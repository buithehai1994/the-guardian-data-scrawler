It’s a pretty damning indictment of what happened.”Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy, said inequality was “the primary story of the pandemic”. “You still find that people from poorer backgrounds are more likely to have been impacted,” Shah said, adding that the rate of long Covid in the most deprived households is double that of the most wealthy.“One of the dreadful things about the pandemic was that, as a side-effect, there was less money to invest in public services across the piece. The worry is that some of the trends we’re seeing, unless there’s active work to stop them, will continue.”The UK spent 19.3% of gross domestic product on extra spending and forgone revenue, and gave loans worth a further 16.7%, according to the International Monetary Fund – more than almost every other developed country except Japan, Germany and Italy.Yet the return on this investment was poor. After the lockdowns ended, every other G7 nation except the US saw more adults rejoining the workforce. However, the UK, which has historically had a better than average number of people in work, saw the reverse.There has been a 0.5% increase in the number of people not working and classed as economically inactive, with about 2.7 million too sick to work.In life expectancy, one of the most fundamental measures of how a country is able to look after its people, the UK is in a worse position than most other developed countries.Women can expect to live to 82 years and 10 months, about three years less than in Spain, Australia or Italy, while men can expect to reach 79, about two years less than in the same countries, reversing more than a decade of lifespan increases.OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) figures show that, in similar countries, homelessness is static or has been falling, but it has more than doubled in England since 2010. About 45 out of every 10,000 people are either sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation.Children are also significantly unhappier. The Education Policy Institute said the OECD figures showed that the UK now has the “second lowest average life satisfaction of 15-year-olds across all OECD countries”.Half of pupils in England (48%) rated their overall life satisfaction as seven or more out of 10, compared with 61% across other countries.And the UK has the sixth highest number of Covid deaths reported to theWorld Health Organization, with 232,000 fatalities, although Britain’s excess mortality rate is nevertheless in line with other nations, according to the scientific publicationOur Worldin Data.Covid response ‘one of UK’s worst ever public health failures’Read moreWhile international comparisons can be confounded by different methods of measurement, the main difference between the UK and other developed countries is that theNHShad been consistently underfunded, health experts said.Anandaciva said he had asked a German counterpart shortly after the first lockdown how Germany was dealing with hospital backlogs. “He paused and said: ‘What are you talking about?’ And it became clear that they had got back on track and the reason was that they were never overwhelmed. They had the capacity, the beds, the staff, not only to cope with the pandemic but also get things back to normal quicker.”Paul Johnson, director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studies, said: “Broadly speaking, we actually spent more and borrowed more than almost any other country. We were in that sense particularly generous – we increased our borrowing and debt by more than most other countries over that period.”He added that the increase in people who are economically inactive because of illness was also a problem that affected the UK and few other countries. An extra 1 million people are claiming disability benefits and 700,000 more are claiming incapacity benefits since before the pandemic.“Denmark has seen a small increase, but no other major country has seen an increase or any shift from its prior, pre-Covid trend,” Johnson said.“We’ve seen this unbelievable increase in numbers, which we don’t really understand, and we don’t know whether it’s associated with Covid, but it’s certainly coincident with the period after it.”View image in fullscreenMental health problems among children and young adults have worsened since the pandemic.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAMental health problems among children and young adults are also worsening, accounting for 45% of all diseases affecting 10- to 24-year-olds.Sunday’s Day of Reflection will see a procession along thenational Covid memorial wallby the Thames in London and services at St Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.Later this week, theCovid inquirywill hear evidence from former ministers Michael Gove, Steve Barclay and Helen Whately on how the government went about procuring PPE, ventilators and oxygen in the first stages of the pandemic.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusThe ObserverInfectious diseasesEconomicsNHSYoung peopleHomelessnessLife expectancynewsShareReuse this content"

So after police said that they know about some new attempts, that was not very surprising, just confirmation of what our Russian source was telling us.”‘Sophisticated’ spy ring passed secrets to Russia for three years, UK court toldRead moreDobrokhotov said he recognised the need to be constantly on the move to avoid the attentions of the Kremlin.He said: “All my family are worried, of course. They worry about me and they understand that they are not safe – if they put novichok [the biological agent used in the murder attempt on the Skripals] on the door handle, they can all suffer.“On the other hand, it’s the worst situation when you don’t know whether you should be very much worried, or you can relax. You always doubt if you are paranoid about all of this stuff. So in some way, it’s good to know that you know this situation.”A counter-terrorism policing spokesperson said: “Counter-terrorism policing works closely with police forces, partners and communities to identify any repressive activity by foreign states in the UK and will seek to disrupt this activity where possible.“This has been shown to be the case with a number of recent arrests and charges that have been made in relation to offences under the National Security Act.“We would encourage members of the public to report any allegations of foreign interference to their local police force.“On receipt of any such reports, officers would also assess whether there are any safeguarding or security concerns or issues and, in liaison with specialist officers, would be able to provide individuals affected with appropriate safety and security advice and support as required.“Briefings on personal safety are not the limit of our activity to keep people safe, but they do create direct connections between individuals, organisations and policing.“The importance of that advice should not be underestimated, and neither should the scale of operational activity taking place within our proactive investigations teams and with partner agencies to keep people safe.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageThe ObserverCrimeRussiaBulgariaInvestigative journalismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Fire engulfed a five-storey apartment building. As emergency services arrived,Russialaunched another strike on the same area. Eleven civilians were killed, with five children among the 30 injured.Writing on social media,Volodymyr Zelenskyycondemned the “vile and inhuman intimidation tactic often used by the Russians”. Three people also died and seven injured in a drone attack in the city of Bohodukhiv, in the Kharkiv region.Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian cities has intensified after a torrid week in which Trump has pulled the plug on intelligence sharing withUkraineand halted the supply of US weapons.These hostile moves mean the alarm system that warns Ukrainian civilians of incoming enemy missiles is less effective. Asked if Putin was taking advantage of US aid pauses, Trump on Friday acknowledged Ukraine was experiencing a “tremendous pounding”.He suggested, however, that “anyone in Putin’s position” would do the same. Before a meeting on Tuesday between US and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia, Trump said he was “finding it easier” to deal with Moscow than with Kyiv.European leaders suggested the US president was complicit in the latest devastation.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said there had been “another tragic night in Ukraine”, with “more bombs, more aggression and more victims”. Without mentioning Trump directly, he said: “This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians.”The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the “relentless” Russian missiles demonstrated that Putin had no interest in peace. “We must step up our military support. Otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price,” she said.Zelenskyy has been seeking to repair relations with Trump after their acrimonious White House meeting last month. Ukraine’s president has sketched out a peace plan – beginning with a truce on land and sea – and said he is ready to sign a favourable minerals deal with the US.So far, however, Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine while making no demands of Russia. Zelenskyy said Saturday’s strike showed Moscow’s objectives had not changed. He called for an increase in sanctions against Russia to “collapse” its war economy.Russia’s latest strike transformed the centre of Dobropillia into a sprawling ruin. The apartment block was a gutted mess. There were burnt-out cars and vans and smouldering debris. Rescuers swept up glass and twisted pieces of metal. Video from the strike showed a terrifying explosion.Irina Kostenko, 59, spent the night cowering in her hallway with her husband. When she left the apartment building on Saturday, she saw a neighbour “lying dead on the ground, covered with a blanket”. “It was shocking, I don’t have the words to describe it,” she told the AFP news agency.Meanwhile, Russia has exploited the US intelligence and weapons freeze to launch a series of bold attacks. North Korean and Russian troops have broken through Ukraine’s defences in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian units have for seven months occupied a parcel of territory.There were unconfirmed reports on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had managed to stabilise the situation and avoid encirclement, at least for now. A hundred Russian soldiers crept through a gas pipeline in a raid on the Kyiv-held Russian town of Sudzha,Ukrainskaya Pravda newspaper reported.Ukraine’s hold on territory in Kursk is increasingly precarious. Soldiers told the Observer two supply roads with the Ukrainian city of Sumy were open, but came under constant attack from Russian drones and artillery.Serhiy Sternenko, a prominent Ukrainian activist, described the logistics situation there as “rapidly deteriorating and already critical”. “Logistics routes to Sudzha are under full enemy fire control,” he posted on X.According to Kremlin bloggers, Russian combat groups advanced several kilometres across the border into Ukraine’s Sumy region. Russia also said it had retaken three villages in neighbouring Kharkiv oblast.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result he will say that civil servants’ performance and pay will be judged on the extent to which they deliver on key priorities such as national security and key government missions.While Whitehall departments have substantially grown in recent years – increasing by more than 15,000 since the end of 2023 – McFadden is expected to say working people have not seen improvements in their job opportunities, the safety of their neighbourhoods or the length of time they have to wait for NHS treatment when they are sick.Indicating the scale of potential reform being considered, sources stressed that “delivering national security” could only be done with a full “renewal of the state”.Most controversially, McFadden will set out a new “pay-by-results system learning from the best civil services globally, making sure the most senior officials responsible for the missions have their wages linked to the outcomes they achieve”, a government spokesperson said.McFadden will also outline plans to speed up the removal from the service of civil servants judged as unable to meet current needs. A system of “mutually agreed exits” will be introduced to bring the civil service “more in line with the private sector”.“Civil servants who do not have the skills or can’t perform at the level required to deliver the government’s plans will be incentivised to leave their jobs, as an alternative to lengthy formal processes,” the spokesperson said, adding that the plans would also allow ministers to “quickly weed out underperformance among the highest paid civil servants – the senior civil service … those who do not meet the standards required will immediately be put on a personal development plan, with a view to dismiss them if they do not improve in six months”.Echoing the language of Trump, McFadden said the government is willing to “disrupt the status quo as part of its pursuit of an active and productive modern state.“The state is not match fit to rise to the moment our country faces,” he added. “It is a too common feeling in working people’s lives that the system doesn’t work for them. With our mandate for change, this government will fundamentally reshape how the state delivers for people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To do this we must ensure we go further to ensure those brilliant people who can deliver are incentivised and rewarded, and those who can’t are able to move on.”Late last year Dave Penman, the head of the senior civil servants’ union (the FDA), wrote toKeir Starmerurging him to rethink his “frankly insulting” criticism of Whitehall for being comfortable with falling standards. Penman suggested Starmer had invoked “Trumpian” language by saying that “too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline”.Responding to the government’s latest announcement on the reshaping and renewal of the state, Penman said: “If the government is serious about transforming public services they must set out what the substance of reform looks like, not just the retreading of failed ideas and narratives. In the absence of big ideas, we have seen previous governments peddle the narrative that public services are being held back by a handful of poor performers in the senior civil service.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe ObserverShareReuse this content"

A small team of negotiators then began repeatedly trying to talk the protester down, and he was eventually brought down safely on the stroke of midnight.Two cherrypickers, an incident response unit ambulance, regular ambulances and two fire engines were at the scene.At one point, shouts of “free Palestine” and “you are a hero” could be heard from a small group of supporters behind a police cordon.The protester posted anupdate on Instagramat about 6pm, filming himself threatening to climb higher if the negotiator on a platform attached to a fire engine came any closer. He said: “I will come down on my terms … Right now, I’m saying I’m safe. If you come towards me, you’re putting me in danger and I will climb higher.”The negotiators were concerned that the protester would need food or water, or to use the toilet, and that he had been bleeding from an injured foot. “I feel fine,” the protester said. “I’m on a large ledge here. I’m safe.”He said he had stopped bleeding: “They’re small cuts.”In response, the negotiator said he could see “quite a lot of blood”. Blood appeared to have stained the ledge the protester was standing on.The protester replied: “I will tell you if I’m in danger … I’m safe right now … You’re the ones putting me in danger … I’ve told you, if you come towards me, I have no choice other than to climb higher, because I’m not ready to climb down.”The Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty said on X there needed to be an explanation about how the man got into the parliamentary estate.View image in fullscreenNegotiators on a cherrypicker attempt to talk the protester down.Photograph: Sky NewsHe said: “Every day in parliament I see dozens of armed police officers patrolling Portcullis House and the parliamentary estate. Where were they today?“On Monday there needs to be a full explanation to MPs and staff as to how this protester was able to evade security so easily.”Parliamentary tours were cancelled as a result of the incident, a spokesperson said.A video thought to be filmed by the protester at 7.20am showed him climbing a fence around the Houses of Parliament.Pro-Palestine protesters had planned to gather outside Broadcasting House, the BBC’s headquarters in centralLondon, on Saturday. Police said the rally risked “serious disruption” to Jewish people attending Shabbat services at a nearby synagogue and imposed conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the rally going ahead.Protest organisers from Palestine Pulse, XR for Palestine and others moved the protest outside Downing Street, with many congregating in Parliament Square.The Metropolitan police also restricted protest activity near Parliament Square to prevent serious disruption, with pro-Palestine protesters ordered to move from Bridge Street to Richmond Terrace.A Met police spokesperson said: “At 7.24am on Saturday 8 March officers were alerted to a man climbing up the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament.“Officers are at the scene working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. They are being assisted by the London fire brigade and the London ambulance service.”Bridge Street, at the north end of Westminster Bridge, was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident, police said. It is understood one exit of Westminster station is also closed, but there is no disruption to tube services and passengers can use other exits.A spokesperson for the London fire brigade said: “Firefighters are responding alongside the Metropolitan police service to reports of a person scaling thePalace of Westminster.”In the afternoon, a large crowd gathered on the corner of Parliament Square in support of the protester. Some held signs reading: “Labour Tories BBC you show Russia’s crimes but hide Israel’s … why?”Reports suggested the protester had been overheard saying “peaceful protesters are being brutally arrested” and “I’ve brought the protest to the so-called hub of democracy in the UK” to onlookers below.The incident came amid a weekend of pro-Palestine protests across the country. Activists targeted one of Donald Trump’s golf courses inScotlandon Saturday. Palestine Action supporters spray-painted the clubhouse at the Trump Turnberry resort and dug up some of the greens overnight.View image in fullscreenThe Trump Turnberry clubhouse covered in red spray paint.Photograph: Milo Chandler/PAIn a video the grouppostedon social media, the words “Gaza is not 4 sale” are sprayed on the grass of the course.The group said its action was a “direct response to the US administration’s stated intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza” after “having laid out plans to ‘clean out the whole thing’ and forcibly displace its population”.A spokesperson said: “Palestine Action rejects Donald Trump’s treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes. To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance. We will continue to take action against US-Israeli colonialism in the Palestinian homeland.”PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsProtestLondonPalace of WestminsterScotlandPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

This is becausethe sun is thought to be at the peak of its 11-year cycleof activity. As a result, events known ascoronal mass ejections– when the sun spews out plasma, a super-hot gas of charged particles – are occurring more often, offering more opportunities to see the auroras.Explore more on these topicsNorthern lightsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

About 30 people were at the pub for dinner, while 20 more were in the bar as the incident unfolded just after 7pm, she said.Police said the suspect was known to Lisa. There had been no prior contact between the police and the victim or the suspect, they added.Explore more on these topicsKentnewsShareReuse this content"

OK, have you fulfilled your commitments under the JCPOA?” he responded.Khamenei said Tehran had kept its commitments for a year but there was “no other way” but to roll back from them in accordance with legislation passed by the country’s parliament.US officials now estimate that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it so chose.Tehran has consistently denied pursuing nuclear weapons, emphasising the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.Officials have always cited a religious decree issued by Khamenei that prohibits the development of such weapons.Last month, Khamenei reiterated his opposition to negotiations with the US, calling this “unwise” just days after Trump called for a new nuclear deal.Khamenei accused Washington of having “ruined, violated, and torn up” the 2015 agreement.In 2019, more than a year after Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA, Japan’s then premier, Shinzo Abe, visited Iran in an attempt to mediate between Tehran and Washington.But Khamenei firmly rejected the possibility of talks with the US, saying he did not “consider Trump as a person worthy of exchanging messages with”.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Why, in the course of reporting a burglary to the police in 1952, did the maths geniusAlan Turingvolunteer that he was in an illegal homosexual relationship? The admission enabled the police to prosecute the Bletchley Park codebreaker for “gross indecency”, ending Turing’s groundbreaking work for GCHQ on early computers and artificial intelligence and compelling him to undergo a chemical castration that rendered him impotent. Two years later, he killed himself.Now, research by aUniversity of Cambridgeacademic has shed light on the reasons why Turing, a former undergraduate and lecturer at King’s College, Cambridge, did not hide his homosexuality from the police. “There was a whole community in King’s quite different from stories one knows about from gay history, usually involving casual pickups and a lot of despair, hiding and misery,” said Simon Goldhill, professor of classics at the college.His research has uncovered a “rather happy” community in the formerly all-male college at “the centre of the British establishment” while homosexuality was still illegal. “It was a very camp environment,” said Goldhill, who willtalk at King’s11 March about his new book,Queer Cambridge. For example, in the 1930s, when Turing was at King’s, “the provost [college principal] and many of the senior fellows [tutors] were openly and outwardly gay. They had sex with men and talked constantly about having sex with men.”View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch played Turing in the 2014 filmThe Imitation Game.Photograph: Black Bear Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarTuring spent his formative years – from 18 to 24 – at King’s, learning it was “perfectly acceptable” for intellectual gay men like him to not hide their sexuality around people in positions of power. As a result, in 1952 Turing told the police the suspected burglar was a friend of his male lover. “Turing thought he had the perfect right to be gay. He wasn’t ashamed of it. It was who he was.”His experiences of gay life at King’s were empowering: “He’d had a relationship at school and people had been worried about that. So when he came to King’s, where it was perfectly acceptable to be homosexual, I think that’s when he developed himself as a gay person.”Turing gained a “political strength and a political clarity” from his time at King’s. “He was somebody who was capable of standing up for himself as a gay man. He thought it was important not to lie, not to conceal, but to say: ‘This is who I am. I think you should be able to deal with this.’ He got that confidence from King’s.”View image in fullscreenThe novelist and Bloomsbury Group member EM Forster.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe poetRupert Brookeand the authorEM Forsterare among the other gay alumni of the college, along with the economistJohn Maynard Keynes, who was a fellow at King’s alongside Turing.Keynes kept ledgers of every man he slept with and what he did with them for years, Goldhill said. “He’s an economist – and economists count things. He’s bookkeeping.”Keynes also wrote about how everyone in Cambridge was “buggering each other”. Virginia Woolf, a friend of Forster, Keynes and the theatre directorDadie Rylands, another gay fellow of King’s, claimed: “The word buggery was never far from our lips.”Goldhill said: “There’s that extraordinary sense that it was very much talked about and open. You’ve got a complete gay community at the centre of the establishment, with Keynes and leading figures in economics, literature, music and art in charge.”View image in fullscreenThe war poet and King’s fellow Rupert Brooke.Photograph: Culture Club/Getty ImagesThe gay community at King’s is likely to have its roots in a statute, signed by King Henry VI in 1443, which required King’s to exclusively admit students from Eton College. “Coming from one house in Eton, the undergraduates had already lived together as boys. They knew each other for ever,” Goldhill said. “There was a very strong community among them – and that carried on.”Such intense childhood bonds meant students who desired other men were tolerated “within the safety of the college walls”.Gay men who came to King’s as “pretty young” students and stayed on to become powerful academics were able to have romantic relationships throughout their lives, ensuring the gay community at the college thrived. Unlike other gay histories, these men not only had “a sense of continuity of time and place, but a sense of moving through different stages of relationships as a gay man,” Goldhill said.After the statute requiring Etonians was overturned in the 1860s, teachers at other schools began encouraging bright boys whom they knew or suspected were gay to apply to King’s, where they would get in and “have a good time”, Goldhill said.View image in fullscreenA portrait of John Maynard Keynes, painted by his lover Duncan Grant, hangs in the dining hall at King’s.Photograph: By permission of the Provost and Scholars of King’s College, CambridgeTo this day, King’s has a reputation for being the centre of LGBTQ+ life in Cambridge, Goldhill said. “There has been and remains a spirit of tolerance and liberal values about the place – though even here, these days, such values are under threat.”King’s LGBTQ+ student officer Ainoa Cernohorsky said that while queer students at Cambridge are always fighting for more space to be themselves, “I have not encountered, seen or felt anything but unwavering support for my queerness – and for my role as the LGBTQ officer – from queer and non-queer undergraduates, graduates, professors and directors of studies at King’s. It’s a very accepting environment, and I think that’s partly due to the way the college presents itself and the stories it chooses to platform.”There is a prominent Antony Gormley statue dedicated to Turing in the college grounds, while a painting of Keynes by his lover Duncan Grant hangs proudly next to paintings of Forster and other gay fellows in the grand college dining hall. “These people are present in my mind,” said Cernohorsky. “They left their mark on the atmosphere in King’s.”Explore more on these topicsAlan TuringThe ObserverLGBTQ+ rightsUniversity of CambridgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His patrol boat roared into action and zipped through the waves. Behind him was the Ukrainian port of Odesa. In front – beyond a grey expanse of water, and 180km (112 miles) away, was occupied Crimea. “We’re here to stop the Russians from taking the Black Sea,” Oleksandr said, as his boat – travelling at a nippy 30 knots – rolled up and down.In 2014 Ukraine lost three-quarters of its modest naval assets when Vladimir Putin seized the Crimean peninsula. Then, in 2022,Russia sank most of what was left. Its own fleet, by contrast, seemed invincible. It included a mighty flagship carrier, the Moskva, two modern frigates, several smaller warships and multiple missile boats and landing vessels, as well as four submarines carrying deadly Kalibr missiles.The Moskva entered into legend when it told theUkrainian garrison on Snake Islandin the Black Sea to surrender, on day one of Putin’s invasion. The radio operator responded:“Russian warship, go fuck yourself”. The Russians stormed the island anyway and took the Ukrainian soldiers guarding it prisoner. Since then, though, Moscow has suffered a series of maritime setbacks.View image in fullscreenCrew members on the patrol boat, whose job is to respond to the frequent air raid sirens.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverFirst, Ukrainesank the Moskvausing a Neptune cruise missile. Then it reclaimed Snake Island. After that, Kyiv’s homemade explosives carrying sea drones sentat least five other Russian boats to the bottom of the sea.In 2023 and 2024 Moscow’s Black Sea fleet relocated. Surviving ships left their base in the Crimean harbour of Sevastopol and sailed east, to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.The fleet’s departure allowed commercial shipping to resume fully from three coastal cities: Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi (formerly Yuzhnyi). The future of the Black Sea is likely to form part of any peace deal with Russia. Last week, after hisunhappy meetingwith Donald Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed a truce. It could begin on land and sea, he said.Spelling out the details on Friday, he called for “no military operations” in the Black Sea, and an end to missile and drone attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure. Ukraine’s president will travel on Monday to Saudi Arabiato meet the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and to hold talks on Tuesday with US negotiators. It is unclear if genuine progress to ending the war can be made.Patrol boats in the Black Sea are Ukraine’s first line of defence against drone swarms sent by Russia from occupied Crimea.Patrol boats in the Black Sea are Ukraine’s first line of defence against drone swarms sent by Russia from occupied Crimea.For now, Russia continues to pummelUkrainefrom Crimea. Whenever the air raid siren sounds, the patrol boat takes to the waves and tries to shoot down incoming drones. “They arrive in a swarm. Normally there are 20. We manage to destroy around half,” the chief officer, Illia, said. He added: “You hit one and immediately fire at the next. There’s no time for celebration.”Last week Russian unmanned aerial vehicles targeted the Odesa region, flying over the sea in darkness. On Thursday an elderly man was killed, and another person wounded. Twenty houses were damaged. Air defence units shot down three dozen drones, but were unable to intercept them all. There were more attacks on Friday, on the Odesa suburb of Podilskyi and an outlying village.The patrol boat is equipped with three machine guns. One is an American mini-gun that fires 6,000 rounds a minute. The others are a Browning and an ancient PKM, produced in the Soviet Union in 1982. “It’s a pretty cool gunboat,” Illia said, as his crew sailed past container ships, several wrecks and an island of gulls and diving shags.Foreign partners have helped to restore Ukraine’s navy. It now has 90 vessels. Estonia donated Illia’s vessel. Sweden and Finland have provided combat boats. The UK passed ontwo former Royal Navy mine-hunters, currently moored in Portsmouth. Under the Montreux convention, they can only enter the Black Sea once the war ends. Kyiv has built a new corvette in Istanbul, with another on the way.View image in fullscreenOleksii Neizhpapa, Ukraine’s naval commander in his office in Odesa. He stands next to part of the Neptune cruise missile used to sink Russia’s flagship, the Moskva.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverOleksii Neizhpapa, the commander of Ukraine’s navy, said his country had “independently freed” the north-west Black Sea. Russia’s fleet fled because it no longer felt safe, he said, and Ukraine also had “fire control” over the neighbouring Sea of Azov. His strategic goal was to guarantee the safety of the busy grain corridor used by international cargo ships to take goods to foreign ports. Exports had almost returned to pre-2022 levels, he said, with 90m tonnes transported. “This is good for the economy. It’s one of the successes of Ukraine’s war against Russia,” he said.“The corridor works all the time. We’ve destroyed 100 floating mines. It’s a big operation, which nobody talks about and nobody really sees. Our task is to guarantee safe passage,” he said.Speaking to theObserver, Neizhpapa described the war with Russia as a technological race dominated by drones. Moscow had developed “pretty effective” methods to counter sea drone raids. So Ukraine had responded by turning the drones into fast-moving attack platforms. Engineers had added anti-aircraft guns to shoot down helicopters – and FPV (first-person view) drones, he said.The vice admiral said he was optimistic Kyiv would be able to destroy the Kerch bridge, built by Russia to connect its territory withCrimea. Two previous strikes damaged the road and rail structure. Russia’s military was no longer able to transport heavy wagons across the railway bridge, Neizhpapa said. “The Russians understand we are actively discussing a third operation. There is a saying: ‘God loves a trinity’,” he said, grinning.View image in fullscreenOne of the three machine guns installed on Captain Oleksandr’s patrol boat.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverNeizhpapa shrugged off tensions with the Trump administration, which hascut supplies of weaponsandintelligence. “We can’t split from the US,” he said. “We are in a new epoch of war between democratic countries and authoritarian ones. We are in the line of fire from totalitarian states.” Western support for Ukraine sent a powerful signal that “we are not alone,” he noted, saying: “It inhibits bad Russian behaviour”The commander was speaking from his office in Odesa, decorated with naval memorabilia. One souvenir is a part of the missile used to sink the Moskva. The shield-like piece of casing shows a Ukrainian soldier giving the middle finger to the burning ship. “I stood on the Moskva’s deck in 2012. Ten years later we sank it,” Neizhpapa said, pointing out it was the first Russian flagship to be lost since 1905.mapThe Kremlin says the Black Sea region is a part of “historical” Russia. In fact, it was previously home to Greeks, Scythians and for four centuries the Ottomans, until the late 18th century, when Catherine the Great seized it. Neizhpapa said the Russians twisted history and understood nothing of the actual past. “When Kyiv had a university Moscow was just a bog. It was home to a lot of croaking frogs,” he said.Back on the gunboat, the sailors acknowledged that after three years of all-out war they were exhausted. But they were not ready to sign a peace deal that involved Ukraine giving four oblasts to Russia – one of many Kremlin demands, alongside replacement of Zelenskyy’s government and non-Nato “neutrality”.View image in fullscreenA crew member inspects one of the weapons.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverThere was also bewilderment at Trump’s support for Moscow. “Russia already gets help from North Korea and Iran. Day by day they conquer our territory. We struggle, but we do our best,” one sailor, Volodymyr, said. “Now with such a political situation, such political decisions, we don’t understand.” If Zelenskyy capitulated Ukraine would erupt in civil war, he predicted.“The Russians try and kill us every day. They drop bombs on women and children,” Oleksandr said. “This is a struggle of good against evil. We are counting on the world to help us. If you don’t understand what’s happening come here and we will take you on an excursion.”Luke Harding’sInvasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, is published by Guardian FaberExplore more on these topicsCrimeaThe ObserverUkraineRussiaEuropeDrones (military)featuresShareReuse this content"

A cheer went up as basketball fans realised thatBarack Obamawas in their midst. The former US president rose to his feet, smiled and waved before watching the Los Angeles Clippers take on the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.It was a jarringly normal scene at a profoundly abnormal time. The previous evening,Donald Trumphad delivered thelongest-ever presidential addressto Congress, a dark, divisive tirade strewn with lies and insults – he called Joe Biden the “worst president in American history” and the senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas”.Yet Biden did not respond and Obama remained silent. Former presidentsBill ClintonandGeorge W Bushwere similarly mute. Six weeks into a Trump second term that has shattered democratic norms and ruptured diplomatic alliances, it remains unclear what – if anything – might prompt theformer presidents to speak out.Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “Let’s look only at Clinton and Obama: it’s almost as though they’ve washed their hands of it.View image in fullscreenFormer presidents and first ladies at the inauguration of Donald Trump at the US Capitol on 20 January 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images“I’ve been calling them Pontius and Pilate,” he said, referring to the Roman governor who allowed Jesus to be crucified. “You can understand why because when you challenge Trump, he goes after you and never lets up. It’s hell every single day, multiple times a day.”Trump’s barnstormingfirst six weeks in officehave left millions of Americans reeling. He has pardoned January 6 insurrectionists, punished journalists, imposed tariffs, sided with Russia over Ukraine, expanded presidential power and unleashed the tech billionaire Elon Musk to slash the federal government. Critics say it is time to break the emergency glass.Struggling to find a coherent strategy, Democrats used delaying tactics to stall Trump’s cabinet nominees and heckled his address to Congress. Grassroots activists have expressed their anger and fear at town halls while demanding more direct action. Notably, former senior government officials have gone public with their concerns.Trump is the most lawless president in American history | Robert ReichRead moreLast month, a group of five former treasury secretarieswrote a joint essayfor the New York Times warning that the nation’s payment system was under attack by political actors from Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.Then, five former defence secretaries signed a joint letter calling on Congress to hold immediate hearings on Trump’srecent firings of the chairof the joint chiefs of staff and several other senior military leaders.The presidents’ club has its own etiquette, however. The five men have gathered twice recently, first at the Washington national cathedral forJimmy Carter’s state funeral, where Obama and Trump were seen conversing and even sharing a joke. Then, they reunited at Trump’s inauguration, where Biden was forced to listen to his presidency being described as “a horrible betrayal”.Since then, all the ex-presidents have resisted the temptation to stage a significant intervention. Sabato believes that one factor is an awareness that Trump – and his vituperative supporters – would be sure to strike back, including at family members such asHillary Clinton, a former first lady and secretary of state who ran against Trump in the 2016 election.“Bill Clinton is close to 80 and he’s been attacked a lot in his lifetime,” Sabato said. “I’m not sure he wants any more of it and then there’s Hillary – he has to realise that Trump would go after her, too. With Obama, the more I think about it, the more I believe that little friendly chat at Jimmy Carter’s funeral either was part of Obama’s plan or, once it happened, he decided to capitalise on it and keep his mouth shut so that he wouldn’t be the target again.”I get it. But I think they have an obligation to do moreLarry SabatoHe added: “It’s unpleasant. Trump unleashes this army of assholes and we’ve all experienced them on Twitter and in other ways. I get it. But I think they have an obligation to do more.”View image in fullscreenAll living presidents attend the funeral for former president Jimmy Carter.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesCertainly the former presidents’ feeds on the X social media platform do not convey a sense of a nation in crisis. Bill Clinton has posted tributes to political figures who died in recent weeks, although Hillary Clinton has been more combative – for example, by responding to the suspension of offensive cyber operations against Russiawith sarcasm: “Wouldn’t want to hurt Putin’s feelings.”Bush does not have an X account, although his Texas-based presidential centre this weekposted an articleheadlined, “America First should not put Russia second”, condemning Trump and JD Vance for attacking Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Obama’s X account, which has more than 130 million followers, didpost a New York Times articleby Samantha Power, former administrator of USAid, decrying Trump’s cuts to the international development agency. But it then offered congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on their Super Bowl win and a Valentine’s Day message to his wife, Michelle, who did not accompany him to Carter’s funeral, the inauguration or Wednesday’s basketball game in California.Biden has kept a low profile since flying out of Washington on 20 January apart from signing with a Los Angeles talent agency. His X feed includes congratulations to the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, reactions to the release of Hamas hostages, a Valentine’s message to wife Jill, reflections on Black History Month, a picture of hisbeloved Amtrak train serviceand a tribute to the late representative Sylvester Turner.It is not hard to imagine how Biden must have seethed as Trump bullied and berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last week and threatened to tear up the 80-year transatlantic alliance that Biden had striven to renew. Yet he offered no public reaction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is just not done and yet it’s done now.You get one moment when that has the greatest impact so you want to pick that moment carefullyDavid Litt“Certainly Trump was not shy about criticising the current administration when he was an ex-president. I suspect that in 2029, if he is still physically able to tweet what he thinks about whoever’s in office, he will do so.”View image in fullscreenThe funeral of George HW Bush.Photograph: PoolThedeath of George HW Bushin 2018 left his son, George W Bush, as the only living Republican president apart from Trump himself, raising the question of when Bush could join Clinton, Obama and Biden in a powerfully symbolic show of bipartisanship.Litt added: “You get one moment when that has the greatest impact so you want to pick that moment carefully. Trump going further in selling out our allies and also forging a new alliance with Putin and Russia to me sounds like the kind of thing that might cross a line where a bipartisan group of former presidents would say this isn’t right.”There is traditionally reluctance among presidents to criticise a successor, especially during the opening honeymoon period. However, history is littered with exceptions to the rule.Theodore Roosevelt lambasted William Taft in aseries of speeches, even though Roosevelt had promoted Taft as his successor in 1909. Cartereviscerated Ronald Reagan, who beat him in 1980, for sending arms to Iran in hopes that Americans held captive in Lebanon would be released.Clinton had a dig at his successor, George W Bush, for failing to achieve democratic progress in Iraq, saying in a 2007 interview: “The point is, that there is no military victory here.” Bush, in turn, reportedly told a closed-door meeting in 2015 that Obama’s decision to lift sanctions on Iran was a mistake.The answer for Democrats is not backwards. It’s not in the past. It’s got to be somewhere forward-lookingKurt BardellaObamadenounced his successor Trump’shandling of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 as an “absolute chaotic disaster” during a conversation with ex-members of his administration. He also warned that the “rule of law is at risk” under the 45th president.But none of it compared with Trump’s constant and vicious attacks on Biden during the Democrat’s four years in the White House. Trump mocked his successor as “Crooked Joe” and “Sleepy Joe” and claimed that he had caused “more damage than the last 10 worst presidents combined”.Whether a return of fire from Biden, who left office with an approval rating in the 30s and could be accused of being a sore loser, would benefit his party at this moment is questionable.Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist, said: “The answer for Democrats is not backwards. It’s not in the past. It’s got to be somewhere forward-looking and that’s what they’ve got to figure out here.”Bardella said of the former presidents: “If I were them, I would get behind someone right now and say this is the guy or girl that I believe in. Stop playing the: ‘I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes or prematurely step out of line.’ We don’t have time for that crap. Get in the game or don’t ever talk again. If you don’t have anything to say now, while this is going before our very eyes, I don’t want to hear from you ever again.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsJoe BidenBarack ObamaBill ClintonHillary ClintonGeorge BushfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Correctional officers escorted her to the common area of the CentralCaliforniaWomen’s Facility and chained her hands and feet to a metal table, on top of which sat avirtual realityheadset. Two and a half years into a five-year prison sentence, Royal was about to see Thailand for the first time.When she first put on the headset, Royal immediately had an aerial view of a cove. Soon after, her view switched to a boat moving fairly fast with buildings on either side of the water. In the boat was a man with a backpack, and it was as if she were sitting beside him. With accompanying meditative music and narration, the four-minute scene took Royal across a crowded Thai market, through ancient ruins, on a tuk-tuk (a three-wheeled rickshaw) and into an elephant bath with her backpacked companion. For Royal, these vignettes felt real enough to be deserving of a passport stamp.View image in fullscreenCreative Acts volunteers giving a virtual reality headset to a person.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsBefore Thailand, Royal had been held in the facility’s “restricted housing unit”, orsolitary confinement. There, the only opportunity incarcerated people typically have to speak with each other is through cell vents or across the yard during recreation. Typically for this program, participants in solitary sit inside individual cells the size of phone booths known as “therapeutic modules”. In Royal’s facility, she and fellow participants were separated by plastic dividers, and each participant was shackled to a metal seat attached to a table.The VR stirs up the triggers and the trauma and the emotions – and then the art transformsSabra Williams, Creative Acts founderIn the seven-day intensive VR program, participants experience scenes from daily life, as well as some more adventurous ones such as traveling to Paris or paragliding, for four hours each day. Facilitators ask them to process emotions that come from these scenes through various art exercises involving theater tactics, poetry, painting, etc.“The VR stirs up the triggers and the trauma and the emotions – and then the art transforms,” Sabra Williams, the founder of Creative Acts, the organization behind the program, shares. The non-profit conducts the program both in general population and in solitary.Now released, Carlos Ortega went through the virtual reality program in March of last year while in solitary confinement at Corcoran state prison. At 6ft tall, he remembers needing to sit down on the provided stool within the solitary cage to immerse himself in the VR scenes, even though the headset’s 360-degree view was programmed to work within the cage’s confines.“If you’re not mindful of your body in prison, that can lead to conflict. We’re always aware of the amount of space we have, so I didn’t fidget a lot,” he shares. Ortega rarely bumped into the walls, carefully moving his torso and neck in order to take in his surroundings. “It was difficult, but we worked with what we got.”Freedom within – and from – a controlled environment“The micro environment is really, really controlled,” Ortega goes on to explain. Even when he would try to initiate interaction with prison guards, he would get shut down. “I would always say, ‘Hey, good morning. How was your drive here? How are you doing?’ I’d mostly get a glare or a look like ‘Why do you care?’ It’s kind of humiliating.”View image in fullscreenAn incarcerated person uses a VR headset.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of  Creative ActsCreative Actsseeks to work against this hardened environment. The California-based organization relies on the arts as a resource for behavioral change and practical preparation for coming home from prison. With VR in four institutions – Valley state prison (VSP), Kern Valley state prison, Corcoran state prison and the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF) – the organization has more requests coming in from other California facilities. Plans to expand beyond the state, however, can not be fulfilled due to lack of funding, according to Williams.Williams first had the idea to bring VR into prisons five years ago. After founding Creative Acts in 2018, she said she “got real tired of hearing people come home after life sentences, having done multiple decades inside, and literally landing on a different planet”. She felt there was an urgent need for her organization to visually puncture the concrete barriers separating incarcerated people from the outside world. “As the world was changing out here, we missed it,” said Star Van Pool, Creative Acts’ program facilitator, who was incarcerated for 17 years.So when Williams heard about a rudimentary VR program led by correctional officers in another state, she began to workshop how her organization could safely and humanely adapt this work. “I was looking for something that would bring the outside world inside. I heard that VR works on your brain as if you’ve had the experience,” Williams said. “It seemed like an ideal tool.”Breathing through the overwhelming emotions of the everydayIt took a year for Creative Acts to persuade Meta to donate 20 headsets and two of itsCleanboxheadset sanitation machines for a VR pilot. Meanwhile, Creative Acts’Alumni Labworked with content makers includingUnincarcerated Productionsto produce scenes reflecting the collective fears and curiosities that arise when preparing to come home from prison, such as exiting the facility on release day, conducting a job interview or going on a date.For Major Bunton, Creative Acts’ director of programming, the big fear was paying for groceries. “If I’m sitting in line, swiping my credit card, and I can’t get it done, the first thing that comes to my mind is ‘Oh my God, someone’s going to know I’ve been incarcerated,’” he said.To film a Thanksgiving dinner scene, Williams made an entire meal – “I cooked a terrible turkey,” she quipped – and brought in actors to demonstrate various conflicts that could come up when interacting with a loved one who has just come home from prison. When a person puts on the VR headset to experience this scene, it is as if they are at the table. “When I came home, I had to realize that my family had changed. I had to learn how to adapt to their lives,” Bunton shares. “And conversely, they saw me as the person I was when I went in 20 years ago.” Williams’ goal is for participants to get a handle on the rollercoaster of emotions that comes after long-term separation through these family-conflict scenes.View image in fullscreenVolunteers assist people with their VR headsets.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsWilliams says that the programming is not about therapizing or diagnosing anyone; it’s about providing them with the tools to feel and be aware of their own emotions in an otherwise repressive environment. Daniel Garcia, a participant incarcerated at Valley state prison in rural central California, got upset experiencing a scene in which a person bumped into him on a crowded street inLos Angeles. Following a breathing exercise while still in VR, Garcia said he was able to calmly consider how he might better resolve this type of conflict. “A lot of us, when we do come to prison, we’re not aware of the triggers from traumatic experiences that we’ve had, so we just react. VR helped us recognize those triggers.” Introducing this level of emotional awareness supports participants in coping and responding differently because, as Van Pool shares, “if a person doesn’t even understand why they’re angry or where it came from, they can’t change their behavior”.The transformative scene for Ortega was sitting around the Eiffel Tower. “You see tourists, regular people going to and from work,” he said. “And that’s when it hit me: I want to live life like that. I deserve it. I owe it to myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs a responsive exercise, Creative Acts gives participants physical masks to paint. On the outside o the mask they’re asked to portray how they believe society perceives them; on its inside, how they see themselves. On his mask, Garcia wrote “condemned” with cracks on the outside, to reflect his sentence of life without parole. “But I want to be bigger than that,” he said, “so on the inside I painted a sunset, full of life, so bright.”Working through ‘a lot of pain’ in virtual realityReflecting on her experience in VR six months ago, Royal shares that she initially “saw a lot of pain” when the group started. “But by the end, I saw smiles on the faces of all these women and the ability to trust somebody again,” she said. Released from solitary confinement within two months after donning the headset, Royal still conducts unified breathwork she learned from the program with people in the prison if she senses conflict.View image in fullscreenSome incarcerated people have reported transformative experiences when using the VR devices.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of  Creative ActsGarcia similarly retains his meditation practice, oftentimes putting in earbuds to quiet his surroundings, slowly counting while envisioning a sunset. Matias Magana, another program participant at Valley State, shares that now he says hello to individuals he never would have spoken to had it not been for his Creative Acts group. For him, “we’re breaking cultural boundaries”. And Ortega, who spoke sporadically on a Tuesday when he had gone to Creative Acts’ office to pick up some of his old art, says that he now finds himself “being comfortable in the uncomfortable”. His birthday was the second to last day of his Creative Acts’ experience; he still has the sticky notes the facilitators put on his “therapeutic module” with birthday wishes from everyone.Closing a solitary unit after virtual reality workshopsIn response to Creative Acts programming, facilities are witnessing an immense change. “Prison is toxic. You become accustomed to it: the corruption, the duplicitousness. Hell is normalized,” Ortega said. But prisons that have piloted the VR program report a 96% reduction in infractions from incarcerated participants in solitary confinement, according to Creative Acts. Corcoran state prison in rural centralCaliforniasaw the number of infractions of the men in solitary go from 735 to one after one week-long session. One of Corcoran wardens commuted so many solitary confinement sentences that the facility closed one of its four buildings dedicated to the practice.The organization attributes this level of transformation to the role that art plays in encouraging people to redirect their anger, share and process their trauma, and envision, quite literally with the help of VR, a world beyond the bars that confine them.Pros and cons of tech in prisonsIntroducing new technology into prisons has inspired skepticism as well as praise. Making available tablets with texting, email and books en masse in prisons has also made way for anotherpredatory profit channelfor companies, increased the ability to further surveil incarcerated people, and createdfalse promises of more connectionoreducation. Many argue that tech is just a bandage solution that only serves to maintain an inhumane carceral system. Others say that working with the same prisons that continue to incarcerate people in droves cannot possibly benefit those inside. Williams has grappled with these critiques.I learned that, even if someone has nothing in common with me, I can find a way to connect with themSamantha ‘Royal’ Tovar“Anything can be used to cause harm, [and] people will always make money off of anything that goes into prisons, so the benefits for the people inside, to me, outweigh the issues,” Williams says when discussing the introduction of tablets and other technology inside prisons. For the Creative Acts’ founder, the key to administering VR is by utilizing team members who have endured incarceration themselves to thoughtfully facilitate the experience as well as providing trauma-informed art exercises paired with every scene. As for criticisms about working with the California department of corrections and rehabilitation rather than against it, Williams has a consistent motto: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to make change? You can’t make deep cultural change without including the people that work there.”View image in fullscreenCritiques of the VR program have included that it helps maintain an inhumane carceral system.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsStill, the non-profit must go the financial and physical lengths of bringing VR inside prisons while many of the scenes that participants interact with in their headsets are just on the other side of their cell walls. However, participants said the small doses of virtual freedom and exposure to the outside world shifted their behaviors and perceptions more than solitary confinement ever did.“I learned that, even if someone has nothing in common with me, I can find a way to connect with them,” Royal shares. She will parole from prison in May and feels more confident in her ability to build a community for herself. For Ortega, Creative Acts laid an emotional foundation that informs the work he’s doing upon release. “I feel content, I’m more tolerant, people call me reliable again. I go to AA and NA meetings, I’m in school. I actually started my own program. It’s called Dream Catchers. I’m trying to catch that dream that I didn’t catch before.”Explore more on these topicsVirtual realityUS prisonsCaliforniaSolitary confinementWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Also, over the past 15 years, we’ve become slower at building them.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe average build time for standalone houses has slid from nine months to 12.7 months (a 40% increase), while apartment construction timelines have blown out from 18.5 months to 33.3 months, Master Builders Association data shows.Mahil says he is about to move into the answer to that problem.Melbourne 3D house construction interactive3D printing shaves huge chunks of months off a build. Mahil’s house, which will have four bedrooms and five toilets, will be completed within five weeks.“The printing itself is about three weeks, and then to put the roof and the lighting and all the other services, that will take us about five weeks,” he says. “Then I can move and live inside it.”While there has been no Australian research into the cost differences between traditional brick and mortar builds and 3D ones, Mahil says he got comparative quotes for his house.LiveHow did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – video“I have three quotations, and the best of them, [3D printing] comes cheaper at 25% to 30% [than traditional builds],” he says. Mahil did not tell Guardian Australia how much it is costing to print his home.Australia’s first 3D-printed home – a one-bedroom inNew South Walesthat was completed in May 2023, took just two days to construct.

She calls 3D-printed houses “a gamechanger”.“It’s faster to construct, cheaper to build, and more environmentally-friendly than traditional construction methods because it cuts down on material waste,” she says.There are also lower environmental impacts. Two weeks ago, a study published in the Journal of Building Engineering, looking at the environmental impact of a build in Canada, found the technology has the potential “to support sustainable and efficient construction, particularly in remote locations”. “However, material consumption and transportation remain significant contributors to environmental impact,” it said.Property developer Kavitha Vipulananda is now completing her PhD in housing at the University of Melbourne. She says there are environmental benefits with 3D-printing homes – but other issues are also in play.3D printing homes in urban environments and the middle ring suburbs that sit just outside the CBD and inner-city neighbourhoods is “a bit tricky”, Vipulananda says, pointing to the size and manoeuvrability of the 3D printer. “You can only really do houses at the moment.”Banks are also reluctant, for now, to fund developers to 3D print homes because it is a new technology, she says. Prospective customers are also limited in the design options to choose from. “It just needs to be more flexible on sites and more flexible for consumers.”Michael Fotheringham, the AustralianHousingand Urban Research Institute managing director, says 3D printing could help the federal government meet its target of 1.2m homes in five years, but there are a lot of unknowns.“We’re really early days with this stuff in terms of actually delivering housing,” Fotheringham says. “I think we’re really more at a demonstrating potential than delivering in any mainstream sense.”Fotheringham says more research is needed on the insulation and energy efficacy of the builds.“We need to make sure that we’re building housing that is suitable for our climate … and energy efficient going forward,” he says.While alternate building strategies are worth exploring, Fotheringham says governments should concentrate on more high-density housing close to the CBD.“3D printing probably plays a role in that infield development quite effectively,” he says, “because of its pace of delivery, it’s less disruption to communities.”Explore more on these topicsHousingInequalityMelbourneVictoriaNew South Wales3D printingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last month London fashion week had such a small number of catwalk shows it shrank to a weekend. Even super-conglomerate LVMH – which includes Dior, Fendi, Louis Vuitton and most of the drinks brands in your cocktail cabinet –lost a fifth of its profits last year.Yet the Italian brand Miu Miu almostdoubled its profitsthis year, hitting close to £1bn in sales and being named “hottest brand in the world” by influential search site Lyst for the second year running. Retail sales were up 93%.Miu Miu is owned by the Prada Group, a small conglomerate overseen by Miuccia Prada – including the well-known Prada label. In 1992, around 14 years after she started working for her family’s business, Mrs Prada – as she’s known in the industry – launched a cheaper womenswear subsidiary inspired by the sort of clothes (cardigans, skirts, wearable shoes) she wanted for her own wardrobe. Miu Miu is Miuccia’s nickname.The label has always been a bit cooler, and crucially a little bit cheaper than many luxury fashion brands. But its recent success is down to more than just clothes. It’s the shows, the models, the campaigns and – the white whale of modern designers – Mrs Prada’s knack for turning out a viral trend.Over its past five golden years, Miu Miu’s huge fashion hits have included amicro mini skirtwith a raw hem that became so famous it spawned its ownInstagram account; satin ballet pumps, which started an (ongoing) race for ballet shoes on the high street;£750 silk briefsdesigned to be worn without trousers; narrow framed spectacles, and even plasters on toes. And that’s before we get to the It bags (the most liked luxury item on Vinted right now is a Miu Miu metallic handbag). For a designer who says she is vehemently opposed to trends, Mrs Prada has a gift for starting them.View image in fullscreenBritish actress Raffey Cassidy attends the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar party in a Miu Miu dress.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images“What I like about Miu Miu is that it’s irreverent,” says Elektra Kotsoni, deputy director forVogueBusiness and Runway. But it’s also strangely familiar. Kotsoni thinks this sets Miu Miu apart from other brands: “The mishmash of references in every collection basically seems to reflect what women already have in their wardrobes,” she says. “Everyone [can] dress in the style of Miu Miu even if they can’t afford to buy it.”Fashion is as much about how you wear clothes as the clothes themselves, says Dal Chodha, editor and pathway leader of St Martin’s fashion communication course. “I have started to see a lot of young men wearing Miu Miu-style shrunken women’s cardigans around college. And I understand why – [the look] has a certain freshness; it feels knowingly cool.”Mrs Prada also has an uncanny eye for spotting creative talent – in the first flush of fame, making a comeback or just perennially cool. A year before Drew Barrymore’s iconic turn inScreamin 1997, she fronted a Miu Miu campaign. Lupito Nyong’o was Miu Miu’s girl the year she won the Oscar for best supporting actress.Emma Corrin, fresh fromThe Crownand sporting an elfin cut, has also fronted a campaign. Tennis star Coco Gauff and actor Sydney Sweeney both picked Miu Miu gowns for this year’sVanity FairOscar party.Willem Dafoe, 69, closed the last Miu Miu show, and so has Kristin Scott Thomas, 64. The autumn/winter 2024 show included Qin Huilan, a 70-year-old Chinese doctor from Shanghai,picked from Instagram. Miu Miu has a talent for appealing to women who want to see themselves reflected on the catwalk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a very Jack White kind of location: highly stylised, lovingly restored, but not entirely removed from its unglamorous surroundings.Lit in deep blue and strobing white, the colour palette of his solo career, White and his band have played tracks from his most recent album, the surprise-releasedNo Name, firsthanded out freeon white-label vinyl to unsuspecting shoppers at Third Man stores in Nashville, Detroit and London last summer (Third Man Records is White’s own imprint).It’s Rough on Rats (If You’re Asking)is a particularly rousing workout full of guitar shock and awe, from an album that has drawn relieved and delighted comparisons to White’s first band,the White Stripes.He’s also stormed throughBlack Math, from the White Stripes’ fourth album, 2003’sElephant, a disc recorded entirely on analogue gear at Toe Rag Studios in Homerton, Hackney, just a few miles down the road. Roaming across his discography, White and his band have just absolutely pulverisedBroken Boy Soldier– a 2006 cut fromthe Raconteurs, another White side outfit. It’s virtually unrecognisable in this early 70s acid-blues-rock version. Mini whirlpools of flailing bodies ebb and flow through it all.View image in fullscreen‘Johnny Guitar, from Hackney.’Photograph: David James SwansonWhite began this gig with an affirmation – that “everything that comes out of my mouth tonight will be the truth!” A little while later, though, he introduces himself as “Johnny Guitar, from Hackney”. You can’t help but grin. It’s 2025, the postwar world order is in grave flux, but we are on surprisingly steady ground here tonight. Kaleidoscopic garage-punk blues fills the air, and a mischievous artist who always delivers is playing fast and loose in more ways than one.Since White first started damaging speaker cones as half of the White Stripes in the early 00s, this Detroit-born Nashville transplant has enjoyed a relationship with fact perhaps best described as capricious. White Stripes drummer Meg White being his “sister” was a key foundational sleight of hand.But White doesn’t actually want audiences to believe every tall tale he tells. A keen student of legends past, he has long been drawn to obfuscation and myth-making – creative strategies that go back to Bob Dylan and beyond, to blues people and showfolk of all kinds.Rather, White wants us to believeinhim – in the intensity with which he curates his 360-degree aesthetic, and in the righteousness of the sound-world he has manifested from source materials brimming with raw, pre-modern resonance.Most of all, he wants us to be won over by the fervour with which all this is delivered. He stalks around in bone-white shoes, shaking his replenished mop of curly black hair (it was short and blue for a while). He faces off against the keys player, wears grooves in the stage. The band make everything heavy and roiling, then they pull out a blithe, garage-pop song such as the White Stripes’You’re Pretty Good Looking (For a Girl).The viral terrace-chant riff to Seven Nation Army causes the usually immune security guards to whip their heads aroundThere’s never been a bad set of musicians backing this showboating guitarist, but tonight’s trio – go-to drummer Patrick Keeler (the Raconteurs), bassist Dominic Davis (from the Buzzards, a previous White backing band) and Bobby Emmett, a relative new boy vamping on keys, who wears his shades all night – are a particularly taut lineup. White joins Emmett at his organ station for a keyboard-heavy, rococo romp through the White Stripes’Apple Blossom. Elsewhere, there are long, jam-like codas, near-constant segues; at one point, Iggy and the Stooges’ I Wanna Be Your Dog emerges out of the squall.The encore is nearly as long as the first set. At the end, the viral terrace-chant riff to Seven Nation Army causes the security guards – normally immune to whatever music is going on behind them – to whip their heads around. Somewhere in the middle isArchbishop Harold Holmes, an instant classic White tune from the new album, where truth, falsehood, patter and faith are remixed to a Led Zeppelin-like swinging chug.In the lyrics, White plays the itinerant preacher, coming to your town. It is, in part, a riff of hucksters ancient and modern, promising a cure for all ills. “And if you are suffering a strange sickness,” White hisses, “Or someone is blocking up all of your success, you need to see me right away so I can fix this.”The many parallels between religious and musical spectacle are well studied but tonight, White makes a very convincing salesman of rock’n’roll’s fundamentals. Under all the bluster, his belief in the power of pacy, sly electric blues to cure a lot of ills remains very persuasive. He really is the kind of showman who can make you feel better for a while.Watch the video for That’s How I’m Feeling by Jack White.Explore more on these topicsJack WhiteKitty Empire's artist of the weekThe White StripesThe RaconteursPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Women, I think, from childhood are taught how to keep a home. It’s less ingrained in the culture of raising young men, so a lot of them are misguided when it comes to domesticity.”New York-based Coster, 28, is a comedian with a background in film production. During the Sag-Aftra film and television actors’ strike in Hollywood, jobs were few and far between. “I sent a few one-sentence ideas to a new social media production company for short-form digital shows,” she says. “Boy Room was one of my pitches: Boy, will you show me your room?”A proof-of-concept was shot at a friend’shouse. “He told me a girl had been over the previous night, refusing to stay because of the mess, then asked what he should do to change his room.” On camera, Coster surveyed the scene. “Throw out the garbage, put your clothes in a dresser, and put sheets on your bed. He nodded along, gratefully.”At first, she didn’t tell participants that her focus was untidy rooms. “But turns out these boys don’t feel shame about their messiness,” she says. “It made no difference if we told them. Some boys, it transpires, are proud of their mess. Others do start to reflect on their choices in an outsider’s presence: you’re right, whydoI have a 30-month-old boiled egg on my bedside table?”There are plenty of messy-home TV formats, but Coster’s tone is different: non‑judgmental. She has shot at least 40 episodes now, and themes are emerging. “A lot of boys have no idea what’s in their room: a housemate left that; an ex-girlfriend this. Lots of garbage. They often lack ownership of their space. And there’s a lack of concern for their cleanliness and comfort. Like,whydo you want to sleep on a yellowing pillow, a stained, broken mattress and a disgusting quilt? It’s so easily fixable.”The intimacy of the format is what makes it endearing. “In the same way we like to watch Architectural Digest on YouTube to see how the rich and famous live, it’s also nice to see how normals do.” It’s this, she believes, alongside some of the muckier moments captured (“Think extremely yeasty smells or baked-in cigarette stench – one boy had maybe 7,000 vapes in a drawer and behind his bed”) that keep viewers coming back. “Nothing gets more comments,” she says, “than a handsome boy living in total squalor.”‘How did you two meet?’Jeremy Bernstein, Aaron Feinberg and Victor Lee (below, from left),@meetcutesnycTikTok followers:1.8 millionInstagram followers:2.9 millionView image in fullscreen‘Early on, we were only looking for the best meet-cute stories.’Photograph: Chris Buck/The GuardianTwo years ago, friends Aaron Feinberg, Jeremy Bernstein and Victor Lee weren’t even onTikTok. Now, it’s an occupation for the three 30-year-old New Yorkers. Feinberg handles partnerships and collaborations; Lee oversees editing and posting; Bernstein is the voice, politely accosting random couples on the street, and probing into their relationships.It was Lee’s baby, initially. He was working in his family clothes manufacturing business. “The first question you ask a couple,” he says, “is where did you guys meet? Maybe it could be something … ” He floated the idea of asking strangers on camera past Feinberg.“I thought it was fun,” says Feinberg. “We didn’t realise what it could become, but I knew we had the perfect person to ask the questions in Jeremy, who wouldn’t be afraid to stop people – and he won the most distinguished voice award at high school.”Bernstein wasn’t interested at first. “I was selling renewable energy on the street, so, yes, I was always approaching strangers. But when Aaron suggested we do this, I took quite a lot of convincing.” However, interviewees were receptive to the concept from the get‑go, says Bernstein, “although we had to learn about the physicality. How to approach someone in a non-threatening way is key,” he says. “Firstly, it’s body language – making yourself small and smiley. Then, get to the ‘Are you two a couple? How did you meet?’ questions immediately. Once people hear that, they relax.”They have heard some remarkable stories: high‑school sweethearts, chance encounters, arranged marriages. “My favourite,” says Lee, “is the onewe titled Tunnel Vision.” In it an older gentleman who was a train supervisor at Grand Central station explains how he met his wife, 30 years ago. For days, he kept moving trains on to the platform he worked nearest to, to try to find a beautiful woman he had noticed getting out of a carriage. She grins, standing next to him, as he tells the story, and says: “I had no idea!”It’s no wonder people love it. The group have started working on a book, and begun franchising. “We’ve just opened aMeetCutes London account,” says Feinberg – a British friend goes out to record, “and we’re interviewing to hire people in Paris and Madrid. We’re off camera, so we can recreate it globally.”To date, the lads have interviewed maybe 7,000 couples, but only post a small fraction. “Early on, we were only looking for the best meet-cute stories,” says Bernstein. “Now we’re also asking about the relationship: what’s your favourite thing about your partner? What advice do you have for a new couple?”They have each used these lessons in their own love lives. “My favourite piece of advice, which I’ve taken into my relationship, is ‘Never stop dating’,” says Lee. “I’ve been with my fiancee for six years. It’s so easy to fall into a routine and be lazy.”“As someone looking for a relationship while asking all these couples questions,” says Bernstein, “my main takeaway is that there’s no one way to do it. People have such different types of romantic relationships.”‘What’s your dream?’Simon Squibb,@simonsquibbTikTok followers:6.1 millionInstagram followers:3 millionView image in fullscreen‘I wanted to make my son proud – not just sit around and play golf.’Photograph: Simon SquibbFor Simon Squibb, 49, perfecting the question was key. “A dream is both something we’re never really asked, but also feels safe to admit,” he says. “Much bigger than an objective that’s fleeting, or a resolution that comes and goes. Ask someone their dream, and you get to the heart of what they want from life.”This is exactly what he does when approaching strangers on the street. “I’m an entrepreneur, and investor in startups,” he says. “I offer free business knowledge, support people’s dreams, and promote them on my channel.” In essence, he’s an iPhone-wielding, street-scouring, one-man Dragons’ Den.Squibb, who lives in Sussex, started his first business aged 15. “I had no choice, having been made homeless when I fell out with my mum.” His dad had recently died. “I couldn’t get a job, so I started my own gardening company. I asked someone who knew I was struggling for help. They were selling courses, and offered to support me – for a fee. I couldn’t afford to pay. I vowed one day, if I could afford to help people for free, I would.”In2015, Squibb sold his business – a Hong Kong-based creative and digital agency – to PricewaterhouseCoopers. “I made life-changing money. I wouldn’t need to work again. I took two years off. My wife and I had a baby. But I wanted to make my son proud, I realised – not just sit around and play golf.”He thought back to his hustling teenage self. “I knew so little about business. School hadn’t equipped me for it at all. I wanted to help educate others, and TikTok is where young people were.”No doubt his advice is gratefully received. He has also invested in 79 businesses to date. Most significant, though, is the exposure a chance encounter with Squibb and his camera brings: millions of followers; 315m monthly views. “Lots of people still think you shouldn’t film kind gestures,” says Squibb, “that I should offer my advice privately, else it’s tainted. That’s stupid; part of the help I can offer is eyeballs. Why not use social media for social good?“Not long ago, someone’s reply to me was, ‘I want to travel and take pictures’.” Squibb had a think. “How do we get there? Not, I said, saving money and planning. Let’s get you a sponsor. That video clocked 112m views.lastminute.comoffered to sponsor her – now she’s travelling the world, filling their social media feeds.” There was a woman in Lewes, getting off the bus. “She said her dream was to be a fashion blogger and designer. Twenty-four hours later, she had 300,000+ followers. Done. The rest is up to her.“My whole life is built around this concept: whatever I want to achieve, put a business model behind it. Teach people the basics, and any dream is possible.”Simon Squibb’s bookWhat’s Your Dream?, published by Century, is out now‘What do you do for your workout?’Mark Langowski,@bodybymarkTikTok followers:527,200Instagram followers:1.5 millionView image in fullscreen‘Of course fitness trainers have the perfect workout. But what about real people?’Photograph: Chris Buck/The GuardianThe approach, for Mark Langowski, 44, who lives in New York, still feels a little icky. His street-interview format relies on the camera rolling before the first question is asked – initially filming someone without their consent. “I try to get them walking towards me,” he says, “so I’m looking two blocks ahead. Then I have a split second to scan them and decide if they look fit. I don’t love that.” After making a judgment on their physique, he’ll ask: “What do you do for your workout?” The shtick is simple, but the results are compelling: revealing the dedication of the majorly muscled, uber‑athletic and, often, shirtless.The scale of the challenge varies seasonally. “In summer and springtime New York, it’s obviously easier to spot someone fit: tank tops, vests and workout gear; lots of skin on show,” he says. “Winter and fall are harder. It’s why I travel to Miami or Los Angeles at that time of year.”He has been in the fitness business for 20 years, and started TikTok‑ing 18 months ago. “I’m a personal trainer by trade. I already had theInstagramaccount of a traditional fitness influencer: me and my clients working out; showing my abs off,” he says. “I got bored with it. Sick of the narcissism. I knew I needed a presence for my business, to keep myself relevant. But how to without making it all about me?”Then, inspiration. “I was in an exercise class, and saw this woman in the most spectacular shape. I wondered what she was doing? It couldn’t just be this class.” He went out the next day to film on the streets of New York. “I’m an introvert; I’d never approach a stranger. I was so self-conscious and nervous, holding the camera down by my waist.” After a few weeks, people started to know about the videos. “It made things easier – if someone was into fitness, the algorithm was probably already showing them my stuff. And people were keen to talk. Now, my videos have been seen more than 1bn times.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s tedious –of coursethey have the perfect breakfast, perfect workout, perfect everything. It’s their day job. But what about real people? I’m asking the construction worker, the stay-at-home mum of three, the doctor or shop assistant.”Langowski has learned plenty himself. “You start to see patterns: lift heavy weights, don’t run too much, eat healthy, sleep a lot and don’t drink much alcohol. I’m surprised at how little cardio very fit-looking people do.”‘How much do you pay for rent?’Caleb Simpson,@calebwsimpsonTikTok followers:8.5 millionInstagram followers:2.5 millionView image in fullscreen‘At first, 100 New Yorkers told me to eff off. Then one guy in Brooklyn showed me his apartment. It went viral.’Photograph: Chris Buck/The Guardian“Everyone is low-key a snoop, when it comes to homes,” says Caleb Simpson, 33. “We all want to poke around places.”Simpson grew up in Morganton, North Carolina, “in a small house with eight siblings, very humble beginnings – a food-stamps-and-white-rice sort of life”. He moved to New York in 2015, and soon started to make a living doing social media for startups. “I was also always trying to do my own thing,” he says, “making videos on YouTube and Instagram.”Simpson had spent years wandering the streets of New York, looking up at buildings, imagining what was within. “I had this lightbulb moment: just ask to look inside. Now most people know me as the ‘apartment tour guy’ – the dude who asks the questions: how much do you pay for rent? Can I see?” He has done about 300 apartment tours in New York. “Globally, it’s more like 500 now: Paris, London, Hong Kong. All major US cities.“It began with being shown a bunch of middle fingers on the streets of Manhattan,” he says. “New Yorkers are straight up – they told me to eff off.” How many times? “Maybe 100. It was deflating.” Then, a yes. “A  guy in Brooklyn showed me around his apartment. It went viral.” It hasn’t stopped since.Simpson’s selections are dictated by his own sense of curiosity. “There are lots of identical, cookie-cutter flats in New York, housing finance guys.” He no longer steps foot inside them. “I’m not interested. Instead, it’s places where I think: I want to see what that looks like. A strange building, low-income housing, rent-controlled places, someone who pays $70,000 a month.” He still roams the street looking for volunteers, but with 11 million followers on Instagram and TikTok, there is no shortage of doors opening these days; sometimes prearranged.What has he learned from the endless property perusal? “All New York renters think they’re getting a deal, but, really, everybody is getting ripped off,” says Simpson. “And beauty really lies in the eyes of the beholder. Sometimes, I film small apartments, and people comment saying it’s depressing, but the people who live there are thrilled.”This is why, he’s certain, it’s not just beautiful Brownstone-owning Brooklynites who let him in. “People are proud of what they have,” he says, “on whatever scale, and they want to show the world. Price isn’t the only determiner of worth or value: how they decorate, how they live in the architecture, how they found a place. And there’s the 15 minutes of fame that comes with letting me in.”‘What do you do for a living?’Daniel Mac,@itsdanielmacTikTok followers:14.2 millionInstagram followers:2.8 millionView image in fullscreen‘It was tough at the beginning – I’m shy by nature. Money was the motivator. I wanted to know how to get rich.’Photograph: CraSH/Shutterstock“When I started,” says Los Angeles-based Daniel MacDonald, 27, known online as Daniel Mac, “I’d just moved to Dallas, Texas, from a small-ish town in Arizona where there weren’t any Lamborghinis. I’d never seen supercars – and was curious. How did the driver afford it? What could I, fresh out of college, do to get one?” Unabashed, he began walking up to their tinted windows to ask: “What do you do for a living?”His first video clocked up 40m views. “When I posted it, I thought there was a glitch in the app and the numbers were wrong, but within a week I’d gained a million followers on TikTok.” This quadrupled in a matter of months – all during Covid. “People were bored and needed cash,” he says. “They wanted to get rich, and to find out how.”Sometimes, answers are unexpected.He has stoppedformer stockbroker Jordan Belfort, rapper Wiz Khalifa and Shou Zi Chew, theCEO of TikTok. Mostly, though, the responses are fairly formulaic. “The golden rule to getting rich, it transpires, is to invest, and buy real estate. Otherwise, common jobs are finance, healthcare, computer science and tech. Plus some trades, like plumbing and electricians … Accumulating wealth isn’t that sexy, it transpires.”How does he earn his living? “My revenue is split into three buckets: roughly 40% from ad revenue paid out primarily by Facebook and Snapchat, then some from YouTube and TikTok.” That’s his commission from the advertising that the platforms sell. “Another 40% or so comes from brand partnerships.” That’s the sponsored content. “Instagram brings in the most from this, then TikTok. And the last section comes from other miscellaneous things like speaking gigs.”Raised in Tucson, MacDonald had just graduated with a degree in finance from the University of Arizona when he started his TikTok. Initially, he was reluctant to be in front of the camera. “It was tough at the beginning,” he says. “I’m shy by nature, and wasn’t used to negativity and criticism, or people being mean to me online. Money was the motivator to continue. I wanted to know how to get rich.” It worked. In 2023, he bought his dream car: a $100,000 Porsche GT4.There’s a candidness to interviewees, he reckons, when they’re filmed on an iPhone camera, with no chunky kit or team of producers. “I’ve gotten people into hot water. One of thehigh-ups at Apple left the company after they made a lewd joke in a video of mine. People say stuff they regret.”Certainly, a strata of the super-wealthy would be reluctant to publicly parade their wealth. But MacDonald preys on those in flashy cars – the shy, modest and secretive types don’t tend to drive Bugattis. “It’s very American, for sure,” he says. “I’ve tried filming in several other countries where people don’t show off so much; they aren’t as flashy. In London, people were far more reluctant to talk about money.”‘Why are you a fan?’Morfo Peyiazis,@morfopeyiazisTikTok followers:47,800Instagram followers:15,600View image in fullscreen‘Football fans are either portrayed as mindless, violent hooligans or as sugar-coated and family-friendly. Nothing captured the true, unfiltered chaos somewhere in between.’Photograph: Robin Lee / robin.p.leeLondon-based Morfo Peyiazis, 30, took a clinical approach to viral success. She worked in marketing before starting out as a professional poster. “I was pitching video ideas to brands,” she says, “particularly football clients. I wanted to do interviews embedded with fans, and got fed up with being told, ‘No, it’s too risky.’”During Euro 2020, she spotted a chance. “Fuck it,” she thought, “I’ll make my own fan-focused series. Football fans are either portrayed as mindless, violent hooligans on the news, or, by their clubs, as sugar-coated and family-friendly. Nothing captured the true, unfiltered chaos somewhere in between.”Getting in among it suited her personality. “I get it from my dad,” she reckons, “a crazy Cypriot man. Growing up he had so much energy, and so much empathy with people.”Peyiazis saw TikTok as a way in to a more traditional telly career. “In essence, I used it to create a public portfolio: a place to make your own pilots, and prove that your ideas are popular. My ambition over the next five years is to build a media brand, and I want to be future-proof.” Whether or not that’s possible on TikTok, she’s still unsure. “The turnaround is so crazy. I couldn’t tell you the last five videos I watched. It’s instant: bam-bam-bam. How to create long-term impact is challenging.” She has landed gigs with Channel 4 and Sky Sports.There’s a natural warmth to her presenting style: playful, inquisitive, genuine interest in what her interviewees are saying. “I don’t like being on the periphery; I’m there to soak up the experience they’re having.” It’s this attitude that explains Peyiazis’s on-screen appeal, entirely unfazed by whatever she’s confronted with: hordes of screaming Celtic and Rangers fans at the high-octane “old firm” derby; young men playing up to the camera once microphones are pointed in their direction. “Among some of the supposedly most dangerous rivalries in the world, I feel entirely safe. Having no fear, and getting stuck in. You’ve got to be able to hold your own – and I can.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSocial mediaTikTokInstagramDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their appalling tragedy – being killed by the person to whom they gave life – has a chilling resonance. Like many of those whose deaths have been highlighted in the2,000 Women report by the Femicide Census, I am a professional with adored adult children and a close circle of friends. I am also frightened of my son.The women’s backstories are all too familiar – that is, an adult son with mental health and social problems, drug misuse, neurological diagnoses and a history of controlling and violent behaviour. Invariably, the perpetrators have fallen through every net designed to safeguard them. Often such a net never existed.It is a peculiar place to inhabit, to be simultaneously scared of your son while desperately wanting to hold and support him. It is hard enough to walk away from an abusive partner, let alone your child, whose vulnerabilities and misery claw at the heart. My son lives in a state of deep unhappiness, prey to stimuli he can’t filter, fraught social encounters, chronic anxiety and physical discomfort. Life is bewildering, painful, hard.At 24, he is a young man with learning disabilities and no hope of any of the aspirations of neurotypical peers: no career ladder, no partner, no festivals or functional friendships. Life is something to be battled and endured. I would not spend a minute in his shoes. He needs me for support, advocacy and protection. He still sleeps with his security blanket. I can’t and won’t walk away.But I often wish I could. On my phone is a recent text, the words “fucking cunt” written repeatedly. It was sent because I had blocked his calls after being asked the same question for 20 minutes. I was at work. He rang a further 76 times. Such messages are common, as is driving somewhere while he violently elbows the seat close to me – the list of challenging behaviours is exhaustive and exhausting. It is not just autistic meltdowns caused by an inability to regulate emotions but an expression of deep-seated mental health problems.In the photographs, I see resilient, smart, smiling women – doing their best to live normally against a backdrop of abnormality few can relate to. I am paralysed with sorrow for them, as I am for the mainly young men who killed the one person who loved and supported them the most.In many instances the women sought help. The inquest into thedeath of Sally Poynton, 44, stabbed repeatedly by her 22-year-old son Jacob Poynton-Whiting during a severe psychotic episode in June 2021, found thather death could have been avoidedif her son’s mental health condition had been diagnosed sooner. She had tried more than 20 times to get help for him.View image in fullscreenSally Poynton tried to get help for her son 20 times before he stabbed her to death in 2021.Photograph: LinkedinThat matricide is largely linked to mental health is borne out by research that is soon to be published.It was reported last weekthat academics Prof Rachel Condry and Dr Caroline Miles, from the universities of Oxford and Manchester, in collaboration with theFemicide Census, have found that in cases of women being killed by their sons and grandsons from 2009-2021, 70% involved perpetrators with mental health problems.Yet help is too often either not forthcoming or ineffectual because, in the words of the British Medical Association, our mental health and social care systems are “broken”.In itsMental Health Report 2024, the BMA pointed to key areas it said needed “urgent action” including underfunding; lack of trained staff in health and social care; and support systems operating in silos.In our case, my son does not merit a dedicated social worker because he isn’t perceived to be in crisis. That he isn’t thriving physically or emotionally is not reason enough to intervene. The social care system is reactively predicated – action happens when a crisis presents, not when it might have been prevented. As for mental health, like many adults on the autistic spectrum, hefalls through the gaps. There have been no mental health interventions since he turned 18 and ceased to be eligible for the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.Yet my son desperately needs therapeutic input to help manage his anxiety, depression and emotions, alongside medications prescribed by an expert in his diagnoses, which include autism, pathological demand avoidance, ADHD and OCD. Medication is managed by a GP who, while competent, is not trained specifically in mental health and neurodivergent conditions.Crucially, he needs help navigating his complex feelings towards me. A misfiring mother-son relationship isn’t, of course, confined to the neurodivergent, nor is it new. The Orestes complex, in which a son harbours the unconscious desire to kill his mother, is a parable dating back to ancient Greece. Friends complain of walking on eggshells around sullen adult neurotypical sons. But during flashpoints, their sons roll their eyes or behave peevishly. With a son who is hostage to unregulated emotions, flashpoints can be tragically fatal.This is where societal structures should save lives.Mental healthsupport that offers tools to manage emotions, joined up with a social care system that enables those with behavioural and social challenges to thrive. And residential and supported living that offers community, activities and cohesion, rather than simply warehousing vulnerable people.Yet such a picture seems depressingly far off, and I fear this year won’t have been the lastInternational Women’s Daymarked by reports of failings that led to deaths and shattered families. It is inevitably parents, particularly mothers, who bear the brunt of systemic failures and step in to support volatile, troubled sons. That they may be in danger is often overlooked; Condry points to a case where a man’s medical notes said he shouldn’t be left alone with female staff, “but nobody had questioned whether he should live on his own with his mother”.My son was removed from the house in 2018, not because he was attacking me but because there were minors present. I remain very involved in his care, but at times I feel unsafe. Sitting in the quiet of my house, it seems dramatic to write these next words, but had he remained living with me, I believe my picture could have been among those women. I can’t say it never will be.Explore more on these topicsFemicideThe ObserverViolence against women and girlsMental healthCrimeWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead – after realising that far from being left adrift by pop’s ever-changing styles, people were still interested in what he had to offer – he recorded another 37 albums (taking his total to more than 100), penned two bestselling autobiographies and a film score and carried on performing shows. Then last year he announced that he’d stop touring when he reaches 77, but he’ll be 76 this May and his packed live schedule doesn’t suggest a performer saying his last goodbyes.“There was a time when I thought, maybe it’s time to gracefully bow out,” the prog keyboard caped crusader explains, before his latest gig in Bradford. “But unfortunately I can’t. Music is the world to me. It’s just become blatantly obvious that I’m going to keep doing it until they put an epitaph on my gravestone reading: ‘It’s not fair. I’m not finished yet.’”Elkie Brooks knows exactly how he feels. The “Queen of British blues” (whose hits include Pearl’s a Singer and Lilac Wine) has had 13 Top 75 albums in total and is on the road again at 80, having performed a “farewell tour” when she was 40. “The promoter thought it might be a nice idea,” she chuckles. “I’ve been saying ‘farewell’ ever since.”View image in fullscreenThere’s Only One … Graham Nash.Photograph: Ralf LouisThe pair are not alone in rocking way past pensionable age. When rock’n’roll was considered a young person’s game, the young Mick Jagger once said: “I don’t wanna be singing Satisfaction when I’m 30,” but he still tours with the Rolling Stones at 81, while other venerable rockers treading the boards include Bob Dylan (83), Paul McCartney (82), Bruce Springsteen (75) and Mavis Staples (85). Folk legend Peggy Seeger is even touring this year aged 89. “It’s like a drug,” Wakeman explains. “Once it’s inside you, you can’t do without it.”The top stars don’t need the money but perform because it is rooted in their psyche and the demand is there. For Graham Nash, the Blackpool-born co-founder of the Hollies and supergroup Crosby, Stills and Nash, it’s about “the passion of music, and the energy I get from performing a new song to an audience. And when it’s a song I’ve sung a million times, I’m going to sing it with the same passion I had when I wrote it.”Seventy-five-year-old, California-born roots singerBonnie Raitthas spent 54 years on the road and says she can’t think of anything more fun. “When I started out, my heroes were the jazz, blues and classical people who played well into their 70s and 80s. But touring is like a travelling summer camp. Then every night I get to have a party with the audience.”I’m about to turn 83. I don’t have a vocal coach, I do 22 songs a night, 25 shows a tour. I’m singing as well as everGraham NashStars get hooked young. Wakeman first performed in childhood and Salford-born Brooks got the bug through singing in her uncle’s wedding band. Raitt watched audiences going “nuts” when her father sang in musicals such as Oklahoma! “None of us could believe this was his job,” she remembers. “So once I took to it and got to open for James Taylor and Muddy Waters there was no turning back.”Nash was a teenager when he entered a talent contest at Manchester Hippodrome with his pal Allan Clarke. “On that show were myself and Allan, who later formed the Hollies, Freddie Garrity, who became Freddie and the Dreamers, Ron Wycherley, who became Billy Fury, and Johnny and the Moondogs, who became the Beatles.” John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison had dashed for the last bus back to Liverpool by the time Nash and Clarke were declared the winners, but Nash says “2,000 people going crazy was the moment I knew I loved singing for people”.In the Hollies, he experienced the archetypal touring life: “Five of us in the back of a Transit, trying to get to sleep on the amps and drum cases. One night the doors flew open and I fell out of the van.” Aged 20, Wakeman lived similarly during his time in the Strawbs. He chuckles. “You couldn’t get my keyboard rig in a Transit now.”View image in fullscreen‘The trick is to pace yourself’ … Bonnie Raitt.Photograph: Scott Newton/Photo Courtesy of Austin PBS/Austin City Limits Photo by Scott NewtonJoining prog rock giants Yes in 1971 took his touring experiences to a very different level. “Staying on Sunset Strip with a whole bathroom and a shag pile carpet. I thought: ‘Bloody hell. I could move in here.’” But for older artists comfort is essential, rather than a luxury. “I wouldn’t want to be running around in a van trying to break into the business, loading the equipment and not getting decent hotels or food,” Raitt says. “The trick is to pace yourself.” She’s been touring for the last four years, and she does five months on the road out of every 12. “Enough to keep my band and crew working with me and to keep it fun.”In her youth, Brooks hated touring. “Just me in my little Mini with a little suitcase, driving everywhere, finding my own bed and breakfasts. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.” Now she tours the country with long gaps between gigs, pointing out that her vocal warmup, soundcheck and show still add up to more than three hours of exertion. “You wouldn’t ask Mo Farah to run the marathon again the next day, would you?” On show days, she avoids speaking to rest her voice. Raitt concurs: “One of the great gifts has been texting and email to save your voice during the day.”I never want to hear people walk out of a concert and go: He used to be really good.Rick WakemanIt also helps to stay fit. Brooks became a black belt in aikido when she was 50. Raitt does yoga and weights, hikes and takes a bike on tour. Wakeman merely walks his dogs. “We recently sold a house and in one of the outbuildings I came across this strange equipment,” he chuckles. “My wife said: ‘That’s the gym you built four years ago.’”As a member of Yes, he enjoyed excesses such as mocking a studio up like a farmyard, after which his keyboard had to go for repair because it was full of woodlice. “We’d come up with mad suggestions,” he chuckles. “‘Why don’t we travel by camel?!’ It was ridiculous, but it was the 70s.” His own excess stopped at drugs – “I’ve never popped a pill or smoked a joint” – but, he says, too much booze and cigarettes gave him a series of heart attacks by the age of 25, so he quit both. “I try not to think about all that,” he admits, more seriously, “because you ask yourself: ‘Should I still be here?’”“Honestly, to go on at the Newcastle Fiesta in 1964 or 65 you needed half a bottle of brandy,” argues Brooks, who admits that in Vinegar Joe, the band she formed with Robert Palmer in the 1970s, taking cocaine was like having a cup of coffee. “The thing was, we’d go on in Sheffield at 10pm, then we’d be doing a gig in the London Roundhouse at 3am. Two shows a night. I often wondered why the record company were taking cocaine but we were taking it just to stay bloody awake.” She stopped after meeting Trevor, her sound engineer husband of 47 years, who didn’t touch the stuff. “I wanted him to like me,” she says. She last drank alcohol before a show in 1979, when “a stomach upset meant I couldn’t keep anything down”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I realised they must be looking at me and seeing the same thing.” He still uses marijuana before shows, but says, “I’m about to turn 83. I don’t have a vocal coach, I do 22 songs a night, 25 shows a tour. Songs such as Military Madness or Immigration Man are still relevant and I’m singing as well as ever.”Some older stars carry scars from a lifetime on the road. Along with those heart attacks, Wakeman has had “double pleurisy, double pneumonia, arthritis, diabetes” and has to plunge his throbbing arthritic hands into an ice bath after every show. “I had some health problems in America this year and if it wasn’t for the show I’d have been in bed or calling the medics,” he reveals. “But when you go on stage, something takes over – adrenaline or whatever – and you feel great, until you’re back in the dressing room and you feel dreadful.”View image in fullscreenRick Wakeman … not planning to put his musical career on ice any time soon.Photograph: Lee Wilkinson MultimediaRaitt has had to postpone shows in recent years because of laryngitis or “wear and tear” and says her older musician pals joke about “who’s getting their knees done or who’s got tendonitis and so on. But in every city there are parks I love to go to, friends I love to see. And there are people who saw me in the 1970s who still come and see me now.”Younger fans discover veteran artists through parents, radio, magazines or streaming. It amazes Nash that he can pack a hall at his age and Wakeman appreciates every second in ways he could never have done when he was younger. What would make him stop performing? “If I couldn’t play like I want to. I never want to hear people walk out of a concert and go: ‘He used to be really good.’”Raitt wants to prove that she’s as “badass” as ever, but insists: “I’m not slowing down and I’m not going to stop until I can’t do it any more.” Brooks jokes that when she can no longer hit the high notes, “they’ll find a place for me in Tesco on the tills”. Nash saw Spanish guitar giant Andrés Segovia play when he was 92. “And he knocked me on my ass with the energy and brilliance of his performance. So I think: ‘Why not me?’”Perhaps there’s a life lesson here for all of us.

By the time he was saving Irish souls in the fifth century AD, linguists are pretty sure that Celtic was spoken throughout Britain andIreland. When Celtic first arrived in those islands, however, is an enduring mystery – one that new findings in archaeology and genetics might help to solve.The dates range between the early bronze age, around 2500BC, when archaeologists detect a major cultural transformation in Britain and Ireland, and the first century AD. Most linguists place it in between, in the last millennium BC – the iron age – but they can’t prove it because the language wasn’t written down until much later.The oldest known Celtic inscriptions come from the region of the northern Italian lakes and are dated to the sixth century BC. Greek and Roman historians attest to Celtic languages being spoken as far east as modern Bulgaria at about the same date. In Britain, however, Celtic wasn’t recorded until the first century BC, and in Ireland later still.Linguist David Stifter of Maynooth University in Ireland says that an iron age introduction is most likely because the Celtic languages of Britain, Ireland and what is now France look strikingly similar when they are first captured in writing, suggesting that the three varieties hadn’t parted ways long before. “If Celts or pre-Celts were in Ireland in the early bronze age, we would expect the language to look very, very different,” he says.We have this big crash in Ireland at 800BC. Something big happened, and it’s presumably related to the climateRowan McLaughlin, Maynooth UniversityThe cultural upheaval of the early bronze age may well have seen the introduction of a new language, Stifter thinks, but it wasn’t Celtic; Celtic eventually replaced that language.Migration is considered to have been a major driver of language change in prehistory, and in 2022 a group of researchers at Harvard University, led by computational biologist Nick Patterson,reportedthat they had detected a big turnover in the British gene pool around 1200BC. From that date until the Roman invasion of AD43 they were unable to detect any other large shift, so they suggested that this marked the wave of immigration that brought Celtic to Britain. “My gut feeling is it’s still a little bit early,” Stifter said at the time.However, geneticist Lara Cassidy of Trinity College Dublin says that a finer resolution is needed to detect people moving around the north-western corner of Europe in the last millennium BC, because the populations of France and Britain were already quite interconnected by then, and genetically more similar than they had been in the bronze age.In January, Cassidy’s groupreportedfinding identical sequences of DNA in the genomes of people who died either side of the Channel in that crucial period, indicating that they were more or less distantly related – up to nine generations’ separation. “We found evidence of substantial contact between at least the south coast of Britain and France during the iron age,” she says.The arrival of Celtic in Ireland is even harder to detect, because there’s no evidence of any major reconfiguration of the Irish gene pool after the early bronze age. Again, that doesn’t rule out immigration from genetically similar populations, Cassidy says, and archaeologist Rowan McLaughlin of Maynooth University thinks he has evidence of such an influx.Human DNA preserved from prehistoric Ireland is scarce, in part because the Irish cremated their dead throughout the iron age. That makes it difficult to estimate how the population size changed over time, but McLaughlin has found a way to do so indirectly. He has built a database of all archaeological traces of human occupation in Ireland starting in the late stone age. At 2500BC, he says, the population was about a million, and it remained that size until 800BC. “We have this big crash at 800BC, and then a few centuries of low levels of activity,” McLaughlin says. “Something big happened, and it’s presumably related to the climate.”View image in fullscreenThe Roman invasion of Britain, AD43.Photograph: Lebrecht Music and Arts Photo Library/AlamyAround 800BC, a global climate event caused western Europe to become very wet. McLaughlin thinks that associated disasters such as crop failures or epidemics triggered an Irish “brain drain” to Britain. This is the date at which the bronze age gave way to the iron age in Europe. Continental societies experienced a major rupture, with new cultural practices and religions replacing old ones, but in Britain it was business as usual – and business was thriving. Population centres were growing, impressive hillforts were being built, and cross-Channel traffic was increasing. “Britain is an unusual place in the iron age,” McLaughlin says.About 300 years later, the Irish population recovered, which could reflect the descendants of those earlier economic migrants returning to their roots. Only now they may have been speaking a different language, one they had brought back with them from Britain: Celtic.This scenario strikes many linguists as plausible, but McLaughlin says the smoking gun is missing: clear genetic evidence that Irish people settled in Britain around 800BC. Cassidy’s approach of searching for genealogical links between genetically similar populations could provide it, but she says that it’s not yet possible to rule out a third scenario – one proposed by linguist Peter Schrijver of Utrecht University in the Netherlands.Schrijver thinks that Celtic could have arrived in Ireland as late as the first century AD, brought by Celtic-speaking Britons fleeing the Roman invasion of AD43. They may have prospered in their new home, forming an elite that managed to impose its language by force or persuasion, or because others wanted to imitate them. An archaic form of Irish could have been what came out of local people’s mouths when they mispronounced what was, to them, a foreign tongue – British Celtic, or Brittonic.But the split between Brittonic and the so-called Goidelic languages of Scotland and Ireland could have happened differently. Goidelic could have arisen in the west of Britain, before being pushed across the Irish Sea by the Roman invasion. “I think everybody would be very confident that Celtic came from the continent into the islands,” Cassidy says, “but after that, movements could have been in both directions.”Breton, a Brittonic language still spoken in Brittany, is thought by many to have been planted in France by Cornish people who themselves took to the sea in small boats. Irish slavers seeded Goidelic in Scotland and the Isle of Man in the early middle ages, when they were capturing local people, including the future Saint Patrick.Does it seem complicated? That’s language for you. If the Celtic story is becoming clearer in some respects, Cassidy says, it’s unlikely ever to be entirely limpid: “The more data we gather, the more questions we raise.”Proto: How One AncientLanguageWent Globalby Laura Spinney is published on April 24 by HarperCollins (£22)Explore more on these topicsLanguageThe ObserverIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Olivia LadanyiSat 8 Mar 2025 07.00 ESTShareJill, 76If it hadn’t been for walking the dog, we would have stayed in bed for a fortnight. That first touch was such a turn-on for us bothSeven years ago, and three decades into our relationship, I was diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, then bladder cancer, which resulted in urostomy surgery. I lost a lot of weight and ended up with a plastic bag on my stomach, which doesn’t do a lot for your libido. Bob took great care of me, but although we remained emotionally close, we became more like housemates than lovers.We tried to have sex, but I found it too painful and Bob was scared of hurting me. He actually thought I’d had my clitoris removed with the surgery! (Not that men of my generation knew where to find it anyway.) Then Bob also had a cancer diagnosis and his prostate removed. We didn’t have sex for about five years. Instead, I would use my back massager to pleasure myself. We just accepted that we’d never have sex again.All the things I thought were over were back – and more full-on. We now have sex several times a weekThen one night about a year ago, we were watching a series of sex stories called Erotic Tales. The episode was about two friends with remote-controlled his-and-hers vibrators. I didn’t even know you could get sex toys for men, other than blow-up dolls. I found a website selling toys and showed Bob. When a delivery arrived the next day, I was surprised when he passed one of the packages to me.If it hadn’t been for walking the dog, we would have stayed in bed for a fortnight. That first touch was such a turn-on for us both and it felt good to see Bob enjoying himself.After that came lots more laughter, looking, touching. All the things I thought were over were back – and more full-on. We now have sex several times a week. We are more sensitive to one another’s needs. We have more fun. Bob has a bad back so we’re not that physically active but we really connect.Bob got carried away and ordered a whole collection of toys – he gave me a potted green vibrator shaped like a cactus for Mother’s Day with a label that says “keep in a warm, moist crevice” – but we don’t use them as often any more. Bob has his pot belly and I have my bag, but the toys helped make our inhibitions disappear.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

But her email with a link to the sex toys communicated that she was interested in sex again, so I ordered two. We now have about 14 toys but only use one or two.I see Jill’s orgasms as a mark of my sexual prowess – she often climaxes two or three times, and our record is nine in one dayAfter years of sex being too painful for Jill, the toys opened up the possibility of sex again. They also opened up a conversation about sex – about what we both like and what Jill finds uncomfortable. We still have to be careful in certain positions, but Jill now communicates during sex, saying, “that feels good” or “that hurts.”I’m not very touchy-feely. I wasn’t taught to express emotion (I can’t remember ever being cuddled by my mother), so I’m cautious about being overly demonstrative with my affection. I have an ingrained fear of rejection, which makes me avoidant and is partly why I backed off in those five years – I was afraid that Jill would think I was being too needy or turn me down. So even though I mostly initiate, I’d appreciate it if Jill initiated more.After I had my prostate removed, I was prescribed Viagra, but it gave me headaches and also found I could still get an erection without it. Although I can no longer ejaculate and struggle to orgasm, I see Jill’s orgasms as a mark of my sexual prowess – she often climaxes two or three times, and our record is nine in one day. That gives me the satisfaction I need.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsHealth & wellbeingMarriageBody imagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the time the final whistle went at the Aviva Stadium, the thousands of French fans inside, outside and all around the ground were cheering, screaming, roaring, singing, dancing, in celebration of one of the great victories.They had travelled in huge numbers and beenrewarded with five tries and 42 points, a record score for them in this city, revenge in plenty for the 21-point thrashing by Ireland in Marseille last year. France are favourites for the championship now and the Irish are squaring up to the kind of existential hangover you get by being so completely beaten in a match that had so much riding on it.France take Six Nations title race to the wire with thumping win over IrelandRead moreThe game will take some unpicking. In the first moments after it was over, it left a mess of images. Somewhere in the tumult was young Sam Prendergast looking, for the first time, like a kid playing a man’s game, being smacked back in his very first collision with Yoram Moefana and stripped by Uini Atonio, and Damian Penaud galloping across the field, the game unspooling around him like a film that had slipped its reel, Louis Bielle-Biarrey sprinting around Hugo Keenan like he was a maypole, to slap the ball down behind the posts, and Jean-Baptiste Gros tossing an underhand pass to Maxime Lucu as he came barrelling in behind him, and Oscar Jégou twisting underneath Tadhg Beirne’s reach to twist over the Irish try line.In this sort of form, playing France is like sitting out a whirlwind. All you can do is duck and cover. The cruel part is that when the Irish side sit down to go over the tapes, they might just find that there were the makings of a very different game somewhere in there, too.There were moments when the match was right there for the taking, if they had only been able to reach out and seize hold of it. They will look at the first 20 minutes in particular when they had three-quarters of the territory and three-quarters of the possession, and did three quarters of naff-all with it. They had a run of four early penalties, sent two to the corner and tried to maul their way over, kicked a third at goal, and still didn’t manage so much as a single point.Even then, they were right in it either side of half-time. They were two points down right before the break, and five points up right after it, after Dan Sheehan scored off a maul in the corner.View image in fullscreenSam Prendergast for the first time looked like a kid playing a man’s game.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesBetter yet, at that point the French looked to be reeling from the loss of the talismanic Antoine Dupont, who was forced off in the 30th minute when Beirne collapsed into his knee after he was shoved while trying to clear out of a ruck. There are half a million rugby players in France, at least a couple of thousand or so professionals, Fabien Galthié managed to pick 75 of them just last year. They even have a good handful of Test-match scrum halves, Lucu, Nolann Le Garrec, Baptiste Serin, Baptiste Couilloud and Baptiste Jauneau. But they only have one Dupont. Which is why Galthié has built the team around him.On came Lucu, like the actor playing understudy to Olivier. The entire tone of the game changed in the first minutes he was on the pitch, the Irish crowd swelled, the Irish players surged and the bewildered French were blown back into their own territory. It got worse when Pierre-Louis Barassi was forced off with a head injury after a high tackle by Calvin Nash. France had picked such a lopsided bench, with seven forwards, that it felt a good thing the players don’t have to share the same stretch of timber anymore, or else Lucu, the one solitary back, would have been stuck 10 feet up in the air, like a kid playing seesaw with a sumo.With Barassi off too, France were forced to bring flanker Jégou on at outside-centre. It was a hell of a gamble. But it turns out that Galthié is a fair judge of the odds. In the 48th minute, with the match hanging in the balance, and while Ireland were one man down waiting for Nash to come back on to the field after his 20-minute dismissal, Galthié brought on his squad of five forwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moments later, the Irish were battered back off their own ball, and Penaud was away and running. It was as if someone had slipped them into a higher gear, all of a sudden they were playing a very different sort of rugby, above and beyond what the exhausted Irish could live with. Truth is, the seven-one bench paid off.They had too much power, too much speed, too much skill, and the game broke open, in a flood of 29 points in the next 21 minutes. Ireland, who are such an intricately organised side, a bit of clockwork engineering, collapsed in a mess of coils and springs and levers, like a watch dashed on a rock. A fair few teams have come to Dublin and gone down to epochal defeats in recent years, you wonder whether the Irish have just done likewise.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverIreland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

From Arne Slot’s elevated position up in the Anfield directors’ box, however, he could see warning signs with Paris Saint-Germain on the horizon.“When I look at the first game against PSG, we have to go one step up in terms of intensity,” said theLiverpoolhead coach. “And compared to the game today, we need to go five, six, seven steps up in terms of intensity if we want to have any chance of reaching the next round.”The French champions will not be as obliging as the Premier League’s bottom club in Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 second leg should Liverpool repeat this display. Slot insisted this was a one-off.The Premier League leaders required two Mohamed Salah penalties to move closer to the title after Darwin Núñez cancelled out Will Smallbone’s opener for Ivan Juric’s doomed side. The hosts also needed an injection of energy and quality from a triple half-time substitution to rouse themselves from a lethargic and sloppy opening. Southampton were able to grow in confidence and menace before stunning Anfield by taking the lead. They would ultimately bemoan three video assistant referee reviews that went against them.Liverpool v Southampton, Brighton v Fulham, and more: football – liveRead moreSlot had labelled Southampton’s visit as the first of three finals this week. “I’m hoping we play a bit better in the next two finals than we did in the first one,” he admitted after serving the final game of his touchline ban.The Liverpool head coach had his head in his hands when a calamitous mix-up handed Southampton the breakthrough. That Virgil van Dijk and the hero of Paris, Alisson, were involved heightened the unease inside Anfield. The Liverpool captain attempted to shepherd a Ryan Manning throw-in back to his goalkeeper but Alisson, off balance after a Mateus Fernandes challenge, failed to collect. The ball squirmed loose to Smallbone, who squeezed a low shot through the Brazilian’s legs and in from a tight angle.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah scores one of his two penalties for Liverpool.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesLiverpool could have been in a worse position before half-time. The VAR checked a possible red card offence by Núñez after he was booked for taking a swipe at Kyle Walker-Peters. Núñez made no attempt to play the ball but the VAR stuck with the on-field decision of the new Premier League referee Lewis Smith.Slot’s half-time changes said everything about Liverpool’s performance. His selection appeared risky from the off with only Andy Robertson, Alexis Mac Allister and Diogo Jota rested from the team that started at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. There was no reward of a first league start of the season for Harvey Elliott, though he was among the half-time replacements for Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas. The impact was immediate.Elliott almost repeatedhis PSG performanceby scoring within seconds of his arrival. Aaron Ramsdale, who saved well from Trent Alexander-Arnold but was relatively untroubled in the first half, turned the 21-year-old’s drive wide of the far post. There was a sharpness and aggression to Liverpool that had been absent before the changes. Now Slot witnessed the intensity he had called for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move was instigated by one of the half-time substitutes, Robertson, who found Luis Díaz hugging the left touchline. Díaz darted past Walker-Peters to the byline and centred for the Uruguay striker to convert at the near post.The game turned moments later when Ramsdale saved from Díaz and Núñez went down under a challenge from Smallbone as Southampton attempted to clear. Smith awarded a soft penalty, the VAR did not intervene, and Salah swept an unstoppable spot-kick into Ramsdale’s right corner. The 242nd goal of Salah’s Liverpool career moved him to outright third in the club’s all-time goalscorers’ list. “It was not a penalty and that changed the match,” said an angry Juric. “This cannot be a penalty ever.”Juric also bemoaned the award of Liverpool’s second penalty but conceded Yukinari Sugawara “needs to be more careful” after he handled following a tussle with Díaz. A Sugawara handball gave Salah a spot-kick to complete Liverpool’s comebackat St Mary’s Stadium in November. Here it presented the Egypt international with the opportunity to go joint-fifth on the all-time Premier League scorers’ chart with Sergio Agüero. The phenomenal forward’s 184th top-flight goal was drilled emphatically into Ramsdale’s top left corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverLiverpoolSouthamptonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The most successful resemble club teams in that they have a core of players and a clearly defined style of play. There’s always an in-form player around whom a clamour develops, but continuity is just as important, perhaps even more so, in the international game. But next week inevitably represents a new start as Thomas Tuchel picks his firstEnglandsquad for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia later in the month.All managers make some slightly surprising selections to start with – Sven-Göran Eriksson, for instance, began witha 3-0 friendly win against Spainin which Chris Powell, Gavin McCann and Michael Ball all played a half – but this should give at least some indication of how Tuchel plans to set about trying to win the 2026 World Cup.Tuchel casts net far and wide for talent as he ponders 55-player England longlistRead moreGiven his contract runs only until the end of that tournament, there is little reason for him to look to the long term: there’s no point blooding players who might be coming into their prime for Euro 2028. His job is to win in 2026, which may mean a greater willingness to pick older players who had seemed to have drifted from the picture. While there are obvious drawbacks if Tuchel ends up ignoring youth, a clarity of focus may turn out to be beneficial. Jam tomorrow often ends up not being jam at all.That, and the lack of outstanding alternatives, probably means Harry Kane still leading the side, even if he has underwhelmed in the last two tournaments. Ollie Watkins impressed at the Euros but has not had the best season, Ivan Toney has removed himself from consideration by joining Al-Ahli, while Dominic Solanke, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Callum Wilson have all struggled with injury. Danny Welbeck, at 34, could be the beneficiary of a new short-termism. Liam Delap, at 22, has surely done enough for at least a call-up.What comes behind Kane is a thornier question. At the Euros,Englandended up with too many players whose natural position was either as a No 10 or drifting from wide into that position – a particular issue given the way Kane naturally drops into that role. Telling him to stay high seems to miss the point; one of his greatest gifts is his ability to fall deeper, spin and ping passes to players running beyond him. But England suddenly lacked players to run beyond him, a problem, arguably, of Gareth Southgate – so often derided as conservative, staid and over-loyal – making too many changes too quickly.View image in fullscreenA lack of outstanding alternatives probably means Harry Kane will still lead England, even if he has underwhelmed in the last two tournaments.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverInjury removes Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke, while Raheem Sterling is surely no longer under consideration, but there is still an intimidating array of options: Jude Bellingham, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Morgan Gibbs-White, Anthony Gordon, Jack Grealish, James Maddison, Ethan Nwaneri, Cole Palmer, Marcus Rashford, Morgan Rogers …The question really is one of balance: Rashford may only just be showing flickerings of form after his loan move to Aston Villa, but his pace, his capacity to run into the space Kane vacates, may be what England need from the left. Can Palmer and Bellingham both be accommodated? There may have to be some very difficult omissions.At the back of midfield – the squad seem naturally to fall into a 4-2-3-1 or perhaps a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid shape – Tuchel faces the problem all England managers have of the lack of a ball-playing anchor. Declan Rice seems not to have the tactical awareness needed for the role and is better deployed as the more attacking of the two holders, driving forwards.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold presents the usual dilemma: is there a way of covering his defensive shortcomings to accommodate his supreme ball-playing?Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverThat absence is why Lee Carsleyturned to Angel Gomesbut, for all the Lille midfielder’s technical ability, doubts persist about his physicality, which is why so many have invested so much hope in Adam Wharton. He surely will be in the squad, although given he is just regaining fitness after a groin problem, it would be unfair to expect too much too soon. Curtis Jones and Conor Gallagher could also have roles to play, particularly if the preference is for something closer to 4-3-3 than 4-2-3-1.Jordan Pickford remains the clear first choice in goal, but the back four is far harder to predict. Marc Guéhihad an outstanding Eurosand, after a slightly shaky start to the season, has returned to form recently and has a good claim to be the left-sided centre-back. In an ideal world, his partner would probably be John Stones but his thigh injury opens the door to a host of candidates, foremost among them perhaps Ezri Konsa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFull-back is even more fraught. Lewis Hall, who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel, would probably have been the left-back after an excellent season but he is out until the summer. Myles Lewis-Skelly has made a huge impact at Arsenal, even if he does feel like a red card waiting to happen.Great individuals help, as England found at the last Euros when their misfiring side somehow reached the finalTyrick Mitchell, after another quietly impressive season, is a more experienced option but Tuchel may decide fielding somebody more used to operating at wing-back is too much of a risk, particularly if he goes for Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right. A player who can tuck in as a de facto third centre-back would offer better balance, which makes it a shame Levi Colwill hasn’t had a better season.On the right, Alexander-Arnold presents the usual dilemma: is there a way of covering his defensive shortcomings to accommodate his supreme ball-playing? In that sense the question of his selection is less to do with him than the makeup of the midfield and the rest of the back four. Rico Lewis, Tino Livramento, Djed Spence or, if he can stay fit, Reece James represent safer options.But, as ever, the key is internal coherence, picking the right players not the best players, and having a thick enough skin to ignore the noise around whoever happens to be flavour of the month. Great individuals help, of course, as England found at the last Euros when their misfiring side somehow reached the final. But what actually wins tournaments is the rest, those who allow the great individuals to flourish. Anybody can pick Lionel Messi; the real skill is finding Rodrigo De Paul.Explore more on these topicsEnglandInside footballThomas TuchelcommentShareReuse this content"

Twas ever thus. Punditry is, by nature, viewed through the prism of the past. Glance into a Premier League press room on match day, the thickened waistlines and/or greying hair of former heroes will be present and correct.The BBC’sTest Match Specialis forever travelling back in time, if not so frequently as whenFred Truemanwas part of the team.

TMS, despite cricket’s many modernities, has never truly extracted itself from its golden era ofEW Swantonand John Arlott.The Haaland safari: Bryne celebrates its famous son in Norway’s newest tourist attractionRead moreFootball, a sport of far greater partisanship, is full of such golden ages, depending on which club you may favour. A listener to Merseyside’s Radio City in the 90s on Saturday evenings could hear Ian St John, formerly half of ITV’sSaint and Greavsie, hold forth on the latest failings of Liverpool FC. “That’s no’ a Liverpool team,” the Saint, Kop idol turned keeper of the Shankly faith, would grumble.Concurrently, viewers ofMatch of the Daywere presented with Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, twin rocks of the 80s Liverpool machine turned shirt-sleeved critics of serial champions turned tabloid fodder “Spice Boys”. Hansen’s Clackmannanshire baritone and Lawro’s Lancastrian, Mavis Riley-like whine would dissect their former club’s performances, punches occasionally pulled in the hope things would turn around. They weren’t angry, just disappointed.A Liverpool player of the time would have few places to turn to avoid disapproval. On Sky, Phil Thompson, jettisoned from coaching after a falling-out with Graeme Souness, became an often searing critic. Around such time, neutrality was abandoned as an impossible job, giving rise to the largely partisan pundits found on pay-TV broadcasts. Every club has one, and if not, Steve Sidwell probably played for them.AManchester Unitedplayer of 2025 has even fewer places to hide than his 90s Liverpool equivalent. In the pundit class, Sir Alex Ferguson’s players pervade, including, and this is no exhaustive list, Gary Neville’s groans of warning, Roy Keane’s squawks of disgust, Paul Scholes’s sighing disapproval and Rio Ferdinand’s rising volume.Other former United stars are available. Most have contributed to a criticism of their former club that has become an avalanche. Punches are rarely pulled. None has an official role at United like, say, Micah Richards’ club ambassadorship for Manchester City. The Glazer family’s – and latterly Ineos’s – lack of interest in a past that cannot be monetised has demobbed an army into one that now rails against them.View image in fullscreenRoy Keane does not hold back in the media but Ruben Amorim has the confidence to take on the old guard.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEach reverse sees a former Ferguson charge rant, almost on a rota basis, Keane doing double shifts. Last week, asUnited exited the FA Cup, it was Wayne Rooney’s turn, using the word “naive” to describe Ruben Amorim. The United manager’s riposte – “That’s why I’m here, at 40 years old, coaching Manchester United” – was a missile guided towards his critic’s struggles to establish himself in coaching.Where Liverpool players of their doldrum era have spoken of the dangers of kicking back, Amorim retains the self-confidence to take on the old guard, becoming a gift to headlines, adding fire and colour to common-and-garden quotes follow-ups.Technology has added multitudes. Social media, where Neville’s partner in punditry, the perennially online Jamie Carragher, is usually found, is key, though the collapse of X into a Dante’s Inferno of wrongness has lately lessened its impact. YouTube and podcasts are where the money is. The most piping-hot takes, too.They are served hottest byThe Overlappodcast, where Neville, Carragher, Keano, Jill Scott and Ian Wright plus guests – Scholesey, Wazza, Butty, Schmeichs, Becks – perch round the type of kitchen island no Cheshire footballer’s mansion would be complete without.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Manchester United players of 2025, struggling within the 3-4-3 formation the old gods dismiss despite other Premier League teams making it work, find themselves in a media environment where the treble of 1999 and accompanying triumphs are regularly relived, where Ferguson’s team’s unrepeatable magic has grown men cooing like the subservient young men they once were.It makes for popular, watchable content, but in constantly looking to the past, any brighter future for United feels further away than ever.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverGary NevilleRoy KeaneRio FerdinandSky SportsSport TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And about the same time again for him to have a packed crowd in Apeldoorn eating out of his hand.For no sooner had he been asked for his thoughts on his victory, the Rotterdam-born Azu began to speak in fluent Dutch: “I am here, I am in the building!” Having been foot perfect on the track, the 23-year-old proved to be word perfect off it too.Extra motivation, Azu admitted, had been provided after his wife, Terri, gave birth to their son, Azaire, last week – even though it had led to a few sleepless nights.“It’s a huge moment with his father becoming a European champion,” he said. “He’s going to be able to look back on this and see what his dad was doing, which is an amazing feeling.“But last week was rough,” added Azu, who joins a roll call of British winners of this title that includes Linford Christie, Colin Jackson and Richard Kilty.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Honestly, people go on about sleep and not that I didn’t believe them, but I feel like everyone over dramatises it, but they’re not joking at all.”Azu’s parents, Alex and Cathreen, were also unlikely to get much sleep on Saturday given they had to dash off to catch the overnight ferry back to Cardiff in time for Alex to preach in church at 11.30am. “My dad’s preaching tomorrow, so he’s getting back at 5am,” he added.Sweden’s Henrik Larsson took silver in 6.52, with another Briton, Andrew Robertson, claiming bronze in 6.55 after getting a call up on Monday after a withdrawal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will probably thrive on it.Gregor Townsend acknowledged that Scotland face the toughest assignment of all on Saturday night. “France scored 70 points against a very good Italian team,” he said. “They got 40 points against Wales, 40 points against Ireland. I think they could have 40 or 50 points against England with the amount of chances they had. Just now, probably this is the toughest fixture in world rugby. They beat the All Blacks in November. So we can’t wait to be involved in it. They’ll be going for the title, but it’s an opportunity for us to go out and play against one of the best teams right now.”Scotland produce performance of extremes but survive Wales fightbackRead moreA very different prospect, then, to what Scotland faced here. Once again, just as they had against England in round three – when they actually managed to lose the game – they ran rings around the opposition for most of the match but could not finish them off. In the end, they held on for a six-point win, but it might even have been a loss, but for an intervention by the television match official, when Taulupe Faletau thought he had scored with five minutes remaining. Alas, Blair Murray had jumped into a tackler earlier in the move, so the try was disallowed.“I think we thought straight away that you can’t jump to evade a tackle,” said Townsend. “Jamie Ritchie, who was captain at the time, was asking the referee to check it, but the TMO had already highlighted it. I thought it was an easy decision.”Wales’s coach, Matt Sherratt, agreed the offence had occurred, even if it must frustrate that it seemed so unnecessary. Had the try stood, Wales might even have earned the unlikeliest of wins. There was time for Max Llewellyn to score Wales’s fourth try at the death, with the conversion bringing them back within six points.“Obviously it was a really brave effort to come back and get two [bonus] points,” said Sherratt, “but I’ve seen enough of those games where the reality is, Scotland probably thought they’d done enough and maybe dropped off 5%.“But there was a hell of a lot of effort from our boys in that last 20 minutes. It was nice to get the bonus points, but more pleasing to me was seeing the desperation defending their line [in the final quarter]. It was almost like it was a one-score game. The amount of tackles some of our forwards were putting in in those sets was outstanding.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve spoken to many female athletes about it. And some of the stuff that the American shot putter Raven Saunders told me made me want to cry. We’ve got to do more.”Coe also promised he would deliver a blunt message to Zuckerberg, who is the chief executive of the Facebook and Instagram owner Meta, and Musk, who owns X, if he got the top job in global sports politics. “Come on, sort this out. Because this is just unacceptable. Sadly, it’s not new, but there’s just more of it. However, I think artificial intelligence actually can really help here in turbocharging some of this stuff out.”Coe also questioned whether sportswashing was a valid term in the modern world, given that every country uses sport to promote its own interests, and said he would be happy for Saudi Arabia to bid for the 2040 Olympics.“Let’s be open,” he said. “To a greater or lesser degree, everybody does that. You want to show the best of your country. They have 30-year strategies. And I think we sometimes overlook that. I first went to Qatar in the mid-90s, when they had a Junior World Cup in 1997.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe also said he would not have a problem with Saudi Arabia bidding for the 2040 Olympics.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/Reuters“And some of those countries have got a much more coherent policy towards sport – and using it to create better opportunities for movement and young people – than other countries that are sitting there saying: ‘Oh well, it’s sportswashing,’ while watching school sport disappear and sport slowly drift off government agenda. So we have got to be a little more even-handed.”Coe also insisted that he would be relaxed about Saudi Arabia hosting the Games in the autumn rather than summer, because it was inevitable that global warming would push future Olympics away from their traditional slot in July and August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it doesn’t work.”Coe pledged to work closely with Donald Trump before the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 if elected – and dismissed concerns that Trump’s behaviour might overshadow the Games. “I can’t believe that – like any other American president – he won’t want these Games to be a huge success,” he said. “And the Games are bigger than any individual. But it’s not a landscape that’s alien to me. The one thing about sport is you can have many more uncompromising conversations than jobbing ministers and politicians who don’t want to lose contracts going into countries.“And the LA Games were opened in ’84 by Ronald Reagan.

The Order of Lenin, though, is in the bagSimon TisdallThe strange warmth between the leaders has sent a chill globally at the prospect of a troika of authoritarian statesSat 8 Mar 2025 09.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 09.53 ESTShareDonald Trump’s sinister affinity for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has long been the subject of intense speculation. Former KGB officers claim Trump wasrecruited in Moscow in 1987 and cultivated as an assetin the years prior to his 2016 US election victory.Two retired Russian spies weighed in again last month, alleging that the then 40-year-old Trump,codename “Krasnov”, was personally compromised in an “active measures” operation and has secretly danced to Putin’s tune ever since.Nothing is proved and all is denied. Yet the so-calledSteele dossier, compiled by a British MI6 ex-spy chief, the FBI’sMueller report, and US intelligence agencies all agree there were “multiple, systematic” Russian efforts to swing the 2016 vote to Trump. Candidate Trump praised Putin at the time as a “strong leader” while claiming never to have met him.Previously, he said he had.He’s less coy now. Their phone call on 12 February lasted 90 minutes – and changed the world.What did Putin say? It must have been persuasive. Since then, Trump has been falling over himself to please andappease the Kremlin’s dictator. He has suspended US military aid and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, pilloried and plotted to oust its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and demanded a “peace deal” on Russia’s unjust terms. Meanwhile, the wider ramifications of Trump’s sellout carry huge negative implications for Europe and western interests in China, the Middle East and Africa.If Trump is not Russia’s stooge, what explains his epic volte-face? Apologists offer several excuses. One is that Ukraine is not America’s problem. Nonsense. Unprovoked armed aggression against a sovereign democratic state is every free nation’s problem. Another is that the US should not have to fight Europe’s wars. Answer: it doesn’t. It fights its own wars on other people’s territory, out of self-interest.It always has.Supporters say Trump is a master dealmaker and peacemaker. Phooey! He has already offered crucial Ukraine giveaways to Putin, for zero return. Remember his North Korea and Afghanistan fiascos? And look at Gaza. How’s that going, Comrade Krasnov? Fans claim he’s performing a clever “reverse Nixon” by disrupting Russia-China ties, like that other disgraceful US president in 1972. Except, only days ago, Putin and President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the “unique strategic value” of their alliance.Lucrative joint economic projects provide another key to understanding Trump’s broader surrender strategy. Marco Rubio, US secretary of state turned cheap hustler, gushes embarrassingly about “extraordinary opportunities”. Putin is dangling deals onrare earth metals, energy and aluminium.Joint Arctic exploitation is mooted. Meanwhile, Trump helpfully imposes costly tariffs on Russia’s foes.Whatever Trump’s reasons, the shocking truth is that Putin owns him now, even if he didn’t own him before. The US has switched sides. Trump boasts, self-incriminatingly, that he alone has inside information about Kremlin intentions. This dumb patsy likes the strongman vibe. He’d like to be a dictator, too. He admires how Putin terminates opponents “with extreme prejudice”, as inApocalypse Now. Except in this twisted White House remake,JD Vanceis mad, bad Colonel Kurtz.Trump betrayed his warm feelings for Putin during his Oval Office put-up row with Zelenskyy. Asked why Putin would keep his word in any peace deal when he never has before, Trump exploded: “They respect me! Let me tell you. Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through aphoney witch-hunt…” Trump was referring to the past investigations into Russian collusion. Plainly, he sees Putin, an indicted war criminal and mass murderer, not merely as role model but as personal friend and fellow victim of political persecution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Europe is Moscow’s new bogeymanMuch flows from this, none of it good for Britain and Nato. Ukraine’s capitulation is now a shared US-Russia war aim. Trump is trying to bully Zelenskyy and stampede Europe into a deal without credible security guarantees. He is planning to ease or lift sanctions, not strengthen them, as he occasionally suggests. He has already halted US cooperation with Europe on countering Russian“shadow war” cyber operations.Continued American backing for Nato is rightly questioned by German and French leaders. The alliance may not survive this crisis. Would-be bridge-builder Keir Starmer lacks a pontoon to stand on. Poland and the Baltic states understandably fear they may be next. The US nuclear umbrella is in doubt, too, which has led Emmanuel Macron to revive his idea of a pooledAnglo-French deterrent.Russia is intensifying the war to exploit Trump’s surrender, gain ground and further squeeze Kyiv. Europe is Moscow’s new bogeyman. Putin now says the US is more like a partner, run by people with a “pragmatic, realistic worldview” who are discarding “stereotypes, so-called ‘rules’ and the messianic, ideological cliches of their predecessors”.There goes the laws-based international order, right there. Trump may not win a Nobel peace prize but he has certainly earned the Order of Lenin.If it lasts, and that’s a big “if” given fickle Trump’s record, this US-Russia reset may remake the geopolitics of the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Iran stands to gain, unless, as Tehran fears, Putin sells it out to Israel. North Korea is a likely winner, too. Putin may win a freer hand in Syria, the Sahel and central Asia. Facing an emboldened Beijing, Trump may giveTaiwan the Kyiv bum’s rush.The most threatening prospect, for western democracies, is the idea, discussed by Rubio, of an emerging troika ofauthoritarian superstates– the US, Russia and China – dominating and dictating a new world order.As Judas Trump blunders about, betraying friends, rewarding enemies and smashing the global crockery, one cold-eyed certainty remains: in their dysfunctional, deeply dubious relationship, Putin is the dominant partner.

You might make a fortune. Take a punt on a fintech company or an artificial intelligence startup. Better still, join the rest of the world by targeting property, which is the go-to asset class for80% of global investmentsseeking a stellar payout.Whatever you do, avoid retail. And steer clear of manufacturing, which needs lots of startup capital and precision engineering, and offers only slim margins and modest returns as a reward for all that effort.This is what Rachel Reeves is up against when she urges pension funds and Isa savers to channel funds into businesses that make physical stuff.The chancellor wants everyone with money to back Britain. Initially, she talked mostly about attracting foreign investors.These days the focus is on domestic funds that have – contrary to a Britain First agenda – spread their investments across the world, and especially the US, where stock markets have boomed in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Why bother with the UK when all the action is in fast-growing, emerging markets or the US, fund managers ask.British manufacturing is back in the spotlight now that Donald Trump is in the White House, threatening the withdrawal of US defence cover. His trade tariffs are part of the same story. They are aimed at manufactured imports, to illustrate the cost to Europe, China and others of not agreeing to all of Trump’s main political aims. Then they are withdrawn or delayed at a moment’s notice, as Mexico’s government can attest, to make sure countries cannot plan or adjust to cope with the new regime.The only way to react is to smile in Washington’s direction, as Keir Starmer has done, and plan furiously and diligently toreduce any reliance on the US.In the frontline of British manufacturing are many globally competitive businesses, from fighter jet maker BAE Systems and warship builder Babcock International to the security group QinetiQ. Alongside them are French, German and Italian counterparts, including the Rome-headquartered Leonardo, which owns the former Westland helicopter factory in Yeovil, Somerset.Manufacturing is not seen as the dirty, life-shortening job it was, but it is often considered to be a dead-end careerLockheed Martin and General Dynamics top the list of US defence firms. Both make the Ajax “mini tank” – considered a central pillar of the British army’s operations – while Lockheed also supplies Britain with the F-35 fighter jet.The F-35, used by the RAF and navy, operates alongside Eurofighter Typhoon jets, some of which, specifically the T1 model, are showing their age and are to be scrapped for spares.Defence secretary John Healey must soon decide whether to upgrade these to the newer version of the Typhoon, the T5, as other partner nations in the Eurofighter consortium – Germany, Italy and Spain – have done, or make a trip to Lockheed’s offices to buy more F-35s. It isa monumental decisionthat should be made in the Typhoon’s favour.The general rule of thumb, according to defence expert Trevor Taylor of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) thinktank, should be: does the British or European kit deter the Russians, and if it does, then is the UK/EU version good enough to buy?There are about 12,000 other firms in the defence supply chain, many of them family owned and run, with histories going back to the second world war and beyond. After 40 years of shrinking defence budgets, they have often expanded away from defence to other related areas and may be only considered defence contractors in the broadest sense.Encouraging them to become involved again in the defence supply chain is not going to be easy when they remember the kind of contractual game-playing and ministerial dither and delay that only the biggest companies can cope with.Smaller firms are often also trapped in a loveless marriage with their local communities, who do not want to live next to a factory or work in it, while lauding its existence.Manufacturing may not be seen as the dirty, life-shortening job it once was, but as a career it is often considered a dead end. Meanwhile, factory owners have typically done a terrible job selling the benefits of a life making tangible objects. A succession of Tory government initiatives hasn’t helped – in particular the apprenticeship levy, which triggered a dramatic fall in the number of young people starting training programmes from its inception in 2017.Engineering students are just as likely to veer off their chosen path into the world of finance as they are to build a bridge or develop a defence project. No wonder few investors want to touch UK manufacturing, let alone defence contracting.It means Labour needs lots of jigsaw pieces to fit together before it can begin to think about a deterrent that relies less on the US and more with our European partners. But redirecting foreign and domestic capital to it would be a start.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorThe ObserverDefence policyEconomicsTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

We know what we don’t want, which is, basically: everything the couple have done so far. We disapproved of the tell-allOprah interview, andHarry’s memoir,Spare– they were too revealing, too appallingly frank. We hatedtheir tell-nothing Netflix documentary,Harry & Meghan– far too boring, what was the point?And we particularly loathe the new Netflix show,With Love, Meghan, which garnered what must be a record number ofterrible reviewslast week – “an exercise in narcissism”, “toe-curlingly unlovable TV”. Where once the pair were ridiculed for their whining self pity, now they are diagnosed with the opposite problem – critics find the new venture “desperately upbeat”.It’s not that the reviewers are wrong. It is bad TV. Meghan is stiff and awkward and operates entirely in cliches. A cooking show can just about handle a dull presenter if they are skilled and making something interesting – but here is Meghan’s “skillet spaghetti”: dry pasta over a layer of cherry tomatoes and feta, to be boiled up together. She doesn’t look as though she enjoys cooking or is any good at it. Perhaps this would be OK if there were at least a few dynamic guests. But Meghan instantly neuters any conversation that strays off the assigned path (praising her; echoing her platitudes) with a look of true alarm.What I find interesting, though, is the utter outrage humming through the press about all this, an emotion that underlies every one of these reviews. After all, this is fairly innocuous stuff, as it comes. The duchess is irritating – but no more so than, say, any other Californian lifestyle influencer, or rich actress launching a brand of rustic fantasy tea towels and “inspirational” candles. Even Gwyneth Paltrow did not provoke this level of hate. Neither is Meghan flogging dubious wellness cures, a curse that hangs over so many similar enterprises. She’s just making ladybird crostini out of tomatoes and balsamic glaze, and inviting us to admire her taste in flower arrangements. It’s boring, yes, but is it worth all this fury?Everything the Sussexes do is wrong. When they paid a sombre visit to a cemetery one Remembrance Sunday, it was pilloried as a PR exercise – they were aping true royals. When they behave instead like mere celebrities, they are scolded as embarrassments to the crown.It should be a relief to royalists, really, that the “confessional” part of their careers seems to be over, and they are attempting to establish themselves as bland lifestyle influencers. There is no gauntlet thrown down before William and Kate this time, no shaming secrets revealed. Yet this new phase is provoking more anger than ever.I suppose it’s obvious what we want: for the pair to keep their mouths shut. We would like them to act as if they were still working royals, but without the work. We want decorum, and dignity. We do not want them to do anything as vulgar as make money.This, I suppose, is the price of cutting royals loose: embarrassmentThe trouble is, we do not want to pay them, either. The couple need protection, and the public – justifiably – do not wish to foot the bill. As working royals, they received a taxpayer-funded sovereign grant, but we’ve cut them loose, as has King Charles, who no longer pays the rest of Harry’s income. That decision was cheered most heartily by the same corners of the media now slamming Meghan and Harry for their adventures in the private sector. Let them make their own money! No, not like that!But what else are they supposed to do? A childhood in “the firm” doesn’t exactly set you up for an ordinary job: Harry managed in the army, but this particular career was always going to end prematurely as his status put his fellow soldiers at risk. His wife could go back to acting, perhaps – buttheir security billalone is said to run to £1.5m a year. TV companies were willing to spray them with cash for the price of some light self promotion: they signed a £78m multi-year deal with Netflix in 2020. Wouldn’t you take it?But then the charges laid at their door have always been confusing, to say the least. A chief criticism seems to be that they are using their proximity to the throne to make money. Well, yes. That particular grift must date back to the birth of the monarchy. It also precisely describes the industry – authors, reporters, TV crews – making these accusations in the first place. Not to mention British tourism. Why shouldn’t money be made off the royals? Isn’t that how we justify their existence these days?Another is that the TV industry is a tawdry and shaming way to make a living. We tend to draw a tender veil, here, over the various ways in which the monarchy has accumulated its wealth over the centuries: empire, slavery, killing rivals and pheasants. There are worse sins than presenting a badNetflixshow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We pick overWith Love, Meghanas if the pair were still subject to royal standards, courting popularity in the British press. But they aren’t. We hear over and over that the duchess isn’t “helping herself”. But she is. Last week the show hit Netflix’s top 10. It has just been renewed for a second season.This, I suppose, is the price of cutting royals loose: embarrassment. They are no longer answerable to us, no longer cowed by bad press. King Charles cannot pull them into line. And yet, somehow, they still represent the royal family. Charles has expressed a wish to “slim down” the monarchy, sending more royals off to seek their fortunes in the wide world.

Though I make absolutely zero claim on having any Mystic Meg capabilities,this time around it turned out that I had interviewed both Adrien Brody andMikey Madison, respective winners of this year’s best actor and actress, for theObserver.Asked whether they believed they were in with a chance they answered the only way an actor can in their situation: by not really answering the question at all.Madison notedthat her filmAnorawasn’t even out yet, so it was weird talking about awards. Brody,star ofThe Brutalist, mumbled: “If that day comes…”.The only actor I’ve spoken to who didn’t observe this protocol of humility and bashfulness was Adam Pearson, whomI interviewedlast October for his filmA Different Man. The buzz for his (excellent) performance was already ratcheting up and there was talk of a best supporting actor nod. Pearson, however, made no attempt to dampen the flames. “I want to go to the Oscars and clean up,” he told me. “I’ve already gone to Ikea, I’ve got the flat-pack shelves in the shed ready for it.”In the event, Pearson wasn’t nominated, which is a shame, because he’d have given one hell of a victory speech. Still, Ikea shelves always come in handy.Covid amnesiaHow are you going to mark – “celebrate” is definitely the wrong word – the fifth anniversary of the Covid pandemic?

Mostly, it seems, we choose not to look back on this bizarre and traumatic period; “collective amnesia” is often used to describe our response.I’ve found myself thinking about it at strange times recently: walking past a skate park that was packed in the balmy spring of 2020, but sits dormant and unloved now.I’m going to try to remember some of the positive aspects: those few months when we revered school teachers as we always should; the strange acts of kindness between neighbours, rather than pass-agg WhatsApp arguments over whether you should put CCTV on your street. And maybe at 8pm on the 23rd, I’ll quietly bang a pot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it revolutionised human connectionJohn NaughtonThe company that pioneered voice communication over the internet has withered to dust in Microsoft’s hands. Still, I for one am grateful for itSat 8 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 16.47 ESTShareSo Microsofthas decidedto terminate Skype, the internet telephony company it bought in 2011 for $8.5bn (£6.6bn). Its millions of hapless users are to be herded into Microsoft Teams, a virtual encampment with a brain-dead aesthetic that makes even Zoom look cool. This eventuality had been telegraphed for quite a while but, even so, it comes as a jolt because Skype was a remarkable venture, and its demise closes a chapter of an interesting strand of technological history.The internet has been around for much longer than most people realise. It goes back to the 1960s and the creation of Arpanet, a military computer network that emerged after the US had its “Sputnik moment” – the awful realisation that the Soviet Union seemed to be racing ahead in the technology stakes. The design of Arpanet’s successor, the internet we use today, started in the early 1970s and it was first switched on in January 1983.The designers of the network were, from the outset, determined to avoid the limitations of earlier communication systems, particularly the analogue telephone network, which was optimised for voice, hopeless for digital signals and owned by corporations which resisted innovations that they themselves had not originated. So the new network would not have an owner or be optimised for any particular medium, and would therefore be more permissive than any earlier network. Anyone could access it, and create services that ran upon it, so long as their computers conformed to the protocols of the network.The result was the explosion of creativity – good and bad – that we are still living with today. What the internet’s designers had built was what a scholar later called “an architecture for permissionless innovation”; or, put another way,a globalplatform for springing surprises.The world wide web, created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, was one of those surprises. But so too was something called VoIP (voice over internet protocol). Speech could be digitised (converted into ones and zeroes) and put into data packets which could be sent over the internet; and then, having reached their destination, converted back into audio. The result: free telephony to anywhere in the world!Skype was the first company to bring this magic to ordinary consumers. It was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis (a Dane) and Niklas Zennström (a Swede) and headquartered in Luxembourg; but the software that powered it was written by three Estonians who also wrote software for peer-to-peer file sharing. In 2005, eBay bought it for $2.6bn (£2bn). By 2006 it had 100m registered users and by 2009 was adding about 380,000 new users each day and generating around $740m (£575m) in annual revenue. So you could say thatSkypewas the first European company to reach US-level scale.I grew up in a time when a phone call from the US meant only one thing: a death in the family. If emigrants kept in touch with the folks back home, it was only by letterAt which point the inevitable happened: in 2011 Skype was bought byMicrosoftand absorbed into the maw of the tech colossus. Many observers, including this columnist, wondered what Microsoft thought it was doing with its new toy. Last week’s news suggests that the company never quite figured it out. And in any event, once the pandemic arrived in 2020 and people started working from home, it was clear that Microsoft would need to have something to ward off the threat posed by Zoom. Skype conceivably could have been at the core of its response, but instead the decision was made to put all the energy into making Teams the behemoth’s answer to remote working. From then on, Skype was surplus to requirements and the die was cast.Before it disappears, though, it’s worth remembering what an energising newcomer it was on the scene two decades ago. Most people nowadays have no idea how closed and depressing telephony was in the analogue era. It was an industry run either by complacent, unresponsive and domineering monopolies (AT&T in the US) or government agencies (the GPO in the UK). It could take months to get a telephone installed in your home. Phone calls were expensive and international calls positively prohibitive.I grew up in a country (Ireland) with a huge diaspora in a time when a phone call from the US meant only one thing: a death in the family. If emigrants kept in touch with the folks back home, it was only by letter and perhaps the odd parcel; never by phone. In rural Ireland, on the night before a son or a daughter departed for America or Australia, their family would sometimes hold a wake, because they assumed they would never hear their voices again.And now? The VoIP technology that Skype brought into people’s lives has been commoditised. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal offer unlimited – and free – audio (and video) connections with friends, families and colleagues all over the world. Phone calls that would once have bankrupted a family are made every day. Microsoft may not have found Skype useful in the end. But the rest of us certainly did.What I’ve been readingThree-market economyDave Karpf’ssharp essayidentifies the three types of money behind Silicon Valley’s power.Bringing back sovereigntyAninsightful editorialinNoemaby Nathan Gardels on why the current and 47th US president is behaving like the 25th.Fighting talkA seismic regulatory clash is in the offing, says David Allen Green’sprescient analysisin theFinancial Times.Explore more on these topicsSkypeThe networkerMicrosoftInternetZoomTelecomsComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve got some good news and some bad news to mark the occasion.The bad news is that alegally defined sexual predatoris leading the most powerful country on earth and we’re seeing aglobal backlashagainst women’s rights. “[I]nstead of mainstreaming equal rights, we are seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny,” the UNsecretary-general, António Guterres, said in his IWD message.The good news, for those of us in the US at least, is that the Democrats have a plan to deal with all this. Or rather, they have wardrobeconcepts of a plan. On Tuesday night, Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol. Some members from the Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC), including Nancy Pelosi, decided to protest by … wait for it … wearing pink.“Pink is a color of power and protest,” the New Mexico representative Teresa Leger Fernández, chair of the DWC,toldTime. “It’s time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear.”The pink outfits may have been loud but the message theDemocratswere sending was far from clear. They couldn’t even coordinate their colour-coordinating protest: some lawmakers turned up wearing pink while others wore blue and yellow to support Ukraine and others wore black because it was a somber occasion.Still, I’ll give the DWC their due: their embarrassing stunt seems to have garnered at least one – possibly two – fans. OneMSNBC columnist, for example, wrote that the “embrace of such a traditionally feminine color [pink] by women with considerable political power makes a stunning example of subversive dressing”.For the most part, however, the general reaction appears to have been that this was yet another stunning example of how spineless and performative the Democrats are. Forget bringing a knife to a gunfight – these people are bringing pink blazers to a fight for democracy. To be fair, there were a few other attempts at protest beyond a pink palette: the Texas representative Al Greenheckled the president(and was latercensuredby some of his colleagues for doing so) and a few Democrats left the room during Trump’s speech. Still, if this is the “opposition”, then we are all doomed.Not to mention: even the pink blazers seemed a little too extreme for certain factions of the Democratic party. House Democratic leadershipreportedly urgedmembers not to mount protests and to show restraint during Trump’s address. They also chose the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin to give the Democratic response to Trump’s speech. While Slotkin tends to be described as asensible centrist voiceby a lot of the media, she’s very Trump-adjacent. Slotkin is one of the Democratic senators who hasvoted with Trumpthe most often and, last June, was one of the 42 Democrats to vote with the GOP to sanction the international criminal court (ICC) over its seeking of arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israelileaders for destroying Gaza. Human rights advocacy groups have warned that attacking the ICC like this undermines international law and the ability to prosecute or prevent human rights violations across the world. It speaks volumes about the US media and political class that a senator standing against international law can be called a centrist.This whole episode also speaks volumes about the Democrats’ plan for the future: it’s growing increasingly clear that, instead of actually growing a spine and fighting to improve people’s lives, the Democratic party seems to think the smartest thing to do is quietly move to the right and do nothing while the Trump administrationimplodes. I won’t caution against this strategy myself. Instead, I’ll let Harry Truman do it. Back in 1952,Truman said: “The people don’t want a phony Democrat. If it’s a choice between a genuine Republican, and a Republican in Democratic clothing, the people will choose the genuine article, every time.”Anyway, the upshot of all of this is that the Democrats are not coming to save us. We must save ourselves. That means organizing within our local communities and learning lessons from activistsoutside our communities. It means being careful not to normalize creeping authoritarianism and it means recognizing the urgency of the moment. The warning signs are flashing red: we need to respond with a hell of a lot more than a pink wardrobe.Make atomic bombings straight again!DEI Derangement Syndrome has reached such a fever-pitch in the US that a picture of the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan has beenflagged for deletionat the Pentagon.

The key question now is what, in practical terms, Europe and Britain can and will do to meet this challenge. Is this Europe’s moment, when it finally comes of age as a global player? Or will the EU and its close neighbours collectively fail to rise to the occasion, condemning their citizens to an era of domination by bigger, rapacious and more determined powers?Donald Trump is in the process of attempting, rashly, to dothree extraordinary things. First, he is trying to force Ukraine, which has spent more than three years under murderous assault, to accept a “peace deal” on inimical terms dictated by himself and the aggressor, Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Second, in a stunning reversal of US policy, he is seeking a rapprochement with Moscow that includes re-establishing full political and diplomatic relations, lifting sanctions and launching joint economic partnerships. Third, he is telling Europeans they must henceforth defend themselves, that the US, in effect, is no longer a loyal, reliable partner or even necessarily a friend, and that Nato, for 76 years the solid bedrock of transatlantic security, is dispensable.European leaders, with some exceptions on the political fringes, are united in their alarm at all three of these unwise, irrational and dangerous interventions. At the same time, most accept that even if Trump vanished entirely – a desirable but unlikely eventuality – a change in the balance of US-Europe relations is inescapable and overdue. In a national address last week, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president,summed up the position well. “Europe’s future should not be decided in Washington or Moscow,” he said. “The war in Ukraine… continues with the same intensity [but] the US, our ally, has changed its position.” As a result, Europe was entering a new era of self-reliance.Nato is a crucial shield for Poland, as it is for the three neighbouring Baltic republics. Now its removal or weakening is threatenedAccused of appeasing Putin in 2022, Macron, like many others, has learned better since. Now he warns that Russian imperialist aggression “knows no borders”, directly threatening France and Europe. Macron is not just talk. He has shown imaginative leadership, producing a tentative plan for astaged ceasefirethat has Ukrainian support, lobbying, flattering and correcting Trump to his face in the Oval Office, and promoting an Anglo-French proposal to deploy a European “assurance force” in Ukraine composed of a so-called coalition of the willing.In a week that saw repeated recourse to another overused phrase – the need for Europe to “step up” – Germany surprised many with a positive leap into the future. A country that nurtures visceral horror of debt announced a spectacular U-turn of its own – the amending of its Basic Law to permit multibillion-euro investments in defence and national infrastructure. Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat who held off the far-right to win last month’s federal election, has a reputation as a deficit hawk and fiscal conservative.Not any more. And he has gone further even than Macron inurging Europe’s “independence”from the US and vowing ongoing, expanded military aid for Kyiv. Other European leaders, notably Donald Tusk, have “stepped up” in commendable ways. Poland’s prime minister is in an unenviable position. A strong believer in the transatlantic alliance, he, like so many others, must now feel utterlybetrayed by Trump.Nato is a crucial shield for Poland, as it is for the three neighbouring Baltic republics. Now its removal or weakening is threatened.Keir Starmer also recognises the historic nature of this moment, and has risen to meet it. He has worked assiduously and carefully to restrain Trump’s worst instincts. His evident contempt, displayed in the Commons last week, for the ignorant comments of US vice-president JD Vance about “random countries” showed he is not afraid to push back, too. Starmer’s collaboration with EU leaders is a very welcome post-Brexit development that should be extended beyond defence and security. Yet like them, the UK faces daunting hurdles. Although they now recognise the necessity, their shared, chronic dependence on the US will behard to break.These challenges – on reducing Europe’s reliance on America, boosting its defences and maintaining support for Ukraine – were the focus of last week’s emergency EU summit. As is often the case in Brussels, the results were mixed. New overall defence spending of€800bn (£670bn) was agreed. But whether it ever materialises will depend on national governments’ willingness to borrow. The usual divisions were apparent; Hungary blocked a joint statement on Ukraine. Within Nato, most member states, like Britain, are now committing to higher spending. Non-EU countries, such asNorway, are piling in, too. Oslo is belatedly yet commendably doubling its aid to Kyiv.Europe is stepping up. In time, if it perseveres and its leaders keep their promises, it will be better able to deter Russia alone – and survive in a reordered, more hostile world. But how effective Europe can be in rescuing Ukraine in the short term from a developing Trump-Putin axis is in serious doubt. Trump still refuses to provide Kyiv with meaningful postwar security guarantees. His suspension of military aid and mapping and intelligence assistance is encouraging Russia to intensify attacks. More civilians are dying each day because of Trump’s treachery. Each day, Ukraine is further brutalised and degraded. A just peace looks further away than ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the losses he found near the overland track, an alpine walking trail through central Tasmania, were groves of pencil pine.“We saw a couple of stands that were quite severely burned,” saysLeonard, from the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service. “Others where the fires had taken out single trees.” This wizard-bearded scientist spoke the fears of many: that tree-by-tree natural antiquity is being consumed.Only found in Tasmania, pencil pine dates back to the late Jurassic, 140 million years ago. It is from the smallAthrotaxisgenus, with King Billy pine and a third species that crosses between them called the Lax-leaf. If allowed, these trees can live a thousand years.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsUnlike eucalypts, they are hypersensitive to fire; if burned around the trunk, they die. And Tasmania is in a new age of fire.Pencil pine has an absorbingly varied character which reflects its landscape, shaped by wind, ice and snow. The bark is soft and yielding, its waxy leaves kind to running fingers.I have seen it outlined at sundown, making a trail along a watercourse like a clan on a centuries-long journey. Marvelled on a mountain plateau where the trees’ windward stems have been ice-stripped of bark, yet shelter stems of new life. And I’ve been held spellbound on a glacial shelf where a pine crawls up a boulder, live branchlets rising barely a hand’s breadth above the rock.View image in fullscreen‘Pine of Olympus’ at sundown at Lake Petrarch, Tasmania.Photograph: Andrew DarbyI have imagined pencil pines sculptural groves offering permanence through generations of Palawa who have lived on the island for thousands of years, the shelter across riskier altitudes they would have offered. After invasion it was regarded as so “remarkably handsome” that its first colonial name was pine of Olympus.Woodlands of pencil pine are now rare. The tree persists in rock-guarded fortresses like the walls of Jerusalem and the labyrinth; a reminder of what once stood before wide-scale burning. Mostly now pencil pines live as remnants, finding just enough nourishment to huddle in fireproof boulder fields or to edge wet shorelines.A century ago the poet Marie Pitt, who lived through bushfire on a mountain mining hamlet, wrote of people unleashing “A gallop of fire”:I loose the horses, the wild, red horsesI loose the horses, the mad, red horsesAnd terror is on the land.The burning was to clear Tasmanian land for access and prospecting, and later to encourage livestock grazing.Pitt’s words stand eerily today as a description of the red horses of global heating, which have brought lightning-started fires across whole Tasmanian landscapes in 2013, 2016, 2020, and now in 2025. These latest fires, now burning into a fifth week, are again exceeding our ability to protect these ancient trees.View image in fullscreenFire-damaged pencil pine near the Overland Track.Photograph: Ryan Nichols/Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife ServiceA tree like Huon pine, renowned for its long-lasting scented timber, can more often be found today confined to pockets of landscape that are less likely to burn: south-facing hillsides, for example, sheltered from the predominant northerly wind-blown fires.In his 21 February helicopter survey, Leonard flew west to the Harman River, where deep concern was held for a Huon pine stand that included a tree ring counted to 2,500 years of annual growth – not including its rotten centre, which might have held another 500 rings. Fire had burned to the edges of this stand in a steep river valley.“It’s a tall, single stem tree. It sticks up out of the canopy in the rainforest. It’s a really nice looking tree. It was unharmed.” Other, big, Huon further downriver did burn, leaving a ghastly catalogue for Rob Blakers, a nature photographer, to record.Touchstones from the deep past such as the Huon and pencil pines give each of us pause to contemplate our own temporary existence. I was drawn to these trees during my recovery from stage 4 metastatic lung cancer, our joint struggles for life an inspiration to me.I have the medical breakthrough of immunotherapy to thank for my second life. Surely human ingenuity can be turned to protect this rich heritage of trees too.On the afternoon of 3 February, 1,227 lightning strikes hit the ground in a sweep across the island. Nineteen fires lit up within hours in the north-west but one in the south of the state didn’t. It stayed smouldering near Mount Picton for a few days, then burst into flame.Within minutes its smoke was reported by a remote AI-trained camera set on a nearby mountaintop; a little swarm of Fire Boss water bombers flew out to it and began dumping. Helicopters followed and winched down remote area firefighters. Together they stopped the burn at a few hectares.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Allen & UnwinBut this is just a hopeful sign. The 2025 fires have left a patchwork of burnt ground across 98,500 hectares of wild country.Richard Dakin, the deputy incident controller with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, says the fire which took out the pencil pine near the overland track was nearly held back by Fire Bosses – fire fighting float planes –skimming water out of nearby Lake St Clair. Lakes and coastal bays are on the side of the ancients.But Tasmania is an island in the southern ocean. Strong winds and cloud are usual, and the skimmers could not hold the fire’s perimeter.Instead, the fire headed north toward more rich flora, including a very old King Billy pine forest and – in the distance – Cradle Mountain itself. “We had to throw everything at it,” Dakin sais.NSW fire service large air tankers dropped a 2.5km fire-retardant line; water bombers campaigned from the lakes; and remote firefighters worked at arduous, grimy “old-school” firefighting, flailing and digging at the perimeter. “The combination of the three led to success,” Dakin says.Their campaign rolls on, the full losses of the ancients yet to be tallied. But already we know for certain that after millions of years on Earth, and living only in Tasmania, these trees will need our help if they are to have a place in a heated future.Andrew Darby is the author ofThe Ancients, published by Allen & Unwin and available nowExplore more on these topicsAustralian booksTrees and forestsTasmaniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the sleeping heart of the global financial system, they felt eyes on them from the city’s network of surveillance cameras, but hoped their disguise of high-vis vests and hoods hiding their faces would conceal them.Reaching Lime Street, they stopped by a maintenance hole and looked around to make sure no one was watching. One took off the cover, located a bundle of black cables and started hacking away. Hours later, an email was circulated to news desks: “Internet cut off to hundreds of insurersin climate-motivated sabotage.”What is this era of calamity we’re in? Some say ‘polycrisis’ captures itRead moreFive years ago, climate activists fromExtinction Rebellion(XR) and the school strikes movement believed getting huge numbers of people on the streets could persuade the powerful to change course on the climate crisis. Then protesters from groups such as Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil (JSO) put their bodies and freedom on the line to disrupt business as usual, in an effort to concentrate minds.Now, with climate breakdown worsening and fossil fuel emissions showing no signs of peaking, let alone abating, some say it is time to escalate the campaign of disruption, by carrying out clandestine acts of sabotage against the corporations they see as responsible for the destruction of the climate.In a manifesto published on the WordPress blogging platform, Shut the System (STS), the group that claimed credit for the action in the City that took place in January, says it is “kickstart[ing] a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors in the fossil fuel economy”.“We vow to wage a campaign of sabotage targeting the tools, property and machinery of those most responsible for global warming, escalating until they accept our demands for an end to all support for fossil fuel expansion.”The Guardian spoke over the Signal encrypted messaging service to an activist from STS. He did not reveal his identity and the Guardian was unable to verify his claims.He said new laws further criminalising disruptive protests had made traditional, accountable methods of activism increasingly unsustainable, and a clandestine approach increasingly attractive. He pointed to the case ofactivists from JSO who received sentencesof four and five years – reduced on Friday after an appeal– for organising road blocks on the M25.“If you want to do anything that is disruptive, the penalty is pretty massive now, and so these draconian laws mean it is hard to get very much pressure … by following the kind of things that [Extinction Rebellion] and JSO have done in the past, because people will be arrested and put away for a long time,” he said.“You can’t just keep doing that … The actual number of people who are committed to risk jail time to do this are pretty small in number.”STS is not the first group to take clandestine direct action against fossil fuel targets. In 2022, unknown activists targeted a pipeline being built to funnel jet fuel from Southampton to west London, cutting holes in the pipe and severing hydraulic cables on a construction vehicle.This month, another group claimed responsibility for drilling holes in the tyres of more than 100 SUVs parked at Land Rover dealerships in Cornwall – a repeat of an action carried out last year. And the Tyre Extinguishers, a campaign group that urges people to take autonomous clandestine action againstSUVs in cities by deflating their tyres, have targeted hundreds of vehicles through activists heeding their call.In the City, the action of STS, though carefully planned, had minimal impact. “We did our research, as best as we could and we planned about what sort of cables to be looking for, how they might be laid out, and we taught ourselves about opening up these manholes,” the activist said.“We did everything we could to maximise safety for everyone, and then in my small group we found targets and divvied them up.”A cybersecurity expert said there had been “significant slowdown of internet speed” in the area, but the network continued to function.“We had varying success throughout the UK,” the activist admitted. STS also claimed actions in Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds. “I am aware of people in other areas that did this … where they then called up the next day and the phone lines were down. There is obviously a learning curve to these things.”But actions such as this pale in comparison with the scale of those taken by climate activists abroad. In Germany, activists last year staged attacks against gas pipelines, while others escalated a campaign against concrete with two arson attacks on a Cemex plant in Berlin.But it is in France that the tactic has been most widely used, with actions ranging from activists filling the holes in golf courses with cement to a full-scale riot when a crowd descended onthe construction site of an agricultural reservoirin the country’s drought-stricken south, intent on dismantling it.8:36Are French protesters more effective? Meet the ‘next level’ climate activists – videoAndreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University, said: “France really is the one case in recent years … where you’ve had a radical mass movement that has actually been quite successful – and this is the only movement that has also deployed sabotage consistently as a tactic.”Four years ago Malm, a Swedish social ecologist, penned How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a polemic on the future of effective climate action and an exploration of the tactic of sabotage. It has become a set text in the movement, and even spawned amovie adaptation.Malm says that, with issues such as Israel’s wanton destruction of Gaza taking up activist energy, and the energy crisis precipitated by Russia’s war in Ukraine potentially discrediting those targeting fossil fuels as “stooges of Putin”, militant action for the climate has been on a downswing.Nevertheless, he still sees it as the only sustainable route for climate activists increasingly facing a severe pushback against non-violent disruptive protest.“One mistake made by the offshoots of XR [such as Just Stop Oil] – they started escalating a little bit and doing slightly more radical stuff … while still sticking to the protocol to wait until the cops come and arrest them,” he said.“If you want to actually escalate and do real material damage to fossil fuel property you cannot stick to this idea. You have to do this without offering yourself as a kind of virtue sacrifice.”The STS activist who spoke to the Guardian did not see the group’s actions as more extreme than the kinds of things already carried out by other groups. “The only difference is that they stayed around to be arrested,” he said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisJust Stop OilExtinction RebellionActivismProtestLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not a very pleasant feeling, to be entirely honest …‘Nigel Farage feels real’: why young British men are drawn to ReformRead more“Does requesting regular meetings of MPs make me a monster? Is asking to even just see policy before it’s made public unreasonable? Is it fair to be insulted because I want people to finally talk to each other?“I have torn out what remaining hair I have left over the last few months trying to talk. That’s it. Just talk. I have tried, and tried, and tried to resolve all of this behind closed doors. I can only smash my head against a brick wall for so long.”He also asked Farage to “resolve this in a manner that our members and the country would expect”.“I am going to now repeat publicly an invitation that I have extended toNigel Faragein private multiple times over many months,” Lowe said.“Every offer has been refused or ignored. Please, let’s have dinner and resolve this in a manner that our members and the country would expect.”A Reform statement released on Friday afternoon accused Lowe of having “on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence” to Yusuf.Reform also said it had received allegations from two separate staffers about “serious bullying” and “derogatory” remarks made about women in Lowe’s parliamentary and constituency offices.Lowe denied the claims, describing them as “vexatious” and said the complaint to police “obviously went in just after I asked reasonable questions of Reform’s leadership”.On Friday, Lowe said the timing of the complaint was a “malicious attempt to drag my name through the mud”.“A complete inability to accept even the most mild constructive criticism without such a malicious reaction is not effective leadership,” he said.Reform confirmed that Lowe had lost the whip.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said on Friday: “On Thursday, 6 March, we received an allegation of verbal threats made by a 67-year-old man on Friday 13 December.“Officers are carrying out an assessment of the allegations to determine what further action may be required.”The involvement of the police comes after internal fractures in the party, which has five MPs, opened up on Thursday as Lowe complained to the Daily Mail that Reform remained a “protest party led by the Messiah” under Farage.Asked whether the Reform leader had the potential to become prime minister, Lowe said: “It’s too early to know whether Nigel will deliver the goods. He can only deliver if he surrounds himself with the right people.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

They are used to house homeless individuals and families, either temporarily in emergency accommodation or permanently in privately rented homes.Most of the homes are in deprived areas in the south-east and east of England that are already under huge pressures due to homelessness among their own residents. But in the past year London councils have looked farther afield, buying up a small number of properties in the Midlands and laying out plans to buy more in north-east England.Housing charities said families’ lives were thrown into “turmoil” by being moved away from their communities. Labour MPs urged the government to reconsider its approach to the “scarring” out-of-area placements, which are at their highest levels since records began.Waltham Forest and Bromley councils, via companies they jointly own with the housing and social care company Mears Group, have collectively spent almost £80m buying more than 500 homes in areas including Harlow and Thurrock inEssexand Maidstone in Kent since 2017. Both councils use these properties to discharge their homelessness duties and permanently rehouse people out of London.Brent council has spent more than £18m buying 75 properties across Milton Keynes, Hemel Hempstead and Slough, while Barnet council has spent more than £10m buying nearly 70 properties in Peterborough and Luton. Brent and Barnet used companies they wholly owned to make these purchases since 2017.Housing Gateway, a company wholly owned by Enfield council, spent £13m in 2018 buying Greenway House, a converted office block on the outskirts of Harlow with 83 flats that are used as temporary accommodation.The Guardian previouslyrevealedthat councils had paid millions to relocation companies to help them permanently move homeless people to the Midlands and north of England. Recent property purchases suggest that some London councils are starting to move the practice in-house.In December, Enfield council laid out plans to buy 28 homes through Housing Gateway around Liverpool this year. It said these properties would initially be used as temporary accommodation with the aim of finding homeless households long-term housing in the area once relocated.View image in fullscreenProperties have been bought in Maidstone in Kent to rehouse people out of London.Photograph: Air Video UK/AlamyRedbridge council, which has spent more than £10m buying 55 properties outside the capital since 2020, has bought homes 100 miles away in Coventry and Leicester in the past year. They are being used as temporary accommodation but the council said it planned to privately discharge homeless households into these homes.Harlow is the most popular local authority for London councils to buy homes in, with 164 properties acquired there since 2017.Many of the homes bought are concentrated in areas where hundreds of households are already homeless. Eighty-four homes owned by London councils are in Basildon in Essex, where nearly 700 households are living in emergency accommodation.Basildon council’s leader, Gavin Callaghan, has previously said his authority had no choice but to find local people new homes in the north of England because its own housing stock was being used by London councils.MPs have been increasingly vocal about out-of-area placements. Government data shows the number of households placed in temporary accommodation outsidetheir borough is at an all-time high, with a 39% rise in such placements in the past 12 months.Florence Eshalomi, a Labour MP who is the chair of the housing, communities and local government parliamentary committee, said: “Out-of-area placements force some of our most vulnerable families away from desperately needed support and devastate the life chances of children, who end up travelling for hours simply to go to school.“This is the result of the toxic mix of the housing crisis and the stretching of local council finances to breaking point. The government’s long-term housing strategy must give local authorities the support and supply to ensure everyone has access to the right housing and support in their own community.”Naushabah Khan, the Labour MP for Gillingham and Rainham, who also sits on the housing committee, said: “The negative impact of out-of-borough placements is the scarring legacy of a deeply damaged housing market that was neglected under 14 years of a Conservative government. As local councils struggle with an ongoing housing crisis, this last-resort practice has become the norm.”Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: “On top of the trauma of becoming homeless, families’ lives are being thrown into further turmoil by being moved miles away from their communities, often overnight. Councils are meant to accommodate families who become homeless in their own area, but a dire shortage of social homes, extortionate private rents, and record homelessness is making this increasingly difficult.“Instead of sinking money into temporary solutions, we need to see social homes built in areas where they are most needed.”Waltham Forest council said the purpose of its housing company was to provide long-term good-quality homes to discharge the council’s homelessness duties and move households on from temporary accommodation. It said loans used to buy these homes were taken out by the company itself, not the council, and they did not appear on council balance sheets.Bromley council said its policy was to secure housing in or as near to Bromley as possible but, as it receives lower funding as an outer London borough, many local homes were unaffordable, forcing it to look farther afield. It said its housing companies were primarily partner-funded.Barnet council said when it placed people in temporary accommodation it ensured it was in or as close as possible to the borough. It said neither the council nor any of its subsidiaries had bought homes outside the borough since 2020.Redbridge council said all properties it had acquired were being used as temporary accommodation but it aimed to use these homes to provide longer-term settled tenancies by discharging its homelessness duty through a housing company.Brent council said the vast majority of homes bought via its housing company were in London and it was working to build council housing to deal with the 34,000 people on its housing waiting list. It added that none had been bought outside London since 2021.Explore more on these topicsHousingHomelessnessLondonLocal governmentSocial housingCommunitiesPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

It shows documents classified as top secret are housed at the MoD’s sensitive archive, whose location is redacted, while about 20m more routine documents are stored at Swadlincote in Derbyshire.Government documents of historical importance should be released for public consumption after 20 years under the Public Records Act. But there are many reasons listed why that might not happen, and they may never be transferred to theNational Archivesat Kew, south-west London, or opened up for use by historians, journalists and other researchers.The 144-page blue guide says files dealing with recruitment of Gurkha soldiers from Nepal and anything about Gulf Arab ruling families are sensitive, for example. Reports of UFOs should be considered for retention, even though theMoD shut its UFO desk in 2009.In a section on the monarchy, the guide says records on financial arrangements and other personal matters affecting the royal family should always be referred for vetting by sensitivity reviewers. They might require extended closure, it says, along with “any action, or communication, by a member of the royal family which might be considered unconstitutional, eg expressions or indications of personal views which criticise or conflict with government policy”.The guide also states that other forms of correspondence between the government and the royals might not be suitable for disclosure, including “trivial” matters that might not meet a public interest test.The guide was obtained by the author Andrew Lownie, who has spent the past four yearsresearching a biography of Prince Andrewand trying in vain to obtain records of his official duties and overseas visits as a trade and investment envoy for the UK government for 10 years.The MoD guide says records of royal visits should normally be saved, even though the Foreign Office and the Department for Business and Trade have both claimed to have no records relating to many of the Duke of York’s overseas trips, on which he is alleged to have combined his official role with private meetings for himself and his friends.Lownie, who is appealing against the Cabinet Office and Foreign Office’s refusal to disclose their versions of the MoD guide for sensitivity reviewers, described the guide as a manual for a “secret state” and a holy grail for historians frustrated by Whitehall. “It gives us an insight into how our history is suppressed,” he said.The MoD said last week, in a written parliamentary answer to aquestion from the Labour peer Lord Foulkes, that it had been unable to find any records of the Duke of York receiving defence briefings during his time as a trade envoy. Lownie said he was sceptical of this claim.Tim Tate, an author who has been trying since 2019 to obtain Cabinet Office files on thecrisis in governmentover the 1987 publication ofSpycatcher, the banned autobiography of the former MI5 officer Peter Wright, said Whitehall officials’ refusal to disclose documents as required under the law was a scandal. “They lie, they cheat, they fail to meet deadlines. They obfuscate every time,” he said.Tate urged MPs to show more interest in official secrecy and the government to bring in a new FoI Act, reducing the number of loopholes and exemptions now routinely used by civil servants.It was Tony Blair’s original FoI Act in 2000 that, paradoxically, started a growing clampdown on disclosure of historical documents, according to Prof Philip Murphy, director of history and policy at the Institute of Historical Research.He urged a return to a more informal open government initiative launched by John Major’s administration in 1993, which he argues was more liberal. “I think there’s always a balance involved in the release of documents,” Murphy said.An MoD spokesperson said: “We are committed to being open and transparent and take our obligations under the FoI Act very seriously.“All requests are handled on a case-by-case basis, and where sensitive information is identified as in scope of a request, the appropriate exemptions are applied.“Any requester has a right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with a response under the FoI Act, and the rights to appeal are provided in the response.”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of informationThe ObserverMinistry of DefenceNational ArchivesnewsShareReuse this content"

I have said it multiple times: I think it is horrifying what is happening,” saysMartha Lane Fox.For the British peer and ex-Twitter board member, the sight of Musk holding forth from the bully pulpit of Donald Trump’s White House shows theSilicon Valleydream has gone sour.“The richest man in the world, who can stand there alongside the president, and kind ofcarte blanchemake jokes about how he’s carving up people’s jobs in the government. Then he can be there with achainsaw laughing on stage…“It is really, really alarming, and I find it extremely unpleasant at a values-based level – but also, just how can we be watching this in plain sight? It makes me feel very anxious. I think it is gross.”In an interview with theObserverto mark International Women’s Day, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned the diversity pushback orchestrated by Trump and his tech bro acolytes will not only damage society, but also the economy at large.What Musk is doing is really alarming. How can we all be watching this in plain sight? I think it is grossSince his return to the White House, the US president hasshut down all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,while Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is ripping up funding schemes.Some of the world’s biggest companies are following suit. Amid a wider pushback against everything from environmental targets to sustainable development, among themost prominenttaking part are US finance and tech companies, including Goldman Sachs, Accenture and Amazon, whileUK businesses such as GSK have also fallen in line.“He needs to be contained,” Lady Lane Fox says of Musk’s role in the rollback. “I find it extraordinary that the richest man in the world is trampling all over these things and that we still have kind of fanboying from the tech sector. It’s already been corrosive for society, and I would argue it is going to continue to be.”For businesses, she says the bottom line is that companies that take diversity seriously appeal to the widest possible employee talent pool and are better placed to target a broad range of customers. This, she adds, is about profit as much as social justice. However, she has a broader concern about the future.“The first thing, it’s financial. But the second thing, it’s about power and money – like everything, right?“If you’re looking at a sector like the digital sector, where there’s the growth in jobs, growth in opportunity – it is the growth sector in the economy. Yet you are not including a whole bunch of people in that. Then you are going to be creating inequality. Full stop. So it’s financial and it’s a question of social justice.”Given the close ties between Britain and the US, there is a view that where corporate America treads, the UK naturally follows. But there are signs that some UK businesses – and even the British operations of some US companies – are prepared to stand apart.The accountancy firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government toremove pronouns from their emails, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme. But its UK boss told staff its British operations remained “committed to [its] diversity goals”.“It feels as though global companies rooted in the US are making a politically motivated slight shift in emphasis and tilt, through to rowing back everything. And it does feel a bit more tempered here,” says Lane Fox.UK businesses have an opportunity to do something different, she says, which could bring financial benefits. “I think we’ll build more robust companies, attract talent and have a much better shot at building the most resilient companies of the future.”For almost three decades, Lane Fox has built a career – and multimillion-pound fortune – in tech. She made her first big moneyfloating Lastminute.com, the online travel site co-founded alongside fellow Oxford graduate Brent Hoberman in 1998.View image in fullscreenElon Musk holds court with his son X in the White House’s Oval Office in February.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockShejoined the board of Twitter– now X – in 2016, landing herself a huge payday in Musk’s$44bn hostile takeoverin 2022, before he dissolved the board and appointed himself the sole director.Seeing Musk in the Oval Office,parading his son X on his shoulders, made her question the gender divide. “Can you imagine if that was a woman? Can you imagine what that would look like? I mean, I just think the whole thing is really gross.”Trump signs executive order expanding power of Elon Musk’s Doge agencyRead moreBut while railing against Musk in a personal capacity, the BCC president does not suggest this approach is for everyone. “It is really tricky to navigate. You have a responsibility to your customers and your employees that might be different to our personal view sometimes.”Government regulation to enshrine diversity targets is also a bad idea, she says, preferring instead that companies report their progress. “Keeping it in the light, keeping up the reporting, is important – keeping up good investors, looking at the right metrics and investing in the right companies all helps.”However, not enough progress is being made. Analysis this week showed that worsening unemployment and workforce participation for women haspushed the UK behind Canadato its lowest global ranking for workplace equality among large economies in a decade.The gender pay gap has been declining slowly over time, butaverage pay is still 7% lessfor women than for men. It is a challenge Lane Fox is all too aware of. “Look at the data and it is really freaking depressing – and it is not moving,” she says.“What worries me is that it’s far too easy to find numbers that I thought we were moving on from.“In this week of International Women’s Day, we see representation at the executive level has gone back. I see progress on boards is still good at the FTSE 100 level, but bad at FTSE 250 and 350 level.“I know there will be people in the sector thinking: ‘Oh, here she goes again.’ That’s true of many women [that people think that]. But it is so important to keep making these arguments.”Explore more on these topicsMartha Lane FoxThe ObserverInvestingInternational Women's DayElon MuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpSilicon ValleyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

After they publicly challenged the university on their lack of employment rights, Oxford wrote to the Society of Authors in April 2022, agreeing to offer the two academics more appropriate contracts.But the promised contracts never materialised – and the pair were eventually told their old contracts would not be renewed. “They didn’t even have to sack us, because we had no employment rights,” Jolly said.Last January, after a protracted legal fight in which Jolly says the university’s top legal team tried to “rip [them] to shreds”,a judge ruled in their favour, arguing that they should be classed as employees. It was seen as a pivotal moment for the ­thousands of staff who teach at Oxford and other universities on precarious contracts.But this week Jolly told theObservershe now had no hope that Oxford had learned anything at all from the case.View image in fullscreenAlice Jolly says she fears Oxford has learned nothing from a court ruling over her zero hours contract.Photograph: Alexander Caminada“I have lost my work, been ostracised by colleagues and had no settlement from the university, no apology, no admission that the judgment has any effect on anyone else – although of course it does,” she said.She added: “Universities tend to always ask for NDAs in these employment cases, but I will be resisting that because I do not see why a settlement should be dependent on my silence.”TheObserverrevealed last yearthat two-thirds of core tutorial teaching at Oxford is done by academics on what the University and College Union calls “Deliveroo-style” hourly-paid roles or precarious fixed-term contracts.Jolly said she initially thought that the “sham contracts” she and Abrams had were unusual. “But we talked to young academics and realised no one could get a mortgage and people were stuck in this totally insecure situation for years.” It was an “open secret” the two women decided they had an obligation to expose.After their court victory, Law for Change, the charitable litigation fund which supported the pair, said the case would secure better contract rights for lecturers at Oxford, but also help others working on “exploitative contracts” right across academia.Yet although Jolly is fiercely proud of what they achieved against such a powerful and renowned university, she is now doubtful about whether other Oxford academics will have the money, or the courage, to follow their lead.The hearing was “a very hard three days”, in which both women spent more than three hours being interrogated “by a very expensive legal team” on the witness stand. “They compared our work to bedroom fitters, security guards and cleaners, and I kept thinking: ‘Yes, and all those people have no chance of fighting the gig economy, but we do.’”She and Abrams attended one hearing without lawyers. “We are tough people, but we were ripped to shreds,” she said. “I held it together in there, but when I got out of the courtroom. I wept.“Even if you’re very good ­amateurs you wouldn’t have a hope without serious legal representation,” she added. “And how much has Oxford spent trying to deny us our legal rights?”Jolly is due to appear in court again in July, in a six-day remedy hearing in which the university will be compelled to pay compensation.Prof Wyn Evans, professor of astrophysics at Cambridge University and leader of the 21 Group, which campaigns against bullying in academia and supports academics taking their universities to tribunal, said: “It takes a particular courage and stamina to do what these two academics did. Unfortunately, I think Oxford will ensure it hasn’t set a precedent.”Since last September, universities have been banned from using NDAs to cover up sexual harassment cases. However, the 21 Group is campaigning for universities to be banned from using them to hush up employment disputes too.Evans said: “Millions of pounds of public money is being spent on hushing up cases, when instead universities should be learning from their mistakes and improving how they treat staff.”Zelda Perkins, thefirst woman to break an NDAand founder of the group Can’t Buy My Silence, said: “What Alice and Rebecca did could be massively groundbreaking and change universities’ ability to exploit their staff. I can see why Oxford would want to keep them quiet.”An Oxford University spokesperson said: “The university has no comment on the ongoing litigation at this stage.“The academic quality of an Oxford education is extremely high, with the university rated first for teaching in the most recent UK national student survey results. We recognise that this is based on our committed academics and staff at all levels. We are determined that they are all rewarded and supported appropriately.“The Department for Continuing Education has completed, and is in the process of implementing, a review of its ways of working. Following a comprehensive consultation, some tutors have indicated a preference for flexible engagement and others, with whom the department is having detailed discussions, for permanent contracts of employment.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of OxfordThe ObserverZero-hours contractsHigher educationAcademicsGig economyUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Muslims were the most targeted group (38% of police-recorded ­religious hate crimes), followed by Jews (33%).Several recent far-right terror plots have targeted Muslims, and on Thursday a court heard that an alleged neo-Nazi terror cell had been planning attacks on mosques and synagogues in north-west England, and that one of its members discussed torturing an imam.View image in fullscreenFiyaz Mughal, the founder of Tell Mama, said anti-Muslim rhetoric had become mainstream.Photograph: Graham Turner/The ObserverFiyaz Mughal, the founder ofTell Mama, said its resources were being cut while “the far right and ­populists across Europe are growing significantly”. He said: “There are going to be more individuals targeted, we know that in the current environment, and where are they going to go? This is an injustice at a time where I have never seen anti-Muslim rhetoric become so mainstream.”Mughal said Tell Mama’s reporting service was a point of contact for vulnerable victims who do not feel able to go to the police, and also researched emerging threats to security and cohesion. “Labour talks a lot about countering Islamophobia but they are cutting the only project doing anything on a national scale – supporting victims, working with numerous police forces and supporting prosecutions,” he added. “I’m not aware of any other organisation that can do this work and even if a new agency tried, it would take them 10 to 15 years to reach where Tell Mama is.”He said the organisation was meant to “replicate and develop” the work done for Jewish communities by the Community Security Trust (CST), which runs an antisemitism reporting hotline, offers support and security advice and conducts research. The CST receives grants from the Home Office, rather than MHCLG, and its funding is not at risk, theObserverunderstands.Mughal accused the government of “saying one thing and doing another” after announcing a new working group on anti-Muslim hatred, chaired by the former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve.Last month the ministry said the working group would draw up a new definition of Islamophobia and “support a wider stream of work to tackle the unacceptable incidents of anti-Muslim hatred”.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said then: “The rise in anti-Muslim hate crime is ­unacceptable and has no place in our society. That’s why we’ve committed to defining anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia, as crucial steps forward in tackling it and creating a ­society where everyone feels safe and welcome.”The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said the Macpherson report after the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 showed many victims of hate crime do not report to police.“To address this under-reporting and to ensure that all victims receive the necessary support, we have established partnerships with trusted charities who can offer ‘third-party reporting’ options and serve as conduits to affected communities,” a spokesperson said.“In the wake of critical incidents in the UK and globally, including events of 7 October 2023, we have witnessed marked increases in hate crime and tensions. Tell Mama and similar organisations that support other communities have provided invaluable insights and reporting data. These contributions have allowed for the effective analysis of community tensions and informed actions to reduce such tensions.”Contacted by theObserver, the ministry did not answer questions about why Tell Mama’s funding was being withdrawn, or what alternative service would be funded. A spokesperson said: “Religious and racial hatred has absolutely no place in our society, and we will not tolerate Islamophobia in any form. This year we have made up to £1m of funding available to Tell Mama to provide support for victims of Islamophobia, and we will set out our approach to future funding in due course.”Explore more on these topicsIslamophobiaThe ObserverIslamReligionAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

While trailers remain central to the experience, ads have become a larger portion of the run time,” said Jon Evans, the chief customer officer at the advertising agency System1.Warning: if your name is David, you won’t survive a horror movieRead moreAds for brands or products typically take up 10-15 minutes of the pre-show segment, with trailers occupying about five to 10 minutes, according to the company, which specialises in market research.One filmgoer in India successfullysued a cinema chainfor “wasting his time” and for the “mental agony” caused by lengthy pre-film advertisements.There is no legal limit on the amount of adverts a cinema can show on screens in the UK.While adverts and trailers in UK cinemas typically last about 20 to 30 minutes, the Prince Charles cinema in London bucks the trend by limiting the pre-film reel to 10-12 minutes.The co-owner of the independent West End cinema, Gregory Lynn, said lengthy ads could not only hamper a viewer’s experience, but prevent people from going to the cinema in the evening because a film might end too late.“I took [my] wife and we went to see Bridget Jones’s Diary last week. We sat there for 29 minutes before the film started, watching absolute nonsense,” Lynn said. “There must have been over 15 or 16 minutes of adverts, and then 13 minutes of trailers. Just too much, if you ask me, it’s just too much.”The cinema advertising company Pearl & Dean said while it had not increased the lengths of advertising reels in cinemas, there had been a trend towards longer individual adverts on the big screen.“Brands really want to take advantage of the undivided attention, the captive audience in a world where we’ve got constant bombardment and distraction.”Digital Cinema Media, which represents 80% of the UK cinema market, said the pre-show adverts have remained much the same length for the past 10 years.Karen Stacey, the CEO of Digital Cinema Media, said: “Across our estate, brand advertising in reel averages 11 minutes, a standard that’s remained unchanged for a decade, honouring long-term exhibitor agreements.“Trailer times are set by individual cinemas alongside film studios, with no significant shifts in time-lengths.“For 10 years, the pre-show experience has stayed consistent, giving cinemagoers a familiar, immersive lead-in to the film they’re about to see.”According to DCM cinema, adverts are more likely to capture attention compared with other media formats such as YouTube and television. The study found a30-second cinema advert is viewed for an average of 23.9 seconds, compared with 15.5 seconds for a TV advert of the same length.Damian Spandley, the managing director of programming at Curzon cinemas, said: “We are conscious that customers are here to watch the film, but people like to see trailers for upcoming releases and the reel is part of the pre-film ritual. It’s a moment for people to settle into their seats, but we don’t want to take liberties and distract from the enjoyment of the film.”Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

Britain had50 missiles left as of 2008after purchases from a US stockpile, according to research by the University of Bradford.“Britain likes to call its nuclear posture independent, but it, of course, is absolutely not,” said Hans Kristensen, who monitors the status of nuclear forces for the Federation of American Scientists, a US thinktank.“It may be that Britain can fire weapons independently of the US, but below that, the entire infrastructure covering missile compartments on submarines, the missiles themselves, all are supplied by the Americans.”Defence analysts are emphasising the need to plan for a scenario where a transatlantic relationship fractures to the extent that the US declines to give the UK missiles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You would very likely need to develop a whole second warhead. That would require everything from new assembly facilities and workforce planning, but it could be a worthwhile investment for Britain,” she said.“You could hope that France – the most obvious contender for Britain to work with – has a delivery vehicle similar to Trident that could easily be adapted, but it would require the French government and the French nuclear enterprise being willing to share those designs with the UK.”Other factors are also coming in to play, including an openness by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to talks on extending its nuclear umbrella over the rest of Europe, and comments by Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, that it could pay towards French and British nuclear costs.Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP on parliament’s defence committee and a former RAF officer, said it was “difficult to conceive” of the US not wanting to maintain its relationship with the UK, stressing that this had been strengthened by the Aukus alliance between Australia, Britain and the US.But he added: “We now also have to look at how we as Europeans ensure and guarantee our own safety and security. We’re showing leadership on this with the French, who are the most obvious partners for us.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsTridentDefence policyMilitaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That approach is likely to be a non-starter for mostDemocratswho have long insisted that defense and non-defense spending move in the same direction.Congress must act by midnight Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown.SpeakerMike Johnsonis teeing up the bill for a vote on Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to vote against it and risk a shutdown. He also is betting that Republicans can muscle the legislation through the House largely by themselves.Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That’s because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own.Crucially, the strategy has the backing of Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line.“All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,” Trumppostedon Truth Social on Saturday.House Republicans’ leadership staff outlined the measure Saturday, saying it would allow for about $892.5bn in defense spending and about $708bn in non-defense spending. The defense spending is slightly above the prior year’s level, but the non-defense comes in at about 8% below.The leadership aides said the deal does not include various side agreements designed to cushion non-defense programs from spending cuts. Those side agreements had been part of negotiations by Joe Biden, a Democrat, and then speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, when they were in office. The negotiations had allowed for a debt-ceiling extension in return for spending restraints. Under terms of that agreement, defense and non-defense spending had both been set to increase 1% this year.The measure will not include funding requested by individual lawmakers for thousands of community projects around the country, often referred to as earmarks.The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including programs such as social security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs are on autopilot and not regularly reviewed by Congress.The Republican representative Ralph Norman said he had never voted for a continuing resolution – what lawmakers often call a CR – but that he is on board with Johnson’s effort. He said he has confidence in Trump and the so-called “department of government efficiency”, led by Elon Musk, to make a difference on the nation’s debt.“I don’t like CRs,” Norman said. “But what’s the alternative? Negotiate with Democrats? No.”“I freeze spending for six month to go identify more cuts? Somebody tell me how that’s not a win in Washington,” added the Republican representative Chip Roy, another lawmaker who has often frequently voted against spending bills but supports the six-month continuing resolution.Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year’s spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term and raising the nation’s debt limit to avoid a catastrophic federal default.Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending.“We cannot stand by and accept a yearlong power-grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on and agencies that keep our communities safe,” said the Washington senator Patty Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee.The Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But leaders also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution.“We have to wait to see what their plan is,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “We’ve always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.”Trump has been meeting with House Republicans in an effort to win their votes on the legislation. Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster. And that’s assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesRepublicansDemocratsUS CongressMike JohnsonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A decision by the US district judge Shelly Dick could could come by the end of the weekend.Hoffman has proposed using a drug mixture similar to those used in assisted suicides, butstate attorneys have said those drugs are unavailablefor executions. His attorneys have also argued that the method, which requires an industrial, full-face mask, would worsen Hoffman’s diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia, and cause severe mental distress.The move comes amid an intense debate about the role of the death penalty in the US and methods of execution. On Friday, South Carolina used a firing squad to kill a death row prisoner after the condemned man elected that method over the use of drugs.Hoffman is scheduled for execution on 18 March at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Louisiana adopted its nitrogen hypoxia execution plan just last month, and Hoffman would be the first to die under the new protocol.Hoffman was convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering a New Orleans advertising account executive, Mary “Molly” Elliot, in 1996. Her body was found in a wilderness area near the Pearl River in eastern St Tammany parish. Elliot was 28 years old.The Louisiana attorney general, Liz Murrill, has defended the state’s decision to use nitrogen hypoxia.“On March 18, 2025, the State of Louisiana will execute Hoffman by nitrogen hypoxia for Molly’s murder. We have and will continue to vigorously defend the State’s obligation to carry out this sentence and bring justice to the family and friends of Molly Elliot,” Murrill said in astatement.Louisiana scheduled two executions on consecutive days in March, but Christopher Sepulvado, who was scheduled to be executed one day before Hoffman, died of an illness on 23 February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The collected soundbites from his speeches and writings have become known the world over as theLittle Red Book.But the red-coveredQuotationsof the former Chinese Communist Party chairman, who died in 1976, aged 82, went through many ideological iterations before the official version was settled on. The original cover was also a different colour – in fact, had some of those earlier thought experiments been declared the final draft, we could now be talking about Chairman Mao’s Little Blue Book.For the first time, a huge collection of the various editions ofQuotationshas been assembled and is to be unveiled and presented for sale at the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair next month, with a communism-busting price tag of £1m.The collection is the work of more than two decades by Justin G Schiller, an American collector who began to visitChinain the 1990s. Dr Matt Wills of London rare book dealer Peter Harrington, which is representing the sale, said: “At that time, the market for collecting the Little Red Book was only just beginning, and you could find all kinds of rare and one-off editions being discarded by institutions and private individuals if you knew where to look. Justin was in place at the perfect time to build a collection without parallel. It would be impossible to do the same today, as the majority of the rarer editions have long perished.”View image in fullscreenMao Zedong watches an army parade in Beijing, then known as Peking, in 1967.Photograph: Apic/RETIRED/Getty ImagesThe collection is some 200 items strong and includes many of the early versions as well as first editions and international printings of the book. Before the famous red vinyl cover was settled on, the prototype editions had brown, white and blue bindings.And it wasn’t just cosmetic changes that were effected for the final printing. Many of the ideas in the book changed and evolved from 1960, when Mao’s sayings and slogans started to be compiled.“The first widely published edition of the Little Red Book, released in May 1964, naturally opens with a quote on the vanguard role of the Chinese Communist Party,” said Wills.“Look to prototype and trial versions and you will see that most do not open with this quote. As the Little Red Book became a ‘mass market’ publication, it became very important to put the party at the forefront on page one.“You will also see, across editions from 1961 to 1964, that the text shrinks, and the quotes often become punchier and rhetorically impactful as compilers tried to make the ­selection as effective and user-friendly as possible.”In fact, it seems that even 60 years ago spin doctors were at work to make the thoughts of Chairman Mao easily digestible for the masses.View image in fullscreenPart of the collection of Quotations editions, including one with a blue cover.

I think of the promotion of ‘Xi Jinping thought’ and literally hundreds of books Xi has ‘authored’. It reflects an attempt to create a written canon like Mao.”The Cultural Revolution: all you need to know about China’s political convulsionRead moreMao himself said in the Little Red Book: “It is dreadful to imagine a time when everyone will be rich.” So what would he think of his work going on sale for £1m?“I think he would have a very mixed reaction,” says Prof Marquis.“On the one hand, selling items for the rich to buy at such astronomical prices does point to the underlying problems with capitalism, which he strongly resisted.“However, on an intellectual level, it is a great manifestation of commodity fetishism – a key idea of Karl Marx’s – so in some ways he might have found it reinforcing of his world view being right.“But he might have actually been quite pleased, because aside from his ideological positions, he was an extreme narcissist and revelled in the cult of personality he created, so he might have been pleased that this book is getting such attention and is being so highly valued.”Explore more on these topicsCommunismObservedMao ZedongChinaShareReuse this content"

However, the first phase of that agreement expired more than a week ago and a second phase has stalled, leaving Gaza plunged into a “grey zone” of uncertainty.“I feel happiness and relief that the fighting has been stopped for so long but right now, I am really anxious the war will start again. I follow the news continuously,” said Ranan al-Ashqar, who works in the education ministry in Gaza City.Many observers see only a narrow and unlikely pathway to any durable peace. “We are in a grey zone. I am pessimistic about the potential going forward because the political calculations for the Israeli leadership do not favour a ceasefire that would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,” saidHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Some analysts fear a return to wider hostilities within days as Israel seeks to pressure Hamas into new concessions.Others suggest that a large-scale ground and air operation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) “within weeks” is more likely if no new deal is reached. Last week, senior IDF officers told Israeli journalists that if Israeli forces launched a renewed offensive, it would be massive and very destructive.So far, the IDF has limited itself to a series of airstrikes across Gaza, though these appear to be increasingly frequent.On Saturday, Palestinian media reported casualties from an airstrike in southern Gaza near the town of Rafah. The IDF said an aircraft had struck a drone tracked entering Gaza from Israel as well as several suspects who collected it. A day earlier,the IDF saidit had targeted a group suspected of placing a bomb near Israeli soldiers in the east of Gaza City.Palestinian aid officials said two people had died when a drone “shot into their tent”. Aid officials and residents described similar incidents in the past week, and repeatedly hearing artillery fire, though the IDF has denied any extensive bombardment.In the first phase of the ceasefire, 25 living hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were released, along with the remains of eight others, in return for the release of about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Israel also withdrew its forces from many positions in Gaza and allowed more aid to come in.In Gaza, humanitarian workers differ about the effects of the pause in hostilities. One senior UN official said aid organisations had been able to rehabilitate some schools and clinics, set up bakeries and build up stocks of diesel fuel that is vital to supply power and water to the population of 2.3m.More than half a million people have returned to what is left of their homes in northern Gaza after spending months in the south.But prices have soared since Israel imposed a strict blockade on Gaza, cutting off supplies of fresh fruit, vegetables and meat, as well as further aid shipments of tents and other essentials. The price of gas on the hidden market is 10 times higher than from aid organisations charged with its distribution. Israel accused Hamas of seizing and profiting from aid.“We could be facing a quick deterioration. Every day we are hearing these statements of a return to war. It’s very difficult for people,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza, speaking from Gaza City.“It is a very sad city here. There is a lot of rubble and only a few bulldozers so we have opened a few streets and are trying to collect the remains of families under the ruins. We don’t have the equipment we need but people are trying anyway.”The Israeli offensive has killed more than 48,000, mostly civilians, and destroyed swathes of Gaza. It was triggered by a Hamas surprise attack into Israel in October 2023 during which militants killed 1,200 people, also mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Fewer than half of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be alive.While Israel has said it wants to extend the current phase of the ceasefire until the end of the holy festivals of Ramadan in late March and Passover in mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a swift transition to the second phase, and a permanent end to the war.Zev Faintuch, head of research at Global Guardian, a US-based risk consultancy, said Israel’s war aims remained unchanged: to eliminate Hamas, return the hostages, return its displaced civilians to border areas affected by hostilities and minimise any future threat.But at the same time, Hamas has remained faithful to its original goals: to thwart progress towards the normalisation of ties between regional Arab states and Israel, isolate Israel diplomatically, widen divisions within Israeli society and retain control of Gaza. “The four points on each side are pretty mutually exclusive,” Faintuch said.Diplomatic efforts to bridge the wide gap between Israel and Hamas have faltered, and there are now two competing plans for Gaza post-war.President Trump has said the US wants tooversee the displacement of Gaza’s populationso the territory could be rebuilt as “the Middle East’s Riviera” and US officials have dismissed a $53bn reconstruction proposal put forward last week by regional Arab states.Trump has also threatened Hamas with destruction on social media, though it was revealed last week that the US is engaged in unprecedented direct talks with the militant Islamist organisation. Lovatt said that recent US behaviour had been unhelpful, though the direct talks left an “outside chance of agreement”.Almazah al-Masri, a nurse in northern Gaza, said she was worried and frustrated. “Unfortunately, those involved in the discussions [about the ceasefire] do not care about what’s happening in Gaza or the wellbeing of the civilians there,” she said. “We do not want war at all. We have already been destroyed.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

He said all were “aware of the great challenge we are facing – above all the international situation, but also … facing the whole of Europe”.Merz said both sides had agreed on tough new steps to limit irregular immigration, including refusing all undocumented migrants at the borders, even those seeking asylum.The move was a key demand of Merz, who has stressed the need to win back voters from the far-right Alternative forGermany(AfD), which scored a record of more than 20% in the election.Lars Klingbeil of the SPD called Saturday’s deal “an important first step” and said both sides agreed on the need to “get our country back on track”. He said his party had won assurances on key demands, such as a €15-an-hour minimum wage from 2026 and stable pensions.The plan is for Germany to have a new government by mid-April that would end half a year of political paralysis after Scholz’s three-way coalition imploded in November.The probable future governing allies have already surprised European partners with their plan to spend hundreds of billions of euros to revive the ailing economy and rebuild the military.‘People see it as invasive’: did anti-green feeling fuel the right’s rise in Germany?Read moreThe ambitious plans would cast aside Germany’s historic reluctance to take on large-scale debt and see it invest in defence on a scale not seen since the second world war.The spending boost – which Merz’s Bavarian ally Markus Söder has termed an “XXL”-sized splurge – comes in response to Trump and his administration casting doubt in Europe on the future strength and reliability of the Nato alliance.Alarm at Trump’s actions has added urgency to the talks, spurred by his public berating of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a White House meeting.The two parties are moving to talks on a detailed formal coalition agreement, including haggling over cabinet posts. Their spending plans would circumvent Germany’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake and exempt defence spending when it exceeds 1% of GDP.The parties also agreed a €500bn (£420bn) fund to invest in creaking infrastructure over 10 years.The SPD has long pushed for action on Germany’s economy, which has been mired in two years of recession. Merz voiced hopes on Saturday that the stimulus would help the economy grow by “one, preferably two, per cent”.However, both proposals will need a two-thirds majority in the outgoing parliament, with the two big blocs needing the Greens’ cooperation.Merz said new investment could flow into climate projects and voiced confidence that “we will find a way together to achieve a constitutional amendment”.But the Greens’ co-chair Felix Banaszak warned they were “further away from an agreement today than we have been in recent days”, criticising the fact that “climate protection financing plays no part” in the joint document.The CDU/CSU and SPD are in a hurry to push the changes through before a deadline looms. On 25 March the newly elected parliament will convene. From then on, the AfD and the far-left Linke will be able to block any such proposals.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropeOlaf ScholzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)newsShareReuse this content"

After an argument, the men pushed the male travellers into a nearby canal before sexually assaulting the two women.Ram L Arasiddi, a local police official, said one of travellers had drowned and his body was recovered on Saturday. The other two men swam to safety, he said.Koppal is about 217 miles (350 kilometres) from Bengaluru. Arasiddi said police had set up a special investigation team that arrested two of the suspects on Saturday. They were being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, gang-rape and robbery, he said.Sexual assaults on women have become a prominent issue in India, where police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The real figure is believed to be much higher given the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims’ lack of faith in police.Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang-rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a Delhi bus. The attack galvanised huge protests and inspired lawmakers to set up fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.The rape law was amended in 2013, criminalising stalking and voyeurism and lowering the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. The government approved the death penalty in 2018 for people convicted of raping children under age 12.High-profile cases involving foreign visitors have drawn international attention to the issue. Last year, in a video that was later deleted, a Spanish tourist said his wife had been raped in northern India, while an Indian-American woman said she had been raped at a hotel in Delhi. A British tourist was raped in front of her partner in Goa in 2022.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

A female plaintiff alleged that the leaders “acted to protect” the abusers and the church “handled the repeated allegations internally as a ‘matter of sin’ and not one leader reported any matter to police”.A woman from Escondido alleged that she was sexually assaulted from 1961 to at least 1978 by two male family members, including a bishop and a “home teacher” assigned to deliver spiritual lessons.Another claim filed on behalf of the estate of woman alleges repeatedly abused by two LDS home teachers beginning in 1961. A man alleges he was abused between five and nine times over a two-month span in 1978 by his bishop, when he was 14. He alleges he later disclosed the abuse to the bishop of a different area but was “ignored and disregarded plaintiff”.Another claims he was assaulted by a bishop in 1995 and reported the abuse to his father, who in turn reported it to an LDS official who warned him “that he needed to support his son’s abuser or risk being excommunicated from the church”.A fifth claimant claims he was abused, at age 16, during private lessons by a bishop who told him, the lawsuit alleged, that “if he kept quiet, he would go to heaven, but if he told of the abuse, he would go to hell”.Michael Carney, a Los Angeles attorney with Slater Slater Schulman,told the San Diego Tribunethat the LDS church is unique because of “how much power and influence the church has over people’s lives”.A church spokesperson said that “abuse of a child or any other individual is inexcusable. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes this, teaches this, and dedicates tremendous resources and efforts to prevent, report and address abuse” and outlined steps related to abuse LDS church leaders and members are instructed to follow: stop the abuse, help victims receive care and comply with whatever reporting is required by law.But the spokesperson also noted that the cases were filed by a single contingency law firm, “which has aggressively marketed for clients” and many are decades old and some potential witnesses have died.“The church takes these claims seriously and is carefully investigating each case individually,” the spokesperson added. “Early investigation has revealed multiple discrepancies in many of the claims.”The lawsuits against the LDS church have become so numerous, and with so many common threads, that attorneys want to consolidate the actions into a single multi-district litigation in the central district ofCalifornia.One focus of the litigation against the church involvesclaimsthat an LDS “help line” was used to suppress reports of abuse and shield abusers, not to help victims. The LDS church’sgeneral handbookdirects church leaders to “not involve themselves in civil or criminal cases for members in their units without first consulting with Church legal counsel”.“Institutions are more concerned about their public appearance because that translates into monetary donations,” said Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney known for representing sexual abuse claims against the Catholic church. “History has taught us that first and foremost institutions protect themselves and not the child.”But the success of claims against individuals and institutions is not as legally sure-footed as it was at the onset of the #MeToo movement seven years ago. Earlier this week, Jay-Z filed a lawsuit against attorneys Tony Buzbee and David Fortney and their Jane Doe client over a lawsuit claiming sexual abuse that that was subsequently dropped.Jay-Z – also known as Shawn Carter – proposed three causes of action to an Alabama court: malicious prosecution, abuse of process and civil conspiracy against all three defendants, as well as defamation against the Jane Doe, claiming the allegations of rape against him were knowingly “false” and “malicious”.Next month, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, 72, faces retrial in New York on rape charges after his earlier convictions five years ago for the third-degree rape of one woman and a first-degree criminal sex act against another woman were tossed on appeal.According to Wendy Murphy, a former sex crimes prosecutor and director of the Women’s and Children’s Advocacy Project in Boston, it’s harder to prove liability in claims against institutions because the plaintiff needs to show that a high-level officer had knowledge and failed to take action. With institutions that are in some ways structured around secrecy, claims of offenses in cases dating back decades can be especially difficult to establish.“The capacity to structure secrecy so that they can somehow avoid being held accountable by the way they create their power structures also means they have to accept the consequences that a lot of bad stuff is going to happen,” Murphy said.Despite efforts to weaken liability standards, Murphy said, deference to the sanctity of religious organizations provides “unbelievable natural insulation from accountability and oversight, not just because that’s how the legal standards are set up but because of an added layer of first amendment protections. Law enforcement often doesn’t want to intrude behind the doors of godly places.”Whatever the legal outcome of abuse claims against the Mormon church, says Garabedian, any change will probably come externally from the legal framework of institutional protections.“Institutions are icebergs unto themselves, so the real change comes from the public realizing that institutions are not properly supervising and protecting children,” he said, “and the public is now more aware that they have to watch their children.”In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

But as a judge once ruled, that’s just a role she performs. So who is the real Lorraine Kelly?BySimon HattenstoneSat 8 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTShareLorraine Kelly opens the front door with a huge smile. “You interviewed me, years ago, d’you remember?” Now she looks disappointed. “Ach, you don’t, do you?” Of course I remember. And she’s hardly changed. I’ve brought a photo of us on the GMTV sofa to show her. Back then, she’d just turned 40, was a staple of breakfast telly and was about to launch her own show; a household name, if not quite the mononym she is today. Now she’s 65, her show is still on ITV five mornings a week, and last year she was awarded a lifetime achievement Bafta. Oh, and she’s just reinvented herself as a bestselling novelist. The Island Swimmer, which reached No 2 in the Sunday Times hardback fiction charts, is about to come out in paperback.“So how’ve you been?” she asks. Kelly is the kind of person who you can pick up with where you left off a quarter of a century ago. She’s also the kind of person you feel you know, even when you don’t. Perhaps that’s been her great gift as a TV presenter. She was a good journalist as Scotland correspondent for TV-am but not outstanding. She’s a decent interviewer, but she won’t be remembered for her incisive interrogations or scoops. What she is brilliant at, though, is being Lorraine – warm, likable, nosy, funny, occasionally steely and sharp-tongued, sometimes potty-mouthed and always 100% herself. Which is why it was a shock in 2019 when she told a tax court that theLorraine on TV is different from the real Lorraine; that on television she performs the role “of a friendly, chatty and fun personality”.Her Buckinghamshire cottage, backing on to the Thames, is as you might expect – plush but super homely. Inside, there are big comfy sofas and piles of illustrated cushions (one is of a saintly looking Dolly Parton, another of Angus the dog is captioned: “This house is solely for the convenience of our border terrier”). Paintings of Angus, daughter Rosie and her husband of 33 years, Steve, adorn the walls. You can’t move for family photos – her grandparents dressed to the nines; her newlywed parents gorgeous at 18; Rosie with her baby daughter Billie. She dotes over the last photo. “See, I am a real Granny Smith!” she says. I look at her, puzzled. “That’s my married name! Steve is Steve Smith.” I’m already beginning to see the difference between Lorraine Kelly the TV show presenter and Lorraine Smith, wife, mum and grandma.Daytime TV regulars will know just how obsessed she is with being a grandmother. She can’t stop talking about it. Wow, I didn’t know you were a gran, I say. Now it’s her turn to give me a look. “You cheeky bugger. Well itisthe best thing that’s happened to me.”View image in fullscreenKelly with her daughter Rosie, 2021.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageThe Island Swimmer is pure fiction – a romantic mystery about a woman returning to her home in Orkney after leaving unexpectedly many years ago. And yet look at the photos, explore her home, and you can see bits of Kelly’s life in the book. The photo of her parents reminds me of the parents of the book’s protagonist Evie and her older sister Liv, with whom she has a troubled relationship. Kelly stops at another photograph – this time herself as a six-year-old with her baby brother Graham. “That’s me looking dead happy that my wee brother’s here! I look like a demon.” Blimey, I say, you look just how I imagine the young Liv would in her furious jealousy. She bursts out laughing.“Yessssssss!Hahahaha! It’s me as a child, oh my God!” It is exactly how she felt – he was the golden child, and she had been usurped. She admits it inspired the relationship between Evie and Liv. “My nose was put out of joint when he was born. But now I really like him. He just makes me laugh so much.” What did he think when he read the book? “He thought it was hilarious. It’s not his thing, but he enjoyed it.’’ In the book, Liv is accused of attempting to drown Evie. Did she ever try to drown Graham? “Oh no! It wasn’tthatbad.”Above the spices shelf in the kitchen, bottles of whisky are lined up like a military platoon. Which is her favourite? “I like Highland Park.” Highland Park gets an honourable mention in the book. “But Steve and I are not guzzlers of whisky,” she says. What’s their favourite tipple? “G&T,” she says. Funny how G&T is the drink of choice for a number of your characters, I say. “Well you have to write about what you know!”She and Steve used to work together as part of a small team when they were young – him as the cameraman, she as the journalist. “I knew right away as soon as he walked in the door. This wee fella from Dundee, I thought, yep that’s him, thanks very much! Then it took me a year, but I got him in the end.” Why did it take her so long? “It was a small working environment, there were only five of us. It was awkward.” What was special about him? “He’s the kindest man. He’s funny, he makes me laugh a lot, he puts up with me, he’s very stable.”On with the guided tour. There’s a whole shelf of books dedicated to the explorerErnest Shackleton. “I’mobsessedwith him. Always have been.” Kelly doesn’t like standing still. She moves as quickly as she talks. We stop at the magnets on her fridge – souvenirs from places she’s been to. One of her favourites is Twatt in Orkney. “I love that there’s a place called Twatt, as if you couldn’t love Orkney enough.” She moves on to a photo of Steve with Billie. “That’s my husband with baby Billie, when she was just born. But I don’t like to talk about Billie, as you know. Even though she is the best thingever.”Is it better than being a mum? “When you’re a mum you don’t know what you’re doing. Now you have all the love and you don’t have any fear.”Angus is barking at the door. “Come and say hello to Simon!” Angus trots in, yappy and affectionate. A second later Steve arrives back from a game ofpadel. He’s a stocky, handsome man in shorts and a Dundee United top. I ask him if he’s still working. “No!” When did he retire? “Oh God, years ago, 10 years ago or something.”Is it true that he watches all Kelly’s shows?“Yes, I  do.” Is he a tough critic? “Nooooo.”“Noooo!”Kelly echoes.“But it’s lovely that he watches.”Would he ever say, that was a bit shite? “No, I don’t criticise. I’ll just say, well, that was a weird guest! We watch together, don’t we, Angus?”Kelly: “You do, you’re very good. As does my mother.”Could he imagine Kelly retiring? “No. She never will. She’s a grafter. She’ll always do something.”“I do love the writing, though,” Kelly says. “It’s great if you can just get in the zone. I’ve been very lucky to get a chance to do it.” She’s aware that she might have remained unpublished if she hadn’t been well known.Kelly’s publicist had suggested we talk over lunch. I find interviewing while eating quite tricky – too convivial to ask difficult questions. Thankfully lunch consists of three Caramel bars and a Penguin. We head off into the lounge as Kelly tells me despite her 40 years in the business, she’s never counted her chickens.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianShe was born in the Gorbals, spent her early years in Glasgow and then moved to East Kilbride 20-odd miles away. Her father was a TV engineer and her mother a shop assistant; they were the talk of the tenement when they were the first family to get a colour television in the late 60s. “Everybody came to our living room to watch this Frank Sinatra concert.” She says her mum and dad seemed cooler than most of her friends’ parents, partly because they were younger and partly because they were into Dylan rather thanMantovani.She was a bright child – though not as bright as Graham. She would have been the first in the family to go to university, had she not got a job on the East Kilbride News at the age of 17. From the off, she loved it, and was treated as one of the lads in a predominantly male environment. In 1983, she joined BBC Scotland as a researcher, and a year later became TV-am’s Scotland correspondent. It was after covering the Lockerbie disaster for TV-am that she moved to London to present Good Morning Britain in 1989.Kelly says she has never lost the insecurity of a freelancer. She learned her lesson when she was sacked from GMTV while on maternity leave and replaced by Anthea Turner. Ever since, she’s always made sure she’s had something else on the go to fall back on, whether a radio show, newspaper columns or now, her novels.“Rosie was teeny-tiny. We’d just moved south, we had a mortgage, and it was scary to have that peeled away from you. I wasn’t a member of staff. I didn’t have any rights. I didn’t get maternity pay. I’d like to think we’re a bit more enlightened these days, and that wouldn’t happen.”Cow & Gate proved to be her unlikely saviour. The processed baby milk manufacturer agreed to sponsor a slot on GMTV so long as Kelly presented it. From there, she went on to host her own show, Lorraine Live, and since then hasn’t looked back.Oh dear God! I can’t believe what’s going on in America. It’s heartbreaking. It’s being torn apartIn 2010, she launched her current show, simply called Lorraine. It’s changed little in format over 15 years, though they recently decided to accentuate the positive because the world is so bleak. “We made a conscious decision that we’ll try to see the light.” She means light as opposed to dark, rather than trivial. As an example, she cites a recent guest, Auschwitz survivor Renee Salt. “At end of the interview she said: ‘I just want peace. If I’ve got anything to say to the world it’s for goodness sake please don’t let this happen again.’ It was extraordinary. For someone to still have faith in human kindness and peace, wow! That teaches you a lesson, doesn’t it?”Does she worry we could see a return to fascism, with the rise of right-wing populism? “Oh dear God! I can’t believe what’s going on in America. It’s heartbreaking. It’s being torn apart. I don’t see how we can go from Obama who, for all his faults, was a good man. How did we go from this articulate, compassionate, interesting person to what we’ve got now? I do spend a lot of my time being baffled. I do.”Trump has just announced his plan to turn Gaza into the Rivieraof the Middle East when we meet. “I mean …” For a moment even Kelly is lost for words. “It is easy to be depressed about everything. That’s why I think we have to get the joy where we can. I did think it was going to be OK in this country when Keir Starmer got in because I thought, OK he’s a bit dull, but we need grownups. And thenthe first thing he did was take away the heating allowance from pensioners. What are youdoing? Why would youdothat?”View image in fullscreenWith husband Steve Smith after being made a CBE.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThis is Kelly at her best – demolishing arguments or policies not with logic or facts, but with blunt rhetorical questions that reflect what so many of us think. “Then he said things are really shit and they’re going to get even shitter. We don’t want to hear that.” Now she’s on a roll. “We really don’t. There are ways of communicating that: ‘Things are bad, we know, but don’t worry because we’re all trying our very best to make it better.’ You don’t have to overpromise and underdeliver, but you could just go, ‘We’re going to do our best to make it better, stick with us!’ We don’t want to hear all that negativity right now. We just don’t. It might be me putting my head in the sand, but I don’t think it is. We just need a bit of hope.”And she’s still not done. “I don’t recognise this government as a Labour government. And he keeps mythologising Margaret Thatcher which is … scary.”Kelly has always said it the way she sees it – though perhaps not as uncompromisingly as this. I ask whether she was political as a kid. “Oh yes, I was in theAnti-Nazi Leagueand hadCNDbadges. When you’re young you should absolutely be saying, this isn’t good, this isn’t right.” Not just when you’re young, I say. She nods. “You should be shouting from the rooftops.” She looks at my plate of Caramels. “Go on, have a biscuit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I mean David Attenborough, who is holding the universe together!Why does she think the world has become so toxic? She stares at her mobile phone, and pokes it with her finger. “That!All the villages had idiots and extremists, but they were sitting there on their own. Now they’ve found their kindred spirits on thisbloodything.” She’s talking even faster and her voice is getting louder. “Jesus Christ,David Attenboroughgets people being shitty to him! I meanDavid Attenborough, who is holding the universe together! People shout at him – climate change deniers, hunters have a go at him. And you think, well if they’re having a go at him, what’s the point?”People sometimes think of you as soft and mumsy, I say. “The mad fools! Hehehehe!” But you’re pretty tough? “I can be. Especially if I’m defending somebody or something that I believe in.” Such as? “When people are unkind. When I was at school there was this lovely person who was our bus driver, bravest person I’ve met in my life. Her name was Jane. She used to be a chap and was now a trans woman. Jane got people speaking shit to her, saying offensive things. I remember saying to somebody, ‘Shut your face, don’t be so bloody rude.’”But, even then, she says people were more open-minded than they appear to be now. “We were much more tolerant. Again, it’s social media giving nutters a voice. It makes no sense to me. I know a fair few people who are trans and they just want to get on with their lives. I don’t think trans people should have to come on the television, or be part of the debate, to justify their existence. I just think everyone has to be a bit more tolerant. That’s why I put a trans person in my book.”The elderly Freya is the wise, generous heart of The Island Swimmer. “Freya being trans is probably the least interesting thing about her. I was keen to show she’s just Freya. I love her. She’s just a lovely, lovely person.” It’s touching how she talks about her characters as if they are friends – or enemies. Just as she swoons over Freya, she rages over Evie’s boyfriend, the controlling Jeremy. “He’s like all the horrible people I’ve met in my life distilled into one.” Why did she call him Jeremy? “It’s the kind of name, with apologies to all the Jeremies in the world, you think: oh, he’s going to be a knob.”She looks down at Angus, adoringly. “Like Angus is a great name; a strong name. Apologies to everyone who can’t help that their mammy called them Jeremy.” Kelly has just finished writing her second novel, and is currently editing it. She tells me proudly that she’s now signed a deal for a third and fourth.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianEarlier this year, she hit out at “toxic people in telly” – particularly men. In an interview with the Mirror, she said: “The behaviour of Gregg Wallace and other people that we’ve seen, should it come about as all true, is appalling.” She talked about the abuse of power and said that TV bosses who enabled this behaviour were as much to blame as the perpetrators. Last year, she said some male presenters lacked “generosity”. Interestingly, she singled out former fellow morning TV star Phillip Schofield as one who was generous.Schofield resigned from ITV in 2023and was dropped by his talent agency after admitting to an “unwise, but not illegal” affair with a younger colleague. Today, she says: “I think Phillip was awful daft. I think he made a lot of choices he shouldn’t have. But all I can go by is what it was like to work with him, and it was easy. He was lovely, and I think it’s really sad.”As I get older, I want to do other things. I’ve been doing this for 40 years, working my arse offKelly has recently been under attack herself. She has been criticised on social media for not presenting her show five days a week.An X account called LorraineKWatchkeeps track of her absences. At the end of last year, the account, which has 25,000 followers, concluded that she had only hosted 59.7% of the episodes. This year she has presented 67.5% at the time of writing. I thought she might laugh it off, but she doesn’t. “It’s really hurtful actually. It really is. I’ve not spoken about it before. I’m a grafter and I work really hard and I’ve had to take Fridays off for the past year. I just thought it was weird to care so much.” Why was she taking time off? “Initially, it was for my mum who has been ill. And it sort of brings you into line with everyone else because if you look at This Morning, everybody else does four days. And as I’m getting older, I want to do other things, more writing, all of that. Mate, I’ve been doing this for 40 years, working my arse off.”I guess the difference is that your show is called Lorraine, I say. “I get that. I get that 100% because This Morning is just called This Morning and GMB is just GMB.” But she says it does feel horribly personal. “Maybe it just started off as a wee joke, but it’s the way that everyone piles on. It starts off as a wee tiny thing and it gets bigger and bigger. I find it really sad.”We talk about the highs. There have been so many, she says. And this is when you really see that Kelly is one of life’s great enthusiasts – a professional fangirl. She talks about meeting Star Trek heroes Leonard Nimoy (“Mr Spock was my first crush!”) and William Shatner; interviewing real-life space hero Buzz Aldrin; being sent to San Francisco for a zero-gravity flight for her 60th birthday; travelling to America on the QE2 with the Cure (“They were delightful – so polite and cute”).She has been groundbreaking in normalising conversation about once-taboo topics such as miscarriage and menopause. In 2017, Kelly revealed that menopause had left her feeling “flat and joyless”. She only shared her experience because at the time she couldn’t find a famous guest willing to talk about it.Perhaps the thing we remember most from her show are the spontaneous Lorraine moments, often when doing live links with the GMB show – she toldEsther McVey she didn’t remember her, after the Conservative MPsaid they used to work together;tore a strip off Jennifer Arcuri, the businesswoman who had an affair with Boris Johnson, for saying nothing in her interview (“What’s the point in you coming on and not saying anything?”). In 2023, she voiced surprise at Nigel Farage’s relative youth (“Is he only 59? I thought he was a helluva lot older than that. That’s astonishing. It just shows you get the face you deserve!”)I ask about the lows. She struggles to think of any. The few there have been tend to be personal. “I had a miscarriage, which was horrible, and I went back to work too fast. That’s the thing I do. I plough on. But lows, not really.” She says she would love to have had more children.View image in fullscreenHair and makeup by Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using makeup by Mario and hair by Sam McKnight.Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianIn 2019, she took HMRC to court after receiving a £1.2m tax bill. The battle was about whether she was an employee or a freelancer, and whether she appeared as a performer or herself. Kelly won the case, but for the first time she got a drubbing in the press. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled Lorraine “presents a persona of herself” so could be described as a “theatrical artist”, meaning payments to an agent were allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: “For the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public ‘Lorraine Kelly’; she may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies.” It made Kelly sound like a fake, and her USP had always been authenticity.Was that a low? “Yes,” she winces. “That was horrible. But we had no choice. We took them to a tribunal because what they were trying to do was unfair. They were trying to say that I was a member of staff when I’m a freelance, so they sent me a massive tax bill.”She says it felt like a David and Goliath battle against HMRC. “The thing that has negated some of the stress and angst and bad publicity is that it has helped so many people – not just people in the media or famous people, but, say, hairdressers and beauticians who had been treated as staff by HMRC but were actually freelancers.” How did it affect her? “Your peace of mind goes.”To have argued that Lorraine is a character … I begin to say. She answers before I finish as she tends to do when she’s on the defensive. “Yes, that was weird. But that was the only way we could do it.” A lot of people took the piss out of you, I say. “Oh, they did but that’s OK.” Does she genuinely think that Lorraine is a character? Yes and no, she says. “I am a version of me on the telly. And yes, I’m kind of like that but I’m a lot more open, a lot more sweary, and I’m not that person. There’s nobody that goes on television who is themselves.” She says she’s quieter in real life; less sociable. “I am not the life and soul of the party. My husband is. I’m the first one there and the first to leave. I’m at my happiest with people I trust and know, watching something on the telly and having a nice meal.”What really hurt about the court case, she says, was people thinking she’s a tax dodger. “I’ll show you my tax returns. I pay my taxes on time every year, of course I do.” She looks at my plate. “Have another biscuit.”I ask Kelly if Steve was right when he said she’d never give up work. “I would do the telly as long as people want me to do it.” Is she enjoying getting older? “Yes!” Is her brown hair natural? “Look, I’ve got grey.” Hardly any. “I know, but my mum and granny were the same, then it just went white. Like Helen Mirren. She’s beautiful, but she still looks like a normal human being. She’s not got the boiled-egg face. I don’t like that. I’ve not had anything done. I’m too scared, and I don’t want to. I want to look normal, I want to look like me.” Is there any pressure to have work done? “Not in the job I do, no. I was never hired for my looks!” She hoots with delight.Well you say that, but you have been hailed as a sex symbol. “Hahhaha! By whom? Blind people?” Actually, it was the Daily Mail, among others. “Well it’s very kind, I’ll take that all day long.” She’s also been called a gay icon. “I’ll take that all day long, too.” And she’s been labelled the nation’s naughty mum. “I didn’t know that. I’ll take that too.” What title is she going for next? She thinks. “Novelist of the year? No! I couldn’t possibly!”She’s just delighted to still be working, still be relevant, and still be finding new things to do. “I love this stage of my life. Especially with the wee one.” She grins. “But I don’t mention her. I like to keep that quiet!”The Island Swimmer by Lorraine Kelly is published by Orion in paperback on 13 March.

In the cool, concrete sanctuary ofMPavilion–the city’s annual architecture installation/event space/public shelter – a small group of people sit reading. Some recline on beanbags, some perch on stools; others lean against the fluted concrete wall, breeze running through their hair. For close to an hour, nobody speaks; they just read.This is Silent Book Club, where there is no required book list, no entry fee, no organised discussion. Just reading, quietly, in company.Billed as “book clubs for introverts”, Silent Book Club was started in 2012 when a couple of friends in San Francisco felt traditional book clubs involved too much pressure – to read a particular book in a certain amount of time, to “have something smart to say” – so they started their own kind of club, where neither was required. Silent book clubs have become global since then, with chapters openingon every continent.50% of Australians want to read more – but don’t. So what is stopping us?Read moreTaken at face value, it’s a project that seems steeped in contradiction. A good book should be absorbing – why consciously gather to participate in a solitary practice that, if it’s going well, should result in you ignoring each other? What makes this any different or better to sitting in a library on any given day – especially if the other people reading around you are strangers?Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn this morning, Skye Bennett, theMelbournechapter’s founder, greets everyone gently. She invites them to take a seat wherever they feel comfortable, and to find a book if they don’t have one: the Wheeler Centre, Melbourne’s hub for all things literary, has set up a bookshelf against one wall of the pavilion. It’s stacked with books linked to ideas around community and gathering. Most attendees, though, have brought their own.Bennett says about 60 people attend the regular sessions she holds in Docklands onthe last Sunday of the month, and they often sit around reading for far longer than the set time. Today, about 10 people gather in the pavilion – the small turnout likely a reflection of it being both a workday and an out-of-schedule, pop-up event. There’s a bit of quiet chatter before reading time officially begins, but not much. And then we open our books.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve witnessed many new connections and friendships form and flourish at Silent Book Club,’ says Skye Bennett, the Melbourne chapter’s founder.Photograph: Silent Book Club MelbourneLast month,research commissioned by advocacy organisation Australia Readsshowed that more than half of us want to read more than we actually do, but even very engaged readers struggle to make enough time for it – particularly those who work full-time. It doesn’t bode well for recreational reading that many also said finding motivation for it was more difficult than scrolling through social media or watching television – even when they said they read for leisure and pleasure.Bennett says many of the Melbourne participantsare keen readers but busy people, and Silent Book Club allows them to ensure they prioritise a reading habit among other competing tasks. It seems likely, too, that for those struggling with motivation, it may function like body-doubling – a tactic used by some people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to accomplish tasks they find difficult by having a second person working alongside them, as a kind of social scaffolding.The low-expectations of social contact that goes along with it also seem to help people come out of their shell, Bennett says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think that’s the beauty of Silent Book Club – once the social pressure, expectations and obligations are removed, people feel permitted to connect with others in ways that feel comfortable and authentic to them.”For Melbourne in particular – famouslythe most locked-down city in the worldand still arguably in the long tail of Covid recovery – there’s perhaps an understandable attraction to the idea of consciously spending time in company with minimal social pressure.Perhaps part of the attraction, though, is something slightly more numinous.At MPavilion, as the sun slowly creeps above the semi-open roof and the traffic hums in the background as we sink into our novels, the experience of Silent Book Club feels less like engaging in art with friends and more like meditation, or even prayer. Here we gather together with like-minded devotees, setting our own individual intentions for the time we’ve carved out to participate in this, a ritual of reading. It’s church for people who love books.Explore more on these topicsBooksMelbourneLiteracyHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Opener Hawk & Crow has Knapp at her larkish best, giving voice to a cast of birds over a stumbling, broken rhythm – a kind of elfin Tom Waits. The spoken-wordTrain Songrelocates us to today’s mundane realities – “poplars tall, village hall, stately home, sewage works” – before Star Carr whisks us back to theMesolithic Yorkshire sitewhere ritual headdresses of red deer antler hint at ancient raves.Along with intense fiddle playing from Diver, crepuscular instrumentation accompanies a clutch of traditional ballads; the tender romance of I Must Away Love, the murderous Long Lankin and the forlorn Lass of Aughrim, the last with Knapp in heartbreaking form. She sings carefully throughout but remains unafraid to spill the odd yowl and yelp; you get the whole person.

The author of more than 20 books in a variety of genres in Chinese and English, she’s also a film director whose awards include the Golden Leopard at the Locarno film festival, previously won by Claire Denis and Jim Jarmusch. This month she publishes two books: thepaperback of her 2024 memoir,My Battle of Hastings:Chronicleofa Year Bythe Sea, and a new novel,Call Me Ishmaelle, a retelling ofMoby-DickWhat led you to take onHerman Melville’s1851classic?I was in New York, a foreigner walking around for a year while teaching at Columbia and writing my memoir,Radical[2023], and this was a parallel project, a philosophical experiment. Most people are Asiatic – the world’s population is 60% Asian – and with each novel I write, I ask myself in what ways a non-westerner from a non-biblical background can engage in dialogue with the western literary canon. The word “Christendom” appears repeatedly inMoby-Dick. I wondered: what if people never knew what that is? If it said “Taoism” instead, would you still listen to the story? I’m a guerrilla gardener – I secretly go out planting trees in my neighbourhood – and it made me think: can I somehow just bring ancient east Asian philosophy into this American landscape? Guerrilla sabotage. I wanted the whole world on that ship. I spent so much time figuring out how to get a black captain from the civil war period into dialogue with a Chinese Taoist sailmaker.And then there’s the headline twist. Why Ishmaelle rather than the original novel’s Ishmael?I was so struck by stories of working-class Victorian girls who went to sea out of poverty and desperation. I drew on the case of Anne Jane Thornton, who met a captain from New York when she was 15. Those girls just wanted more life: they put on cabin boys’ clothes, shaved their hair and went on the ships. A lot of them were discovered only when they were pregnant: the captain wouldn’t know, because when a girl was discovered, the sailors would have sex – a secret agreement. I was so struck by these cases that I almost forgot about the nautical journey: I wanted to write about Ishmaelle’s journey, from Ishmaelle to Ishmael and then Ishmaelle again.In Chinese, Shakespearean language becomes utterly abstract and meaningless. It’s such a challenge, you give upIn content, the book is deliberately disruptive, yet in style it feels more traditional than your previous books. How come?I couldn’t see the necessity to write novels any more afterA Lover’s Discourse[shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize for experimental fiction in 2020]. I had an overwhelming sense of nausea at the overproduced superfluousness of contemporary fiction. I don’t have this need to consume “story”: I need to have a debate, a dialogue with truth; to think more, write less, and to address issues not in a political way but in a philosophical way, a poetic way. Write less, in order to write stronger. But somehow in this book – the biggest I’ve ever written – I was carried away by the characters. I have to confess, it’s the first time. I’ve returned to the addictive power of fiction… Our fascination with myth-making seems to be a human malady.Can you recall the first time you readMoby-Dick?It was in translation at university [in China]. In Chinese, the Shakespearean and biblical language becomes utterly abstract and meaningless – it’s such a challenge, you give up. The second time, in New York, I still found it difficult, especially the huge cetology chapter, which troubles most readers in English. That’s pre-Wikipedia writing: you’d never write a novel that way these days, but Melville just accumulates so much. I’d rather have the nautical stuff first-hand. He was very affected by the Essex whaling tragedy – shipwrecked sailors who started to eat one another – and I found thememoir by the ship’s first mate, Owen Chase, more powerful than readingMoby-Dick10 times for research.What sways you to work in one genre or another?This question isn’t a problem for a writer who isn’t a wordsmith. Most writers are wordsmiths – they invent the same stories every few years – but I don’t feel like I’m a writer. I think of something and play with it: I make a film and think, oh, that’s actually prose, or memoir, or verse. I’m very idea-led. A lot of my previous work is close to my life, because when I came to the west [in 2002], I suddenly became a young girl again and had a prolonged adolescence to discover myself in Europe as a woman. Turning 50, I realised I never really went deep into history. People change:Tolstoy became a vegetarian at 50, after eating 50 years of Russian sausage and Russian meat! Reading theAnglo-Saxon Chronicleand theDomesday Bookto writeMy Battle of Hastingswas part of a process of self-education in the dynamics of power over the past 1,000 years; it gave me confidence for thisMoby-Dickproject.Tell us what you’ve been reading lately.Wordsworth and Coleridge’sLyrical Ballads, every night before bed for the past two weeks. I’ve been reading Coleridge for ever because ofKubla Khan: whenever a western author writes about Asia, you have this immediate feeling of generosity. “Yes, man, thank you! You addressed the east, I’m gonna look at your work to find out why.” It’s like a dream language when I read Coleridge every night before bed. Wordsworth is much more rational, more structured.What was the last book you gave as a gift?Thomas Hardy’sTess of the D’Urbervilles, which has one of the most original female characters in the British novel. For years, I loved DH Lawrence. I wanted to find out where his prose came from and had to go back to Hardy: so good. That same week, I gave someone John Fowles’sThe French Lieutenant’s Woman. I had three copies at home, to keep it in easy reach, because I love that novel so much. I reread it again after visiting Lyme Regis [where it’s set]. I wish we still wrote novels like that: reflectionandnarrative, not just narrative.Call Me Ishmaelleby Xiaolu Guo is published on 20 March by Chatto & Windus (£18.99).

Though it gestured at being a serious thriller – a sort of Gone Girl for cable – the film, based on the 2017 novel by Darcey Bell, ultimately devolved into ridiculousness, untethered from logic yet with plenty of road for more twists. Lively’s Emily Nelson, an archly manipulative psychopath straight out of a Justin Baldoni lawsuit, remains her best work since Gossip Girl. And most pertinent to Amazon MGM studios, the film found post-theatrical success on streaming, becoming a modern camp classic during the pandemic.The Electric State review – Millie Bobby Brown’s bot war yarn is soulless digital contentRead moreBut Feig, by his own admission at theSXSWfilm festival on Friday evening, is wary of sequels, and for good reason – rarely does lightning strike twice, especially in suburban Connecticut. A Simple Favor ended in settled-enough fashion, with (spoiler alert) Emily in prison for the murder of her secret identical twin sister and attempted murder of her husband, with Kendrick’s Stephanie, a successful mommy vlogger, and their hapless mutual ex Sean (Henry Golding) living in peace in San Diego.Feig’s reservations were warranted: Another Simple Favor, again written by Jessica Sharzer along with Laeta Kalogridis, unsurprisingly does not match the intoxicating magic of the original, which feinted at something sinister and twisted in the facades of motherhood before plunging off the deep end. It is neither suspenseful nor thrilling, but something else: a movie so confidently ridiculous, so stylishly absurd and so self-aware of its mandate for fun that you can’t help but enjoy it, reasonable wariness – and all reason, really – be damned.Another Simple Favor picks up where the first one left off, in that it begins in its latent camp sensibilities and barrels full-force into unabashed silliness. As with the original, Kendrick’s ever-peppy and self-effacing Stephanie opens the proceedings in medias res, vlogging (or, because it’s 2025, livestreaming) from house arrest in Italy. Why? How? She recaps for her followers: she has spent the intervening years baking zucchini bread and solving Reddit’s best mysteries with haunting results, once again revealed in pulpy flashbacks. Her fellow Connecticut moms, played by Kelly McCormack, Aparna Nancherla and Andrew Rannells, are as bitchy as ever. And Emily, now the “faceless blond” of Stephanie’s under-selling true-crime memoir, is walking free, sprung from prison by the generosity of her mysterious new fiance, an Italian hunk/mob heir named, yes, Dante (Michele Morrone).Emily crashes Stephanie’s sparsely attended book reading, slo-mo strut and jumpsuit-chic outfit on lock, with a request that’s less another simple favor than a massive, confounding ask: be her maid of honor at her lavish wedding in Capri? Stephanie accepts, which is the first sign that this movie will be uncovering new shades of the word “ludicrous” at every turn. From the minute Emily’s private jet takes flight, Another Simple Favor abandons any pretense of seriousness or grounding – in fact, the first movie’s deranged plot twists serve as the bread and butter of this sequel’s many in-jokes, the characters quick to point out the whole perverse web of backstabbing deceit as it grows ever more complex and unhinged.Italian mob weddings being what they are, the blood begins to spill almost as soon as the guests arrive. Golding’s Sean is there, now more surly and pathetic (and naked – no one can ever accuse Another Simple Favor of not knowing its audience), as well as Emily’s beloved son Nicky (Ian Ho), who is 10 going on 20 with some understandable mood issues. So, too, is Dante’s unimpressed mob boss mother (Elena Sofia Ricci), Stephanie’s incompetent book agent Vicky (Broadway’s Alex Newell), Emily’s senile mother (Elizabeth Perkins, taking over for Jean Smart) and her long-lost loony aunt Linda (Allison Janney), rounding out a cast of one-dimensional characters who test one’s patience but ultimately do not distract from the mission of smooth-brained amusement. (Janney, especially, can do a lot with a little.)Another Simple Favor drops threads and drags on, but survives on its self-assured baseline pleasures: the gorgeous yet nonsensical setting of Capri, the lush wonders of Renée Ehrlich Kalfus’s costume design (Lively once again sports a murderers’ row of completely impractical suits) and the two leads’ perfectly calibrated banter, at once winking and convincing. Lively, especially, shines in her grand return performance amid the widely scrutinized legal battle surroundingIt Ends with Us. The slippery Emily is a particular pitch of bemused psycho that could easily tip into cartoonish or smug, and she holds it. Kendrick’s comic timing, meanwhile, remains sharp as a tack. Without both, the whole pageant would collapse.And it nearly does. Feig’s crisp direction notwithstanding, Another Simple Favor attempts some plot twists better left unsaid and forgotten. But even overstaying its welcome at two hours, soaring past the boundaries of taste and reaching the astral plane of should-be offensive absurdity cannot derail the experience of watching these toxic frenemies back in action. It may not be the next chapter we needed, but more money-mandated sequels could stand to have this little self-seriousness.Another Simple Favor is screening at the SXSW film festival and will be available on Amazon Prime Video on 1 MayExplore more on these topicsSXSWFirst look reviewBlake LivelyPaul FeigAnna KendrickComedy filmsFestivalsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s also, to a significant and compelling extent, about property. Beginning with a family’s first viewing of a handsome Victorian home in an unidentified stretch of suburbia, the film never ventures outside its walls for the next 85 minutes, as the ensuing chills make us consider the merits of that purchase. Wittily and unnervingly shot from the perspective of the restless spirit roaming its halls, it’s a haunted house film in which much of the tension feels determined by the shape and flow and light and shade of the house itself. It’s a while since I’ve seen a film where I could quite so exactly draw the floor plan of its primary location, even months after viewing.Presenceis the latest entry, then, in a subset of films set in a house that gradually takes on a life and personality of its own – not just a vivid or spectacular set, but a space that begins to dictate proceedings as much as any of the human characters’ actions. Horror cinema is, of course, particularly conducive to this kind of building control – a genre where every cranny is a potential threat or refuge.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are two strangers cosmically bound by good taste in propertyThe layout of the tall, grimly teetering Bates residence in Alfred Hitchcock’sPsychois also indelible, with much terror contained in the festering lifelessness of its dusty corridors, basement and central, hazardous staircase. Before it was diluted with manifold sequels and spin-offs, James Wan’s originalThe Conjuringeffectively multiplied the malevolent possibilities of American gothic architecture with a hidden maze of traps, tunnels and chutes: a haunted mansion as a snakes-and-ladders board. The titular structure of Nobuhiko Obayashi’s landmark 1977 horrorHouse(BFI Player) is likewise conflicted: a heightened fairytale cottage that eventually all but drips blood.Not that a house needs to be quite so old or grandiose to carry this power. David Bruckner’s underrated 2021 spine-tinglerThe Night Houseis in thrall to the clean modernist lines and open spaces of a lakeside dream home built by the late architect husband ofRebecca Hall’s unravelling protagonist as she finds herself unable to shake his literal design for life. The flat, unremarkable proportions of the suburban craftsman house occupied by a tragedy-burdened family ofAri Aster’sHereditaryseem to stretch and sprawl to contain their unending grief: the home is shrunk and replicated in dioramas and miniatures byToni Collette’s brittle matriarch, but she still can’t command it.View image in fullscreen‘Unending grief’: Hereditary (2018).Photograph: AlamyAway from outright horror, the right (or wrong) house can still come with an uncanny aura. The obvious example is Hitchcock’s film of Daphne du Maurier’s romantic psychodramaRebecca(Filmzie), which honoured the novel’s lavish descriptions of the sumptuous, labyrinthine Manderley, and the mental burden that its scale and decor places on its young new mistress. A kind of American Manderley is the darkly looming mansion owned by Guy Pearce’s tortured capitalist inBrady Corbet’s recentThe Brutalist, a relic of an old order briefly disrupted and illuminated by modernist renovation – that highly covetable library designed byAdrien Brody’s immigrant architect ought alone to have won the film a production design Oscar – before sinking back into old-money murk.The immaculately appointed but soul-free colonial rectangle shared by Annette Bening’s uptight estate agent and Kevin Spacey’s increasingly louche wastrel inAmerican Beautyisn’t as lofty, but equally feels like a bricks-and-mortar monument to a soured American dream: all boxy conformity behind rose-lined picket fences, proudly maintained by one, chafed against by the other, suffocating all inside.View image in fullscreen‘A space that traps servants and masters alike’: Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite (2019).Photograph: Curzon Artificial Eye/ AllstarThe enviable, magazine-ready chicness of the exquisite city pad that houses most ofBong Joon-ho’sParasiteis just as claustrophobic in its own way, and indicative of money as power: a space that traps servants and masters alike in its immaculate, angular cocoon.

Once a niche alternative, it now lines supermarket shelves in endless varieties – oat, almond, soya, hazelnut, coconut, rice, pea – and is often the product of choice in coffee shops. Whether for ethical, environmental or dietary reasons, more and more people are ditching dairy. But not all plant milks are created equal. Some taste fantastic on their own but split in hot coffee or tea, some are ultra-processed, and others still have questionable sustainability credentials. Even so, according to the environmental charityHubbub, oat, almond and soy milk generate at least 68% fewer planet-warming emissions than conventional dairy milk, require less land and fresh water, and have a lower impact onwaterwaysthrough chemical run-off andeutrophication.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Here’s how they measure up.Best all-rounderCalifia Farms organic oat barista blendView image in fullscreen£2.30 at Ocado★★★★★A balanced, clean oat flavour, with mild sweetness and a smooth, creamy texture. Works well in coffee, tea, cereal and smoothies. It froths exceptionally well, too. It’s made with organic EU-grown oats, manufactured in Europe and free from gums or stabilisers.Califia Farmshas a sustainability initiative focused on reducing carbon emissions and improving packaging recyclability, and, alongside Plenish, isThe Good Shopping Guide’s best-scoring plant milk for sustainability.Best bargainThe Original Oatly whole oat long life drinkView image in fullscreen£2 for 1 litre at Asda£2 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆The pale cream colour is similar to that of dairy milk, and it has a subtle aroma and a relatively neutral flavour profile. Drunk straight,the mouthfeel was slightly cloying, but it works well in cereal, tea and filter coffee. It’s excellent for lattes and steams easily with a stable microfoam. Oatly calculates theclimate footprintof its products and puts this one at 0.49kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e)/kg, although the brand has a low sustainability score onThe Good Shopping Guide.And the rest …Plenish organic barista almondView image in fullscreen£2.25 for 1 litre at Tesco£12.99 for 6 x 1 litre at Amazon★★★★☆Crisp and white, with a clean mouthfeel and subtle almond aroma.

Steams well for lattes, too, but tricky to make latte art.Rude Health organic brown rice drinkView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 1 litre at Morrisons£2.30 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆Bright, white colour, with a fresh, clean flavour and a deliciously full taste that’s never overpowering. Very sweet, though. Best enjoyed straight, or in tea, cereal or smoothies. Not suitable for latte, because it won’t steam. It’s made with whole brown rice, including the bran, so it has a naturally sweet taste without added sugars. The ingredients include spring water, organic brown rice, organic cold-pressed sunflower oil and sea salt.Rude Healthis a certified B Corp.Plenish organic soyaView image in fullscreen£2.25 for 1 litre at Sainsbury’s£2.25 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆The flavour is balanced, and it has a subtle scent of soya beans.

Best enjoyed straight with tea or cereal. Not really suitable for coffee, though, because it develops a bitter flavour when heated; it’s also difficult to foam. Unlike many similar products, this is free from rapeseed oil, and I opted to include it here because hemp is such an incredible plant, which contributes to soil health and carbon sequestration.

From friluftsliv (the joy of the open air) to janteloven (realising you’re no better than others) here’s what I’ve learnedHelen RussellSat 8 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 12.45 ESTShareAfter more than a decade of Danish hygge, cycling through sleet, and learning to pronounce words made up mainly of vowel sounds, my family and I have moved back to the UK. And it’s been … bewildering. My Scandi adventure began as a one-year experiment when my husband’s job at Lego took us to Jutland, and I worked as a Scandinavia correspondent. But we found we loved living Danishly. We had three children – all born into a health system that to this day leaves me in awe.And I dedicated 12 years to researching what makes the ­Nordic countries so special (as well as where they fall short). I enjoyed a more straightforward existence, where once you knew the (very clear) social rules and how to play by them, life was relatively easy. But in September we head back to the UK, driven by family and work commitments. We moved to the countryside, swapping Danish bakeries and design shops for tractors and a ­scarcity of street lights. My children miss their friends, their school, the only home they’ve ever known and the culture they have grown up in. We’ve had to start over. The question is: can we bring a slice ofDenmarkhome with us, or have I ruined British life for ever by becoming too Danish?Here are 10 lessons I’m holding on to.1Janteloven: you’re not all that, and that’s fineDenmark’s social rule of janteloven–the idea that “you’re no better than anyone else” – keeps everyone grounded. Its education system is rooted in equality, with children calling teachers by their first names and collaboration prioritised over competition. There’s a flat hierarchical structure and high taxes help redistribute wealth – not a terrible plan sincemore equal societies are happier and healthier. Living Danishly means no one cares what car you drive, for example, and if they do, they’re incredibly dull. Back in the UK, this mindset helps keep a sense of perspective in a place where hierarchy is alive and well. It means not being overly impressed by status, titles or wealth – and I’m teaching my children to follow suit (overheard during a playdate: “My dad drives a Porsche!” My child: “But is he happy?”).2Trust is the glue of societyDanes trust their neighbours, institutions and even strangers, with74% believing “most people can be trusted”. So, babies are left to nap outside in their prams, children roam freely and people sell secondhand clothes from “trust stands” outside their homes. In the UK, trust can feel harder to come by, but it’s still there. While I probably wouldn’t have left my babies to sleep outside here (without risking being reported to social services), it’s not quite the dystopian hell­scape the algorithms might have us believe.When a parent I’d never met found out that we’d just moved and didn’t have a bike for a school outing, they lent me their son’s (plus helmet). No questions asked. The trust that I so valued in Denmark has tiny shoots poking through in UK ­communities. I want to foster this in my family; trusting others can become a self-fulfilling prophecy – with our expectations for the behaviour of othersproven to increase the likelihood of that behaviour, according to the founder of modern sociology, Robert K Merton.3Work-life balance isn’t a mythThe Danes are masters of the work-life balance, with a 37-hour work week as standard and OECD figures showing that theaverage Dane puts in only 33 hours a week. “It’s changed!” someone will always wail, with ­nostalgic Danes fearing this way of life is on its way out. But the balance is still better than elsewhere. I once visited Lego HQ at 5pm and the multistorey car park was empty. The result? Lower stress andhigher productivity. Returning to the UK’s hustle culture means the ­familiar rock-in-stomach stress from my London years ­resurfaces occasionally, but I’m holding on to the Danish ethos. This means no work between school pick-up and the kids’ bedtime, because this is sacred family time (child-free Danes tend to prioritise leisure activities in this 4-7pm slot since Danish office hours are typically 8-4pm). On the days when my husband works from home, he tries to do the same. After the children are in bed, I may resume work if deadlines are looming. But­studies show that we’re more productivewhen we’re well rested, so I know I’ll do a better job tomorrow if I sleep well tonight. Emails can wait, weekends are sacred. And burnouthelps no one(believe me, I’ve tried that too).4Rain or shine, get outside (somehow)Friluftsliv, or “open-air life”, is deeply ingrained in ­Nordic culture and spending time in nature has been shown toreduce stress. In Denmark, there’s “no such thing as bad weather, just the wrong clothes” as the proverb goes, and we’ve gone on family walks in snow, hail and rain that would make Noah reconsider his life choices. I’m sticking with friluftsliv in the UK, even if passersby give me strange looks (“You do know it’s ­raining?” Me: “Yes?”). Danes famously cycle everywhere, but this is a riskier proposition here. Gone are Denmark’s generous bike lanes and instead cyclists confront cars at full pelt on hairpin bends. The new plan? I’ve borrowed a teenager’s mountain bike and joined an off-road bike group to make the most of misty mornings, frost-covered fields and spectacular ­sunrises.5Family meals without the fussOne of the greatest gifts from our Danish years is the habit of eating together. This is non-­negotiable – TV off, phones away and everyone at the table for a home-cooked meal, proven to improve mental and physical health as well as ourrelationships. Thanks to a short working week, a daily family dinner is entirely poss­ible in Denmark and tends to be eaten early, something ourmetabolism and gut healthapparently thank us for.View image in fullscreen‘A family meal is non-negotiable. TV off, phones away – the moments of connection make it worthwhile.’Photograph: Emli Bendixen/The GuardianDanish food is unapologetically practical, designed to fuel rather than dazzle. Lunches might consist of hearty smørrebrød, and dinners are simple yet ­satisfying. Danes do indulgence well, too, with cakes, pastries, and an endless supply of salted liquorice. I’ve embraced this functional food philosophy back in the UK, bulk-buying rye bread and sticking with basic, ­balanced meals (though Denmark can keep its salted liquorice). Everyone’s starving by 5.30pm, so instead of filling up on snacks, we’ll eat dinner early, then have something else later if we’re peckish. On days when the schedule’s particularly hectic, one or more of us will eat on the hoof. Tupperware boxes are laden with hard-boiled eggs, chopped veg, cheese and great wedges of Lurpak on rye (Danes spread generously and even have a word, tandsmør or “tooth butter”, for when you slather so much butter on bread that teeth leave bitemarks. Bliss…). It’s not perfect, but it works. Just. Life here is busier, but between inevitable sibling rows and ­broccoli protests, there are moments of connection around the table that make it all worthwhile.6Volunteering is vitalNearly half of Danes volunteer, contributing to their communities through clubs, events and schools. In Denmark, if you want something – whether it’s a football team or a book club – you roll up your sleeves and make it happen. So here in the UK I’m leaning in to ­community events and volunteering at my local library. Ideally, there wouldn’t have been adecline in council-run librariesacross the UK, but because there is I’m doing what I can. If Denmark taught me anything, it’s that small acts of service build stronger communities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Danes prioritise daily moments of joy, so when the world feels like it’s on fire, they can cope and keep fighting the good fight. And it works, with Danes voted among the­happiest peopleon Earth. British life is more frenetic, but I’m determined to pause and savour the small things like a well-brewed coffee or candles while I work (a ­surprisingly effective productivity hack that keeps me from wandering off to the fridge or to put on laundry, thanks to my fear of leaving a naked flame unattended).8Independence is a giftVikings are allowed to take risks, learn from mistakes and develop independence early on. From two-year-olds dressing themselves to eight-year-olds cycling to school alone, there’s a collective confidence in giving children freedom in Denmark, whichhelps them flourish. A phrase beloved by my children’s teachers was that adults should “sit on their hands” – ie do nothing and let ­children work things out for themselves. In the UK, there’s more of a tendency to swoop in to help, and my natural impulse was to cocoon my children in bubble wrap. But during my research into Nordic child­rearing, I’ve learned the value of sitting on my hands. Letting them take age-appropriate risks, exercise autonomy and climb some seriously high trees has been hard, but watching them thrive has been worth it. There is a ­certain confidence and sense of mastery that comes from knowing how to make a bivouac, build a campfire, or just from running a little wild. Especially for girls, who typicallyplay ­outside in nature less than boysfrom ­preschool onwards, according to research from the ­University of Exeter. My daughter knows that she’s the best climber in our house and can regularly be found two and half metres up a tree, to the alarm of passing dog walkers. But she is happy, so I am, too. And if you ever see me talking to a tree, it’s ­probably because one of my children is up it.9Less really is moreDanish minimalism goes beyond design; it’s a way of life. From clothes to home decor, the approach taught me the beauty of having fewer things, of higher ­quality. Danes are a thrifty bunch (see high taxes) so these are often preloved, but even more modest homes have a few design touches. I’ve taken this to heart, keeping our UK home intentionally sparse – half of our belongings are still in boxes. I’m resisting the urge to clutter and fill every space. Instead, I’m focusing on creating a home that’s functional, cosy, and uniquely ours while observing the golden rules of Danish interiors (no big light; plenty of lamps; natural materials and tactile fabrics).10But being friendly never hurt anyoneThe kindness I experienced in Denmark didn’t always come quickly. There’s a general consensus that although people will help if you ask, they won’toffer. It was explained to me that this is because Vikings are independent, with autonomy so valued in Danish society. In pockets of England, however, peoplelovegetting in your business. Everyone knows what’s going on. At all times. Often, before I do. But you know what? As a new arrival, I’m all for it. I had neighbours in Denmark who didn’t speak to me for eight years. Here, I’ve moved straight into an episode of The Archers (my youngest has even picked up the accent). One new neighbour sent me the mostinsanelyuseful list of every­thing I might need to know in my new home (library, doctors, dentists). Another dropped off a lemon drizzle cake. The proactive help we have received has been totally unexpected and hugely appreciated.Leaving Denmark was one of the hardest decisions of my life. It’s counterintuitive to walk away from a life that’s been so good – and it’s easier to be happy in the Nordic countries where the reasons for unhappiness are removed or at least lessened. The true task is implementing all I’ve learned about living Danishly and raising Vikings – outside the Nordic bubble. In Denmark, life was neat, efficient and orderly. In the UK, nothing is. Instead, it’s cobbled together. There’s a patchwork of old varnish on every available surface in cafes and public spaces, with scuffed walls and worn carpets (as my youngest put it: “Everything in England is just … stickier”).But what the UK lacks in non-tacky surfaces, it makes up for in culture, diversity, humour and biscuits. It’s a balancing act, integrating what I loved about Denmark with the life we’re creating here, but I’m hopeful. As I settle back in the UK, I’m holding these 10 lessons close to help me stay grounded.

Something I was not coveting for myself. Living in London,I was not dating to find “the one” (statistically unlikely) or to commit for life (too long), I fell in love for sex, gossip and the subsequent weight loss that accompanied my broken heart a few years later. I felt very “French” about the whole thing, y’know; lovers, life experiences, smoking and motorbikes*. I thought I was living life brilliantly, but on reflection Tara must have thought I was a knob.“It’s supposed to be easy,” she told me.The moment I knew: ‘As we embraced, he suggested we get burgers’Read moreI was uncomprehending.“With the right person, it’s just … ”Tara shrugs, she cannot think of a better word.“Easy.”I felt sorry for the poor woman. “Easy” I interpreted as boring. “She must have settled,” I thought to myself. “And now she’s trying to rebrand the monotony of her marriage as a plus.” Sorry Tara.Cut to 15 years later. I was old. In my 30s** for God’s sake, something I had sworn would not happen to me. I had not reflected on Tara’s words; I had continued in serial monogamy; had trysts and flings and chanced impregnation with anyone I thought would make a decent co-parent. I did fear I’d never have a family, but I didn’t believe my life would be poorer for that. To be stuck in an unfulfilling relationship – that was my idea of misery.After another sad breakup (I was so thin) a friend moved to the UK from Australia. His name was Steen (pronounced “Steve” if you work in a coffee shop or “Sting” if you’re my father). We knew each other from the comedy circuit and had bumped into one another at festivals in Edinburgh and Melbourne. He was young and tall, liked sport and was a confident dancer.One night we went bowling and stayed for the disco. We were singing along to Christina Aguilera’s Dirrty and drinking wine from the bottle (we’d accidentally smashed our glasses). Steen was attempting to strut like he was in chaps, glugging warm chardonnay and smiling at me.View image in fullscreenSteen Raskopoulos and Sara Pascoe.As I watched this guy, I realised his company was the easiest I’d ever been in. I was so comfortable spending time with him I hadn’t noticed I’d been falling in love. This wasn’t a huge thunderbolt moment – I didn’t ask the DJ to turn the music down so I could propose. I didn’t even declare my feelings or kiss him. But into my head popped Tara’s words a decade and a half earlier and I realised the rightness of this person.We have two kids now. We had an awful time conceiving, years of infertility, procedures and miscarriage. Then IVF through Covid lockdowns and all that anxiety and heartbreak. And now having kids is even harder, haha, as they don’t sleep and my brain is broken and the house is so messy and Steen and I both have erratic and stressful careers.The only easy bit is loving him, still. If your relationship is simple and straightforward that means you can focus your energy on actual hard stuff – things that should be tricky.I know it sounds dull, as it once did to me. Here is a more succinct way of putting it that I saw on a meme: “You don’t need butterflies in your stomach, you need someone who calms your nervous system.”Romantic bliss is more boring than you might imagine.* Emotional motorbikes.

By the end, everything ached. I empathise with my patients, for sure. You feel connected to the universe, helping to prolong the lives of animals.People say,“I’ve got a knee problem, a back problem. Can you operate onme?” If I did, I’d lose my licence.I grew up on a farmin Ireland. I was lambing sheep from the age of seven. I remember losing a lamb as young child. I lay on the grass, looked up to heaven and wished I’d been better. When I got into Led Zeppelin, I imagined there was an actual stairway to heaven. I built a superhero in my head called Vet Man, who would save the world, and set about getting myself educated.We often put on the radioand television for the animals.

I remember once standing on a bale of hay, playing a broom handle. My father asked what I was doing. I said: “I’m playing guitar.” He said: “There’ll be no guitar around here,” then he handed me a saw to chop the horns off some cattle.Two years ago,Brian May came to my live show,Beyond Supervet. He’s got a wildlife centre and is very sweet. He said: “Wouldn’t it be funny if you pulled out a guitar?” I told him I couldn’t play and he said it’s not that hard. I said, “How about I give you a scalpel and say: ‘Put a bionic leg on that dog? How hard can it be?’”Brian actuallytaught me a song, then I got myself a guitar teacher and my band, Fitzpatrick, played the Isle of Wight festival last year. He told me to name the band Fitzpatrick. I told him it was a crap name. He said: “That’s funny.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Annabel Miller. Archive photograph: Finn Taylor/The GuardianJordan Stephens and Harley Alexander-Sulé started making music at the Brit school for performing arts in south London. In 2011, they released their debut album, Stereo Typical, which featured Top 10 hits including Down With the Trumpets and Mama Do the Hump. Rizzle Kicks went on hiatus in 2016, due to addiction and mental health problems. They are now back withCompetition Is for Losers, their first album in a decade.JordanThis photo was taken when our first album came out, but I have no memory of the shoot. Apparently we were hungover, which makes sense given we were 18. But I do remember that jumper. It was from American Apparel and I had it in three different colours. It had a specific smell. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but it was probably cigarettes. Nike had given us trainers, which felt like a massive deal. Overall, a snapback and skinny jeans was not a great look for me.Once we got a record deal, we moved out of Brighton and into a house-share in north London which we named The Dungeon. It was very “uni”. We’d have these parties and people would piss in the corners of the front room. For a long time, there was a bowl of Super Noodles with batteries in it that nobody put in the bin. I once ate an egg that was three months old. Apparently it was an in-joke to keep it in the fridge, but no one told me. Eventually, Harley moved to Fulham and I only went over a handful of times: once for a photoshoot; another time I was really stoned and I ordered Chinese. For a while, we lived separate lives.I’ve known Harley most of my life, but it wasn’t until the Brit school that we decided to do music together. I’d known for a long time that being a musician was my destiny, to the extent that I was totally delusional. Unhinged. The way people describe me at that time is reminiscent of a current-day Kanye. I’d roll up to the yard and be like, “Listen, I’m going to be huge one day.” I used to get teased about it, but I did not care. Harley was less sure about our future. He actually wanted to go to drama school, but I was like, “Nah. Give us a year. We can do this.” Four months later, we had signed a deal.Rizzle Kicks’ Down With the TrumpetsWhile I was good at being “on” for interviews, I always found it exhausting. We were like children, and I felt like a total mess most of the time. Once the first album came out, there was a lot of pressure for us to repeat its success. For Stereo Typical, we did whatever we wanted creatively. We recouped our advance quickly, and the record went platinum. The second came out and it went gold, but the label started to ask stuff like, “Why do you not just make a song that sounds like that other artist’s No 1?” Around that time, I started to do a lot of drugs while making some of the worst music of my life. I tried pop, then rock, then bass-driven funk. I was certain the new album was going to be a hit. Instead, it tore us apart as I wasn’t giving Harley the space to create. The album never got released, so there wasn’t even an upside to me stepping on Harley. Naturally, he wanted to do his own thing.The panic attack that sent Harley into a place of submission ended up exposing both of our frailties. It was 2016, and I had been on an all-nighter when he called. I’d done some really horrendous DJ set at a shoe store, while Harley had been performing a solo showcase to the music industry. It was a big opportunity for him, but afterwards his adrenaline was through the roof. He called me up and started panicking, but I was completely wired, too. From that point on it was a reconnection between the two of us.Time is a huge factor when it comes to sustaining a relationship. I don’t think people should be afraid to let friendships disappear. Over the course of my life with Harley, we’ve moved apart, changed partners, I’ve got sober. During all of those transitions people fade away. But the good ones always come back, like the tide of the sea.HarleyIn every picture or video from this period, we are smoking. There was no point at which either of us was not smoking, whether we were in a hotel or a green room. Before we got signed, we could only afford rolling tobacco and we’d make a packet last for two weeks. Then suddenly we had enough money to buy straight cigarettes. I thought, “Oh my God. Now I can smoke all day, every day.”I remember when I first met Jordan. My stepdad and Jordan’s auntie worked together, so they suggested we had some play dates. I was six years old and it was in my garden in London. Mum bought a plastic slide, and me and Jordan went up and down on it for hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Just by coincidence, mine and Jordan’s families both moved to Brighton at the same time. When I saw him again, I recognised him instantly as the kid I went on the slide with. I can’t tell you what I did yesterday, but I remember that moment vividly.Matt Goss looks back: ‘I’d like another Bros experience. Something massive, Bros on steroids. Bigger, the biggest’Read moreJordan and I were rolling in the same circles a lot as teenagers. We were 17 at the inception ofRizzle Kicks, and things escalated quickly. We got management, shot a video, then got signed. Because of how fast it went, we became delusional about how easy it was to get successful. It felt like everything we did worked the first time, when it takes years for most artists.Jordan and I were spending so much of our lives together, but none of it was quality time. It was work. After the second album, there was a period when making music stopped feeling good. In those sessions, Jordan was writing so fast, and I felt I had lost connection with what we were doing. I went to Paris for a while and started working on new songs. Then everything fell apart.When I was struggling with anxiety, Jordan was the only person I could really open up to. He has always been someone that I’ve felt comfortable being honest with, because he’s like a sponge, in a good way. It’s like he knows everything about everything. He doesn’t, really, but it can feel like that. If I’ve got a problem, he’ll know how to solve it.At one point, Jordan tried to make a documentary about my recovery from anxiety. But deep down I knew that, for the film to work, there needed to be an arc. One with a happy ending. Ours would be me getting on stage and performing again. I quickly realised the production team would have to wait at least five years to get that resolution, and the stress of that was making me feel worse. So we stopped completely. Which I am glad about because, actually, five years was too ambitious. It was only three months ago that I could walk out on stage again, for the first time since 2016. In the run-up I was rattled, definitely. I just wanted to get it done. But when I got up there, it was unbelievable. I’ve never seen so many people smiling back at me, Jordan included.Explore more on these topicsRizzle KicksFlashbackHip-hopPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sigmon was the oldest person to be executed in the state’s history and his death was part of aseries of rapidkillings the state haspursuedin the last six months as it revives capital punishment.After a 13-year pause, South Carolina now directs men on death row to choose their method of death – electric chair, lethal injection or firing squad. The development has been widely condemned by human rights activists and anti-death penalty groups.Sigmon, who was convicted of the 2001 murders of his ex-girlfriend’s parents, David and Gladys Larke, chose to be shot to death due to unclear information about drugs used in legal injections and fears they could take a long time to work.“As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject,” Collins wrote.“In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.“I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend’s parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead,” he added.Collins then went on to detail the firing squad and experience of witnessing it.“It’s impossible to know what to expect when you’ve never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you,” he said.“The firing squad is certainly faster – and more violent – than lethal injection. It’s a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon’s lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon’s head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.”“About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon’s whole body flinched,” he wrote.“A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.“A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08pm.“Then we left through the same door we came in,” he added.Sigmon’s lawyers have said it was “barbaric” to make the men on death row choose the method of their death and argued the state was obliged to provide more information about lethal injection drugs. His last words included a plea for an end to the death penalty.His last words, shared by his attorneys, read in part: “I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to help us end the death penalty. An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty. At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was.”Collins’ essay also detailed the impact of witnessing the shooting.“I won’t forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on,” he wrote.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaCapital punishmentUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Since restrictions were lifted, she has visited more than 30 countries and founded a travel agency, Kaijego.On 15 March, the 26-year-old will attempt to fulfil another ambition: breaking the Guinness world record for the shortest time traversing all seven continents.“It is the most ‘do it afraid’ thing I’ve done in my life,” she said.If she succeeds, she will join a string of freshly minted record-holders in west Africa, where a new generation ispassionately embracing breaking records. Since 2023, there have been more than 7,000 applications from the region’s 16 countries, according to Nicholas Brookes, the marketing director atGuinness World Records (GWR).Asinobi, who travelled to other countries to obtain some of the 10 visas needed for the challenge, wants to highlight the difficulties posed by travelling with a “low-mobility” passport. On the2025 Henley Passport Index, which ranks 199 countries by travel freedoms, Nigeria is tied in 88th place with Ethiopia and Myanmar.View image in fullscreenAlma Asinobi, pictured in Vancouver, had to travel to other countries to obtain some of the 10 visas needed for her trip.Photograph: Chinonso ChukwuogorNigerian travellers routinely complain of being pulled out of immigration queues or not being allowed to board flights for mundane reasons at border controls in Europe, North America and even inAfrica.“My dreams will not be limited by the colour of my skin or the colour of my passport,” Asinobi said.In September 2023, officials in Egypt kept her from proceeding to Jordan and Qatar for an hour, claiming that due to an airline policy she had to show a return ticket to Nigeria.“When people say ‘it’s the policy’, they expect that you just keep quiet,” said Asinobi, whose checked-in luggage on that occasion was sent to another city and never recovered. “In two minutes, the matter was resolved automatically when I said they had to show me where that policy was.”GWR rules require her to step foot on all seven continents by briefly leaving the airports she will fly between, and to document her journey with evidence at landmarks.

I just have to take one step at a time and ensure that I’m going at maximum speed. I’m obeying all the rules and I’m staying on track until I get to Australia.”For months, Asinobi had been preparing to break the2023 recordof 73 hours. But on Thursday evening she discovered that an American national, Johnny Buckingham,had been certifiedas the new record holder with a time of 64 hours, travelled in February.On Friday morning she posted on X: “Am I crazy enough to challenge a US Airforce veteran to break a mission-planning record with barely a week to plan? YES.”Asinobi hopes to break another record – the most signatures on a piece of travel memorabilia – by asking thousands of people to sign a Nigerian flag she is travelling with at a party in Lagos on her return.Fellow Nigerians have rallied to her cause. “This here is bravery and I salute this,” said Fiyinfoluwa Akinsiku, a Worcestershire-based doctor who circled the world with a Nigerian passport in nine years, including a 2019 trip to Antarctica. “Can’t wait to welcome you to the elite club of less than 1% of the world’s population to travel to all seven continents.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaGuinness World RecordsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The winner is presented with a presidential chain fashioned by beer bottle tops and boar’s tusks.President John Herlihy has held the role for eight years. He says his children, grandchildren and friends pushed him into it, and it keeps him busy.View image in fullscreenPresident John Herlihy outside the Whangamōmona Hotel after winning the biennial election in 2021.Photograph: Australian Associated Press/AlamyWhangamōmona has a handful of buildings including a pub, arts and crafts shop and a small school. But there are challenges as the eccentric town sees growing numbers of tourists and pressure to upgrade its internet availability, which some residents would prefer to live without.“How many visitors can we handle? We get peopled out,” Herlihy says.Forgotten World highwayWhangamōmona’s journey to become a republic began in 1989, when a local government reform process redrew the boundaries of district and county councils. The reforms meant the town would be part of theManawatū-Whanganui region, rather than Taranaki– and residents weren’t happy.“Someone said, why don’t we … form our own patch. And that evolved into forming a republic,” Stratford district mayor Neil Volzke says. Stratford is about an hour away, the nearest large town to Whangamōmona.“They elected a president and declared themselves a republic. It’s a mocking of the whole system. But it captured the imagination of people: here’s this tiny, rural community giving the middle finger to the bureaucracy.”View image in fullscreenThe Whangamōmona Hotel was built in 1912 and is the heart of the republic.Photograph: Robin Weaver/AlamyResidents in the republicstill pay rates tothe Stratford district council and parts of its environmental governance fall under the Manawatū-Whanganui council. The town raises revenue from selling merchandise and passports to visitors for NZ$5 and seeks outside funding to support republic day.Whangamōmona lies on thenarrow State Highway 43, known as the Forgotten World highway, one of the most remote roads in the country. Along the road the land transitions from rich dairy pastures to rolling hills, to steep cattle country, and thickets of native bush that enclose the tiny settlement of Whangamōmona. Its borders are delineated by signage.Parts of The Forgotten World Highway have onlyrecently been sealed. The road was dug out by early European settlers, who laid rail to transport goods, cattle and passengers through ravines and once bustling towns and tunnels cut into the earth from the region’s coal mining days. When the passenger train made its final stop in the early 1980s, an economic lifeline disappeared, along with the population.Today, Whangamōmona and the surrounds are home to an estimated 150 residents, but it’s difficult to get an accurate figure as some locals resist filling out the census. There’s no store for basic supplies like bread and internet connection is marginal.Locals tried to fight the installation of mobile phone coverage, Volzke says.“They loved witnessing the moment tourists would pull out their phone and discover no service.”map of whangamomona“There’s some real characters. Some are four, five generations-deep farmers, others are contractors doing things like fencing. There are transients, others are seeking to escape the system and authority who can live off-grid in alternative lifestyles,” he says.‘It’s old New Zealand’Tourism has created some tension in the town between needing tourist dollars to keep the place alive and maintaining their independent way of life. Herlihy laments the sealing of the old road.“I wanted it left as it was. But there was a push for tourism by the council,” he says.Herlihy says there’s a cult status to the place, especially with international visitors.“During summer, it’s becoming impossible to find a table at the hotel.”At the Whangamōmona Hotel, visitors can buy Whangamōmona passports, or receive a formal stamp in their own, which provides the township NZ$15,000 annually and contributes to upkeep of the handful of buildings.View image in fullscreenHotelier Vicki Pratt describes the hotel as ‘part of our history that needs to be kept for the next generations to come’.Photograph: Anna Rankin/The GuardianVicki Pratt has owned the hotel for 11 years, and it’s now for sale. Pratt says the hotel is “iconic” and “warm” and notes there’s never been a fight in the bar. Recently, the hotel got mobile coverage, but is still mostly without wifi, with some pockets available outside.“Before, everyone had to mix and mingle, like the old days. If I had my way I’d block all internet in this area”.The hotel operated as a hospital during the 1918 influenza. Guests have reported ghost sightings, including road worker Joseph Lewandowski, born in 1879 and whose portrait Pratt commissioned to depict the hardship faced by early residents.View image in fullscreenThe church at Whangamōmona.Photograph: Robin Weaver/Alamy“But people are the salt of the earth here – it’s old New Zealand. They always pay it forward. If someone breaks down on the roadside they’ll be helped, if someone passes away the community will chop firewood or shear their sheep.”It takes a certain kind of person to live here, agrees local arts and crafts proprietor Tracey Haskell. Even after 20 odd years she isn’t considered a local.“People are welcomed, but you’ve got to show you have something to contribute”.“I love the remoteness – I could have been born in another century. I like that you have to make an effort to do your shopping.” Haskell lives 19km down the highway and says Whangamōmona is now too busy for her.“It’s a tight knit community, though in different ways. We’re all fairly different and staunch. This place represents the freedom to do what I want.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t his first feint and retreat. It probably won’t be the last.A day after imposing steep tariffs on his country’s neighbors, the US president announced a month-long reprieve for carmakers. The following day, tariffs were also suspended onalmost all goods from Canada and Mexico.Tariffs onChina, levied at a 10% rate in February and doubled to 20% on Tuesday, remain in place. Trump and his aides are now trailing a fresh wave of tariffs in early April as “the big one”, with myriad markets – including the European Union – and industries in their sights.Each abrupt and erratic jerk and jolt on policy in Washington reverberates around the world, with firms in the US and far beyond trying to keep track of developments from one day to the next – and figure out what they mean.The architects of Trumponomics insist it will pave the way for a greater, more prosperous future. But firms are struggling to make out the economic landscape now, let alone what might happen next.“When you have such a high level of uncertainty, and have a set of policies that seem to impact every part of the economy ... it leads to businesses essentially being frozen,” said Sameera Fazili, former deputy director of the national economic council (NEC) under Joe Biden. “They’re not able to make investments. They’re not able to make plans. They’re not able to make hiring decisions.“Because they don’t know where these policies are going to head. These policies are going to have such an impact on their bottom line.”In the four short months since his election victory last November, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs onCanadaand Mexico in January; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in February; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; briefly imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; revoked those tariffs on most goods; and threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in April.For companies attempting to navigate North America – from car manufacturers to juice makers – the world shifted, and shifted back, at a dizzying pace in a matter of days. “I don’t know how they navigate it,” said Fazili. “You can’t run a business with one-month cliffs around you all the time.”“This is not a moment to celebrate,” Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said after Thursday’s latest delay. “The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll.“We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People’s livelihoods are at stake.”As a campaigner, Trump’s great political skill is his ability to use rhetoric – often brash, crude and even false – to bend perception of reality.The president’s rhetoric can leave listeners with the impression that tariffs will revitalize America’s industrial heartlands, and fill up the federal government’s coffers with trillions of dollars from other countries, with only a minor impact on US consumers.“The countries and companies that have been ripping us aren’t particularly happy with what I’m doing,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. Sure, tariffs might bring about “a little short-term interruption” in theUS economy, he conceded, but “I don’t think it’s going to be big”.But the reality of tariffs is trickier. Tariffs are generally paid by importers, for starters – in this case, US companies buying goods from overseas – not exporters, who sell the products, or the countries where they are based. Many of these US firmsquickly made plain this weekthat they would pass on these higher costs to their customers.While Trump has used the threat of tariffs to encourage overseas firms to relocate their factories to the US, such longer-term investments are harder for executives to plan when they do not know which duties will be in place next week.Seven weeks into his second term, as many Americans grapple with the cost of living after years of higher inflation, Trump continues to blame Joe Biden. “We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” he said during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night.The US economy is not in a state of catastrophe, having shown remarkable resilience in the years following the end of the pandemic. The biggest issue has been inflation, which surged to its highest level in a generation three years ago, but has since fallen dramatically from this peak.Presidents typically “move on quickly, or don’t criticize their predecessors by name”, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “Here’s another norm that Trump has exploded. Trump has no limits and his base lets him get away with anything. So expect it to continue.”But should prices rise as a direct result of Trump’s decisions – as many economists and business leaders have warned – it will grow more challenging to blame Biden for day-to-day affordability challenges.On the campaign trail last year, Trump repeatedly pledged to “rapidly” bring down prices from “day one” of his second administration. “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,” hedeclaredon the eve of November’s election.Only after winning did he acknowledge how difficult this would be. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up,” hetold Timea few weeks his victory. “You know, it’s very hard.”It is one thing to play down higher prices and bills as “a little short-term interruption” when they’re a risk. Should they become reality, such rhetoric is less likely to wash.“Once you’re in charge, you’re in charge,” said Fazili. “And if there’s a problem in the economy, people look to you to fix it.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyUS small businessTrump administrationDonald TrumpMexicoChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But Tesla, one of the world’s biggest corporate names, does not have a conventional chief executive.After Elon Muskbacked Alternative für Deutschland(AfD) – calling the party Germany’s “only hope” – voters are considering an alternative to Tesla. Data released on Thursday showed that registrations of the company’s electric cars in Germany fell 76% to 1,429 last month. Overall, electric vehicle registrations rose by 31%.Tesla’s biggest shareholder, who has voiced support for rightwing leaders around the world, is now a de facto US cabinet member under Donald Trump’s administration.Could Elon Musk’s newfound political influence help him finally crack India?Read moreTesla’s valuation has become inextricably tied to Musk’s politics. After he spent $288m backing Trump’s 2024 election victory, Tesla’svaluation passed $1tn. Yet Musk’s political involvements – unprecedented for the head of a company that size – could also be having a negative effect.On Friday, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists occupied aTeslastore in central Milan. Activists chained themselves to the cars’ tyres, and others glued themselves to the windows along with the slogans “Make millionaires pay again” and “Ecology for all, no ecofascism”.Analysts are openly wondering if Musk is causing lasting damage to a brand he has made synonymous with electric cars and, by extension, liberal aspirations to tackle climate change.Tesla was approached for comment.Tesla was the world’s biggest producer of battery electric cars in 2024, but sales dropped to 1.79m, the first time the company has endured a sales decline since 2011 after years of rapid growth that made it the world’s most valuable carmaker.The manufacturer said in January that global sales would grow during 2025, and Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 2m cars this year. But even those forecasts would hardly represent a blazing return to form. As recently as October, Musk said he expected 20% to 30% annual sales growth, implying as many as 2.3m cars sold.“Customer retention will be key in 2025 as customers may begin to look for an ‘Alternative for Tesla’,” said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst.View image in fullscreenSome analysts fear for Tesla’s future, others are more optimistic and the dent in sales limited to 5%.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/ReutersOther analysts are more optimistic. Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, a US financial firm, is a longstanding Tesla supporter. Ives believes the company’s share price could rise from its current level of about $280 to hit $550. However, he acknowledged the negative perception created by Musk’s partnership with Trump and his work on the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) – an issue he described as the “elephant in the room” for the brand.Calling them “major brand worries for Tesla”, he added in a note to investors that the direct impact on sales should be relatively small. “We estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues despite the global draconian narrative for Musk.”Ives said that Tesla was on the verge of making a new, cheaper vehicle – costing less than $35,000 – andwould “own” the autonomous vehicle market, factors that would help push Tesla to a valuation of more than $2tn..Nonetheless there are clear signs in the US, Tesla’s biggest market, that would-be buyers are wavering, according to Strategic Vision, a market research company. Its new vehicle experience study tracks the buying preferences of up to 250,000 car buyers in the US, and it shows a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Muskbought Twitter(now X) in 2022.Shortly before the multibillionaire bought the social media platform, 22% of new vehicle buyers would have “definitely” considered buying a Tesla. By the end of 2024 it was just under 8%. The proportion who would not consider buying a Tesla has risen from 39% over the same period to 63%.According to Strategic Vision, approximately half of non-Tesla EV buyers identify as Democrat or liberal, compared with about 20% identifying as Republican or conservative. Among Tesla owners, the Democrat owner group has fallen from 40% during the Biden administration to 29% now, with the Republican group averaging about 30% since 2021.“Democrats, the majority party of EV owners, are now actively rejecting Tesla and choosing other options,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision.Meanwhile, global protests against Musk and Tesla are intensifying. In America, there have been demonstrations outside dozens of Tesla showrooms, while in the UK a guerrilla poster campaign – “0 to 1939 in 3 seconds” – has emphasised Musk’sfascist-style salute at an inauguration rally. In Germany, he was recently caricatured on a carnival float as “Napo-Elon”.Ross Gerber, chief executive of the US investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which holds shares in Tesla, said Musk had given people an outlet to express their disdain for his politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s ironic because the vehicles were made for liberals who care about the environment and it has become a symbol of the conservative movement.”Tesla is valued at about $847bn – still more than the next 10 carmakers combined. Few investment banks have included any effect from Musk in their work trying to accurately value Tesla. Still, there are further reports of falling sales. In Australia,February sales were down about 72%compared with the same month in 2024, according to data released this week.View image in fullscreenIn Australia, Tesla sales were down 72% in February compared with the same month in 2024.Photograph: Jason Reed/ReutersSeveral analysts have raised concerns that the current valuation is much too high. JP Morgan is among the most pessimistic of the investment banks, suggesting that Tesla’s share price could fall as low as $135 – or a valuation closer to $400bn. Musk is the largest shareholder in Tesla, a key contributor to his status as the world’s wealthiest person.“Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals,” wrote JP Morgan in January, pointing out that 2025 profit expectations were down 70% since 2022. The share price has more than doubled since then – something that would not usually happen when investors expect lower profits.Analysts at UBS, a Swiss investment bank, concur, saying that Tesla’s valuation “continues to confound us”, with big risks in its efforts to make money from self-driving cars or humanoid robots.While sales declined steeply in January in several markets, several analysts have warned against relying on numbers for a single month. Schmidt said: “Some consumers are likely holding back purchase decisions and waiting for the updated Model Y which arrives this month. The big question though is, are these just the die-hard Tesla enthusiasts which remain in line while other potential consumers jump ship?”There have also been positive signs elsewhere. UK Tesla sales fell in January, butbounced back by a fifthin February to leave sales up year-on-year for 2025 so far. In the US there were also signs of a recovery after a fall in January, with preliminary data for February indicating rebound sales of about 42,000 cars, up 14% year-on-year, according to Wards Intelligence.But the UK sales figures also highlight another concern for investors: that Tesla’s lead on rivals could be narrowingas a flood of new models arrive. Tesla’s electric market share for the first two months of 2025 was 11%, down from 14% in 2024, according to New Automotive, a research group.Ben Nelmes, New Automotive’s chief executive, said: “The impact of Elon Musk’s political views on Tesla’s sales may have been overstated, but Tesla is gradually losing its position as the dominant EV seller in the UK as other carmakers bring more up-to-date and cheaper models to market.”In China Tesla is under big pressure from a slew of cheaper competitors, most notably BYD. In Tesla’s second-biggest market, sales of its China-made EVs dropped 49% year-on-year in February, to the lowest level since August 2022.Edward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous – a 2019 book about Tesla which focuses on Musk’s habit of making bold claims about the business that don’t stack up – argues that the prospect for new business like robotaxis and robots are distant. “The unique moment that we’re in now is the business has peaked,” he said.The worry for Tesla investors is whether Musk has turned that peak into a cliff-edge.Additional reporting Lorenzo TondoExplore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industryDonald TrumpUS politicsGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ishiguro, now 70 and in receipt of a Nobel prize in literature and a knighthood, has fetched the elegant cakes himself, and is immediately solicitous. Am I chilly? Am I hungry? Am I worried whether my device will record our conversation?It’s an attentiveness to minute, even mundane detail that is evident in all his work. From The Unconsoled to The Remains of the Day, Ishiguro is the creator of some of the most unsettling and memorable fiction of the last 40 years. But perhaps no book of his is more loved than his sixth novel, Never Let Me Go, which has outsold all his others and been adapted not only into a major film but now a stage production.Still finding new readers 20 years after its publication, the novel is credited by the author with starting a train of thought and thematic inquiry that shaped its successors, The Buried Giant a decade ago, and 2021’s Klara and the Sun. All three, Ishiguro believes, are centred around the most basic and unavoidable fact: we are all going to die, and yet we must live as if we aren’t. Never Let Me Go is set in a society in which children are cloned in order to provide healthy organs to extend the lives of others; after two or three of these involuntary “donations”, they will “complete”, or die. But a rumour circulates among them that in some cases – if you can prove you are truly in love, for example – you may be granted an exemption from the process; you may be allowed to live.It is this unfounded belief that there may be a means of escape that powers the novel’s emotional heart. “Somewhere, irrationally, we can’t quite accept our fate,” Ishiguro explains, “and we long for this special dispensation. I think that it’s not just because we want to carry on living on and on and on. I think it’s because we don’t want to face the pain and sorrow and loneliness that comes with death. We fear the loss of loved ones. We fear the parting.”The novel’s title is a song that its narrator, Kathy H, plays on repeat during her time at the clones’ boarding school, Hailsham; it is both a physical possession, on a cassette tape that is later lost and which she searches to replace, and a talisman, an emblem of a time before she knew how her life, and those of her friends Tommy and Ruth, would develop. Ishiguro invented the song, which was later recorded by his friend and collaborator, the jazz musician Stacey Kent; subsequently, he taught himself to play it – he gestures towards a baby grand piano in the corner – “but that was very much after the fact, so that if anyone asked me about it, I’m not embarrassed by being totally ignorant”.It is a romantic song, of course, but its plaintive, beseeching title can be addressed not only to a lover, but to life itself; a plea for continuation and connection. “I think that’s an instinct that is strong in all of us. And it seems to me there’s something sad about it, but there is something quite admirable as well. There’s some kind of courage there, and an affirming of the good things about being alive, in that instinct of saying: look, it hasn’t been easy to build love and family and friendship, but I’ve done it and surely we can, all of us, just have a little bit more.”I’ve never been a great writer of prose. I can’t do it. It’s not out of choiceNever Let Me Go had a long gestation period, as Ishiguro explains in his introduction to a new edition; for many years, it existed merely as thoughts and notes about a group of students whose lifespan – perhaps as the result of a nuclear accident – was markedly different from their peers. The breakthrough came via a combination of external factors and timing: societal interest in the potential benefits and dangers of cloning, at its most headline-grabbing in the shape of Dolly the sheep; and a shift in writing and publishing that made a place in so-called literary novels for the techniques and practices of speculative fiction.“I gave myself permission to use what traditionally might have been called genre tropes,” Ishiguro explains. “And that wasn’t because I was being terribly brave or anything. I think the climate around me changed; the next generation of writers, people about 15 years younger than me, didn’t see anything weird about it, at least the people I happened to become friends with, David Mitchell or Alex Garland. They were taking their cues from all kinds of places and I really liked their work.”Alongside the feel of dystopic science fiction that attends Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro also detects a relationship with another emerging genre. Its readership has far exceeded that of his other novels, including The Remains of the Day, and is responsible, he says, for the noticeable numbers of younger people who come to events and readings: “I think one of the reasons is that it’s like a YA book before YA was a label. It’s not meant necessarily for young people, but it’s got a lot of what have now become the tropes of a YA novel: children at school together, jealousies and little power battles. I think that’s part of the reason it keeps finding a readership; it’s a YA novel that then expands into something else.”View image in fullscreenIshiguro collects the Nobel prize in Stockholm, 2017.Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/AFP/Getty ImagesHe is amusing and illuminating about the insulated feel to literary fiction prior to the 1990s: the novelists that featured alongside him on the celebrated inaugural list of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists in 1983 – Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes and Pat Barker among them – may have been a new generation, but they were still associated with those who had come immediately before. “I think, literally, the Sunday Times magazine that had our photograph actually said: Will these be the future William Goldings and Graham Greenes?” Ishiguro remembers.“It was a fairly compartmentalised bit of the publishing world, and we weren’t supposed to be part of this other stuff. Although we made less money and didn’t sell any books, we were rather proud of the fact that we were proper literature people and understood literary values, and we understood the value of each other’s work. It was that kind of coterie, and so the idea of science fiction was quite frowned on.” I ask him about a counter-example, fellow Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, who moved between genres with apparent freedom. He smiles in perhaps slightly wistful agreement: “Well, I suppose she didn’t give a shit. She went with her imagination, Margaret Atwood as well, more recently. I mean, these people, they didn’t care about such things.”But when the literary landscape started to change, Ishiguro was well placed, in terms of influence and temperament, to take advantage of the loosening of the stays. He had both read and created comics – he is ambivalent about the term “graphic novel” – since he was a child, and a lifelong passion for music and film gave him a different perspective on the idea of mixing styles and genres. His heroes were Bob Dylan, swapping folk protest music for rock’n’roll for country and western, or Miles Davis or even Picasso; and in film, he had the constantly shifting figure of Stanley Kubrick, with A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon all in his imaginative wheelhouse, to inspire him.Aren’t you a bit like that, too, I ask him: you moved from the Japanese setting of your early novels, to the country-house environment of The Remains of the Day, to the wild, dreamlike indeterminacy of The Unconsoled, after all. “Yes,” he replies, laughing, “I do it consciously because I’m emulating Bob Dylan and Stanley Kubrick.”View image in fullscreenCarey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in the 2010 film adaptation of Never Let Me Go.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyHaving recently seen Timothée Chalamet as Dylan in A Complete Unknown, he says he wonders how aware the singer was of the consternation he would cause when he chose to use a Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar; whether, even, there was a certain naivety at work. “I have no idea. I can’t get inside Dylan’s mind.” Certainly in terms of the differences between his own books, he says, “I was following something more internal. I wasn’t angling for someone to shout ‘Judas’.”It’s hard to imagine angry crowds challenging Ishiguro, who is unfailingly polite and self-effacing, and who has written so piercingly about the human tendency to become entangled in self-deception and contradiction. And his ability to see beneath surface motivations is also applied inward. Despite enthusiastically embracing the flow of genres and styles, Ishiguro is strikingly insistent on his own limitations. As we’re talking about his preference for first-person narratives, and his commitment to creating distinctive voices who will establish the tone and content of his novels, he makes a frank declaration. “You have to understand, I have to also play to my strengths and not to my weaknesses,” he says, and then, “I’ve never been a great writer of prose.”It’s quite difficult not to point out – and indeed, I do – that he won the Nobel prize and so, definitionally, he must be pretty great. “There are all kinds of good ways to write. One of them definitely is to write wonderful, virtuosic prose. There’s no doubt about it. Sometimes I read things and I marvel at the beauty of the actual prose.” And you don’t think that’s you? “Well, I can’t do it. It’s not out of choice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It is unsurprising to discover that he is currently at work on a novel set in the compartment of a train; you can almost already imagine how claustrophobic it will be, how obscurely significant its journey, how bewildered its passengers.And yet, he explains, it’s more lighthearted than that; something he wrote as an antidote to the pressures of travelling when he was promoting the 2022 film Living, for which he adapted Kurosawa’s film Ikiru, transplanting the action to 1950s London. Its protagonist, a bureaucrat who is terminally ill, was played by Bill Nighy, whom Ishiguro propositioned in the back of a taxi. “What happened was that Bill’s cab hadn’t turned up, so we gave him a lift to his cab, which was in the wrong place. So it was only a few minutes, but during that time, I said: ‘Bill, I know a part that will get you the best actor Oscar.’ And Lorna said: ‘Stop bothering Bill, he’s got lots of work.’”View image in fullscreenNighy’s interest, however, was piqued, and he did indeed get nominated for an Oscar, losing out to Brendan Fraser’s performance in The Whale. As the byzantine voting campaigns played out, Ishiguro began to get a sense that it wasn’t going to go to his man, and “I started to feel that I went and promised Bill this Oscar, and maybe he’s not going to get it. This is terrible!”Ishiguro is joking, but also not: he’s a man of noticeable intellectual fastidiousness, and one of the things he has been thinking about recently is his responsibilities as a writer. “I’ve become quite wary of the power to provoke emotions in readers – and that is the gift, if you like, that I’ve been praised for; the Nobel citation actually says something like ‘emotionally powerful’. And most of my writing life, that’s how I justified my job. I would say that you won’t learn much about history from me; go to a historian. However, a novelist can provide the emotional dimension; we offer some sort of emotional truth that is not there in nonfiction, however scrupulously well researched and documented.”View image in fullscreenBut over the last few years, he’s become increasingly worried that stirring up strong emotional responses has a far darker dimension, as we see in the way that political movements are able to harness citizens by appealing to their instincts rather than to evidence. “In the post-truth Trump era, there’s this relentless attack on accredited news media. It’s not just Trump: it’s a general atmosphere that whatever the evidence, if you don’t like it, you can just claim some alternative emotional truth for yourself. The whole status of what might be true has got very blurred lately. And so I feel that this power to actually cause emotions in people and create apparent emotional truths, is quite an odd thing.”That can only be intensified, he believes, by the increasing power of AI. “AI will become very good at manipulating emotions. I think we’re on the verge of that. At the moment we’re just thinking of AI crunching data or something. But very soon, AI will be able to figure out how you create certain kinds of emotions in people – anger, sadness, laughter.” AI is likely to have a significant effect on the creative arts, too, and Ishiguro has recently called for the British government to protect writers’ and artists’ work from the predations of tech corporations, describing the current era as a “fork-in-the-road moment”.So in a post-truth society aided by AI and algorithms, is it enough for fiction to pack an emotional punch? “If I was deploying that kind of gift for the service of a politician or for a large corporation that wanted to sell pharmaceuticals, you wouldn’t necessarily think it was commendable, you’d be highly suspicious of it. But if I’m doing it in the service of telling a story, that is considered to be something really valuable,” he says. “It’s something that increasingly makes me feel uneasy, because I haven’t been praised for my incredible style, or because in my fiction I exposed great injustices in the world. I’ve usually been praised for producing stuff that makes people cry.” He laughs. “They gave me a Nobel prize for it.”They did, and despite his concerns, the stories he tells will continue to be a source of great pleasure and importance to his readers. I ask him what his novels are to him. Are they now part of his psychology, his internal landscape? “In some ways, I feel they’re quite distant from me. The classic analogy is children: they were very close to you, and then they go their own way, but you feel bonded to them.” He considers. “They are my work, but I feel who I am is somewhere else.”Never Let Me Go: 20th Anniversary Edition by Kazuo Ishiguro is published by Faber on 13 March.

The man she was in a relationship with was actually a police officer who for seven years had lived deep undercover at the heart of the environmental protest movement. When the story became public, senior officers tried to quell the outcry, insisting that Kennedy was merely a rogue officer. In fact, the opposite was true. Kennedywas just one of many footsoldierswho had been routinely infiltrating political groups, mostly on the left,since as far back as 1968.Anushka Asthanatalks to the Guardian’sPaul LewisandRob Evansabout their decade-long work with activists to investigate police spies. Officers’ deployments typically lasted four to five years, with them living alongside political campaigners, forming deep bonds of friendship, or having romantic liaisons with their targets. At least three of the police spiesfathered children with womenthey met while undercover. The existence of a squad of officers sent deep undercover in political groups was so secret that many of the UK’s most senior police officers were oblivious until they began reading the reports in the Guardian 10 years ago.Anushka also hears fromJessica(a pseudonym) who, in 1992, when she was 19, had a year-long sexual relationship with Andy, a fellow activist. In 2017, she discovered that Andy was Andy Coles, a police spy, who was 32. She believes she was “groomed” by Coles and describes the devastating impact the discovery has had on her life. Coles has denied that he had an intimate relationship with Jessica while he infiltrated political groups in the 90s, dismissing her claims as ‘lurid’.The exposure of this network of spies has led to apublic inquirythat is examining the covert infiltration of political groups and willexamine the conduct ofa large number of undercover officers, including Coles.If you have been affected by this podcast, the Samaritans are available for counselling on 116 123.Archive: Channel 4 News; BBC; YouTube; Independent; ITNPhotograph: David Rowe/AlamyExplore more on these topicsUK newsToday in Focus"

The colorful protest was overseen by a large police presence, including officers in riot gear and a water cannon truck.The government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared 2025 the Year of the Family. Protesters pushed back against the idea of women’s role being confined to marriage and motherhood, carrying banners reading “Family will not bind us to life” and “We will not be sacrificed to the family”.Critics have accused the government of overseeing restrictions on women’s rights and not doing enough to tackle violence against women.The Turkish president in 2021 withdrew his country from a European treaty, dubbed the Istanbul Convention, that protects women from domestic violence. Turkey’s “We Will Stop Femicides” platform says 394 women were killed by men in 2024.“There is bullying at work, pressure from husbands and fathers at home and pressure from patriarchal society. We demand that this pressure be reduced even further,” Yaz Gulgun, 52, said.View image in fullscreenInternational Women’s Day march in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIn many other European countries, women also protested against violence, for better access to gender-specific healthcare and for equal pay, among other issues.InPoland, activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.Opening the center on International Women’s Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws.From Athens to Madrid, Paris, Munich, Zurich and Belgrade, and in many more cities across the European continent, women marched to demand an end to treatment as second-class citizens in society, politics, family and work.In Madrid, protesters held up large hand-drawn pictures depicting Gisèle Pelicot, the woman who was drugged by her now ex-husband in France over the course of a decade so that she could be raped by dozens of men while unconscious. Pelicot has become a symbol for women all over Europe in the fight against sexual violence.In the Nigerian capital of Lagos, thousands of women gathered at the Mobolaji Johnson stadium, dancing and signing and celebrating their womanhood. Many were dressed in purple, the traditional color of the women’s liberation movement.View image in fullscreenWomen sing and dance during an International Women's Day celebration in Lagos, Nigeria, on 7 March 2025.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/APView image in fullscreenA poster honoring Gisèle Pelicot, in Madrid, Spain, on 8 March 2025.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersInRussia, the women’s day celebrations had a more official tone, with honor guard soldiers presenting yellow tulips to girls and women during a celebration in St Petersburg.In Berlin, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, called for stronger efforts to achieve equality and warned against tendencies to roll back progress already made.In the US, demonstrations popped up in cities including Washington DC, New York City and Los Angeles, with many protesters rallying against the Trump administration’s policies.View image in fullscreenInternational Women’s Day march in Los Angeles on Saturday.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/ReutersThe marches, organized by the Women’s March feminist network, come seven weeks into Trump’s second term. Since returning to office, Trump has signed a string of executive actions that advocates say disproportionately affect women.Some of these orders are geared towardcracking down on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiativesin the federal government, signed just hours after his inauguration. The next day, Trump rescinded a decades-old executive order that had barred government contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.At least 300 protests were planned for Saturday across the country, according to the Women’s March website.RefuseFascism.org, an organization in Oakland, California, working with Women’s March, invited members of its community to join the march on Saturday, outlining some of the actions they’re fighting against in astatement: “It is Trump blaming plane crashes on DEI. It is JD Vance denigrating women who don’t have children. And these towering misogynists have the audacity to claim their attacks on trans people are in the name of ‘protecting women’.”Coral Murphy Marcos contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsInternational Women's DayWomenEuropeAfricaTurkeyPolandGreecenewsShareReuse this content"

Since restrictions were lifted, she has visited more than 30 countries and founded a travel agency, Kaijego.On 15 March, the 26-year-old will attempt to fulfil another ambition: breaking the Guinness world record for the shortest time traversing all seven continents.“It is the most ‘do it afraid’ thing I’ve done in my life,” she said.If she succeeds, she will join a string of freshly minted record-holders in west Africa, where a new generation ispassionately embracing breaking records. Since 2023, there have been more than 7,000 applications from the region’s 16 countries, according to Nicholas Brookes, the marketing director atGuinness World Records (GWR).Asinobi, who travelled to other countries to obtain some of the 10 visas needed for the challenge, wants to highlight the difficulties posed by travelling with a “low-mobility” passport. On the2025 Henley Passport Index, which ranks 199 countries by travel freedoms, Nigeria is tied in 88th place with Ethiopia and Myanmar.View image in fullscreenAlma Asinobi, pictured in Vancouver, had to travel to other countries to obtain some of the 10 visas needed for her trip.Photograph: Chinonso ChukwuogorNigerian travellers routinely complain of being pulled out of immigration queues or not being allowed to board flights for mundane reasons at border controls in Europe, North America and even inAfrica.“My dreams will not be limited by the colour of my skin or the colour of my passport,” Asinobi said.In September 2023, officials in Egypt kept her from proceeding to Jordan and Qatar for an hour, claiming that due to an airline policy she had to show a return ticket to Nigeria.“When people say ‘it’s the policy’, they expect that you just keep quiet,” said Asinobi, whose checked-in luggage on that occasion was sent to another city and never recovered. “In two minutes, the matter was resolved automatically when I said they had to show me where that policy was.”GWR rules require her to step foot on all seven continents by briefly leaving the airports she will fly between, and to document her journey with evidence at landmarks. Asinobi’s journey will start in Antarctica – where she is looking forward to seeing penguins – and end in Australia.View image in fullscreenAlma Asinobi on a previous trip to Beirut.Photograph: Salim Abdelnour“I’m starting at the most unpredictable point, which makes the most sense because it’s when the wheels take off that the timer starts,” she said. “It’s up to me, the weather, God, so many different things. I just have to take one step at a time and ensure that I’m going at maximum speed. I’m obeying all the rules and I’m staying on track until I get to Australia.”For months, Asinobi had been preparing to break the2023 recordof 73 hours. But on Thursday evening she discovered that an American national, Johnny Buckingham,had been certifiedas the new record holder with a time of 64 hours, travelled in February.On Friday morning she posted on X: “Am I crazy enough to challenge a US Airforce veteran to break a mission-planning record with barely a week to plan? YES.”Asinobi hopes to break another record – the most signatures on a piece of travel memorabilia – by asking thousands of people to sign a Nigerian flag she is travelling with at a party in Lagos on her return.Fellow Nigerians have rallied to her cause. “This here is bravery and I salute this,” said Fiyinfoluwa Akinsiku, a Worcestershire-based doctor who circled the world with a Nigerian passport in nine years, including a 2019 trip to Antarctica. “Can’t wait to welcome you to the elite club of less than 1% of the world’s population to travel to all seven continents.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaGuinness World RecordsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Let no one take law into their hands.“The government which I lead will handle this crisis. We will remain steadfast in the path of peace,” he added.The information minister, Michael Makuei, said “approximately 27” troops were killed. A UN crew member was among the dead.It was not immediately clear if the helicopter was hit as it was in the air or if the attack took place while it was still on the ground.South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, ended a five-year civil war in 2018 with a power-sharing agreement between Kiir and Machar.But Kiir’s allies have accused Machar’s forces of fomenting unrest in Nasir county, in league with the White Army, a loose band of armed youths in the region from the same ethnic Nuer community as the vice-president.Machar’s spokesperson Puok Both Baluang declined to comment on the attack. Machar’s party has previously denied involvement in the recent fighting in Nasir.The head of the UN mission in South Sudan (Unmiss), Nicholas Haysom, said the attack was “utterly abhorrent” and might constitute a war crime under international law.“We also regret the killing of those that we were attempting to extract, particularly when assurances of safe passage had been received. Unmiss urges an investigation to determine those responsible and hold them accountable,” he said.Machar’s spokesperson said earlier this week that security forces had arrested the petroleum minister, the peacebuilding minister, the deputy head of the army and other senior military officials allied with Machar, potentially jeopardising the 2018 peace deal that ended a civil war between Kiir’s and Machar’s forces.The government has not commented on the detentions and all the detained officials, apart from the peacebuilding minister, remain in custody or under house arrest, according to Machar’s spokesperson.The White Army fought alongside Machar’s forces in the 2013-18 civil war that pitted them against predominantly ethnic Dinka troops loyal to Kiir.Analysts have warned that the escalating tensions could lead to a full-blown conflict. “South Sudan is slipping rapidly toward full-blown war,” said the International Crisis Group’s Horn ofAfricadirector, Alan Boswell.He urged the UN to prepare peacekeepers to save civilian lives, adding: “We fear large-scale ethnic massacres if the situation is not soon contained.”In a statement, the UN urged “all actors to refrain from further violence and for the country’s leaders to urgently intervene to resolve tensions through dialogue and ensure that the security situation in Nasir, and more broadly, does not deteriorate”.The UN mission in South Sudan was established soon after the country won independence from Sudan in 2011. Almost 20,000 peacekeepers from 73 countries serve in it.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsSouth SudanUnited NationsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Toronto paramedics, however, told Canada’s CP24 Media it was a “dynamic situation” and that some injuries were critical.Police said the three suspects were male, with one of them wearing a black balaclava seen fleeing the scene in a silver car. They said they are using all resources available to find and arrest those responsible.The suspects “walked into the bar. They produced their guns, and they opened fire indiscriminately on the people sitting inside the bar”, according to Supt Paul MacIntyre of Toronto’s organised crime enforcement branch.“I’m happy to report by the grace of God that there’s been no fatalities… extremely lucky.“The motive for this shooting right now remains unclear. We’re chasing down all leads.“I can tell you this was a brazen and reckless act of violence that’s really shaken our community and the city itself.“It looks like we had a mass-casualty shooting inside a pub. When you walk in, it’s kind of eerie. The drinks are still on the table. The food is still on the table.”When asked if the shooting may be connected to the recent tow truck-related shootings, he said: “We’re open to that, but we’re not sure yet.”Toronto’s mayor, Olivia Chow, wrote on X: “I am deeply troubled to hear reports of a shooting at a pub in Scarborough.“This is an early and ongoing investigation – police will provide further details. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.”Armed police and several ambulances and fire engines were on the scene as the pursuit of the suspects continued into the early hours.Canada has a significantly lower rate of firearm homicides than the US at 0.6 per 100,000 people, compared with 4.5 per 100,000, according to 2021 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.Explore more on these topicsTorontoCanadaGun crimeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But if we can’t, [supplying Australia] becomes a very difficult problem because we don’t want our servicemen and women to be in a weaker position and more vulnerable and, God forbid, worse because they are not in the right place in the right time.”In August he tweeted: “Aukus, in principle, it is a great idea, but I have been very skeptical in practice.I remain skeptical, agnostic, as I put it, but more inclined based on new information I have gleaned. It would be crazy to have fewer SSNs Virginia-class [attack submarines] in the right place and time.”According to the Aukus agreement, signed in 2021 by the then Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, the US will sell Australia between three and five Virginia-class conventionally armed nuclear-powered attack submarines (known as SSNs), with the first to be delivered in 2032. These will replace Australia’s ageing Collins class diesel-electric submarines before Australia’s own Aukus submarines can be built.However, the agreement also mandates that before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that America relinquishing a submarine will not diminish the US navy’s undersea capability.The US’s submarine fleet numbers are currently a quarter below their target and the country is producing boats at half the rate it needs to service its own needs, US figures show. Experts have argued the chance of that condition being met is“vanishingly small”.On 8 February, Australia paid $US500m ($AUD790m) to the US, the first instalment in a total of $US3bn pledged in order to support America’s shipbuilding industry as part of the Aukus agreement.But on 11 February, theCongressional Research Serviceissued a paper highlighting the stubbornly sclerotic pace of submarine-building in the US. The US navy has a “force-level goal” of 66 attack submarines; it currently has 49.The report says the US needs to build new submarines at arate of 2.3 each yearto meet its own needs, as well as provide submarines to Australia. Since 2022, it has built boats at about half that rate: 1.2 boats a year.Under an alternative proposed in the paper, the US would not sell any submarines to Australia; instead, it would sail its own submarines, under US command, out of Australian bases.“Up to eight additional Virginia-class SSNs would be built and, instead of three to five of them being sold to Australia, these additional boats would instead be retained in US navy service and operated out of Australia along with the five US and UK submarines that are already planned to be operated out of Australia.”The paper argued that Australia, rather than spending money to buy, build and sail its own nuclear-powered submarines, would instead invest that money in other military capabilities – long-range missiles, drones, or bombers – “so as to create an Australian capacity for performing non-SSN military missions for both Australia and the United States”.Colby is the author of The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict, and has pushed the US to prioritise the Indo-Pacific over other parts of the world. He has been strongly supported by key members of Trump’s inner circle, including the vice-president, JD Vance.In written comments to the Senate committee, Colby urged Australia tolift its defence spending to 3%of GDP.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read more“The main concern the United States should press with Australia, consistent with the president’s approach, is higher defence spending,” Colby said.“Australia is currently well below the 3% level advocated for Nato by Nato secretary general [Mark] Rutte, and Canberra faces a far more powerful challenge in China.”Australia is not a member of Nato. Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, responded: “The budget papers show the Albanese government is increasing defence spending to record levels.”Australian defence spending is budgeted to reach $56bn this year, equivalent to 2.02% of GDP. The Albanese government has committed to exceeding $100bn by the 2033-34 financial year, representing 2.4% of GDP.In written comments to the Senate committee, Colby said he “had expressed concerns” regarding the US attack submarine fleet and the production rates of new boats.“I believe we must increase US attack submarine production to meet US military requirements in the Indo-Pacific region – to ensure our servicemen and women are as well-armed as possible in the event of war – as well as to meet our obligations under Aukus Pillar One.”Trump told Congress in an address this week he would “resurrect the American shipbuilding industry” by establishing a new “office of shipbuilding” inside the White House.“We’re going to make them very fast, very soon.”Read more:Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Explore more on these topicsAukusDonald TrumpAustralian foreign policyAustralian militarynewsShareReuse this content"

This is the case for most of the nation’s airports that are not designated to meet the security threshold required for such measures.The lack of police has raised alarms within the aviation sector.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn Thursday afternoon, the boy allegedly broke through the airport’s security fence dressed in hi-vis and with tools. Witnesses said they believed he was a maintenance worker.He then walked up to a plane on the tarmac – Jetstar flight 610 – where about 150 passengers had boarded the Airbus A320 bound for Sydney.Teenager charged after allegedly boarding Jetstar flight with ‘large gun’ at Avalon airportRead moreShortly after entering the cabin, crew and passengers noticed he was allegedly carrying a shotgun and ammunition. Former shearer and boxer Garry Clark, from seat 1C, tackled him to the ground.Clark and other passengers performed a citizen’s arrest, and had to wait for state police from the local area command 9km away to arrive and take the teen into custody.TheTransportWorkers Union, a key aviation union that represents ground workers among others, sought an urgent meeting with Jetstar on Friday to call for a review of security arrangements at Avalon airport, operated by transport logistics company Linfox.While it hosts few commercial flights – about 20 daily departures and arrivals combined – these are all operated by budget carrier Jetstar, which markets the airport as serving Melbourne. Avalon’s air fares have a slightly cheaper base rate than services from Melbourne airport in Tullamarine, a shorter 14km from the city.Geoff Askew, a former director of security and emergency planning for Qantas, now principal of the risk consulting group Askew and Associates, haspreviously raised alarm thatregional airports that only welcome planes with 40 seats or fewer are exempt from security scanners to screen passengers.The Morrison government further watered down the laws in 2020, allowing additional airports to remove their security scanners to cut costs.Askew, who also held positions in the Australian Defence Force andVictoriapolice, said the alleged breach at Avalon was a reminder that “airports are not military camps”.“Yes, there’s a degree of security, most of it is within the passenger side of the terminal [as opposed to the tarmac],” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You would need a very expensive fence to prevent an intruder, and eventually these costs are passed on to the passenger.”Such considerations are front of mind for airports. Rex pulled out of several regional airports, such as Whyalla, after Qantas launched rival services with aircraft that seat more than 40 passengers, forcing the airports to introduce security screening.The additional costs were split across all airlines using the airport, and were said to have such an inflationary impact on Rex’s ticket costs that it dropped several routes.On Friday afternoon, the Australian federal police said in a statement that the counter-terrorism and special investigations command was working alongside Victoria police.Askew said those investigating the breach were likely considering if Avalon’s fence needed upgrading, and whether AI-assisted CCTV could be installed to detect alerts or patrols could be instated.One aviation insider, a former veteran maintenance engineer with Qantas, told Guardian Australia that they considered the airport’s fence easily breachable in the middle of the night.“You can do a monumental amount of damage at an airport at night. Each night, after the crew goes to the motel, the airport manager goes home for dinner, there’s nobody there. There’s no security monitoring; you could smash the window of a small plane and be in the air within two minutes.”“There’s so many glaringly obvious vulnerabilities in security, a more serious incident is just waiting to happen,” they said.The Avalon airport chief executive, Ari Suss, said the organisation was working with Victoria police.“As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we have implemented further measures across the airport, including within the terminal and surrounding areas,” he said in a statement.– with AAPExplore more on these topicsTransportVictoriaAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The Bureau of Meteorology says the centre of the tropical low is now expected to move inland more rapidly over Sunday while weakening.The storm has caused significant disruption, with 30 rescue operations launched on Saturday for people stuck in flood waters.This included a search for a 61-year-old man swept off a bridge by fast-moving flood waters near Dorrigo in NSW on Friday. Emergency service workers were able to briefly talk with the man as he clung to a tree, before he was washed downstream. Police have confirmed a body was found at about 4.30pm.On Saturday afternoon, the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, said of the 36 defence personnel being treated after the collision some were “seriously injured”. In a joint statement with the defence minister, Richard Marles, he said the “ADF heroes were on their way to help Australians in need”.Earlier in the day, Albanese urged people not to drive through flood waters unless authorised to do so and warned people against becoming complacent after the weather system was downgraded.“If it’s flooded, forget it,” the prime minister said. “The government, of course, stands ready to activate disaster payments for both south-eastQueenslandand New South Wales.”1:22Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred weakens to tropical low, warnings still in place - videoPower was restored to Gold Coast university hospital late on Saturday afternoon, after relying on generators throughout the day.

His personal ratings have risen by 10% – albeit from an alarmingly low point – compared with a month ago.Strikingly, Labour, rather than theConservativeswho are traditionally seen as stronger on defence, are now seen as by far the best at dealing with key foreign policy and defence challenges. Around 30% of voters said they would prefer Labour when it comes to “dealing with allies against threats to the UK”, compared with 18% for the Tories. On “allocating funding to the armed forces and defence”, 27% support Labour to do so best against 20% for the Tories. Some 28% say Labour will best safeguard “the UK’s reputation abroad” against 19% for the Tories..On working to ensure a strong relationship between the UK and EU – as both seek to enhance to Europe’s defence capabilities against a background of the US’s potential scaling back of support forUkraineand for Nato – 32% prefer Labour to do so against just 16% for the Tories.Since Trump unveiled his controversial plans to bring peace to Ukraine and announced talks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Starmer has won praise from MPs across the House of Commons for his response..While many of his ratings remain solidly in negative territory (when the number disapproving of his performance is subtracted from the number approving) Downing Street will be cheered to see most of them moving in the right direction. Compared with the last time the same questions were asked on 5 February, Starmer’s rating for being “decisive” has gone up by 12%, that for being a “strong leader” by 13%, and for being able to “stand up for Britain’s interests abroad” up by 15%. His rating for being “competent” has climbed by 10% and that for being “likeable”by 10%.Asked about the Ukraine conflict, 62% of voters say they trust the handling of it by the UK and 52% trust the EU. But just 19% trust the US and 9% Russia. When asked how united or divided they believe countries are over what to do about Ukraine, 67% said the UK and Ukraine were united, 51% saidEuropeas a whole was united, but only 26% thought the UK and US were united..On Tuesday Trump announced the suspension of US military aid to Ukraine; 60% thought this the wrong thing to do, compared with 17% who thought it was right – 23% didn’t know. There was strong support from voters of all major parties that this was the wrong thing to do. Reform UK voters are the only group where there is clear division on the issue (44% wrong, 33% right).Uncertainty is high on whether there will be a US-facilitated peace deal in Ukraine. A quarter (24%) think it likely compared to a third who think unlikely (33%), with 24% saying they don’t know. In the event the US did broker a peace in the region over half (55%) think it would benefit Putin and Russia the most, with only 17% thinking Zelenskyy and Ukraine would be main beneficiaries.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverLabourConservativesDefence policyUkraineOpinion pollsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said all were “aware of the great challenge we are facing – above all the international situation, but also … facing the whole of Europe”.Merz said both sides had agreed on tough new steps to limit irregular immigration, including refusing all undocumented migrants at the borders, even those seeking asylum.The move was a key demand of Merz, who has stressed the need to win back voters from the far-right Alternative forGermany(AfD), which scored a record of more than 20% in the election.Lars Klingbeil of the SPD called Saturday’s deal “an important first step” and said both sides agreed on the need to “get our country back on track”. He said his party had won assurances on key demands, such as a €15-an-hour minimum wage from 2026 and stable pensions.The plan is for Germany to have a new government by mid-April that would end half a year of political paralysis after Scholz’s three-way coalition imploded in November.The probable future governing allies have already surprised European partners with their plan to spend hundreds of billions of euros to revive the ailing economy and rebuild the military.‘People see it as invasive’: did anti-green feeling fuel the right’s rise in Germany?Read moreThe ambitious plans would cast aside Germany’s historic reluctance to take on large-scale debt and see it invest in defence on a scale not seen since the second world war.The spending boost – which Merz’s Bavarian ally Markus Söder has termed an “XXL”-sized splurge – comes in response to Trump and his administration casting doubt in Europe on the future strength and reliability of the Nato alliance.Alarm at Trump’s actions has added urgency to the talks, spurred by his public berating of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a White House meeting.The two parties are moving to talks on a detailed formal coalition agreement, including haggling over cabinet posts. Their spending plans would circumvent Germany’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake and exempt defence spending when it exceeds 1% of GDP.The parties also agreed a €500bn (£420bn) fund to invest in creaking infrastructure over 10 years.The SPD has long pushed for action on Germany’s economy, which has been mired in two years of recession. Merz voiced hopes on Saturday that the stimulus would help the economy grow by “one, preferably two, per cent”.However, both proposals will need a two-thirds majority in the outgoing parliament, with the two big blocs needing the Greens’ cooperation.Merz said new investment could flow into climate projects and voiced confidence that “we will find a way together to achieve a constitutional amendment”.But the Greens’ co-chair Felix Banaszak warned they were “further away from an agreement today than we have been in recent days”, criticising the fact that “climate protection financing plays no part” in the joint document.The CDU/CSU and SPD are in a hurry to push the changes through before a deadline looms. On 25 March the newly elected parliament will convene. From then on, the AfD and the far-left Linke will be able to block any such proposals.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropeOlaf ScholzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)newsShareReuse this content"

So after police said that they know about some new attempts, that was not very surprising, just confirmation of what our Russian source was telling us.”‘Sophisticated’ spy ring passed secrets to Russia for three years, UK court toldRead moreDobrokhotov said he recognised the need to be constantly on the move to avoid the attentions of the Kremlin.He said: “All my family are worried, of course. They worry about me and they understand that they are not safe – if they put novichok [the biological agent used in the murder attempt on the Skripals] on the door handle, they can all suffer.“On the other hand, it’s the worst situation when you don’t know whether you should be very much worried, or you can relax. You always doubt if you are paranoid about all of this stuff. So in some way, it’s good to know that you know this situation.”A counter-terrorism policing spokesperson said: “Counter-terrorism policing works closely with police forces, partners and communities to identify any repressive activity by foreign states in the UK and will seek to disrupt this activity where possible.“This has been shown to be the case with a number of recent arrests and charges that have been made in relation to offences under the National Security Act.“We would encourage members of the public to report any allegations of foreign interference to their local police force.“On receipt of any such reports, officers would also assess whether there are any safeguarding or security concerns or issues and, in liaison with specialist officers, would be able to provide individuals affected with appropriate safety and security advice and support as required.“Briefings on personal safety are not the limit of our activity to keep people safe, but they do create direct connections between individuals, organisations and policing.“The importance of that advice should not be underestimated, and neither should the scale of operational activity taking place within our proactive investigations teams and with partner agencies to keep people safe.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageThe ObserverCrimeRussiaBulgariaInvestigative journalismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And yet, it will potentially be the most consequential in the Arctic island’s history.What makes this general election unlike any other, says the Inuit Ataqatigiit member of the Danish parliament, is the global spotlight on it. “What we’re seeing is influence from the US,Denmarkand other places. It is not the same as other elections.”Donald Trump’s fixation with acquiring Greenland“one way or the other”, as he told Congress to laughs last week, means the US – and as a result, the world – is watching Greenland’s election like never before. Denmark, which ruled the now autonomous territory as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy, is also paying unprecedented attention for fear of losing a crucial part of its kingdom.0:58Donald Trump on Greenland: 'I think we're going to get it one way or another' - videoEven before Trump’s inauguration in January, he was aggressively mooting a renewed version of his first-term idea of “buying” Greenland – which his administration sees as a valuable asset for its strategic location and its considerable natural resources – this time with threats of military action and tariffs if Denmark did not comply. This came after a whistlestop private visit to the capital, Nuuk, by his son,Donald TrumpJr, which despite being a private trip was broadcast across the world on social media by his entourage.A map of GreenlandAmong an electorate where little polling takes place, analysts are reluctant to predict whether the ­coalition led by Greenlandic prime minister Múte Egede, of Inuit Ataqatigiit (the ruling democratic socialist pro-independence party) will remain in power. Naleraq, Greenland’s largest opposition party, has been gaining traction with its prominent voice for independence and openness to collaborating with the US.Society feels more divided during this election, says Chemnitz Larsen, and for the first time politicians have security with them while out campaigning. There is also public anger about a documentary by Danish broadcaster DR that claimed Denmark earned the equivalent of up to 400bn Danish kroner (£45bn) from a Greenlandic cryolite mine between 1854 and 1987. Some critics have claimed the amount is inaccurate because it did not include costs, but in Greenland the documentary has been cited as an example of colonial injustice. According to a poll for Greenlandic newspaperSermitsiaq,more than a third of voters say its findings will influence their vote.This comes on top of other recent revelations over alleged mistreatment of Greenlanders by the state of Denmark. These include anIUD scandalin which 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with contraception without their knowledge or consent between 1966 and 1970. Egede recently labelled the scandal genocide. And the Danish government recently did a U-turn on the use of controversial “parenting competency” tests on Greenlandic families which have led to the separation of many Inuit children from their parents.With a voting public of only about 40,000 – Greenland’s total population is 57,000 – the margins are small.Unlike the reaction in Copenhagen, which went into crisis mode over Trump’s apparent threats, Trump’s interest in Greenland was seen by many in Nuuk with bemusement and a hope that it could be leveraged to negotiate a better deal with Denmark or to secure a quicker route to independence.Rasmus Leander Nielsen, head of Nasiffik, the University of Greenland’s centre for foreign and security policy, said it is an election of everyday politics colliding with geopolitical questions over Trump. “You have those two narratives kind of clashing.”He added: “We see different dynamics going in different directions but also it’s very unpredictable what’s going to happen.”View image in fullscreenA man gestures behind posters for the Greenlandic political party Siumut outside their office in Nuuk, Greenland, on 6 March.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat he is sure of is that while there may be a referendum on independence in the next election cycle, it is unlikely that Greenland will achieve independence in the next four years. “It could take a decade or longer.” Like Brexit, he said, even if Greenland voted yes in a referendum, there would still need to be lengthy discussions and negotiations.Among the more likely scenarios, he believes, is that Greenland will try to renegotiate its relationship with Denmark within the kingdom. “Now with heightened tensions, Greenland has pretty good cards in its hands and could make the argument that they need to do something different from the status quo.”Greenlandic politician Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam said time is of the essence when it comes to Greenland’s voice on the global stage, which she believes will not wait for Greenland to make up its mind on independence. Høegh-Dam, who left the social democratic Siumut party, which she represented in the Danish parliament, to run for Naleraq for Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, said: “I hope people will vote in people who are excellent in foreign policy because with major interest from the outside world it’s more important now.”Interest from outside Greenland has been unprecedented, she said. “We have never seen so much international media interested in participating in our election campaigning.”There has also been considerable foreign interest in the business world.Drew Horn, a member of the first Trump administration and chief executive of Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, said there are “tens of billions” of dollars ready to be invested in Greenland immediately.Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic commissioner and an investor, said while there is not a “quick buck” to be made – mining, he says, is a long-term business – it is an “exciting time” for Greenland. “It’s really frontier in the true sense of things,” he said.Dans added: “We talk about outer space and trips to Mars and then when you realise Nuuk is a three-hour flight from New York City, or thereabouts, it gets interesting.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandThe ObserverDenmarkDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Soon after the aerial attacks,Trump saidVladimir Putin was “doing what anybody would do”.Overnight strikes in easternUkraineon Saturday killed at least 14 people and wounded dozen more, including five children.Wallace, who was the defence secretary when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, said on Saturday that Trump was diminishing the hope of Ukraine with his actions.Trump’s polarising appeal leaves European populists in a tight spotRead moreSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Hope is the most important thing in this type of conflict and, at the moment, Donald Trump is suffocating the hope that Putin can be either fought to a standstill or indeed brought to the table.”He added: “Hope is always the key for both morale and a military campaign. When this started three years ago, I remember gathering the military officials in my then department, and saying on day one, we have to give the Ukrainians hope.“If a Russian truck has a puncture, we need to let people know. If the Russians have a small defeat, we need to let the Ukrainian people know.”Wallace suggested that Ukraine could still win the war if it continued holding off Russian forces. He said: “If Ukraine continues to resist for 18 months, the Russian economy will collapse. Its inflation rate’s at 23%, it’s spending 40% of its money [on defence], it’s finding it incredibly hard to replace its equipment. It can use North Koreans like cannon fodder, but fundamentally, it is not in a good place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OK, have you fulfilled your commitments under the JCPOA?” he responded.Khamenei said Tehran had kept its commitments for a year but there was “no other way” but to roll back from them in accordance with legislation passed by the country’s parliament.US officials now estimate that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it so chose.Tehran has consistently denied pursuing nuclear weapons, emphasising the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.Officials have always cited a religious decree issued by Khamenei that prohibits the development of such weapons.Last month, Khamenei reiterated his opposition to negotiations with the US, calling this “unwise” just days after Trump called for a new nuclear deal.Khamenei accused Washington of having “ruined, violated, and torn up” the 2015 agreement.In 2019, more than a year after Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA, Japan’s then premier, Shinzo Abe, visited Iran in an attempt to mediate between Tehran and Washington.But Khamenei firmly rejected the possibility of talks with the US, saying he did not “consider Trump as a person worthy of exchanging messages with”.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiNuclear weaponsMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

However, the first phase of that agreement expired more than a week ago and a second phase has stalled, leaving Gaza plunged into a “grey zone” of uncertainty.“I feel happiness and relief that the fighting has been stopped for so long but right now, I am really anxious the war will start again. I follow the news continuously,” said Ranan al-Ashqar, who works in the education ministry in Gaza City.Many observers see only a narrow and unlikely pathway to any durable peace. “We are in a grey zone. I am pessimistic about the potential going forward because the political calculations for the Israeli leadership do not favour a ceasefire that would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,” saidHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Some analysts fear a return to wider hostilities within days as Israel seeks to pressure Hamas into new concessions.Others suggest that a large-scale ground and air operation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) “within weeks” is more likely if no new deal is reached. Last week, senior IDF officers told Israeli journalists that if Israeli forces launched a renewed offensive, it would be massive and very destructive.So far, the IDF has limited itself to a series of airstrikes across Gaza, though these appear to be increasingly frequent.On Saturday, Palestinian media reported casualties from an airstrike in southern Gaza near the town of Rafah. The IDF said an aircraft had struck a drone tracked entering Gaza from Israel as well as several suspects who collected it. A day earlier,the IDF saidit had targeted a group suspected of placing a bomb near Israeli soldiers in the east of Gaza City.Palestinian aid officials said two people had died when a drone “shot into their tent”. Aid officials and residents described similar incidents in the past week, and repeatedly hearing artillery fire, though the IDF has denied any extensive bombardment.In the first phase of the ceasefire, 25 living hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were released, along with the remains of eight others, in return for the release of about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Israel also withdrew its forces from many positions in Gaza and allowed more aid to come in.In Gaza, humanitarian workers differ about the effects of the pause in hostilities. One senior UN official said aid organisations had been able to rehabilitate some schools and clinics, set up bakeries and build up stocks of diesel fuel that is vital to supply power and water to the population of 2.3m.More than half a million people have returned to what is left of their homes in northern Gaza after spending months in the south.But prices have soared since Israel imposed a strict blockade on Gaza, cutting off supplies of fresh fruit, vegetables and meat, as well as further aid shipments of tents and other essentials. The price of gas on the hidden market is 10 times higher than from aid organisations charged with its distribution. Israel accused Hamas of seizing and profiting from aid.“We could be facing a quick deterioration. Every day we are hearing these statements of a return to war. It’s very difficult for people,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza, speaking from Gaza City.“It is a very sad city here. There is a lot of rubble and only a few bulldozers so we have opened a few streets and are trying to collect the remains of families under the ruins. We don’t have the equipment we need but people are trying anyway.”The Israeli offensive has killed more than 48,000, mostly civilians, and destroyed swathes of Gaza. It was triggered by a Hamas surprise attack into Israel in October 2023 during which militants killed 1,200 people, also mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Fewer than half of the 59 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be alive.While Israel has said it wants to extend the current phase of the ceasefire until the end of the holy festivals of Ramadan in late March and Passover in mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a swift transition to the second phase, and a permanent end to the war.Zev Faintuch, head of research at Global Guardian, a US-based risk consultancy, said Israel’s war aims remained unchanged: to eliminate Hamas, return the hostages, return its displaced civilians to border areas affected by hostilities and minimise any future threat.But at the same time, Hamas has remained faithful to its original goals: to thwart progress towards the normalisation of ties between regional Arab states and Israel, isolate Israel diplomatically, widen divisions within Israeli society and retain control of Gaza. “The four points on each side are pretty mutually exclusive,” Faintuch said.Diplomatic efforts to bridge the wide gap between Israel and Hamas have faltered, and there are now two competing plans for Gaza post-war.President Trump has said the US wants tooversee the displacement of Gaza’s populationso the territory could be rebuilt as “the Middle East’s Riviera” and US officials have dismissed a $53bn reconstruction proposal put forward last week by regional Arab states.Trump has also threatened Hamas with destruction on social media, though it was revealed last week that the US is engaged in unprecedented direct talks with the militant Islamist organisation. Lovatt said that recent US behaviour had been unhelpful, though the direct talks left an “outside chance of agreement”.Almazah al-Masri, a nurse in northern Gaza, said she was worried and frustrated. “Unfortunately, those involved in the discussions [about the ceasefire] do not care about what’s happening in Gaza or the wellbeing of the civilians there,” she said. “We do not want war at all. We have already been destroyed.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

After an argument, the men pushed the male travellers into a nearby canal before sexually assaulting the two women.Ram L Arasiddi, a local police official, said one of travellers had drowned and his body was recovered on Saturday. The other two men swam to safety, he said.Koppal is about 217 miles (350 kilometres) from Bengaluru. Arasiddi said police had set up a special investigation team that arrested two of the suspects on Saturday. They were being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, gang-rape and robbery, he said.Sexual assaults on women have become a prominent issue in India, where police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The real figure is believed to be much higher given the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims’ lack of faith in police.Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang-rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a Delhi bus. The attack galvanised huge protests and inspired lawmakers to set up fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.The rape law was amended in 2013, criminalising stalking and voyeurism and lowering the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. The government approved the death penalty in 2018 for people convicted of raping children under age 12.High-profile cases involving foreign visitors have drawn international attention to the issue. Last year, in a video that was later deleted, a Spanish tourist said his wife had been raped in northern India, while an Indian-American woman said she had been raped at a hotel in Delhi. A British tourist was raped in front of her partner in Goa in 2022.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

A small team of negotiators then began repeatedly trying to talk the protester down, and he was eventually brought down safely on the stroke of midnight.Two cherrypickers, an incident response unit ambulance, regular ambulances and two fire engines were at the scene.At one point, shouts of “free Palestine” and “you are a hero” could be heard from a small group of supporters behind a police cordon.The protester posted anupdate on Instagramat about 6pm, filming himself threatening to climb higher if the negotiator on a platform attached to a fire engine came any closer. He said: “I will come down on my terms … Right now, I’m saying I’m safe. If you come towards me, you’re putting me in danger and I will climb higher.”The negotiators were concerned that the protester would need food or water, or to use the toilet, and that he had been bleeding from an injured foot. “I feel fine,” the protester said. “I’m on a large ledge here. I’m safe.”He said he had stopped bleeding: “They’re small cuts.”In response, the negotiator said he could see “quite a lot of blood”. Blood appeared to have stained the ledge the protester was standing on.The protester replied: “I will tell you if I’m in danger … I’m safe right now … You’re the ones putting me in danger … I’ve told you, if you come towards me, I have no choice other than to climb higher, because I’m not ready to climb down.”The Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty said on X there needed to be an explanation about how the man got into the parliamentary estate.View image in fullscreenNegotiators on a cherrypicker attempt to talk the protester down.Photograph: Sky NewsHe said: “Every day in parliament I see dozens of armed police officers patrolling Portcullis House and the parliamentary estate. Where were they today?“On Monday there needs to be a full explanation to MPs and staff as to how this protester was able to evade security so easily.”Parliamentary tours were cancelled as a result of the incident, a spokesperson said.A video thought to be filmed by the protester at 7.20am showed him climbing a fence around the Houses of Parliament.Pro-Palestine protesters had planned to gather outside Broadcasting House, the BBC’s headquarters in centralLondon, on Saturday. Police said the rally risked “serious disruption” to Jewish people attending Shabbat services at a nearby synagogue and imposed conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the rally going ahead.Protest organisers from Palestine Pulse, XR for Palestine and others moved the protest outside Downing Street, with many congregating in Parliament Square.The Metropolitan police also restricted protest activity near Parliament Square to prevent serious disruption, with pro-Palestine protesters ordered to move from Bridge Street to Richmond Terrace.A Met police spokesperson said: “At 7.24am on Saturday 8 March officers were alerted to a man climbing up the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament.“Officers are at the scene working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. They are being assisted by the London fire brigade and the London ambulance service.”Bridge Street, at the north end of Westminster Bridge, was closed to allow the emergency services to deal with the incident, police said. It is understood one exit of Westminster station is also closed, but there is no disruption to tube services and passengers can use other exits.A spokesperson for the London fire brigade said: “Firefighters are responding alongside the Metropolitan police service to reports of a person scaling thePalace of Westminster.”In the afternoon, a large crowd gathered on the corner of Parliament Square in support of the protester. Some held signs reading: “Labour Tories BBC you show Russia’s crimes but hide Israel’s … why?”Reports suggested the protester had been overheard saying “peaceful protesters are being brutally arrested” and “I’ve brought the protest to the so-called hub of democracy in the UK” to onlookers below.The incident came amid a weekend of pro-Palestine protests across the country. Activists targeted one of Donald Trump’s golf courses inScotlandon Saturday. Palestine Action supporters spray-painted the clubhouse at the Trump Turnberry resort and dug up some of the greens overnight.View image in fullscreenThe Trump Turnberry clubhouse covered in red spray paint.Photograph: Milo Chandler/PAIn a video the grouppostedon social media, the words “Gaza is not 4 sale” are sprayed on the grass of the course.The group said its action was a “direct response to the US administration’s stated intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza” after “having laid out plans to ‘clean out the whole thing’ and forcibly displace its population”.A spokesperson said: “Palestine Action rejects Donald Trump’s treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes. To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance. We will continue to take action against US-Israeli colonialism in the Palestinian homeland.”PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsProtestLondonPalace of WestminsterScotlandPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

This is becausethe sun is thought to be at the peak of its 11-year cycleof activity. As a result, events known ascoronal mass ejections– when the sun spews out plasma, a super-hot gas of charged particles – are occurring more often, offering more opportunities to see the auroras.Explore more on these topicsNorthern lightsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a pretty damning indictment of what happened.”Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy, said inequality was “the primary story of the pandemic”. “You still find that people from poorer backgrounds are more likely to have been impacted,” Shah said, adding that the rate of long Covid in the most deprived households is double that of the most wealthy.“One of the dreadful things about the pandemic was that, as a side-effect, there was less money to invest in public services across the piece. The worry is that some of the trends we’re seeing, unless there’s active work to stop them, will continue.”The UK spent 19.3% of gross domestic product on extra spending and forgone revenue, and gave loans worth a further 16.7%, according to the International Monetary Fund – more than almost every other developed country except Japan, Germany and Italy.Yet the return on this investment was poor. After the lockdowns ended, every other G7 nation except the US saw more adults rejoining the workforce. However, the UK, which has historically had a better than average number of people in work, saw the reverse.There has been a 0.5% increase in the number of people not working and classed as economically inactive, with about 2.7 million too sick to work.In life expectancy, one of the most fundamental measures of how a country is able to look after its people, the UK is in a worse position than most other developed countries.Women can expect to live to 82 years and 10 months, about three years less than in Spain, Australia or Italy, while men can expect to reach 79, about two years less than in the same countries, reversing more than a decade of lifespan increases.OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) figures show that, in similar countries, homelessness is static or has been falling, but it has more than doubled in England since 2010. About 45 out of every 10,000 people are either sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation.Children are also significantly unhappier. The Education Policy Institute said the OECD figures showed that the UK now has the “second lowest average life satisfaction of 15-year-olds across all OECD countries”.Half of pupils in England (48%) rated their overall life satisfaction as seven or more out of 10, compared with 61% across other countries.And the UK has the sixth highest number of Covid deaths reported to theWorld Health Organization, with 232,000 fatalities, although Britain’s excess mortality rate is nevertheless in line with other nations, according to the scientific publicationOur Worldin Data.Covid response ‘one of UK’s worst ever public health failures’Read moreWhile international comparisons can be confounded by different methods of measurement, the main difference between the UK and other developed countries is that theNHShad been consistently underfunded, health experts said.Anandaciva said he had asked a German counterpart shortly after the first lockdown how Germany was dealing with hospital backlogs. “He paused and said: ‘What are you talking about?’ And it became clear that they had got back on track and the reason was that they were never overwhelmed. They had the capacity, the beds, the staff, not only to cope with the pandemic but also get things back to normal quicker.”Paul Johnson, director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studies, said: “Broadly speaking, we actually spent more and borrowed more than almost any other country. We were in that sense particularly generous – we increased our borrowing and debt by more than most other countries over that period.”He added that the increase in people who are economically inactive because of illness was also a problem that affected the UK and few other countries. An extra 1 million people are claiming disability benefits and 700,000 more are claiming incapacity benefits since before the pandemic.“Denmark has seen a small increase, but no other major country has seen an increase or any shift from its prior, pre-Covid trend,” Johnson said.“We’ve seen this unbelievable increase in numbers, which we don’t really understand, and we don’t know whether it’s associated with Covid, but it’s certainly coincident with the period after it.”View image in fullscreenMental health problems among children and young adults have worsened since the pandemic.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAMental health problems among children and young adults are also worsening, accounting for 45% of all diseases affecting 10- to 24-year-olds.Sunday’s Day of Reflection will see a procession along thenational Covid memorial wallby the Thames in London and services at St Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.Later this week, theCovid inquirywill hear evidence from former ministers Michael Gove, Steve Barclay and Helen Whately on how the government went about procuring PPE, ventilators and oxygen in the first stages of the pandemic.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusThe ObserverInfectious diseasesEconomicsNHSYoung peopleHomelessnessLife expectancynewsShareReuse this content"

Why, in the course of reporting a burglary to the police in 1952, did the maths geniusAlan Turingvolunteer that he was in an illegal homosexual relationship? The admission enabled the police to prosecute the Bletchley Park codebreaker for “gross indecency”, ending Turing’s groundbreaking work for GCHQ on early computers and artificial intelligence and compelling him to undergo a chemical castration that rendered him impotent. Two years later, he killed himself.Now, research by aUniversity of Cambridgeacademic has shed light on the reasons why Turing, a former undergraduate and lecturer at King’s College, Cambridge, did not hide his homosexuality from the police. “There was a whole community in King’s quite different from stories one knows about from gay history, usually involving casual pickups and a lot of despair, hiding and misery,” said Simon Goldhill, professor of classics at the college.His research has uncovered a “rather happy” community in the formerly all-male college at “the centre of the British establishment” while homosexuality was still illegal. “It was a very camp environment,” said Goldhill, who willtalk at King’s11 March about his new book,Queer Cambridge. For example, in the 1930s, when Turing was at King’s, “the provost [college principal] and many of the senior fellows [tutors] were openly and outwardly gay. They had sex with men and talked constantly about having sex with men.”View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch played Turing in the 2014 filmThe Imitation Game.Photograph: Black Bear Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarTuring spent his formative years – from 18 to 24 – at King’s, learning it was “perfectly acceptable” for intellectual gay men like him to not hide their sexuality around people in positions of power. As a result, in 1952 Turing told the police the suspected burglar was a friend of his male lover. “Turing thought he had the perfect right to be gay. He wasn’t ashamed of it. It was who he was.”His experiences of gay life at King’s were empowering: “He’d had a relationship at school and people had been worried about that. So when he came to King’s, where it was perfectly acceptable to be homosexual, I think that’s when he developed himself as a gay person.”Turing gained a “political strength and a political clarity” from his time at King’s. “He was somebody who was capable of standing up for himself as a gay man. He thought it was important not to lie, not to conceal, but to say: ‘This is who I am. I think you should be able to deal with this.’ He got that confidence from King’s.”View image in fullscreenThe novelist and Bloomsbury Group member EM Forster.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe poetRupert Brookeand the authorEM Forsterare among the other gay alumni of the college, along with the economistJohn Maynard Keynes, who was a fellow at King’s alongside Turing.Keynes kept ledgers of every man he slept with and what he did with them for years, Goldhill said. “He’s an economist – and economists count things. He’s bookkeeping.”Keynes also wrote about how everyone in Cambridge was “buggering each other”. Virginia Woolf, a friend of Forster, Keynes and the theatre directorDadie Rylands, another gay fellow of King’s, claimed: “The word buggery was never far from our lips.”Goldhill said: “There’s that extraordinary sense that it was very much talked about and open. You’ve got a complete gay community at the centre of the establishment, with Keynes and leading figures in economics, literature, music and art in charge.”View image in fullscreenThe war poet and King’s fellow Rupert Brooke.Photograph: Culture Club/Getty ImagesThe gay community at King’s is likely to have its roots in a statute, signed by King Henry VI in 1443, which required King’s to exclusively admit students from Eton College. “Coming from one house in Eton, the undergraduates had already lived together as boys. They knew each other for ever,” Goldhill said. “There was a very strong community among them – and that carried on.”Such intense childhood bonds meant students who desired other men were tolerated “within the safety of the college walls”.Gay men who came to King’s as “pretty young” students and stayed on to become powerful academics were able to have romantic relationships throughout their lives, ensuring the gay community at the college thrived. Unlike other gay histories, these men not only had “a sense of continuity of time and place, but a sense of moving through different stages of relationships as a gay man,” Goldhill said.After the statute requiring Etonians was overturned in the 1860s, teachers at other schools began encouraging bright boys whom they knew or suspected were gay to apply to King’s, where they would get in and “have a good time”, Goldhill said.View image in fullscreenA portrait of John Maynard Keynes, painted by his lover Duncan Grant, hangs in the dining hall at King’s.Photograph: By permission of the Provost and Scholars of King’s College, CambridgeTo this day, King’s has a reputation for being the centre of LGBTQ+ life in Cambridge, Goldhill said. “There has been and remains a spirit of tolerance and liberal values about the place – though even here, these days, such values are under threat.”King’s LGBTQ+ student officer Ainoa Cernohorsky said that while queer students at Cambridge are always fighting for more space to be themselves, “I have not encountered, seen or felt anything but unwavering support for my queerness – and for my role as the LGBTQ officer – from queer and non-queer undergraduates, graduates, professors and directors of studies at King’s. It’s a very accepting environment, and I think that’s partly due to the way the college presents itself and the stories it chooses to platform.”There is a prominent Antony Gormley statue dedicated to Turing in the college grounds, while a painting of Keynes by his lover Duncan Grant hangs proudly next to paintings of Forster and other gay fellows in the grand college dining hall. “These people are present in my mind,” said Cernohorsky. “They left their mark on the atmosphere in King’s.”Explore more on these topicsAlan TuringThe ObserverLGBTQ+ rightsUniversity of CambridgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

After they publicly challenged the university on their lack of employment rights, Oxford wrote to the Society of Authors in April 2022, agreeing to offer the two academics more appropriate contracts.But the promised contracts never materialised – and the pair were eventually told their old contracts would not be renewed. “They didn’t even have to sack us, because we had no employment rights,” Jolly said.Last January, after a protracted legal fight in which Jolly says the university’s top legal team tried to “rip [them] to shreds”,a judge ruled in their favour, arguing that they should be classed as employees. It was seen as a pivotal moment for the ­thousands of staff who teach at Oxford and other universities on precarious contracts.But this week Jolly told theObservershe now had no hope that Oxford had learned anything at all from the case.View image in fullscreenAlice Jolly says she fears Oxford has learned nothing from a court ruling over her zero hours contract.Photograph: Alexander Caminada“I have lost my work, been ostracised by colleagues and had no settlement from the university, no apology, no admission that the judgment has any effect on anyone else – although of course it does,” she said.She added: “Universities tend to always ask for NDAs in these employment cases, but I will be resisting that because I do not see why a settlement should be dependent on my silence.”TheObserverrevealed last yearthat two-thirds of core tutorial teaching at Oxford is done by academics on what the University and College Union calls “Deliveroo-style” hourly-paid roles or precarious fixed-term contracts.Jolly said she initially thought that the “sham contracts” she and Abrams had were unusual. “But we talked to young academics and realised no one could get a mortgage and people were stuck in this totally insecure situation for years.” It was an “open secret” the two women decided they had an obligation to expose.After their court victory, Law for Change, the charitable litigation fund which supported the pair, said the case would secure better contract rights for lecturers at Oxford, but also help others working on “exploitative contracts” right across academia.Yet although Jolly is fiercely proud of what they achieved against such a powerful and renowned university, she is now doubtful about whether other Oxford academics will have the money, or the courage, to follow their lead.The hearing was “a very hard three days”, in which both women spent more than three hours being interrogated “by a very expensive legal team” on the witness stand. “They compared our work to bedroom fitters, security guards and cleaners, and I kept thinking: ‘Yes, and all those people have no chance of fighting the gig economy, but we do.’”She and Abrams attended one hearing without lawyers. “We are tough people, but we were ripped to shreds,” she said. “I held it together in there, but when I got out of the courtroom. I wept.“Even if you’re very good ­amateurs you wouldn’t have a hope without serious legal representation,” she added. “And how much has Oxford spent trying to deny us our legal rights?”Jolly is due to appear in court again in July, in a six-day remedy hearing in which the university will be compelled to pay compensation.Prof Wyn Evans, professor of astrophysics at Cambridge University and leader of the 21 Group, which campaigns against bullying in academia and supports academics taking their universities to tribunal, said: “It takes a particular courage and stamina to do what these two academics did. Unfortunately, I think Oxford will ensure it hasn’t set a precedent.”Since last September, universities have been banned from using NDAs to cover up sexual harassment cases. However, the 21 Group is campaigning for universities to be banned from using them to hush up employment disputes too.Evans said: “Millions of pounds of public money is being spent on hushing up cases, when instead universities should be learning from their mistakes and improving how they treat staff.”Zelda Perkins, thefirst woman to break an NDAand founder of the group Can’t Buy My Silence, said: “What Alice and Rebecca did could be massively groundbreaking and change universities’ ability to exploit their staff. I can see why Oxford would want to keep them quiet.”An Oxford University spokesperson said: “The university has no comment on the ongoing litigation at this stage.“The academic quality of an Oxford education is extremely high, with the university rated first for teaching in the most recent UK national student survey results. We recognise that this is based on our committed academics and staff at all levels. We are determined that they are all rewarded and supported appropriately.“The Department for Continuing Education has completed, and is in the process of implementing, a review of its ways of working. Following a comprehensive consultation, some tutors have indicated a preference for flexible engagement and others, with whom the department is having detailed discussions, for permanent contracts of employment.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of OxfordThe ObserverZero-hours contractsHigher educationAcademicsGig economyUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Instructors were told to cancel all future travel until further notice.Firefighters, emergency medical service providers and other first responders from across the country travel to the NFA’s Maryland campus for the federally funded institution’s free training programs.“The NFA is a powerhouse for the fire service,” said Marc Bashoor, a former Maryland fire chief and West Virginia emergency services director with 44 years of fire safety experience. “It’s not a ‘nice to have’. It is the one avenue we have to bring people from all over the country to learn from and with each other. If we want to continue to have one of the premier fire services in the world, we need to have the National Fire Academy.”The academy, which also houses the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial, opened in 1973 to combat a growing number of fatal fires nationwide. At the time, the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control envisioned it to be the “West Point of the Fire Service”, according to a report form the organization.Bashoor said the NFA had been expecting to welcome a new set of fire safety officers for training next week.“People had made their plane and travel reservations. And all of a sudden, they get an email that: ‘Sorry, it’s been canceled,’” he said. “It’s really upsetting.”For firefighters, including those on the frontlines of deadly fires that ravaged California this year, having an essential training institution “shut down under the presumption that there’s waste, fraud and abuse” has been demoralizing, Bashoor said. He said losing NFA training could make the coordinated response that prevented additional deaths and destruction in California more difficult.Fema and the National Fire Academy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Further talks could still result in changes to the end-of-summit statement.US diplomats briefed their G7 counterparts that the move was because of Washington’s “re-evaluation of its position in multilateral organisations, rendering it unable to join any new initiatives”, according to the Bloomberg report.European countries are discussing plans that will let themcarry out seizuresof Moscow’s oil-exporting tankers in the Baltic Sea.The proposals include using international law to allow them to take control of vessels on environmental or piracy grounds.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsRussiaUS foreign policyG7CanadaDonald TrumpUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Sigmon was the oldest person to be executed in the state’s history and his death was part of aseries of rapidkillings the state haspursuedin the last six months as it revives capital punishment.After a 13-year pause, South Carolina now directs men on death row to choose their method of death – electric chair, lethal injection or firing squad. The development has been widely condemned by human rights activists and anti-death penalty groups.Sigmon, who was convicted of the 2001 murders of his ex-girlfriend’s parents, David and Gladys Larke, chose to be shot to death due to unclear information about drugs used in legal injections and fears they could take a long time to work.“As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject,” Collins wrote.“In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.“I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend’s parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead,” he added.Collins then went on to detail the firing squad and experience of witnessing it.“It’s impossible to know what to expect when you’ve never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you,” he said.“The firing squad is certainly faster – and more violent – than lethal injection. It’s a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon’s lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon’s head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.”“About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon’s whole body flinched,” he wrote.“A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.“A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08pm.“Then we left through the same door we came in,” he added.Sigmon’s lawyers have said it was “barbaric” to make the men on death row choose the method of their death and argued the state was obliged to provide more information about lethal injection drugs. His last words included a plea for an end to the death penalty.His last words, shared by his attorneys, read in part: “I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to help us end the death penalty. An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty. At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was.”Collins’ essay also detailed the impact of witnessing the shooting.“I won’t forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on,” he wrote.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaCapital punishmentUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

She and John Roberts, the chief justice, voted to leave in place a ruling from a US district judge that ordered theTrump administrationto unfreeze the nearly $2bn in aid for foreign aid work that had already been performed, and that had been approved by Congress.The reaction from pro-Trump rightwing commentators and activists was swift.“She is evil, chosen solely because she checked identity politics boxes. Another DEI hire. It always ends badly,” Mike Cernovich, a prominent rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist,wroteon X, referencing diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which Republicans have demonized.Fox News host Mark Levinclaimedin an online post that Barrett had “deceived people into thinking she was a reliable constitutionalist”. He added: “The power has gone to her head. It happens with frightening regularity the last half-century.”Laura Loomer, the rightwing activist who repeatedly traveled with Trump during his 2024 campaign, went even further. She posted a picture of Coney Barrett’s family, whichincludestwo adopted Black children, andwrote: “Amy Coney Barrett was a DEI appointee.” Jack Posobiec, a popular Maga figure with more than 3m followers on X,postedthat Coney Barrett was a “DEI judge”.Mike Davis, whowas involvedin the effort to confirm Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court,appearedon Steve Bannon’s podcast to add his voice to the criticism.“She’s a rattled law professor with her head up her ass,” Davis said of Coney Barrett.He added: “As we work with the Trump 47 administration on the next supreme court list, we’re going to be looking for more bold, more fearless, less DEI, and people who are going to be more of a sure bet.”The branding of Coney Barrett as a liberal judicial figure will come as a surprise to those familiar with her work and legal history.Her appointment to the supreme court in October 2020 cemented the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, and she voted to overturn Roe v Wade, which established the right to abortion in the US, in 2022. An analysis by theEmpirical Scotuswebsite found that Barrett voted with Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – the court’s two most conservative justices – more than 80% of the time in 2023.However, before the vote to reject Trump’s attempt to withhold aid, she had sided with liberal justices todeny Trump’s requestto delay sentencing in his New York hush-money case, andjoined a dissentagainst a conservative-led decision that weakened rules on the discharge of raw sewage.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtAmy Coney BarrettDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

That approach is likely to be a non-starter for mostDemocratswho have long insisted that defense and non-defense spending move in the same direction.Congress must act by midnight Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown.SpeakerMike Johnsonis teeing up the bill for a vote on Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to vote against it and risk a shutdown. He also is betting that Republicans can muscle the legislation through the House largely by themselves.Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That’s because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own.Crucially, the strategy has the backing of Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line.“All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,” Trumppostedon Truth Social on Saturday.House Republicans’ leadership staff outlined the measure Saturday, saying it would allow for about $892.5bn in defense spending and about $708bn in non-defense spending. The defense spending is slightly above the prior year’s level, but the non-defense comes in at about 8% below.The leadership aides said the deal does not include various side agreements designed to cushion non-defense programs from spending cuts. Those side agreements had been part of negotiations by Joe Biden, a Democrat, and then speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, when they were in office. The negotiations had allowed for a debt-ceiling extension in return for spending restraints. Under terms of that agreement, defense and non-defense spending had both been set to increase 1% this year.The measure will not include funding requested by individual lawmakers for thousands of community projects around the country, often referred to as earmarks.The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including programs such as social security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs are on autopilot and not regularly reviewed by Congress.The Republican representative Ralph Norman said he had never voted for a continuing resolution – what lawmakers often call a CR – but that he is on board with Johnson’s effort. He said he has confidence in Trump and the so-called “department of government efficiency”, led by Elon Musk, to make a difference on the nation’s debt.“I don’t like CRs,” Norman said. “But what’s the alternative? Negotiate with Democrats? No.”“I freeze spending for six month to go identify more cuts? Somebody tell me how that’s not a win in Washington,” added the Republican representative Chip Roy, another lawmaker who has often frequently voted against spending bills but supports the six-month continuing resolution.Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year’s spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term and raising the nation’s debt limit to avoid a catastrophic federal default.Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending.“We cannot stand by and accept a yearlong power-grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on and agencies that keep our communities safe,” said the Washington senator Patty Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee.The Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But leaders also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution.“We have to wait to see what their plan is,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “We’ve always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.”Trump has been meeting with House Republicans in an effort to win their votes on the legislation. Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster. And that’s assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesRepublicansDemocratsUS CongressMike JohnsonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t his first feint and retreat. It probably won’t be the last.A day after imposing steep tariffs on his country’s neighbors, the US president announced a month-long reprieve for carmakers. The following day, tariffs were also suspended onalmost all goods from Canada and Mexico.Tariffs onChina, levied at a 10% rate in February and doubled to 20% on Tuesday, remain in place. Trump and his aides are now trailing a fresh wave of tariffs in early April as “the big one”, with myriad markets – including the European Union – and industries in their sights.Each abrupt and erratic jerk and jolt on policy in Washington reverberates around the world, with firms in the US and far beyond trying to keep track of developments from one day to the next – and figure out what they mean.The architects of Trumponomics insist it will pave the way for a greater, more prosperous future. But firms are struggling to make out the economic landscape now, let alone what might happen next.“When you have such a high level of uncertainty, and have a set of policies that seem to impact every part of the economy ... it leads to businesses essentially being frozen,” said Sameera Fazili, former deputy director of the national economic council (NEC) under Joe Biden. “They’re not able to make investments. They’re not able to make plans. They’re not able to make hiring decisions.“Because they don’t know where these policies are going to head. These policies are going to have such an impact on their bottom line.”In the four short months since his election victory last November, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs onCanadaand Mexico in January; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in February; threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; briefly imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in March; revoked those tariffs on most goods; and threatened to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico in April.For companies attempting to navigate North America – from car manufacturers to juice makers – the world shifted, and shifted back, at a dizzying pace in a matter of days. “I don’t know how they navigate it,” said Fazili. “You can’t run a business with one-month cliffs around you all the time.”“This is not a moment to celebrate,” Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said after Thursday’s latest delay. “The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll.“We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People’s livelihoods are at stake.”As a campaigner, Trump’s great political skill is his ability to use rhetoric – often brash, crude and even false – to bend perception of reality.The president’s rhetoric can leave listeners with the impression that tariffs will revitalize America’s industrial heartlands, and fill up the federal government’s coffers with trillions of dollars from other countries, with only a minor impact on US consumers.“The countries and companies that have been ripping us aren’t particularly happy with what I’m doing,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. Sure, tariffs might bring about “a little short-term interruption” in theUS economy, he conceded, but “I don’t think it’s going to be big”.But the reality of tariffs is trickier. Tariffs are generally paid by importers, for starters – in this case, US companies buying goods from overseas – not exporters, who sell the products, or the countries where they are based. Many of these US firmsquickly made plain this weekthat they would pass on these higher costs to their customers.While Trump has used the threat of tariffs to encourage overseas firms to relocate their factories to the US, such longer-term investments are harder for executives to plan when they do not know which duties will be in place next week.Seven weeks into his second term, as many Americans grapple with the cost of living after years of higher inflation, Trump continues to blame Joe Biden. “We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” he said during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night.The US economy is not in a state of catastrophe, having shown remarkable resilience in the years following the end of the pandemic. The biggest issue has been inflation, which surged to its highest level in a generation three years ago, but has since fallen dramatically from this peak.Presidents typically “move on quickly, or don’t criticize their predecessors by name”, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “Here’s another norm that Trump has exploded. Trump has no limits and his base lets him get away with anything. So expect it to continue.”But should prices rise as a direct result of Trump’s decisions – as many economists and business leaders have warned – it will grow more challenging to blame Biden for day-to-day affordability challenges.On the campaign trail last year, Trump repeatedly pledged to “rapidly” bring down prices from “day one” of his second administration. “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,” hedeclaredon the eve of November’s election.Only after winning did he acknowledge how difficult this would be. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up,” hetold Timea few weeks his victory. “You know, it’s very hard.”It is one thing to play down higher prices and bills as “a little short-term interruption” when they’re a risk. Should they become reality, such rhetoric is less likely to wash.“Once you’re in charge, you’re in charge,” said Fazili. “And if there’s a problem in the economy, people look to you to fix it.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyUS small businessTrump administrationDonald TrumpMexicoChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

With Trump in power, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped lawsuits against bothKraken, which it formerly alleged to be an “unregistered securities exchange”, andCoinbase.Such moves followed the departure on inauguration day, 20 January, ofGary Gensler, confirmed as SEC chair under Joe Biden but whom Trump had vowed to remove.Caroline Crenshaw, a commissioner confirmed in Trump’s first term but like Gensleropposedby crypto interests, was set to serve a second four-year term but is now to be replaced.“Crypto money played such an important role in the election,” Bruce Freed, CPA president, said. “Take a look at some of the candidates who went down where there was heavy crypto spending.“Take a look at the case of [the progressive representative andcrypto skeptic] Katie Porter in the [US Senate] primary in California. Adam Schiff [a more crypto-friendly Democrat] benefited from that. You had the heavy crypto spending against Sherrod Brown [an incumbent Democrat, defeated in Ohio by thecrypto-friendlyRepublican Bernie Moreno], because he was chair of the Senate banking committee [and a crypto skeptic].“And then you take a look at the SEC, and you take a look at oversight and regulation of crypto, and some of the enforcement actions that were brought under Gary Gensler against crypto now have been dropped. So you can see a very significant impact in a short period of time, of crypto money.”Ben Schaffzin, CPA assistant director of research and primary report author, said crypto companies “far and away blew every other industry out the water in terms of outside spending” in 2024. “We haven’t seen something like that before … and now we’re seeing theTrump administrationmove very quickly around their idea of this ‘crypto strategic reserve’,” Schaffzin said.This month, Trump, who haslaunchedhis own crypto ventures,wroteon his social media platform that using taxpayer money to create “a US Crypto Reserve” would “elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration”, amid a push to “make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World”.On Thursday, Trumpsignedan executive order to establish the reserve. On Friday, he held a White House “cryptocurrency summit”, followed by a reception hosted by Coinbase.Schaffzin and fellow report author Jeanne Hanna, CPA vice-president of research, note Trump’s appointment of David Sacks, a South African entrepreneur and crypto investor, as “crypto czar”.Sacks “hasreportedlydivested his personal crypto holdings”, the authors write, but “it remains to be seen if [he] will divest from his investment firm as well, of which he remains a partner and [which] stands to profit from the coins mentioned in the executive order if purchased in large numbers by the US government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I think maybe the overall regulatory environment through Congress possibly wouldn’t have been dramatically different under Harris compared to Trump.”Freed said: “With Trump, you have a much more transactional approach to politics and policymaking, and I think that’s very, very significant on [crypto]. When you see the money that poured in, for instance, against Sherrod Brown, you see basically crypto wanting to free itself from any oversight and regulation.“There clearly was tremendous interest in what happens at the SEC … crypto clearly did not want to be encumbered in any way by oversight or regulation.”Musk calls social security a ‘Ponzi scheme’. The real con is what Trump’s peddling | Robert ReichRead moreTo illustrate the dangers of crypto in politics, the CPA report cites recent events in Argentina, where Javier Milei – like Trump, a rightwing populist president – promoted “a scam coin called $Libra that lost all of its value, nearly $4.6bn in mere hours.“While President Milei quickly deleted his endorsement of the token after the fact, his political opposition has filed over 100 fraud complaints with the government, prompting a judge to open an investigation” amidcallsfor Milei to be impeached.“This scandal has only served to further highlight the systemic risks surrounding crypto,” the CPA authorswrite.Schaffzin said Argentina should stand as a warning to Trump’s administration, adding: “Preaching this stuff from the top, from an executive that really doesn’t understand the mechanisms of crypto and how risky it is to ordinary consumers who don’t know the pitfalls in this product, is extremely dangerous.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCryptocurrenciesUS politicsUS political financingE-commerceInternetRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Saturday night the Gtech was recreated as grindhouse, two teams scratching and scraping at each other, all sinew and sweat.For Unai Emery, playing Champions League football while aiming for the top five resembles building an aeroplane in mid-flight. To maintain the dream state that being in the competition has given fans and staff alike this season,Aston Villamust improve their away form. With his team having previously failed to win after Champions League away trips, the winner from Ollie Watkins was vital for the domestic challenge ahead. It pulled Chelsea and Manchester City within striking distance. “This three points gives us confidence, the belief to train to compete for a European position,” said the satisfied Basque manager. “We are trying to get ­balance in the league.”For Thomas Frank, there is the disappointment of far too much heavy traffic to negotiate if his club to play continental football. If Bees fans blamed refereeing for defeat, injuries and fatigue have curbed theBrentfordwhirlwind. “Of course we dream and want to end as high as possible,” said Frank. “You could see [Villa] felt the pressure because they had to win. They have signed five great players [in the winter transfer window] – that’s what we’re competing against.”Brentford v Aston Villa: Premier League – liveRead moreWith midweek’s home return legagainst Club Brugge to consider, despite a 3-1 lead, Emery’s selection was risk-averse, Emi Martínez and Marco Asensio back in Birmingham, both with “muscle pain”, according to their manager. The Argentinian’s first Premier League absence of the season brought in Robin Olsen as goalkeeper. Villa have a mixed record when the Swede has played, 17 goals conceded in seven previous starts.Here he saw out his second clean sheet, though not without moments of trepidation. “He did a fantastic job today,” said Emery. “He is appreciated as a person. It is not easy being behind the best goalkeeper in the world.”His tactics initially appeared the opposite of cautious.

Jail records showed Worthy had not yet posted bond by Saturday morning. The records did not have any details of the arrest or list an attorney.Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year’s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at theNFLcombine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs’ go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.The Chiefs came to rely on Worthy in part because of a season-ending injury to wide receiver Rashee Rice, who was coming off a brilliant rookie season of his own. Rice caught 24 passes for 288 yards and two TDs in four games before getting hurt.Rice and another driver, Theodore Knox, were involved in a high-speed car crash in March 2024 that triggered a chain reaction on a highway in Dallas, close to where he had played college football at SMU. Rice is currently facing at least two civil lawsuits along with numerous criminal charges for his role in the wreck.Rice turned himself in following the crash, and his attorney, Texas Sen. Royce West, said that the wide receiver admitted that he was driving the Lamborghini involved. Rice also posted on social media that he took responsibility for his role in the crash.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

In his absence, they lacked imagination and quality in the final third, mustering a deserved draw against Everton when there was an opportunity to win.Wolves are six points clear of the relegation zone, but on a weekend where Southampton and Ipswich had already lost, while Leicester face a difficult trip to Chelsea on Sunday, it felt like a missed opportunity. There were individual milestones as Jack Harrison scored his first goal in over a year forEvertonand Marshall Munetsi opened his account for Wolves but it was a turgid affair at Molineux.Wolves v Everton: Premier League – liveRead moreAfterbeing sent off for a headbuttat Bournemouth last week, Cunha’s role was reduced to posing for photos and signing autographs for mascots before kick-off. His head coach, Vítor Pereira, would have preferred him to have shown a similar amount of affability when in close proximity to Milos Kerkez and to have had him available for more than public relation duties.Without Cunha, who has scored 13 and assisted a further four in the Premier League this season, Wolves were unable to make the most of enjoying two-thirds of possession throughout the match, rustling three shots on target. Munetsi had a first-half header saved from close range by Jordan Pickford, who also repelled a flash across goal by Jørgen Strand Larsen in the final quarter of a match that always seemed destined to end with parity.“I don’t believe that we can build a team around a player because I believe Cunha is very important for us, as he can do special things, in a moment he can decide a game, but the most important thing is the team,” Pereira said. “We showed today we have a team. The team showed the confidence to try and win the game with this spirit.” Unfortunately for the Wolves head coach, camaraderie cannot create or finish chances.The visitors were more incisive in the early stages and had three chances in quick succession. Abdoulaye Doucouré had a shot blocked on the line, Jarrad Branthwaite’s goalbound header flicked wide off a golden shoulder and Beto was too slow to reach a Harrison cross.View image in fullscreenJack Harrison opens the scoring for Everton against Wolves.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAIt was a low quality affair from the start and the opening goal arrived through a mixture of incompetence and luck. Emmanuel Agbadou’s dreadful clearance was headed straight back by James Tarkowski to Jesper Lindstrøm. The right winger slipped when seeking out Harrison on the other side but the ball still found him, allowing him to control and shoot, with the ball nestling in the bottom corner thanks to a Matt Doherty deflection.Jean-Ricner Bellegarde was the most likely candidate to provide dynamism in the final third for Wolves in unha’s absence. He flashed a shot inches wide from the edge of the box before initiating the equaliser. The Frenchman drove down the middle and slipped a pass into the area, it looked like Branthwaite had it covered but he got his feet in a muddle, allowing Munetsi to capitalise from close range seven minutes after the opener.Injury prevented Munetsi from returning for the second half, although he did not miss much. Everton were equally as blunt as the hosts, missing their own spark in Iliman Ndiaye, forcing David Moyes to send on Carlos Alcaraz to sharpen up their attack. He created his side’s best chance of the second half by instigating a break and sending Beto through one-on-one but the goalkeeper José Sá got down quickly to his left and secured a point for his team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From Arne Slot’s elevated position up in the Anfield directors’ box, however, he could see warning signs with Paris Saint-Germain on the horizon.“When I look at the first game against PSG, we have to go one step up in terms of intensity,” said theLiverpoolhead coach. “And compared to the game today, we need to go five, six, seven steps up in terms of intensity if we want to have any chance of reaching the next round.”The French champions will not be as obliging as the Premier League’s bottom club in Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 second leg should Liverpool repeat this display. Slot insisted this was a one-off.The Premier League leaders required two Mohamed Salah penalties to move closer to the title after Darwin Núñez cancelled out Will Smallbone’s opener for Ivan Juric’s doomed side. The hosts also needed an injection of energy and quality from a triple half-time substitution to rouse themselves from a lethargic and sloppy opening. Southampton were able to grow in confidence and menace before stunning Anfield by taking the lead. They would ultimately bemoan three video assistant referee reviews that went against them.Liverpool v Southampton, Brighton v Fulham, and more: football – liveRead moreSlot had labelled Southampton’s visit as the first of three finals this week. “I’m hoping we play a bit better in the next two finals than we did in the first one,” he admitted after serving the final game of his touchline ban.The Liverpool head coach had his head in his hands when a calamitous mix-up handed Southampton the breakthrough. That Virgil van Dijk and the hero of Paris, Alisson, were involved heightened the unease inside Anfield. The Liverpool captain attempted to shepherd a Ryan Manning throw-in back to his goalkeeper but Alisson, off balance after a Mateus Fernandes challenge, failed to collect. The ball squirmed loose to Smallbone, who squeezed a low shot through the Brazilian’s legs and in from a tight angle.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah scores one of his two penalties for Liverpool.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesLiverpool could have been in a worse position before half-time. The VAR checked a possible red card offence by Núñez after he was booked for taking a swipe at Kyle Walker-Peters. Núñez made no attempt to play the ball but the VAR stuck with the on-field decision of the new Premier League referee Lewis Smith.Slot’s half-time changes said everything about Liverpool’s performance. His selection appeared risky from the off with only Andy Robertson, Alexis Mac Allister and Diogo Jota rested from the team that started at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. There was no reward of a first league start of the season for Harvey Elliott, though he was among the half-time replacements for Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas. The impact was immediate.Elliott almost repeatedhis PSG performanceby scoring within seconds of his arrival. Aaron Ramsdale, who saved well from Trent Alexander-Arnold but was relatively untroubled in the first half, turned the 21-year-old’s drive wide of the far post. There was a sharpness and aggression to Liverpool that had been absent before the changes. Now Slot witnessed the intensity he had called for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move was instigated by one of the half-time substitutes, Robertson, who found Luis Díaz hugging the left touchline. Díaz darted past Walker-Peters to the byline and centred for the Uruguay striker to convert at the near post.The game turned moments later when Ramsdale saved from Díaz and Núñez went down under a challenge from Smallbone as Southampton attempted to clear. Smith awarded a soft penalty, the VAR did not intervene, and Salah swept an unstoppable spot-kick into Ramsdale’s right corner. The 242nd goal of Salah’s Liverpool career moved him to outright third in the club’s all-time goalscorers’ list. “It was not a penalty and that changed the match,” said an angry Juric. “This cannot be a penalty ever.”Juric also bemoaned the award of Liverpool’s second penalty but conceded Yukinari Sugawara “needs to be more careful” after he handled following a tussle with Díaz. A Sugawara handball gave Salah a spot-kick to complete Liverpool’s comebackat St Mary’s Stadium in November. Here it presented the Egypt international with the opportunity to go joint-fifth on the all-time Premier League scorers’ chart with Sergio Agüero. The phenomenal forward’s 184th top-flight goal was drilled emphatically into Ramsdale’s top left corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverLiverpoolSouthamptonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the Seahawks will seek a new starter.From nepotism to staggeringly bad contracts: the NFL’s most hopeless franchisesRead moreSmith threw for 4,320 yards and 21 touchdowns with 15 interceptions last season and will be the clear favorite to be the starter when Las Vegas opens its season, even if the club selects a quarterback in next month’s draft.Because the Raiders pick sixth, they almost certainly wouldn’t be in position to select Miami quarterback Cam Ward and might not be able to pick Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders. If Sanders is available, the Raiders could select him and follow the path of the Atlanta Falcons, who last year signed free agent Kirk Cousins and drafted Michael Penix Jr with the eighth pick.The Raiders also could take a quarterback later in the draft, such as Alabama’s Jalen Milroe. Or they could pass on a quarterback altogether and go with a QB room that includes Smith and Aidan O’Connell, who ended each of the past two seasons as the starter but didn’t show he was capable of making the Raiders a contender in an AFC West that last season sent three teams to the playoffs.All except the Raiders, who went 4-13 and fired coach Antonio Pierce and general manager Tom Telesco.Carroll hopes to find the kind of success he experienced when he resurrected Smith’s career by giving him a home in Seattle in 2019. Smith had lost his starting job with the New York Jets and spent one season each with the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers.Even in Seattle, he didn’t make an immediate impact.But Carroll turned to Smith in 2022, and the QB led the league by completing 69.8% of his passes while throwing for 4,282 yards and 30 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He was named the NFL’s Comeback Player of the Year.The Seahawks had winning records in all three seasons with Smith behind center.Trading for Smith is the latest in a series of moves the Raiders have made this offseason, including this week.They signed defensive end Maxx Crosby on Wednesday to the richest contract for a non-quarterback in league history. He received a three-year extension worth $106.5m, with $91.5m guaranteed, to keep him in Las Vegas through the 2029 season.Signing Crosby and trading for Smith are the clearest signs of a change in direction under new leadership that includes Carroll, general manager John Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady.Whether that results in a playoff berth this season is another question, especially if the Raiders expect Smith to compete in a division that includes quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Bo Nix.Smith going to the Raiders also takes away a potential landing spot for Aaron Rodgers, who is looking for a new team after the New York Jets announced they would release him.Explore more on these topicsLas Vegas RaidersNFLSeattle SeahawksUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Bay FC said Friday in a statement that a third party investigated the claim and found no evidence of misconduct.The league on Friday confirmed that it has opened a formal review by an outside party.On a conference call with reporters ahead of Friday night’s Challenge Cup match between the defendingNWSLchampion Orlando Pride and the Washington Spirit, Berman addressed the report.“Our goal is to create a safe, healthy work environment for everyone and everything that we’re doing, both proactively and responsibly, is in service of that,” she said. “Based on information that has come to our attention, a review is underway by an independent third party and we’re very confident that the system we have in place will ensure that we surface the issues that need to be addressed, and that we’ll continue to work with all of our clubs, our technical staffs and our players to make sure that we’re achieving our goal of creating a safe, healthy working environment.”There was no timeline set for the league’s review.It is the second time this year that Bay FC has come under scrutiny. The club’s head of domestic scouting, Graeme Abel, resigned in late February after just a week on the job amid allegations of verbal abuse while he was coach at the University of Oregon.The NWSL was rocked by an abuse and misconduct scandal in 2021. Five coaches resigned or were fired in the aftermath and it prompted two investigations, one by US Soccer and another by the league and its players’ union.In response, the NWSL implemented changes to protect players, including enhanced vetting of club employees and an anonymous tip line for players. The NWSL Players Association also negotiated safeguards in the collective bargaining agreement with the league.The NWSL established a $5m fund for players who were subject to abuse as part of a settlement announced last month with the attorneys general from Washington DC, Illinois and New York. The settlement also requires the league to maintain safeguards already in place.Four former employees and two former players told the Chronicle they chose to leave the San Jose-based team after its inaugural season last year because of Montoya. Two of those interviewed said the coach would “target and bully” players who questioned decisions.The Chronicle spoke to more than a dozen former and current players, team officials and league sources for its investigation.Bay FC said in a statement that it had worked to address “communications challenges” that came to light in a midseason player survey last year, and that improvement was reflected in an end-of-season survey. The club said it implemented new procedures, including executive coaching and setting a clear framework for team values and culture.“We were recently made aware of feedback from the league about our end-of-season survey that is related solely to communication challenges. We take all feedback very seriously and are working closely with the league to review and will take the appropriate steps necessary based on findings. We were founded as a player-centric club, and we will do what we need to make sure we have a supportive environment for our players,” the team’s statement said.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The most successful resemble club teams in that they have a core of players and a clearly defined style of play. There’s always an in-form player around whom a clamour develops, but continuity is just as important, perhaps even more so, in the international game. But next week inevitably represents a new start as Thomas Tuchel picks his firstEnglandsquad for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia later in the month.All managers make some slightly surprising selections to start with – Sven-Göran Eriksson, for instance, began witha 3-0 friendly win against Spainin which Chris Powell, Gavin McCann and Michael Ball all played a half – but this should give at least some indication of how Tuchel plans to set about trying to win the 2026 World Cup.Tuchel casts net far and wide for talent as he ponders 55-player England longlistRead moreGiven his contract runs only until the end of that tournament, there is little reason for him to look to the long term: there’s no point blooding players who might be coming into their prime for Euro 2028. His job is to win in 2026, which may mean a greater willingness to pick older players who had seemed to have drifted from the picture. While there are obvious drawbacks if Tuchel ends up ignoring youth, a clarity of focus may turn out to be beneficial. Jam tomorrow often ends up not being jam at all.That, and the lack of outstanding alternatives, probably means Harry Kane still leading the side, even if he has underwhelmed in the last two tournaments. Ollie Watkins impressed at the Euros but has not had the best season, Ivan Toney has removed himself from consideration by joining Al-Ahli, while Dominic Solanke, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Callum Wilson have all struggled with injury. Danny Welbeck, at 34, could be the beneficiary of a new short-termism. Liam Delap, at 22, has surely done enough for at least a call-up.What comes behind Kane is a thornier question. At the Euros,Englandended up with too many players whose natural position was either as a No 10 or drifting from wide into that position – a particular issue given the way Kane naturally drops into that role. Telling him to stay high seems to miss the point; one of his greatest gifts is his ability to fall deeper, spin and ping passes to players running beyond him. But England suddenly lacked players to run beyond him, a problem, arguably, of Gareth Southgate – so often derided as conservative, staid and over-loyal – making too many changes too quickly.View image in fullscreenA lack of outstanding alternatives probably means Harry Kane will still lead England, even if he has underwhelmed in the last two tournaments.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverInjury removes Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke, while Raheem Sterling is surely no longer under consideration, but there is still an intimidating array of options: Jude Bellingham, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Morgan Gibbs-White, Anthony Gordon, Jack Grealish, James Maddison, Ethan Nwaneri, Cole Palmer, Marcus Rashford, Morgan Rogers …The question really is one of balance: Rashford may only just be showing flickerings of form after his loan move to Aston Villa, but his pace, his capacity to run into the space Kane vacates, may be what England need from the left. Can Palmer and Bellingham both be accommodated? There may have to be some very difficult omissions.At the back of midfield – the squad seem naturally to fall into a 4-2-3-1 or perhaps a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid shape – Tuchel faces the problem all England managers have of the lack of a ball-playing anchor. Declan Rice seems not to have the tactical awareness needed for the role and is better deployed as the more attacking of the two holders, driving forwards.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold presents the usual dilemma: is there a way of covering his defensive shortcomings to accommodate his supreme ball-playing?Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverThat absence is why Lee Carsleyturned to Angel Gomesbut, for all the Lille midfielder’s technical ability, doubts persist about his physicality, which is why so many have invested so much hope in Adam Wharton. He surely will be in the squad, although given he is just regaining fitness after a groin problem, it would be unfair to expect too much too soon. Curtis Jones and Conor Gallagher could also have roles to play, particularly if the preference is for something closer to 4-3-3 than 4-2-3-1.Jordan Pickford remains the clear first choice in goal, but the back four is far harder to predict. Marc Guéhihad an outstanding Eurosand, after a slightly shaky start to the season, has returned to form recently and has a good claim to be the left-sided centre-back. In an ideal world, his partner would probably be John Stones but his thigh injury opens the door to a host of candidates, foremost among them perhaps Ezri Konsa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lewis Hall, who was given his Chelsea debut by Tuchel, would probably have been the left-back after an excellent season but he is out until the summer. Myles Lewis-Skelly has made a huge impact at Arsenal, even if he does feel like a red card waiting to happen.Great individuals help, as England found at the last Euros when their misfiring side somehow reached the finalTyrick Mitchell, after another quietly impressive season, is a more experienced option but Tuchel may decide fielding somebody more used to operating at wing-back is too much of a risk, particularly if he goes for Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right. A player who can tuck in as a de facto third centre-back would offer better balance, which makes it a shame Levi Colwill hasn’t had a better season.On the right, Alexander-Arnold presents the usual dilemma: is there a way of covering his defensive shortcomings to accommodate his supreme ball-playing? In that sense the question of his selection is less to do with him than the makeup of the midfield and the rest of the back four. Rico Lewis, Tino Livramento, Djed Spence or, if he can stay fit, Reece James represent safer options.But, as ever, the key is internal coherence, picking the right players not the best players, and having a thick enough skin to ignore the noise around whoever happens to be flavour of the month. Great individuals help, of course, as England found at the last Euros when their misfiring side somehow reached the final. But what actually wins tournaments is the rest, those who allow the great individuals to flourish. Anybody can pick Lionel Messi; the real skill is finding Rodrigo De Paul.Explore more on these topicsEnglandInside footballThomas TuchelcommentShareReuse this content"

Twas ever thus. Punditry is, by nature, viewed through the prism of the past. Glance into a Premier League press room on match day, the thickened waistlines and/or greying hair of former heroes will be present and correct.The BBC’sTest Match Specialis forever travelling back in time, if not so frequently as whenFred Truemanwas part of the team. The self-proclaimed “fastest bloody bowler that ever drew breath” constantly hailed back to the days of Leonard Hutton and the Yorkshire team of the 50s. TMS, despite cricket’s many modernities, has never truly extracted itself from its golden era ofEW Swantonand John Arlott.The Haaland safari: Bryne celebrates its famous son in Norway’s newest tourist attractionRead moreFootball, a sport of far greater partisanship, is full of such golden ages, depending on which club you may favour. A listener to Merseyside’s Radio City in the 90s on Saturday evenings could hear Ian St John, formerly half of ITV’sSaint and Greavsie, hold forth on the latest failings of Liverpool FC. “That’s no’ a Liverpool team,” the Saint, Kop idol turned keeper of the Shankly faith, would grumble.Concurrently, viewers ofMatch of the Daywere presented with Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, twin rocks of the 80s Liverpool machine turned shirt-sleeved critics of serial champions turned tabloid fodder “Spice Boys”. Hansen’s Clackmannanshire baritone and Lawro’s Lancastrian, Mavis Riley-like whine would dissect their former club’s performances, punches occasionally pulled in the hope things would turn around. They weren’t angry, just disappointed.A Liverpool player of the time would have few places to turn to avoid disapproval. On Sky, Phil Thompson, jettisoned from coaching after a falling-out with Graeme Souness, became an often searing critic. Around such time, neutrality was abandoned as an impossible job, giving rise to the largely partisan pundits found on pay-TV broadcasts. Every club has one, and if not, Steve Sidwell probably played for them.AManchester Unitedplayer of 2025 has even fewer places to hide than his 90s Liverpool equivalent. In the pundit class, Sir Alex Ferguson’s players pervade, including, and this is no exhaustive list, Gary Neville’s groans of warning, Roy Keane’s squawks of disgust, Paul Scholes’s sighing disapproval and Rio Ferdinand’s rising volume.Other former United stars are available. Most have contributed to a criticism of their former club that has become an avalanche. Punches are rarely pulled. None has an official role at United like, say, Micah Richards’ club ambassadorship for Manchester City. The Glazer family’s – and latterly Ineos’s – lack of interest in a past that cannot be monetised has demobbed an army into one that now rails against them.View image in fullscreenRoy Keane does not hold back in the media but Ruben Amorim has the confidence to take on the old guard.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEach reverse sees a former Ferguson charge rant, almost on a rota basis, Keane doing double shifts. Last week, asUnited exited the FA Cup, it was Wayne Rooney’s turn, using the word “naive” to describe Ruben Amorim. The United manager’s riposte – “That’s why I’m here, at 40 years old, coaching Manchester United” – was a missile guided towards his critic’s struggles to establish himself in coaching.Where Liverpool players of their doldrum era have spoken of the dangers of kicking back, Amorim retains the self-confidence to take on the old guard, becoming a gift to headlines, adding fire and colour to common-and-garden quotes follow-ups.Technology has added multitudes. Social media, where Neville’s partner in punditry, the perennially online Jamie Carragher, is usually found, is key, though the collapse of X into a Dante’s Inferno of wrongness has lately lessened its impact. YouTube and podcasts are where the money is. The most piping-hot takes, too.They are served hottest byThe Overlappodcast, where Neville, Carragher, Keano, Jill Scott and Ian Wright plus guests – Scholesey, Wazza, Butty, Schmeichs, Becks – perch round the type of kitchen island no Cheshire footballer’s mansion would be complete without.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Manchester United players of 2025, struggling within the 3-4-3 formation the old gods dismiss despite other Premier League teams making it work, find themselves in a media environment where the treble of 1999 and accompanying triumphs are regularly relived, where Ferguson’s team’s unrepeatable magic has grown men cooing like the subservient young men they once were.It makes for popular, watchable content, but in constantly looking to the past, any brighter future for United feels further away than ever.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverGary NevilleRoy KeaneRio FerdinandSky SportsSport TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe the answer is: nothingBarney RonayNo new striker, too many injuries, too intense – the supposed fatal flaws in Mikel Arteta’s team ignore their consistent successSat 8 Mar 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 14.32 ESTShareOne of the problems with sport, imported from heartwarming mid-90s books about Man Feelings and their attendant movie adaptations featuring Colin Farrell looking sad in a hoodie, is the idea that football in particular has something to tell us about life. In many ways this is correct. It’s just that the things football has to tell us are not always good or helpful.For example, the concept of the zero-sum game.It’s not azero-sum game.People say this a lot now, often in the context of some reductive and binary argument, the kind of internet shouting match where there can be only one winner, that for one party to succeed it must necessarily be bad for everyone else, without nuance or shared benefits and burdens. Grownups are always insisting that it’s not a zero-sum game.Ruben Amorim fears he ‘will not have same time’ as Arteta to improve UnitedRead moreExcept, football actually is a zero-sum game. This is just one of the sport’s really bad life lessons, modelling a universe where to be a loser is to be a fraud, weakling and moral vacuum, where the only options are victory or shame, where managers will be routinely mocked for trying to get around this with their alternative metrics, their process and performance. Win or fail. It’s that simple. Cry more.This is clearly a false model in football too, where it is also necessary to learn and improve, to take chances, to fail again, fail better. In particular it has been bad news for Arsenal, who travel toOld Trafford’s vale of lost soulson Sunday pursued as ever by notions of the fatal flaw, the idea that something is fundamentally rotten in their season, with an ongoing debate among pundits and voices on the internet designed to establish the exact nature of this unarguable failure. What, exactly, has gone wrong with Arsenal? Maybe the answer is: nothing.Given the surrounding weather, this takes some getting used to as an idea. The obvious objection is that finishing second in the Premier League, asArsenalprobably will, is axiomatically a failure. And that finishing second whenfirst was there for the takingcounts as a double failure.But is any of this true?Some context may help. Should they finish second for a third straight season Mikel Arteta’s team will be the third most consistently successful version of Arsenal ever, in a top-tier existence stretching back to 1904. The only Arsenal eras to surpass this run of league finishes are the Herbert Chapman-built team of the early 30s and the peak Wenger years, 1998-2005, when Arsenal spent eight seasons in the top two, when they had Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and a culture-busting manager.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s trip to Ruben Amorim’s United on Sunday is a reminder that things could be much, much worse.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesThird-best Arsenal ever, then, on league finishes at least, and built out of the fourth-highest net transfer spend in the league across Arteta’s time at the club. During Arteta’s reign Arsenal have gone eighth, eighth, fifth, second, second and (probably) second. Take away Liverpool’s brilliant season and they would be top. Is this really a problem that needs solving? How is it possible to construct even the most marginalised of Arteta-must-go subcultures out of this upturn in fortunes?Except, the title wasthere for the taking! But was it? The world’s strongest league, thronging with ambitious, robust teams, is never going be a stroll for anyone. And yet even Liverpool are being portrayed as middling champions, placeholders, a default option. This season Arne Slot’s team have beaten the champions of Spain, the champions of Germany, the champions of France and the champions of England (twice), all without conceding a goal. At what point do you actually get to be good? Sometimes someone else just deserved it more.Still, the zero-sum game insists second must be failure. So we get the endlessly churning Munchausen syndrome by proxy, the certainty there is some fatal malady waiting to be diagnosed. Which isn’t to say there aren’t elements to improve. Even trophy-winning teams carry flaws. Arsenal have lost or drawn games they should have won. How unforgivable are the key charges?The most obvious fatal flaw is not signing a dedicated goalscorer in the past 18 months. In outline it does look simple. Scoring more goals, having someone in double figures by now. Surely this would, on balance, be good. Why would anyone actively choose to have Mikel Merino up front and not, say, Alexander Isak?View image in fullscreenSaying Arsenal have failed if they finish second this season ignores Liverpool’s excellence.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBut how easy is this in practice? How irrational are the choices that led to it? Arsenal began the season with an attack built around Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Martin Ødegaard, the same attack that helped them score 91 goals in the league last season, a title-trending number.In the event every single one of these attackers has been injured for a significant period. Saka and Ødegaard, the key axis, have played 10 league games together. Injuries should be factored in. Always add, even from a position of strength. But this also has to be a player good enough to operate in the system as well as score goals, while also falling within budget, being available and fitting with the culture Arteta has constructed out of the slightly broken environment he inherited.There is surely a door somewhere along this route, a fork in the road that could have averted a situation where you’re trying to win the league with a jobbing midfielder playing up front. But how many of these candidates actually exist in world football? The club tried, couldn’t find the right outstanding player at the right price and took the view that sometimes the best move is not to make a move at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rejecting this model entirely, refusing to splurge when a player doesn’t quite hit all your vectors. Is this really such a crime? It is at least consistent with the elements that have taken Arteta’s Arsenal this far. A misstep, but a logical one. Fatal flaw verdict: not guilty.The second most common falling-short in the current analysis is a basic lack of discipline, a brittleness, as expressed in red cards (more than anyone else in the league), and a habit of over-celebrating each step, too hyped, too desperate for it all to work.There has been justifiable frustration at times this season, an inability to win when winning would have meant most, forcing Liverpool to play their own games with footsteps at their back. Wrapped up in this is the sense that even the injuries are in some sense self-induced, that what Arsenal are guilty of is too much intensity, an excessive focus on winning the same way, running their own players thin.There is perhaps something in this. Albeit, as fatal flaws go, there are plenty of worse ones around. Again Sunday’s opponents are an ideal counterexample, a club that presents itself repeatedly as the opposite of this, soul-sick, low-throttle, frightened of its own shadow.If Arteta’s Arsenal seem too intense, if there is unease at a managerwho announces he would rather diethan see his team slacken off in pursuit of the distant league leaders – Mikel, all good, but let’s take the death stuff out, yeah? – then it is important to remember the nature of the environment Arteta inherited.View image in fullscreenArsenal travel to Old Trafford off the back of their thumping 7-1 win over PSV in the Champions League.Photograph: Simon Traylen/ProSports/ShutterstockThat Arsenal were characterised as similarly decadent, defined by senior players failing to pull their weight, weighed down by United-level negativity. Weeding this out, instilling that intensity, was always the keynote of the entire rebuild. Intensity was Arteta’s version of Ruben Amorim’s wingbacks-or-die philosophy. Total commitment was his three at the back. This was the one non-negotiable. Even the obvious missteps, the unfortunate remarks about Saka just needing to be ready to play 70 games a season, about Havertz’s gene-based indestructibility (enter: random hamstring injury) spring from it.Arteta was always a risky appointment, then 37 years old and in his first proper job. The positive outcomes are so obvious: back in the Champions League, happy dressing room, clear playing identity, young players showing the best of themselves. A tendency towards excessive intensity seems a small price to pay, consistent with the good parts – just as sticking with the manager and absorbing the bumps in the road are also the opposite of the Manchester United playbook of the past 10 years.Perhaps Arteta’s most interesting comment in the wake ofthe 7-1 win at PSV Eindhoven(Does this count as good? Are we OK with it?) is that the Champions League can now offer his team “a different energy”, a competition where they are naturally less invested. For now, if there is any lesson to be drawn from a trip to Old Trafford, the ghost ship, the meat grinder, it is simply to count the good bits as well as the bad, and always to be careful what you wish for.Explore more on these topicsArsenalThe ObserverMikel ArtetaManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

As he prepares for Sunday’s Premier League visit to Manchester United, he hopes it can mark a turning point.The Haaland safari: Bryne celebrates its famous son in Norway’s newest tourist attractionRead more“I’m very used to people speaking about me, judging my performances and I do that myself,” said the 26-year-old. “I’m harder on myself and I know that I have not been good enough, especially in front of goal. I work hard every day to improve it and I know I have the ability and the talent to do it. PSV Eindhoven was good and hopefully now I can do more towards the end of the season.”Arsenal are missing four key forwards through injury – Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus. As such, it was encouraging for them to have six different scorers against PSV, including all three of their makeshift front line – Ethan Nwaneri, Mikel Merino and Leandro Trossard. Jurriën Timber and Riccardo Calafiori, on as a substitute, got the other goals from the full-back positions.Ødegaard now has five goals and seven assists from 29 appearances in all competitions. Last season, it was 11 and 11 from 48. In 2022-23, it was 15 and seven from 45. “With the players we have out, the rest of us have to step up even more,” Ødegaard said. “It’s a good thing we can share the goals and hopefully we can keep doing that.”There was a time when Arsenal versus United wasthegame of the English season. It is no longer the case, with Sunday’s hosts in turmoil. Stricken by injuries to important players, they have laboured to come to terms with what Ruben Amorim wants from his 3-4-2-1 system.United’s last stirring performance came at Arsenal in theFA Cup penalty shootout winon 12 January. They have shown themselves to be capable of raising their game under Amorim against the very best away from home. It has been a different story at Old Trafford, a steady stream of frustration, particularly in the league where the performances have been even more worrying than the dismal results.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City were limited to three shots on target, despite dominating with almost 70% possession, as Forest’s ability to soak up pressure and hit superior teams on the break was proven once again by Callum Hudson Odoi’s winner.The City manager paid tribute to Forest’s defensive prowess but pointed out that his team’s chances of qualifying for the competition they won two years ago remain in their own hands. The reigning Premier League champions have won four, including two FA Cup games, and lost five of their last nine matches and Guardiola accepted that results are too inconsistent.Hudson-Odoi floors Manchester City as Forest land Champions League blowRead more“We have to win games,” he said. “We don’t win enough games in a row to be secure. We have 10 games left; we have to win a lot of games to qualify. This is how it is. To find a way, we have to play better. We have to do something; it doesn’t come from the sky.”While Guardiola looked to the rest of the season, Nuno Espírito Santo is refusing to look beyond the next game. Forest are five points clear of sixth-placed Brighton in the race for Champions League qualification with fifth almost certain to be enough to earn entry to Europe’s premier competition.“We are very happy,” the Forest head coach said. “We did a very good game against a tough team. The defensive display was good. [We are] proud and happy.”Forest have beaten Liverpool, Manchester United, Aston Villa and City this season while holding Arsenal recently. “We are talking about the best teams around,” Nuno said. “It always gives you the confidence that you can compete well against such good players.“It allows us to grow as a team, but it doesn’t change the opponent ahead of you because the Premier League is very tough. Now, we look ahead to Ipswich [next Saturday]. Let’s rest because it was a tough week for us. Many of our players made 120 minutes-plus [also against Ipswich, in the FA Cup on Monday] and now 90 minutes today. Thank God they are healthy for now. Let’s keep them healthy, recover and prepare for the next one.“The players are doing amazing, the fans are giving us help, so let’s keep on enjoying.”Hudson-Odoi told TNT Sports: “We know it’s the last games of the season and we’re going to have to fight every single game. I’m absolutely buzzing with the goal and I’m happy for the team at the end of the day.

The game was scheduled to start at 9pm local time but an announcement was made shortly beforehand.“FC Barcelona is deeply saddened to announce the passing of first-team doctor Carles Miñarro Garcia this evening,” the club statement said. “For this reason, the match between FC Barcelona and CAOsasunahas been postponed to a later date. The FC Barcelona board of directors and all staff extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time.”The 50-year-old Miñarro Garcia joined the medical staff of Barcelona’s first team last season after previously working with their futsal team.Interwere given a real scare by bottom-placedMonzabefore coming back to earn a 3-2 win, where an own goal allowed the hosts to extend their lead at the top ofSerie A.Monza shocked the home crowd by taking a 2-0 lead in the first half, with Samuele Birindelli netting in the 32nd minute and Keita Baldé scoring with a stunning strike one minute before the break.The hosts pulled one back before half-time from Marko Arnautovic’s header, Hakan Calhanoglu levelled in the 64th minute and Monza’s Giorgos Kyriakopoulos put the ball into his own net 13 minutes from time.Inter move to 61 points, four ahead of Napoli who host Fiorentina on Sunday, while Monza remain rooted to the bottom of the table on 14 points, 10 from the last safe spot. After a 2-0 win away to Feyenoord in the Champions League last-16 first leg in midweek, Inter have one foot in the quarter-finals and they have a Coppa Italia semi-final againstMilanto look forward to in April, sparking treble talk.Calhanoglu told Sky: “We can’t underestimate teams, the opponents are good. In the end we dominated, we tried everything and we are happy with the victory. The coach’s mentality is right, we’ll try to win the treble. It’s a very long season, let’s take it step by step.”Milancame from two goals down to win 3-2 at lowlyLecce, with the midfielder Christian Pulisic levelling for the visitors from the penalty spot before scoring the winner late in the second half.Milan had two goals ruled out for offside inside 15 minutes, with Nikola Krstovic scoring for the hosts in between with a stunning shot from a distance for a 1-0 lead at half-time.The Montenegro striker doubled Lecce’s advantage before the hour mark but the home side then scored an own goal through defender Antonino Gallo before Pulisic pulled Milan level from the spot in the 73rd minute and scored the winner from close range shortly afterwards.Bayern Munichwasted a two-goal lead in front of a home crowd to slump to a 3-2 Bundesliga loss toBochum, but second-placedBayer Leverkusenwere unable to take advantage, going down 2-0 at home toWerder Bremen.Bayern, whobeat Leverkusen 3-0in their Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday, looked to be cruising to a comfortable win after Raphaël Guerreiro struck twice in 14 minutes to put them 2-0 up by the 28th minute. Bochum, however, cut the deficit three minutes later, with Jakov Medic drilling in.Things got worse for Bayern when João Palhinha was sent off two minutes before the break after a rough tackle andBochummade the extra man count when Ibrahima Sissoko headed in a 51st-minute equaliser. The visitors completed their stunning comeback in the 71st when Matus Bero slipped into the box and beat Jonas Urbig, in the Bayern goal in place of the injured Manuel Neuer.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha receives a red card during Bayern’s defeat.Photograph: Sven Hoppe/AP“No excuses. We lost and we can analyse as much as we want but we have to take responsibility for everything,” said the Bayern head coach, Vincent Kompany. “So far we always reacted really well [to defeats]. In these moments you have to accept that the criticism will be there but we will focus on the reaction.”Bayern are top on 61 points and remain eight points clear of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Werder, who had lost their previous five matches, took a surprise seventh-minute lead away to the defending champions, with Romano Schmid slotting in at the far post after a defensive error.Aleix García came agonisingly close to an equaliser for the hosts but his first-half stoppage-time free-kick bounced off the bar.To make matters worse for Xabi Alonso’s team, who host Bayern in the Champions League return leg on Tuesday, Florian Wirtz suffered an ankle injury in the 54th minute and the Germany attacking midfielder had to be substituted.Alonso said Wirtz had been taken to hospital for a scan and there was no information yet on the extent of his injury or if he would be fit for Tuesday’s game against Bayern. “It is too early to say,” Alonso said. “We have to see what the feeling is, what the result of the scan is and then we will have the information.”Despite some late pressure but only a handful of chances, Leverkusen could not find the equaliser and it was Werder who scored again, in stoppage time with Justin Njinmah.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballBundesligaBayer LeverkusenWerder BremenBayern MunichBochumLa LiganewsShareReuse this content"

At that stage, it looked as though Jan Paul van Hecke’s header that cancelled out Raúl Jiménez’s excellent strike would give Brighton and Fulham a share of the points.But a dramatic late penalty from João Pedro, after he was fouled by the substitute Harrison Reed, with seconds left to play gave Fabian Hürzeler’s side a sixth straight victory in all competitions to lift them up to sixth place – one point behind Manchester City in fourth – and leave Marco Silva fuming at his side’s inability to see out the draw. TheFulhammanager stood motionless at the final whistle but admitted they had played a major role in their own downfall.Brentford v Aston Villa: Premier League – liveRead more“It’s a difficult one to take but that’s the reality,” Silva said. “When the game was really quiet we were completely in control and we conceded a goal from a free-kick. We gave them a chance. And then it was not a good second half from us. It’s clearly our fault that we lost the game.”For Brighton, who face a trip to Manchester City next week, this was more evidence of how things have turned since their 7-0 thrashing by Nottingham Forest last month, even if Hürzeler is taking the owner Tony Bloom’s stance about whether they can maintain their run.“Tony always says there is no momentum so I copy his sentence and I also understand why,” he said. “In the Premier League every game is a new challenge so we have to be happy about the situation we have and then focus on the next challenge.”The sun may have been shining on the south coast but the tempo of this game throughout reflected the fact there was no chance of either side being on the beach just yet. Both booked their places in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last weekend and – even if they are now separated by four points – continue to harbour realistic ambitions of qualifying for Europe next season via the Premier League after this.There are also plenty of similarities between their managers, with Hürzeler and Silva having arrived in English football’s top flight in their 30s and known as two of the division’s more demonstrative characters on the touchline. The Fulham manager spent most of the first half on his feet as his side congested the midfield and managed to keep Brighton – who lacked cutting edge as Danny Welbeck watched on from the bench – at arm’s length.View image in fullscreenJan Paul van Hecke (far right) guides in Brighton’s equaliser with a header from a free-kick.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe plan seemed to be working effectively and the visitors took the lead when the impressive Alex Iwobi strode down the right flank in the 35th minute and delivered a brilliant cross to the back post for Jiménez. His chest control to take the ball past Van Hecke was superb and a half-volleyed finish with his left foot gave Bart Verbruggen no chance.To Hürzeler and the home supporters’ relief, the lead lasted around five minutes when Andreas Pereira fouled Carlos Baleba and Van Hecke got his revenge by heading home his first Premier League goal off the post from Yasin Ayari’s free-kick after escaping his marker Calvin Bassey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Welbeck and Solly March received detailed instructions from the Brighton manager before coming on for the final 15 minutes but the veteran striker’s header was badly off target when João Pedro picked him out inside the area.It felt like it wasn’t going to be their day when their fellow substitute Simon Adingra had the ball in the net soon after, only to be flagged offside. But the pivotal moment arrived when Reed attempted to clear the ball and tripped João Pedro inside the area to allow the Brazilian to stroke home his seventh Premier League goal of the season. “I’m not complaining, a clever striker felt contact and won the penalty,” said Silva. “We expect this type of striker to do his job. If it was my side I’d ask for a penalty.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverBrighton & Hove AlbionFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We certainly feel like we were a good value for a goal and we were really, really close on a couple of occasions to getting the first goal. It’s a sickening result, to come away from home and be as competitive as we were against a strong Crystal Palace side.”Thomas Tuchel paid another visit to the Eagles’ south London home, but it was a far less entertaining encounter than their 4-1 victory over Aston Villa on the England coach’s last trip.There was an early chance for Eddie Nketiah, who found himself through on goal and tried to outsmart Alex Palmer, who was alert to it and denied the former Arsenal striker a quickfire opener.Dean Henderson was called into action for the first time after an Ipswich counterattack, denying Jaden Philogene from near the penalty spot, while Liam Delap skied an effort.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr lifts the ball over Alex Palmer to score the only goal of the game.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersBut what had started entertainingly fell a bit flat by the break, neither side looking especially close to breaking the deadlock.The contest remained stop-start but on the hour Jack Clarke had a chance only to fire straight at Henderson after Eberechi Eze lost possession.Palace’s main threat was coming from Eze, who could not find the finishing touch on a few chances for the Eagles, while Sarr nodded just wide of the far post.Daniel Muñoz missed a huge chance to fire Palace into the lead with less than 15 minutes remaining after Leif Davis allowed the Palace defender to pounce.

Sarr marked his goal with a corner-flag kick – copying the signature celebration of Mateta, who is recovering from the ear laceration that required 25 stitches sustained during theirFA Cup fifth-round victory over Millwalllast Saturday.The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, said: “It was tough game and we expected a tough game because Ipswich are doing well.“What I’m really pleased with is that we stayed patient, waited for the next situation. We missed the first, we missed the second, we missed the third, we missed the fourth, but waited for the one and then we scored an amazing goal with Ismaïla. His celebration just shows the spirit in the group, the togetherness, the great characters we have.”Palace now travel to a warm-weather training camp in Marbella and a friendly with Norwegian side Hamarkameratene before returning to England, where they next face Fulham in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on 29 March.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverCrystal PalaceIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They will probably thrive on it.Gregor Townsend acknowledged that Scotland face the toughest assignment of all on Saturday night. “France scored 70 points against a very good Italian team,” he said. “They got 40 points against Wales, 40 points against Ireland. I think they could have 40 or 50 points against England with the amount of chances they had. Just now, probably this is the toughest fixture in world rugby. They beat the All Blacks in November. So we can’t wait to be involved in it. They’ll be going for the title, but it’s an opportunity for us to go out and play against one of the best teams right now.”Scotland produce performance of extremes but survive Wales fightbackRead moreA very different prospect, then, to what Scotland faced here. Once again, just as they had against England in round three – when they actually managed to lose the game – they ran rings around the opposition for most of the match but could not finish them off. In the end, they held on for a six-point win, but it might even have been a loss, but for an intervention by the television match official, when Taulupe Faletau thought he had scored with five minutes remaining. Alas, Blair Murray had jumped into a tackler earlier in the move, so the try was disallowed.“I think we thought straight away that you can’t jump to evade a tackle,” said Townsend. “Jamie Ritchie, who was captain at the time, was asking the referee to check it, but the TMO had already highlighted it. I thought it was an easy decision.”Wales’s coach, Matt Sherratt, agreed the offence had occurred, even if it must frustrate that it seemed so unnecessary. Had the try stood, Wales might even have earned the unlikeliest of wins. There was time for Max Llewellyn to score Wales’s fourth try at the death, with the conversion bringing them back within six points.“Obviously it was a really brave effort to come back and get two [bonus] points,” said Sherratt, “but I’ve seen enough of those games where the reality is, Scotland probably thought they’d done enough and maybe dropped off 5%.“But there was a hell of a lot of effort from our boys in that last 20 minutes. It was nice to get the bonus points, but more pleasing to me was seeing the desperation defending their line [in the final quarter]. It was almost like it was a one-score game. The amount of tackles some of our forwards were putting in in those sets was outstanding.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve spoken to many female athletes about it. And some of the stuff that the American shot putter Raven Saunders told me made me want to cry. We’ve got to do more.”Coe also promised he would deliver a blunt message to Zuckerberg, who is the chief executive of the Facebook and Instagram owner Meta, and Musk, who owns X, if he got the top job in global sports politics. “Come on, sort this out. Because this is just unacceptable. Sadly, it’s not new, but there’s just more of it. However, I think artificial intelligence actually can really help here in turbocharging some of this stuff out.”Coe also questioned whether sportswashing was a valid term in the modern world, given that every country uses sport to promote its own interests, and said he would be happy for Saudi Arabia to bid for the 2040 Olympics.“Let’s be open,” he said. “To a greater or lesser degree, everybody does that. You want to show the best of your country. They have 30-year strategies. And I think we sometimes overlook that. I first went to Qatar in the mid-90s, when they had a Junior World Cup in 1997.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe also said he would not have a problem with Saudi Arabia bidding for the 2040 Olympics.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/Reuters“And some of those countries have got a much more coherent policy towards sport – and using it to create better opportunities for movement and young people – than other countries that are sitting there saying: ‘Oh well, it’s sportswashing,’ while watching school sport disappear and sport slowly drift off government agenda. So we have got to be a little more even-handed.”Coe also insisted that he would be relaxed about Saudi Arabia hosting the Games in the autumn rather than summer, because it was inevitable that global warming would push future Olympics away from their traditional slot in July and August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it doesn’t work.”Coe pledged to work closely with Donald Trump before the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 if elected – and dismissed concerns that Trump’s behaviour might overshadow the Games. “I can’t believe that – like any other American president – he won’t want these Games to be a huge success,” he said. “And the Games are bigger than any individual. But it’s not a landscape that’s alien to me. The one thing about sport is you can have many more uncompromising conversations than jobbing ministers and politicians who don’t want to lose contracts going into countries.“And the LA Games were opened in ’84 by Ronald Reagan.

Galthié described the incident as “reprehensible”, and has highlighted the actions of Beirne and Calvin Nash, who received a 20-minute red card for a high tackle on Pierre-Louis Barassi, in his post-match report to the citing commissioner.France take Six Nations title race to the wire with thumping win over IrelandRead more“There is a suspicion of a quite serious knee injury to Antoine,” Galthié said. “He is suffering and we are suffering with him. I don’t want to go into details, mainly due to medical confidentiality.”Galthié refused to be drawn into public criticism of the referee, Angus Gardner, but explained that he was unhappy that “we had players who never came back on” while both Beirne and Nash were able to continue. “We are angry and we want an explanation; so, we have cited two players. We must protect our players.” It seems inevitable that both men will be unavailable for France’s final match, against Scotland.Dupont was furious as he left the field, and the French players asked Gardner why Beirne was not being punished. Gardner explained that he believed it was a genuine accident.Ireland’s head coach, Simon Easterby, defended Beirne. “I think it’s just a rugby incident where Tadhg cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit on the back of that. That can happen. Players have a real awareness now about cleaning out on the lower limb of a player, which could create that type of injury that happened today, but that wasn’t the case.“Tadhg was securing his own ball and unfortunately that happened. It was just one of those things, unfortunately.

Campbell had a huge chance within the first 90 seconds when Harrison Burrows’ low cross fell to Campbell at the far post but he somehow missed the target, albeit from a tight angle. Moments later, Ryan Porteous nearly turned Ben Brereton Díaz’s cross into his own net before Gustavo Hamer had a go from distance but his curling shot sailed harmlessly over the bar.Preston held on and had their best chance early in the second half when Robbie Brady set up Sam Greenwood, whose effort from range came crashing back off a post.Preston soon regretted that miss even more as United went up the other end and took the lead. Burrows whipped in a superb cross from the left and Campbell was there to head in.The victors moved level on points with Leeds, while Preston’s manager, Paul Heckingbottom, against his former club, saw his side’s winless run extend to five league games.Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Birmingham back on trackShowBirminghamgot their League One title push back on track with a 1-0 win overLincolnat St Andrew's. Kieran Dowell's penalty with 19 minutes left was enough for Blues, beaten at Bolton in midweek, who sit 11 points clear with a match in hand.Wycombegrabbed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 atPeterboroughand keep themselves in second place. Malik Mothersille's early penalty looked to have been enough for Posh, but Richard Kone struck in stoppage time for the Chairboys.Wrexhammoved level on 68 points with Wycombe after a 1-0 win overRotherham, with Sam Smith's goal early in the second half proving enough.Stockportare fourth after a goalless draw against fellow play-off hopefulsCharltonat Edgeley Park.Boltonwon 2-1 at strugglersBurtonto move into the top six.Huddersfielddropped out of the play-off places after a 1-0 defeat atBristol Rovers.At the other end of the table, relegation-battlersCrawleygrabbed a crucial point when a last-minute goal from substitute Panutche Camara secured a 1-1 draw againstReadingandExeterbeat bottom clubShrewsbury2-0.Blackpoolwon 3-0 atBarnsley, with Sonny Carey scoring twice in the second half.

Two of last season’s Premier League clubs were worlds apart at Turf Moor as a Mark McGuinness own goal and a Lyle Foster strike punished Kal Naismith’s red card in the first half.The Luton defender’s first offence was on Josh Laurent, who was hacked down as he led a counterattack 12 minutes in. Seven minutes later, Luton were down to 10 men as Naismith’s late challenge on Josh Brownhill led to the dismissal. The pressure on Luton’s backline soon cranked up and on the half-hour mark McGuinness put Connor Roberts’s cross into his own net.Foster then skipped in front of an opponent to prod Jaidon Anthony’s drilled pass in and Burnley enhanced their grip on the game after the break through Brownhill and Ashley Barnes. Burnley are two points behind Sheffield United and Leeds.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard celebrates Bobby Thomas’s winning goal for Coventry against Stoke.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesBobby Thomas scored a last-gasp winner to giveCoventrya thrilling 3-2 win overStoke. Victor Torp had scored a first-half double to put the home side ahead before the substitute Sam Gallagher netted two of his own to haul Stoke level. But Thomas sent the home fans into raptures in the seventh minute of added time when he thumped home to earn his side a ninth win in 10 league outings.The fixture also marked the return of the Stoke manager, Mark Robins, to the CBS Arena, after he was sacked by Coventry last November. Robins’s seven-year reign featured two promotions, aChampionshipplayoff final defeat by Luton on penalties and FA Cup semi-final heartbreak against Manchester United last season.

But Tesla, one of the world’s biggest corporate names, does not have a conventional chief executive.After Elon Muskbacked Alternative für Deutschland(AfD) – calling the party Germany’s “only hope” – voters are considering an alternative to Tesla. Data released on Thursday showed that registrations of the company’s electric cars in Germany fell 76% to 1,429 last month. Overall, electric vehicle registrations rose by 31%.Tesla’s biggest shareholder, who has voiced support for rightwing leaders around the world, is now a de facto US cabinet member under Donald Trump’s administration.Could Elon Musk’s newfound political influence help him finally crack India?Read moreTesla’s valuation has become inextricably tied to Musk’s politics. After he spent $288m backing Trump’s 2024 election victory, Tesla’svaluation passed $1tn. Yet Musk’s political involvements – unprecedented for the head of a company that size – could also be having a negative effect.On Friday, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists occupied aTeslastore in central Milan. Activists chained themselves to the cars’ tyres, and others glued themselves to the windows along with the slogans “Make millionaires pay again” and “Ecology for all, no ecofascism”.Analysts are openly wondering if Musk is causing lasting damage to a brand he has made synonymous with electric cars and, by extension, liberal aspirations to tackle climate change.Tesla was approached for comment.Tesla was the world’s biggest producer of battery electric cars in 2024, but sales dropped to 1.79m, the first time the company has endured a sales decline since 2011 after years of rapid growth that made it the world’s most valuable carmaker.The manufacturer said in January that global sales would grow during 2025, and Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 2m cars this year. But even those forecasts would hardly represent a blazing return to form. As recently as October, Musk said he expected 20% to 30% annual sales growth, implying as many as 2.3m cars sold.“Customer retention will be key in 2025 as customers may begin to look for an ‘Alternative for Tesla’,” said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst.View image in fullscreenSome analysts fear for Tesla’s future, others are more optimistic and the dent in sales limited to 5%.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/ReutersOther analysts are more optimistic. Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, a US financial firm, is a longstanding Tesla supporter. Ives believes the company’s share price could rise from its current level of about $280 to hit $550. However, he acknowledged the negative perception created by Musk’s partnership with Trump and his work on the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) – an issue he described as the “elephant in the room” for the brand.Calling them “major brand worries for Tesla”, he added in a note to investors that the direct impact on sales should be relatively small. “We estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues despite the global draconian narrative for Musk.”Ives said that Tesla was on the verge of making a new, cheaper vehicle – costing less than $35,000 – andwould “own” the autonomous vehicle market, factors that would help push Tesla to a valuation of more than $2tn..Nonetheless there are clear signs in the US, Tesla’s biggest market, that would-be buyers are wavering, according to Strategic Vision, a market research company. Its new vehicle experience study tracks the buying preferences of up to 250,000 car buyers in the US, and it shows a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Muskbought Twitter(now X) in 2022.Shortly before the multibillionaire bought the social media platform, 22% of new vehicle buyers would have “definitely” considered buying a Tesla. By the end of 2024 it was just under 8%. The proportion who would not consider buying a Tesla has risen from 39% over the same period to 63%.According to Strategic Vision, approximately half of non-Tesla EV buyers identify as Democrat or liberal, compared with about 20% identifying as Republican or conservative. Among Tesla owners, the Democrat owner group has fallen from 40% during the Biden administration to 29% now, with the Republican group averaging about 30% since 2021.“Democrats, the majority party of EV owners, are now actively rejecting Tesla and choosing other options,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision.Meanwhile, global protests against Musk and Tesla are intensifying. In America, there have been demonstrations outside dozens of Tesla showrooms, while in the UK a guerrilla poster campaign – “0 to 1939 in 3 seconds” – has emphasised Musk’sfascist-style salute at an inauguration rally. In Germany, he was recently caricatured on a carnival float as “Napo-Elon”.Ross Gerber, chief executive of the US investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which holds shares in Tesla, said Musk had given people an outlet to express their disdain for his politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s ironic because the vehicles were made for liberals who care about the environment and it has become a symbol of the conservative movement.”Tesla is valued at about $847bn – still more than the next 10 carmakers combined. Few investment banks have included any effect from Musk in their work trying to accurately value Tesla. Still, there are further reports of falling sales. In Australia,February sales were down about 72%compared with the same month in 2024, according to data released this week.View image in fullscreenIn Australia, Tesla sales were down 72% in February compared with the same month in 2024.Photograph: Jason Reed/ReutersSeveral analysts have raised concerns that the current valuation is much too high. JP Morgan is among the most pessimistic of the investment banks, suggesting that Tesla’s share price could fall as low as $135 – or a valuation closer to $400bn. Musk is the largest shareholder in Tesla, a key contributor to his status as the world’s wealthiest person.“Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals,” wrote JP Morgan in January, pointing out that 2025 profit expectations were down 70% since 2022. The share price has more than doubled since then – something that would not usually happen when investors expect lower profits.Analysts at UBS, a Swiss investment bank, concur, saying that Tesla’s valuation “continues to confound us”, with big risks in its efforts to make money from self-driving cars or humanoid robots.While sales declined steeply in January in several markets, several analysts have warned against relying on numbers for a single month. Schmidt said: “Some consumers are likely holding back purchase decisions and waiting for the updated Model Y which arrives this month. The big question though is, are these just the die-hard Tesla enthusiasts which remain in line while other potential consumers jump ship?”There have also been positive signs elsewhere. UK Tesla sales fell in January, butbounced back by a fifthin February to leave sales up year-on-year for 2025 so far. In the US there were also signs of a recovery after a fall in January, with preliminary data for February indicating rebound sales of about 42,000 cars, up 14% year-on-year, according to Wards Intelligence.But the UK sales figures also highlight another concern for investors: that Tesla’s lead on rivals could be narrowingas a flood of new models arrive. Tesla’s electric market share for the first two months of 2025 was 11%, down from 14% in 2024, according to New Automotive, a research group.Ben Nelmes, New Automotive’s chief executive, said: “The impact of Elon Musk’s political views on Tesla’s sales may have been overstated, but Tesla is gradually losing its position as the dominant EV seller in the UK as other carmakers bring more up-to-date and cheaper models to market.”In China Tesla is under big pressure from a slew of cheaper competitors, most notably BYD. In Tesla’s second-biggest market, sales of its China-made EVs dropped 49% year-on-year in February, to the lowest level since August 2022.Edward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous – a 2019 book about Tesla which focuses on Musk’s habit of making bold claims about the business that don’t stack up – argues that the prospect for new business like robotaxis and robots are distant. “The unique moment that we’re in now is the business has peaked,” he said.The worry for Tesla investors is whether Musk has turned that peak into a cliff-edge.Additional reporting Lorenzo TondoExplore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industryDonald TrumpUS politicsGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Correctional officers escorted her to the common area of the CentralCaliforniaWomen’s Facility and chained her hands and feet to a metal table, on top of which sat avirtual realityheadset. Two and a half years into a five-year prison sentence, Royal was about to see Thailand for the first time.When she first put on the headset, Royal immediately had an aerial view of a cove. Soon after, her view switched to a boat moving fairly fast with buildings on either side of the water. In the boat was a man with a backpack, and it was as if she were sitting beside him. With accompanying meditative music and narration, the four-minute scene took Royal across a crowded Thai market, through ancient ruins, on a tuk-tuk (a three-wheeled rickshaw) and into an elephant bath with her backpacked companion. For Royal, these vignettes felt real enough to be deserving of a passport stamp.View image in fullscreenCreative Acts volunteers giving a virtual reality headset to a person.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsBefore Thailand, Royal had been held in the facility’s “restricted housing unit”, orsolitary confinement. There, the only opportunity incarcerated people typically have to speak with each other is through cell vents or across the yard during recreation. Typically for this program, participants in solitary sit inside individual cells the size of phone booths known as “therapeutic modules”. In Royal’s facility, she and fellow participants were separated by plastic dividers, and each participant was shackled to a metal seat attached to a table.The VR stirs up the triggers and the trauma and the emotions – and then the art transformsSabra Williams, Creative Acts founderIn the seven-day intensive VR program, participants experience scenes from daily life, as well as some more adventurous ones such as traveling to Paris or paragliding, for four hours each day. Facilitators ask them to process emotions that come from these scenes through various art exercises involving theater tactics, poetry, painting, etc.“The VR stirs up the triggers and the trauma and the emotions – and then the art transforms,” Sabra Williams, the founder of Creative Acts, the organization behind the program, shares. The non-profit conducts the program both in general population and in solitary.Now released, Carlos Ortega went through the virtual reality program in March of last year while in solitary confinement at Corcoran state prison. At 6ft tall, he remembers needing to sit down on the provided stool within the solitary cage to immerse himself in the VR scenes, even though the headset’s 360-degree view was programmed to work within the cage’s confines.“If you’re not mindful of your body in prison, that can lead to conflict. We’re always aware of the amount of space we have, so I didn’t fidget a lot,” he shares. Ortega rarely bumped into the walls, carefully moving his torso and neck in order to take in his surroundings. “It was difficult, but we worked with what we got.”Freedom within – and from – a controlled environment“The micro environment is really, really controlled,” Ortega goes on to explain. Even when he would try to initiate interaction with prison guards, he would get shut down. “I would always say, ‘Hey, good morning. How was your drive here? How are you doing?’ I’d mostly get a glare or a look like ‘Why do you care?’ It’s kind of humiliating.”View image in fullscreenAn incarcerated person uses a VR headset.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of  Creative ActsCreative Actsseeks to work against this hardened environment. The California-based organization relies on the arts as a resource for behavioral change and practical preparation for coming home from prison. With VR in four institutions – Valley state prison (VSP), Kern Valley state prison, Corcoran state prison and the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF) – the organization has more requests coming in from other California facilities. Plans to expand beyond the state, however, can not be fulfilled due to lack of funding, according to Williams.Williams first had the idea to bring VR into prisons five years ago. After founding Creative Acts in 2018, she said she “got real tired of hearing people come home after life sentences, having done multiple decades inside, and literally landing on a different planet”. She felt there was an urgent need for her organization to visually puncture the concrete barriers separating incarcerated people from the outside world. “As the world was changing out here, we missed it,” said Star Van Pool, Creative Acts’ program facilitator, who was incarcerated for 17 years.So when Williams heard about a rudimentary VR program led by correctional officers in another state, she began to workshop how her organization could safely and humanely adapt this work. “I was looking for something that would bring the outside world inside. I heard that VR works on your brain as if you’ve had the experience,” Williams said. “It seemed like an ideal tool.”Breathing through the overwhelming emotions of the everydayIt took a year for Creative Acts to persuade Meta to donate 20 headsets and two of itsCleanboxheadset sanitation machines for a VR pilot. Meanwhile, Creative Acts’Alumni Labworked with content makers includingUnincarcerated Productionsto produce scenes reflecting the collective fears and curiosities that arise when preparing to come home from prison, such as exiting the facility on release day, conducting a job interview or going on a date.For Major Bunton, Creative Acts’ director of programming, the big fear was paying for groceries. “If I’m sitting in line, swiping my credit card, and I can’t get it done, the first thing that comes to my mind is ‘Oh my God, someone’s going to know I’ve been incarcerated,’” he said.To film a Thanksgiving dinner scene, Williams made an entire meal – “I cooked a terrible turkey,” she quipped – and brought in actors to demonstrate various conflicts that could come up when interacting with a loved one who has just come home from prison. When a person puts on the VR headset to experience this scene, it is as if they are at the table. “When I came home, I had to realize that my family had changed. I had to learn how to adapt to their lives,” Bunton shares. “And conversely, they saw me as the person I was when I went in 20 years ago.” Williams’ goal is for participants to get a handle on the rollercoaster of emotions that comes after long-term separation through these family-conflict scenes.View image in fullscreenVolunteers assist people with their VR headsets.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsWilliams says that the programming is not about therapizing or diagnosing anyone; it’s about providing them with the tools to feel and be aware of their own emotions in an otherwise repressive environment. Daniel Garcia, a participant incarcerated at Valley state prison in rural central California, got upset experiencing a scene in which a person bumped into him on a crowded street inLos Angeles. Following a breathing exercise while still in VR, Garcia said he was able to calmly consider how he might better resolve this type of conflict. “A lot of us, when we do come to prison, we’re not aware of the triggers from traumatic experiences that we’ve had, so we just react. VR helped us recognize those triggers.” Introducing this level of emotional awareness supports participants in coping and responding differently because, as Van Pool shares, “if a person doesn’t even understand why they’re angry or where it came from, they can’t change their behavior”.The transformative scene for Ortega was sitting around the Eiffel Tower. “You see tourists, regular people going to and from work,” he said. “And that’s when it hit me: I want to live life like that. I deserve it. I owe it to myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the outside o the mask they’re asked to portray how they believe society perceives them; on its inside, how they see themselves. On his mask, Garcia wrote “condemned” with cracks on the outside, to reflect his sentence of life without parole. “But I want to be bigger than that,” he said, “so on the inside I painted a sunset, full of life, so bright.”Working through ‘a lot of pain’ in virtual realityReflecting on her experience in VR six months ago, Royal shares that she initially “saw a lot of pain” when the group started. “But by the end, I saw smiles on the faces of all these women and the ability to trust somebody again,” she said. Released from solitary confinement within two months after donning the headset, Royal still conducts unified breathwork she learned from the program with people in the prison if she senses conflict.View image in fullscreenSome incarcerated people have reported transformative experiences when using the VR devices.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of  Creative ActsGarcia similarly retains his meditation practice, oftentimes putting in earbuds to quiet his surroundings, slowly counting while envisioning a sunset. Matias Magana, another program participant at Valley State, shares that now he says hello to individuals he never would have spoken to had it not been for his Creative Acts group. For him, “we’re breaking cultural boundaries”. And Ortega, who spoke sporadically on a Tuesday when he had gone to Creative Acts’ office to pick up some of his old art, says that he now finds himself “being comfortable in the uncomfortable”. His birthday was the second to last day of his Creative Acts’ experience; he still has the sticky notes the facilitators put on his “therapeutic module” with birthday wishes from everyone.Closing a solitary unit after virtual reality workshopsIn response to Creative Acts programming, facilities are witnessing an immense change. “Prison is toxic. You become accustomed to it: the corruption, the duplicitousness. Hell is normalized,” Ortega said. But prisons that have piloted the VR program report a 96% reduction in infractions from incarcerated participants in solitary confinement, according to Creative Acts. Corcoran state prison in rural centralCaliforniasaw the number of infractions of the men in solitary go from 735 to one after one week-long session. One of Corcoran wardens commuted so many solitary confinement sentences that the facility closed one of its four buildings dedicated to the practice.The organization attributes this level of transformation to the role that art plays in encouraging people to redirect their anger, share and process their trauma, and envision, quite literally with the help of VR, a world beyond the bars that confine them.Pros and cons of tech in prisonsIntroducing new technology into prisons has inspired skepticism as well as praise. Making available tablets with texting, email and books en masse in prisons has also made way for anotherpredatory profit channelfor companies, increased the ability to further surveil incarcerated people, and createdfalse promises of more connectionoreducation. Many argue that tech is just a bandage solution that only serves to maintain an inhumane carceral system. Others say that working with the same prisons that continue to incarcerate people in droves cannot possibly benefit those inside. Williams has grappled with these critiques.I learned that, even if someone has nothing in common with me, I can find a way to connect with themSamantha ‘Royal’ Tovar“Anything can be used to cause harm, [and] people will always make money off of anything that goes into prisons, so the benefits for the people inside, to me, outweigh the issues,” Williams says when discussing the introduction of tablets and other technology inside prisons. For the Creative Acts’ founder, the key to administering VR is by utilizing team members who have endured incarceration themselves to thoughtfully facilitate the experience as well as providing trauma-informed art exercises paired with every scene. As for criticisms about working with the California department of corrections and rehabilitation rather than against it, Williams has a consistent motto: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to make change? You can’t make deep cultural change without including the people that work there.”View image in fullscreenCritiques of the VR program have included that it helps maintain an inhumane carceral system.Photograph: Sam Richardson/Courtesy of Creative ActsStill, the non-profit must go the financial and physical lengths of bringing VR inside prisons while many of the scenes that participants interact with in their headsets are just on the other side of their cell walls. However, participants said the small doses of virtual freedom and exposure to the outside world shifted their behaviors and perceptions more than solitary confinement ever did.“I learned that, even if someone has nothing in common with me, I can find a way to connect with them,” Royal shares. She will parole from prison in May and feels more confident in her ability to build a community for herself. For Ortega, Creative Acts laid an emotional foundation that informs the work he’s doing upon release. “I feel content, I’m more tolerant, people call me reliable again. I go to AA and NA meetings, I’m in school. I actually started my own program. It’s called Dream Catchers. I’m trying to catch that dream that I didn’t catch before.”Explore more on these topicsVirtual realityUS prisonsCaliforniaSolitary confinementWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have said it multiple times: I think it is horrifying what is happening,” saysMartha Lane Fox.For the British peer and ex-Twitter board member, the sight of Musk holding forth from the bully pulpit of Donald Trump’s White House shows theSilicon Valleydream has gone sour.“The richest man in the world, who can stand there alongside the president, and kind ofcarte blanchemake jokes about how he’s carving up people’s jobs in the government. Then he can be there with achainsaw laughing on stage…“It is really, really alarming, and I find it extremely unpleasant at a values-based level – but also, just how can we be watching this in plain sight? It makes me feel very anxious. I think it is gross.”In an interview with theObserverto mark International Women’s Day, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned the diversity pushback orchestrated by Trump and his tech bro acolytes will not only damage society, but also the economy at large.What Musk is doing is really alarming. How can we all be watching this in plain sight? I think it is grossSince his return to the White House, the US president hasshut down all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,while Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is ripping up funding schemes.Some of the world’s biggest companies are following suit. Amid a wider pushback against everything from environmental targets to sustainable development, among themost prominenttaking part are US finance and tech companies, including Goldman Sachs, Accenture and Amazon, whileUK businesses such as GSK have also fallen in line.“He needs to be contained,” Lady Lane Fox says of Musk’s role in the rollback. “I find it extraordinary that the richest man in the world is trampling all over these things and that we still have kind of fanboying from the tech sector. It’s already been corrosive for society, and I would argue it is going to continue to be.”For businesses, she says the bottom line is that companies that take diversity seriously appeal to the widest possible employee talent pool and are better placed to target a broad range of customers. This, she adds, is about profit as much as social justice. However, she has a broader concern about the future.“The first thing, it’s financial. But the second thing, it’s about power and money – like everything, right?“If you’re looking at a sector like the digital sector, where there’s the growth in jobs, growth in opportunity – it is the growth sector in the economy. Yet you are not including a whole bunch of people in that. Then you are going to be creating inequality. Full stop. So it’s financial and it’s a question of social justice.”Given the close ties between Britain and the US, there is a view that where corporate America treads, the UK naturally follows. But there are signs that some UK businesses – and even the British operations of some US companies – are prepared to stand apart.The accountancy firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government toremove pronouns from their emails, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme. But its UK boss told staff its British operations remained “committed to [its] diversity goals”.“It feels as though global companies rooted in the US are making a politically motivated slight shift in emphasis and tilt, through to rowing back everything. And it does feel a bit more tempered here,” says Lane Fox.UK businesses have an opportunity to do something different, she says, which could bring financial benefits. “I think we’ll build more robust companies, attract talent and have a much better shot at building the most resilient companies of the future.”For almost three decades, Lane Fox has built a career – and multimillion-pound fortune – in tech. She made her first big moneyfloating Lastminute.com, the online travel site co-founded alongside fellow Oxford graduate Brent Hoberman in 1998.View image in fullscreenElon Musk holds court with his son X in the White House’s Oval Office in February.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockShejoined the board of Twitter– now X – in 2016, landing herself a huge payday in Musk’s$44bn hostile takeoverin 2022, before he dissolved the board and appointed himself the sole director.Seeing Musk in the Oval Office,parading his son X on his shoulders, made her question the gender divide. “Can you imagine if that was a woman? Can you imagine what that would look like? I mean, I just think the whole thing is really gross.”Trump signs executive order expanding power of Elon Musk’s Doge agencyRead moreBut while railing against Musk in a personal capacity, the BCC president does not suggest this approach is for everyone. “It is really tricky to navigate. You have a responsibility to your customers and your employees that might be different to our personal view sometimes.”Government regulation to enshrine diversity targets is also a bad idea, she says, preferring instead that companies report their progress. “Keeping it in the light, keeping up the reporting, is important – keeping up good investors, looking at the right metrics and investing in the right companies all helps.”However, not enough progress is being made. Analysis this week showed that worsening unemployment and workforce participation for women haspushed the UK behind Canadato its lowest global ranking for workplace equality among large economies in a decade.The gender pay gap has been declining slowly over time, butaverage pay is still 7% lessfor women than for men. It is a challenge Lane Fox is all too aware of. “Look at the data and it is really freaking depressing – and it is not moving,” she says.“What worries me is that it’s far too easy to find numbers that I thought we were moving on from.“In this week of International Women’s Day, we see representation at the executive level has gone back. I see progress on boards is still good at the FTSE 100 level, but bad at FTSE 250 and 350 level.“I know there will be people in the sector thinking: ‘Oh, here she goes again.’ That’s true of many women [that people think that].

But it revolutionised human connectionJohn NaughtonThe company that pioneered voice communication over the internet has withered to dust in Microsoft’s hands. Still, I for one am grateful for itSat 8 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 16.47 ESTShareSo Microsofthas decidedto terminate Skype, the internet telephony company it bought in 2011 for $8.5bn (£6.6bn). Its millions of hapless users are to be herded into Microsoft Teams, a virtual encampment with a brain-dead aesthetic that makes even Zoom look cool. This eventuality had been telegraphed for quite a while but, even so, it comes as a jolt because Skype was a remarkable venture, and its demise closes a chapter of an interesting strand of technological history.The internet has been around for much longer than most people realise. It goes back to the 1960s and the creation of Arpanet, a military computer network that emerged after the US had its “Sputnik moment” – the awful realisation that the Soviet Union seemed to be racing ahead in the technology stakes. The design of Arpanet’s successor, the internet we use today, started in the early 1970s and it was first switched on in January 1983.The designers of the network were, from the outset, determined to avoid the limitations of earlier communication systems, particularly the analogue telephone network, which was optimised for voice, hopeless for digital signals and owned by corporations which resisted innovations that they themselves had not originated. So the new network would not have an owner or be optimised for any particular medium, and would therefore be more permissive than any earlier network. Anyone could access it, and create services that ran upon it, so long as their computers conformed to the protocols of the network.The result was the explosion of creativity – good and bad – that we are still living with today. What the internet’s designers had built was what a scholar later called “an architecture for permissionless innovation”; or, put another way,a globalplatform for springing surprises.The world wide web, created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, was one of those surprises. But so too was something called VoIP (voice over internet protocol). Speech could be digitised (converted into ones and zeroes) and put into data packets which could be sent over the internet; and then, having reached their destination, converted back into audio. The result: free telephony to anywhere in the world!Skype was the first company to bring this magic to ordinary consumers. It was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis (a Dane) and Niklas Zennström (a Swede) and headquartered in Luxembourg; but the software that powered it was written by three Estonians who also wrote software for peer-to-peer file sharing. In 2005, eBay bought it for $2.6bn (£2bn). By 2006 it had 100m registered users and by 2009 was adding about 380,000 new users each day and generating around $740m (£575m) in annual revenue. So you could say thatSkypewas the first European company to reach US-level scale.I grew up in a time when a phone call from the US meant only one thing: a death in the family. If emigrants kept in touch with the folks back home, it was only by letterAt which point the inevitable happened: in 2011 Skype was bought byMicrosoftand absorbed into the maw of the tech colossus. Many observers, including this columnist, wondered what Microsoft thought it was doing with its new toy. Last week’s news suggests that the company never quite figured it out. And in any event, once the pandemic arrived in 2020 and people started working from home, it was clear that Microsoft would need to have something to ward off the threat posed by Zoom. Skype conceivably could have been at the core of its response, but instead the decision was made to put all the energy into making Teams the behemoth’s answer to remote working. From then on, Skype was surplus to requirements and the die was cast.Before it disappears, though, it’s worth remembering what an energising newcomer it was on the scene two decades ago. Most people nowadays have no idea how closed and depressing telephony was in the analogue era. It was an industry run either by complacent, unresponsive and domineering monopolies (AT&T in the US) or government agencies (the GPO in the UK). It could take months to get a telephone installed in your home. Phone calls were expensive and international calls positively prohibitive.I grew up in a country (Ireland) with a huge diaspora in a time when a phone call from the US meant only one thing: a death in the family. If emigrants kept in touch with the folks back home, it was only by letter and perhaps the odd parcel; never by phone. In rural Ireland, on the night before a son or a daughter departed for America or Australia, their family would sometimes hold a wake, because they assumed they would never hear their voices again.And now? The VoIP technology that Skype brought into people’s lives has been commoditised. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal offer unlimited – and free – audio (and video) connections with friends, families and colleagues all over the world. Phone calls that would once have bankrupted a family are made every day. Microsoft may not have found Skype useful in the end. But the rest of us certainly did.What I’ve been readingThree-market economyDave Karpf’ssharp essayidentifies the three types of money behind Silicon Valley’s power.Bringing back sovereigntyAninsightful editorialinNoemaby Nathan Gardels on why the current and 47th US president is behaving like the 25th.Fighting talkA seismic regulatory clash is in the offing, says David Allen Green’sprescient analysisin theFinancial Times.Explore more on these topicsSkypeThe networkerMicrosoftInternetZoomTelecomsComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

During the Sag-Aftra film and television actors’ strike in Hollywood, jobs were few and far between. “I sent a few one-sentence ideas to a new social media production company for short-form digital shows,” she says. “Boy Room was one of my pitches: Boy, will you show me your room?”A proof-of-concept was shot at a friend’shouse. “He told me a girl had been over the previous night, refusing to stay because of the mess, then asked what he should do to change his room.” On camera, Coster surveyed the scene. “Throw out the garbage, put your clothes in a dresser, and put sheets on your bed. He nodded along, gratefully.”At first, she didn’t tell participants that her focus was untidy rooms. “But turns out these boys don’t feel shame about their messiness,” she says. “It made no difference if we told them. Some boys, it transpires, are proud of their mess. Others do start to reflect on their choices in an outsider’s presence: you’re right, whydoI have a 30-month-old boiled egg on my bedside table?”There are plenty of messy-home TV formats, but Coster’s tone is different: non‑judgmental. She has shot at least 40 episodes now, and themes are emerging. “A lot of boys have no idea what’s in their room: a housemate left that; an ex-girlfriend this. Lots of garbage. They often lack ownership of their space. And there’s a lack of concern for their cleanliness and comfort. Like,whydo you want to sleep on a yellowing pillow, a stained, broken mattress and a disgusting quilt? It’s so easily fixable.”The intimacy of the format is what makes it endearing. “In the same way we like to watch Architectural Digest on YouTube to see how the rich and famous live, it’s also nice to see how normals do.” It’s this, she believes, alongside some of the muckier moments captured (“Think extremely yeasty smells or baked-in cigarette stench – one boy had maybe 7,000 vapes in a drawer and behind his bed”) that keep viewers coming back. “Nothing gets more comments,” she says, “than a handsome boy living in total squalor.”‘How did you two meet?’Jeremy Bernstein, Aaron Feinberg and Victor Lee (below, from left),@meetcutesnycTikTok followers:1.8 millionInstagram followers:2.9 millionView image in fullscreen‘Early on, we were only looking for the best meet-cute stories.’Photograph: Chris Buck/The GuardianTwo years ago, friends Aaron Feinberg, Jeremy Bernstein and Victor Lee weren’t even onTikTok. Now, it’s an occupation for the three 30-year-old New Yorkers. Feinberg handles partnerships and collaborations; Lee oversees editing and posting; Bernstein is the voice, politely accosting random couples on the street, and probing into their relationships.It was Lee’s baby, initially. He was working in his family clothes manufacturing business. “The first question you ask a couple,” he says, “is where did you guys meet? Maybe it could be something … ” He floated the idea of asking strangers on camera past Feinberg.“I thought it was fun,” says Feinberg. “We didn’t realise what it could become, but I knew we had the perfect person to ask the questions in Jeremy, who wouldn’t be afraid to stop people – and he won the most distinguished voice award at high school.”Bernstein wasn’t interested at first. “I was selling renewable energy on the street, so, yes, I was always approaching strangers. But when Aaron suggested we do this, I took quite a lot of convincing.” However, interviewees were receptive to the concept from the get‑go, says Bernstein, “although we had to learn about the physicality. How to approach someone in a non-threatening way is key,” he says. “Firstly, it’s body language – making yourself small and smiley. Then, get to the ‘Are you two a couple? How did you meet?’ questions immediately. Once people hear that, they relax.”They have heard some remarkable stories: high‑school sweethearts, chance encounters, arranged marriages. “My favourite,” says Lee, “is the onewe titled Tunnel Vision.” In it an older gentleman who was a train supervisor at Grand Central station explains how he met his wife, 30 years ago. For days, he kept moving trains on to the platform he worked nearest to, to try to find a beautiful woman he had noticed getting out of a carriage. She grins, standing next to him, as he tells the story, and says: “I had no idea!”It’s no wonder people love it. The group have started working on a book, and begun franchising. “We’ve just opened aMeetCutes London account,” says Feinberg – a British friend goes out to record, “and we’re interviewing to hire people in Paris and Madrid. We’re off camera, so we can recreate it globally.”To date, the lads have interviewed maybe 7,000 couples, but only post a small fraction. “Early on, we were only looking for the best meet-cute stories,” says Bernstein. “Now we’re also asking about the relationship: what’s your favourite thing about your partner? What advice do you have for a new couple?”They have each used these lessons in their own love lives. “My favourite piece of advice, which I’ve taken into my relationship, is ‘Never stop dating’,” says Lee. “I’ve been with my fiancee for six years. It’s so easy to fall into a routine and be lazy.”“As someone looking for a relationship while asking all these couples questions,” says Bernstein, “my main takeaway is that there’s no one way to do it. People have such different types of romantic relationships.”‘What’s your dream?’Simon Squibb,@simonsquibbTikTok followers:6.1 millionInstagram followers:3 millionView image in fullscreen‘I wanted to make my son proud – not just sit around and play golf.’Photograph: Simon SquibbFor Simon Squibb, 49, perfecting the question was key. “A dream is both something we’re never really asked, but also feels safe to admit,” he says. “Much bigger than an objective that’s fleeting, or a resolution that comes and goes. Ask someone their dream, and you get to the heart of what they want from life.”This is exactly what he does when approaching strangers on the street. “I’m an entrepreneur, and investor in startups,” he says. “I offer free business knowledge, support people’s dreams, and promote them on my channel.” In essence, he’s an iPhone-wielding, street-scouring, one-man Dragons’ Den.Squibb, who lives in Sussex, started his first business aged 15. “I had no choice, having been made homeless when I fell out with my mum.” His dad had recently died. “I couldn’t get a job, so I started my own gardening company. I asked someone who knew I was struggling for help. They were selling courses, and offered to support me – for a fee. I couldn’t afford to pay. I vowed one day, if I could afford to help people for free, I would.”In2015, Squibb sold his business – a Hong Kong-based creative and digital agency – to PricewaterhouseCoopers. “I made life-changing money. I wouldn’t need to work again. I took two years off. My wife and I had a baby. But I wanted to make my son proud, I realised – not just sit around and play golf.”He thought back to his hustling teenage self. “I knew so little about business. School hadn’t equipped me for it at all. I wanted to help educate others, and TikTok is where young people were.”No doubt his advice is gratefully received. He has also invested in 79 businesses to date. Most significant, though, is the exposure a chance encounter with Squibb and his camera brings: millions of followers; 315m monthly views. “Lots of people still think you shouldn’t film kind gestures,” says Squibb, “that I should offer my advice privately, else it’s tainted. That’s stupid; part of the help I can offer is eyeballs. Why not use social media for social good?“Not long ago, someone’s reply to me was, ‘I want to travel and take pictures’.” Squibb had a think. “How do we get there? Not, I said, saving money and planning. Let’s get you a sponsor. That video clocked 112m views.lastminute.comoffered to sponsor her – now she’s travelling the world, filling their social media feeds.” There was a woman in Lewes, getting off the bus. “She said her dream was to be a fashion blogger and designer. Twenty-four hours later, she had 300,000+ followers. Done. The rest is up to her.“My whole life is built around this concept: whatever I want to achieve, put a business model behind it. Teach people the basics, and any dream is possible.”Simon Squibb’s bookWhat’s Your Dream?, published by Century, is out now‘What do you do for your workout?’Mark Langowski,@bodybymarkTikTok followers:527,200Instagram followers:1.5 millionView image in fullscreen‘Of course fitness trainers have the perfect workout. But what about real people?’Photograph: Chris Buck/The GuardianThe approach, for Mark Langowski, 44, who lives in New York, still feels a little icky. His street-interview format relies on the camera rolling before the first question is asked – initially filming someone without their consent. “I try to get them walking towards me,” he says, “so I’m looking two blocks ahead. Then I have a split second to scan them and decide if they look fit. I don’t love that.” After making a judgment on their physique, he’ll ask: “What do you do for your workout?” The shtick is simple, but the results are compelling: revealing the dedication of the majorly muscled, uber‑athletic and, often, shirtless.The scale of the challenge varies seasonally. “In summer and springtime New York, it’s obviously easier to spot someone fit: tank tops, vests and workout gear; lots of skin on show,” he says. “Winter and fall are harder. It’s why I travel to Miami or Los Angeles at that time of year.”He has been in the fitness business for 20 years, and started TikTok‑ing 18 months ago. “I’m a personal trainer by trade. I already had theInstagramaccount of a traditional fitness influencer: me and my clients working out; showing my abs off,” he says. “I got bored with it. Sick of the narcissism. I knew I needed a presence for my business, to keep myself relevant. But how to without making it all about me?”Then, inspiration. “I was in an exercise class, and saw this woman in the most spectacular shape. I wondered what she was doing? It couldn’t just be this class.” He went out the next day to film on the streets of New York. “I’m an introvert; I’d never approach a stranger. I was so self-conscious and nervous, holding the camera down by my waist.” After a few weeks, people started to know about the videos. “It made things easier – if someone was into fitness, the algorithm was probably already showing them my stuff. And people were keen to talk. Now, my videos have been seen more than 1bn times.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s tedious –of coursethey have the perfect breakfast, perfect workout, perfect everything. It’s their day job. But what about real people? I’m asking the construction worker, the stay-at-home mum of three, the doctor or shop assistant.”Langowski has learned plenty himself. “You start to see patterns: lift heavy weights, don’t run too much, eat healthy, sleep a lot and don’t drink much alcohol. I’m surprised at how little cardio very fit-looking people do.”‘How much do you pay for rent?’Caleb Simpson,@calebwsimpsonTikTok followers:8.5 millionInstagram followers:2.5 millionView image in fullscreen‘At first, 100 New Yorkers told me to eff off. Then one guy in Brooklyn showed me his apartment. It went viral.’Photograph: Chris Buck/The Guardian“Everyone is low-key a snoop, when it comes to homes,” says Caleb Simpson, 33. “We all want to poke around places.”Simpson grew up in Morganton, North Carolina, “in a small house with eight siblings, very humble beginnings – a food-stamps-and-white-rice sort of life”. He moved to New York in 2015, and soon started to make a living doing social media for startups. “I was also always trying to do my own thing,” he says, “making videos on YouTube and Instagram.”Simpson had spent years wandering the streets of New York, looking up at buildings, imagining what was within. “I had this lightbulb moment: just ask to look inside. Now most people know me as the ‘apartment tour guy’ – the dude who asks the questions: how much do you pay for rent? Can I see?” He has done about 300 apartment tours in New York. “Globally, it’s more like 500 now: Paris, London, Hong Kong. All major US cities.“It began with being shown a bunch of middle fingers on the streets of Manhattan,” he says. “New Yorkers are straight up – they told me to eff off.” How many times? “Maybe 100. It was deflating.” Then, a yes. “A  guy in Brooklyn showed me around his apartment. It went viral.” It hasn’t stopped since.Simpson’s selections are dictated by his own sense of curiosity. “There are lots of identical, cookie-cutter flats in New York, housing finance guys.” He no longer steps foot inside them. “I’m not interested. Instead, it’s places where I think: I want to see what that looks like. A strange building, low-income housing, rent-controlled places, someone who pays $70,000 a month.” He still roams the street looking for volunteers, but with 11 million followers on Instagram and TikTok, there is no shortage of doors opening these days; sometimes prearranged.What has he learned from the endless property perusal? “All New York renters think they’re getting a deal, but, really, everybody is getting ripped off,” says Simpson. “And beauty really lies in the eyes of the beholder. Sometimes, I film small apartments, and people comment saying it’s depressing, but the people who live there are thrilled.”This is why, he’s certain, it’s not just beautiful Brownstone-owning Brooklynites who let him in. “People are proud of what they have,” he says, “on whatever scale, and they want to show the world. Price isn’t the only determiner of worth or value: how they decorate, how they live in the architecture, how they found a place. And there’s the 15 minutes of fame that comes with letting me in.”‘What do you do for a living?’Daniel Mac,@itsdanielmacTikTok followers:14.2 millionInstagram followers:2.8 millionView image in fullscreen‘It was tough at the beginning – I’m shy by nature. Money was the motivator. I wanted to know how to get rich.’Photograph: CraSH/Shutterstock“When I started,” says Los Angeles-based Daniel MacDonald, 27, known online as Daniel Mac, “I’d just moved to Dallas, Texas, from a small-ish town in Arizona where there weren’t any Lamborghinis. I’d never seen supercars – and was curious. How did the driver afford it? What could I, fresh out of college, do to get one?” Unabashed, he began walking up to their tinted windows to ask: “What do you do for a living?”His first video clocked up 40m views. “When I posted it, I thought there was a glitch in the app and the numbers were wrong, but within a week I’d gained a million followers on TikTok.” This quadrupled in a matter of months – all during Covid. “People were bored and needed cash,” he says. “They wanted to get rich, and to find out how.”Sometimes, answers are unexpected.He has stoppedformer stockbroker Jordan Belfort, rapper Wiz Khalifa and Shou Zi Chew, theCEO of TikTok. Mostly, though, the responses are fairly formulaic. “The golden rule to getting rich, it transpires, is to invest, and buy real estate. Otherwise, common jobs are finance, healthcare, computer science and tech. Plus some trades, like plumbing and electricians … Accumulating wealth isn’t that sexy, it transpires.”How does he earn his living? “My revenue is split into three buckets: roughly 40% from ad revenue paid out primarily by Facebook and Snapchat, then some from YouTube and TikTok.” That’s his commission from the advertising that the platforms sell. “Another 40% or so comes from brand partnerships.” That’s the sponsored content. “Instagram brings in the most from this, then TikTok. And the last section comes from other miscellaneous things like speaking gigs.”Raised in Tucson, MacDonald had just graduated with a degree in finance from the University of Arizona when he started his TikTok. Initially, he was reluctant to be in front of the camera. “It was tough at the beginning,” he says. “I’m shy by nature, and wasn’t used to negativity and criticism, or people being mean to me online. Money was the motivator to continue. I wanted to know how to get rich.” It worked. In 2023, he bought his dream car: a $100,000 Porsche GT4.There’s a candidness to interviewees, he reckons, when they’re filmed on an iPhone camera, with no chunky kit or team of producers. “I’ve gotten people into hot water. One of thehigh-ups at Apple left the company after they made a lewd joke in a video of mine. People say stuff they regret.”Certainly, a strata of the super-wealthy would be reluctant to publicly parade their wealth. But MacDonald preys on those in flashy cars – the shy, modest and secretive types don’t tend to drive Bugattis. “It’s very American, for sure,” he says. “I’ve tried filming in several other countries where people don’t show off so much; they aren’t as flashy. In London, people were far more reluctant to talk about money.”‘Why are you a fan?’Morfo Peyiazis,@morfopeyiazisTikTok followers:47,800Instagram followers:15,600View image in fullscreen‘Football fans are either portrayed as mindless, violent hooligans or as sugar-coated and family-friendly. Nothing captured the true, unfiltered chaos somewhere in between.’Photograph: Robin Lee / robin.p.leeLondon-based Morfo Peyiazis, 30, took a clinical approach to viral success. She worked in marketing before starting out as a professional poster. “I was pitching video ideas to brands,” she says, “particularly football clients. I wanted to do interviews embedded with fans, and got fed up with being told, ‘No, it’s too risky.’”During Euro 2020, she spotted a chance. “Fuck it,” she thought, “I’ll make my own fan-focused series. Football fans are either portrayed as mindless, violent hooligans on the news, or, by their clubs, as sugar-coated and family-friendly. Nothing captured the true, unfiltered chaos somewhere in between.”Getting in among it suited her personality. “I get it from my dad,” she reckons, “a crazy Cypriot man. Growing up he had so much energy, and so much empathy with people.”Peyiazis saw TikTok as a way in to a more traditional telly career. “In essence, I used it to create a public portfolio: a place to make your own pilots, and prove that your ideas are popular. My ambition over the next five years is to build a media brand, and I want to be future-proof.” Whether or not that’s possible on TikTok, she’s still unsure. “The turnaround is so crazy. I couldn’t tell you the last five videos I watched. It’s instant: bam-bam-bam. How to create long-term impact is challenging.” She has landed gigs with Channel 4 and Sky Sports.There’s a natural warmth to her presenting style: playful, inquisitive, genuine interest in what her interviewees are saying. “I don’t like being on the periphery; I’m there to soak up the experience they’re having.” It’s this attitude that explains Peyiazis’s on-screen appeal, entirely unfazed by whatever she’s confronted with: hordes of screaming Celtic and Rangers fans at the high-octane “old firm” derby; young men playing up to the camera once microphones are pointed in their direction. “Among some of the supposedly most dangerous rivalries in the world, I feel entirely safe. Having no fear, and getting stuck in. You’ve got to be able to hold your own – and I can.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSocial mediaTikTokInstagramDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was solid, not great, television, driven by an unspoken, looming threat –what will he do next?This makes sense if you understand that on the way to creating a new world order of unfettered, red-blooded, male-dominated American capitalism, there is also a cultural revolution. As Stephen Marchewrites in the Atlantic: “Washington today can be understood only as a product of show business, not of law or policy.”True to the norms of show business, performance is all. There can only be one hero, everyone else must genuflect or cheer. So for weeks, other leaders, men who recognised that their power was not God-given or made in a TV studio, used the best tools their cultures bequeathed when dealing with erratic old men. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, charmingly patted The Strongman on the knee and quietly corrected him, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, came bearing an invitation from a real king. Lower-order Australians raised on a diet of neoliberalism offered lower-order Americans squillions of dollars – fordefenceandindustry.The dangerous folly of Australia’s come-what-may sycophancy towards Trump is on full display | Paul DaleyRead moreUnlike President Teddy Roosevelt, who in 1902invited Vida Goldsteinto advise on how America might copy Australia and give women the vote, few women of substance crossed the portal to this Oval Office.And then The Strongman momentarily dropped his guard, overreached and became his true self, The Bully, while his wingman, JD Vance, sat itching to lay a killer punch on the war-weary president of Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelenskyy sat quietly, the loss of his people and country heavy on his shoulders, until he was goaded into trying to set the record straight.Trump must have loved being able to land his line: “This is going to be great television.” No wonder some commentatorsthought it was planned. Close watchers thought it was one of those stoushes that got out of hand whenthe wingman’s ignorance was challenged.Any woman who has ever been treated as though they were from another, lower, speciesrecognised the tactics. Belittle, gaslight, talk over, threaten, demand gratitude and dismiss.It has long been clear that women were to be Trump’s first target. He has made no secret of his contempt for women for decades, choosing to believe his mythic self-creation: “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”He quickly turned to attacking diversity, equity and inclusion policies, suggesting that the fatal collision between the Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines planewas the result of DEI. He began outlawing such policies, not just in government departments funded directly by the state, but every organisation that received grants, and every business that had a connection with the government. That included all the big ones of the old and new economy; public money is the lifeblood of many American enterprises.The speed with which corporations fell into line was astonishing. The values that had been trumpeted for decades – of inclusion, opportunity, reflecting the diversity of society and tapping the best talent even if they weren’t white men – evaporated. Forget the triple bottom line, sustainability and equity.The Australian branches of American companies followed the directives from head office –scaling back policiesthat had begun to change the face of their workforces. The Australian Stock Exchange appeared to embrace the opportunity andabandoned new diversity reporting plans for listed companies.Australian legislation to impose stronger gender and equity requirements on companies with government contractsstill awaits Senate approvalbut it has started to change the nature of work and the opportunities available to women, as theincome inequality data this week showed. It has been slower for other under-represented groups. The opposition, which has never managed to ensure appropriate representation of women in its own party, grasped the prospect ofabolishing rules that ensured the public sector workforce reflected society.The DEI attack was the first telltale sign of the sort of society Trump wants to create, one dreamt of for years by global libertarian thinktanks. The destruction of USAid underlined this single-mindedness, along with removal from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, and undermining the National Institutes of Health.Our worst politicians are wondering if they can make Trumpism work here. Why not? | First Dog on the Moon|Read moreThese institutions are not window dressing. They did real good, gathered useful information,saved lives and enabled societies to function with a degree of humanity and safety. They softened the blows of unfettered capitalism and recognised the power of interconnectedness.I write this waiting for Cyclone Alfred to cross the coast a kilometre from my house – ferocious winds and rain are threatening the worst. This is not random but a cyclone propelled too far south bytropical water temperatures, supercharged by the global heating that capitalism has refused to constrain.American power is unprecedented. Its military bases dot the globe, its companies drive national economies, its popular culture shapes minds. But sticking to his script, the alacrity of The Strongman’s determinationto go it alone and create opportunities for the mega rich is astonishing.Fifty years of effort to save capitalism from itself, to be inclusive, to respect the environment and rule of law, to use unprecedented knowledge to ameliorate likely impacts, has been jettisoned. Instead, the tech revolution, embraced by The Strongman and powered by the worst imperial notions, will leave a trail of extraordinary destruction and missed opportunities for a better, fairer world.And in the wake of another International Women’s Day, it is worth stating the obvious:women and the poor will suffer most.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsAustralian politicsWomencommentShareReuse this content"

The key question now is what, in practical terms, Europe and Britain can and will do to meet this challenge. Is this Europe’s moment, when it finally comes of age as a global player? Or will the EU and its close neighbours collectively fail to rise to the occasion, condemning their citizens to an era of domination by bigger, rapacious and more determined powers?Donald Trump is in the process of attempting, rashly, to dothree extraordinary things. First, he is trying to force Ukraine, which has spent more than three years under murderous assault, to accept a “peace deal” on inimical terms dictated by himself and the aggressor, Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Second, in a stunning reversal of US policy, he is seeking a rapprochement with Moscow that includes re-establishing full political and diplomatic relations, lifting sanctions and launching joint economic partnerships. Third, he is telling Europeans they must henceforth defend themselves, that the US, in effect, is no longer a loyal, reliable partner or even necessarily a friend, and that Nato, for 76 years the solid bedrock of transatlantic security, is dispensable.European leaders, with some exceptions on the political fringes, are united in their alarm at all three of these unwise, irrational and dangerous interventions. At the same time, most accept that even if Trump vanished entirely – a desirable but unlikely eventuality – a change in the balance of US-Europe relations is inescapable and overdue. In a national address last week, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president,summed up the position well. “Europe’s future should not be decided in Washington or Moscow,” he said. “The war in Ukraine… continues with the same intensity [but] the US, our ally, has changed its position.” As a result, Europe was entering a new era of self-reliance.Nato is a crucial shield for Poland, as it is for the three neighbouring Baltic republics. Now its removal or weakening is threatenedAccused of appeasing Putin in 2022, Macron, like many others, has learned better since. Now he warns that Russian imperialist aggression “knows no borders”, directly threatening France and Europe. Macron is not just talk. He has shown imaginative leadership, producing a tentative plan for astaged ceasefirethat has Ukrainian support, lobbying, flattering and correcting Trump to his face in the Oval Office, and promoting an Anglo-French proposal to deploy a European “assurance force” in Ukraine composed of a so-called coalition of the willing.In a week that saw repeated recourse to another overused phrase – the need for Europe to “step up” – Germany surprised many with a positive leap into the future. A country that nurtures visceral horror of debt announced a spectacular U-turn of its own – the amending of its Basic Law to permit multibillion-euro investments in defence and national infrastructure. Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat who held off the far-right to win last month’s federal election, has a reputation as a deficit hawk and fiscal conservative.Not any more. And he has gone further even than Macron inurging Europe’s “independence”from the US and vowing ongoing, expanded military aid for Kyiv. Other European leaders, notably Donald Tusk, have “stepped up” in commendable ways. Poland’s prime minister is in an unenviable position. A strong believer in the transatlantic alliance, he, like so many others, must now feel utterlybetrayed by Trump.Nato is a crucial shield for Poland, as it is for the three neighbouring Baltic republics. Now its removal or weakening is threatened.Keir Starmer also recognises the historic nature of this moment, and has risen to meet it. He has worked assiduously and carefully to restrain Trump’s worst instincts. His evident contempt, displayed in the Commons last week, for the ignorant comments of US vice-president JD Vance about “random countries” showed he is not afraid to push back, too. Starmer’s collaboration with EU leaders is a very welcome post-Brexit development that should be extended beyond defence and security. Yet like them, the UK faces daunting hurdles. Although they now recognise the necessity, their shared, chronic dependence on the US will behard to break.These challenges – on reducing Europe’s reliance on America, boosting its defences and maintaining support for Ukraine – were the focus of last week’s emergency EU summit. As is often the case in Brussels, the results were mixed. New overall defence spending of€800bn (£670bn) was agreed. But whether it ever materialises will depend on national governments’ willingness to borrow. The usual divisions were apparent; Hungary blocked a joint statement on Ukraine. Within Nato, most member states, like Britain, are now committing to higher spending. Non-EU countries, such asNorway, are piling in, too. Oslo is belatedly yet commendably doubling its aid to Kyiv.Europe is stepping up. In time, if it perseveres and its leaders keep their promises, it will be better able to deter Russia alone – and survive in a reordered, more hostile world. But how effective Europe can be in rescuing Ukraine in the short term from a developing Trump-Putin axis is in serious doubt. Trump still refuses to provide Kyiv with meaningful postwar security guarantees. His suspension of military aid and mapping and intelligence assistance is encouraging Russia to intensify attacks. More civilians are dying each day because of Trump’s treachery. Each day, Ukraine is further brutalised and degraded. A just peace looks further away than ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Former KGB officers claim Trump wasrecruited in Moscow in 1987 and cultivated as an assetin the years prior to his 2016 US election victory.Two retired Russian spies weighed in again last month, alleging that the then 40-year-old Trump,codename “Krasnov”, was personally compromised in an “active measures” operation and has secretly danced to Putin’s tune ever since.Nothing is proved and all is denied. Yet the so-calledSteele dossier, compiled by a British MI6 ex-spy chief, the FBI’sMueller report, and US intelligence agencies all agree there were “multiple, systematic” Russian efforts to swing the 2016 vote to Trump. Candidate Trump praised Putin at the time as a “strong leader” while claiming never to have met him.Previously, he said he had.He’s less coy now. Their phone call on 12 February lasted 90 minutes – and changed the world.What did Putin say? It must have been persuasive. Since then, Trump has been falling over himself to please andappease the Kremlin’s dictator. He has suspended US military aid and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, pilloried and plotted to oust its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and demanded a “peace deal” on Russia’s unjust terms. Meanwhile, the wider ramifications of Trump’s sellout carry huge negative implications for Europe and western interests in China, the Middle East and Africa.If Trump is not Russia’s stooge, what explains his epic volte-face? Apologists offer several excuses. One is that Ukraine is not America’s problem. Nonsense. Unprovoked armed aggression against a sovereign democratic state is every free nation’s problem. Another is that the US should not have to fight Europe’s wars. Answer: it doesn’t. It fights its own wars on other people’s territory, out of self-interest.It always has.Supporters say Trump is a master dealmaker and peacemaker. Phooey! He has already offered crucial Ukraine giveaways to Putin, for zero return. Remember his North Korea and Afghanistan fiascos? And look at Gaza. How’s that going, Comrade Krasnov? Fans claim he’s performing a clever “reverse Nixon” by disrupting Russia-China ties, like that other disgraceful US president in 1972. Except, only days ago, Putin and President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the “unique strategic value” of their alliance.Lucrative joint economic projects provide another key to understanding Trump’s broader surrender strategy. Marco Rubio, US secretary of state turned cheap hustler, gushes embarrassingly about “extraordinary opportunities”. Putin is dangling deals onrare earth metals, energy and aluminium.Joint Arctic exploitation is mooted. Meanwhile, Trump helpfully imposes costly tariffs on Russia’s foes.Whatever Trump’s reasons, the shocking truth is that Putin owns him now, even if he didn’t own him before. The US has switched sides. Trump boasts, self-incriminatingly, that he alone has inside information about Kremlin intentions. This dumb patsy likes the strongman vibe. He’d like to be a dictator, too. He admires how Putin terminates opponents “with extreme prejudice”, as inApocalypse Now. Except in this twisted White House remake,JD Vanceis mad, bad Colonel Kurtz.Trump betrayed his warm feelings for Putin during his Oval Office put-up row with Zelenskyy. Asked why Putin would keep his word in any peace deal when he never has before, Trump exploded: “They respect me! Let me tell you. Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through aphoney witch-hunt…” Trump was referring to the past investigations into Russian collusion. Plainly, he sees Putin, an indicted war criminal and mass murderer, not merely as role model but as personal friend and fellow victim of political persecution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Europe is Moscow’s new bogeymanMuch flows from this, none of it good for Britain and Nato. Ukraine’s capitulation is now a shared US-Russia war aim. Trump is trying to bully Zelenskyy and stampede Europe into a deal without credible security guarantees. He is planning to ease or lift sanctions, not strengthen them, as he occasionally suggests. He has already halted US cooperation with Europe on countering Russian“shadow war” cyber operations.Continued American backing for Nato is rightly questioned by German and French leaders. The alliance may not survive this crisis. Would-be bridge-builder Keir Starmer lacks a pontoon to stand on. Poland and the Baltic states understandably fear they may be next. The US nuclear umbrella is in doubt, too, which has led Emmanuel Macron to revive his idea of a pooledAnglo-French deterrent.Russia is intensifying the war to exploit Trump’s surrender, gain ground and further squeeze Kyiv. Europe is Moscow’s new bogeyman. Putin now says the US is more like a partner, run by people with a “pragmatic, realistic worldview” who are discarding “stereotypes, so-called ‘rules’ and the messianic, ideological cliches of their predecessors”.There goes the laws-based international order, right there. Trump may not win a Nobel peace prize but he has certainly earned the Order of Lenin.If it lasts, and that’s a big “if” given fickle Trump’s record, this US-Russia reset may remake the geopolitics of the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Iran stands to gain, unless, as Tehran fears, Putin sells it out to Israel. North Korea is a likely winner, too. Putin may win a freer hand in Syria, the Sahel and central Asia. Facing an emboldened Beijing, Trump may giveTaiwan the Kyiv bum’s rush.The most threatening prospect, for western democracies, is the idea, discussed by Rubio, of an emerging troika ofauthoritarian superstates– the US, Russia and China – dominating and dictating a new world order.As Judas Trump blunders about, betraying friends, rewarding enemies and smashing the global crockery, one cold-eyed certainty remains: in their dysfunctional, deeply dubious relationship, Putin is the dominant partner.

I’ve got some good news and some bad news to mark the occasion.The bad news is that alegally defined sexual predatoris leading the most powerful country on earth and we’re seeing aglobal backlashagainst women’s rights. “[I]nstead of mainstreaming equal rights, we are seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny,” the UNsecretary-general, António Guterres, said in his IWD message.The good news, for those of us in the US at least, is that the Democrats have a plan to deal with all this. Or rather, they have wardrobeconcepts of a plan. On Tuesday night, Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol. Some members from the Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC), including Nancy Pelosi, decided to protest by … wait for it … wearing pink.“Pink is a color of power and protest,” the New Mexico representative Teresa Leger Fernández, chair of the DWC,toldTime. “It’s time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear.”The pink outfits may have been loud but the message theDemocratswere sending was far from clear. They couldn’t even coordinate their colour-coordinating protest: some lawmakers turned up wearing pink while others wore blue and yellow to support Ukraine and others wore black because it was a somber occasion.Still, I’ll give the DWC their due: their embarrassing stunt seems to have garnered at least one – possibly two – fans. OneMSNBC columnist, for example, wrote that the “embrace of such a traditionally feminine color [pink] by women with considerable political power makes a stunning example of subversive dressing”.For the most part, however, the general reaction appears to have been that this was yet another stunning example of how spineless and performative the Democrats are. Forget bringing a knife to a gunfight – these people are bringing pink blazers to a fight for democracy. To be fair, there were a few other attempts at protest beyond a pink palette: the Texas representative Al Greenheckled the president(and was latercensuredby some of his colleagues for doing so) and a few Democrats left the room during Trump’s speech. Still, if this is the “opposition”, then we are all doomed.Not to mention: even the pink blazers seemed a little too extreme for certain factions of the Democratic party. House Democratic leadershipreportedly urgedmembers not to mount protests and to show restraint during Trump’s address. They also chose the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin to give the Democratic response to Trump’s speech. While Slotkin tends to be described as asensible centrist voiceby a lot of the media, she’s very Trump-adjacent. Slotkin is one of the Democratic senators who hasvoted with Trumpthe most often and, last June, was one of the 42 Democrats to vote with the GOP to sanction the international criminal court (ICC) over its seeking of arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israelileaders for destroying Gaza. Human rights advocacy groups have warned that attacking the ICC like this undermines international law and the ability to prosecute or prevent human rights violations across the world. It speaks volumes about the US media and political class that a senator standing against international law can be called a centrist.This whole episode also speaks volumes about the Democrats’ plan for the future: it’s growing increasingly clear that, instead of actually growing a spine and fighting to improve people’s lives, the Democratic party seems to think the smartest thing to do is quietly move to the right and do nothing while the Trump administrationimplodes. I won’t caution against this strategy myself. Instead, I’ll let Harry Truman do it. Back in 1952,Truman said: “The people don’t want a phony Democrat. If it’s a choice between a genuine Republican, and a Republican in Democratic clothing, the people will choose the genuine article, every time.”Anyway, the upshot of all of this is that the Democrats are not coming to save us. We must save ourselves. That means organizing within our local communities and learning lessons from activistsoutside our communities. It means being careful not to normalize creeping authoritarianism and it means recognizing the urgency of the moment. The warning signs are flashing red: we need to respond with a hell of a lot more than a pink wardrobe.Make atomic bombings straight again!DEI Derangement Syndrome has reached such a fever-pitch in the US that a picture of the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan has beenflagged for deletionat the Pentagon.

Is it any surprise he’s a supporter of the president?Sat 8 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 06.04 ESTShareAndrew Tate is now a free man.The rightwing anti-woman influencer landed in Florida last week after being held detained for over two years in Romania on rape, sex trafficking and money laundering charges. The Romanian courts abruptly reversed their previous refusal to allow Tate to leave the country after several high-level Trump administration officials took an interest in his case – including Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr, who called Tate’s arrest in Romania “absolute insanity”. The Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu,was reportedly approached by a Trump envoyabout Tate’s case at a security conference in Munich in February; Tate arrived in the US within weeks. When asked if Trump had played a role in Tate and his brother’s release, the Tates’lawyerJoseph McBridesaid: “Do the math. These guys are on the plane.”There are so many allegations of sexual abuse and violence by the misogynist mega-influencer Andrew Tate that it can be difficult to keep track of them all. After ending his middling career as a professional kickboxer in 2014, Tate first came to fame in the UK as a contestant on the 2016 season of the popular British reality TV series Big Brother. Tate waskicked off that showafter producers became aware that he was under police investigation for sexual assault and rape followinga 2015 arrest. (Tate denies wrongdoing.)But after being kicked off of TV, Tate had another career to fall back on: that of a pimp. For some years, Tate has been running an online business in which he collects the earnings of women who perform webcam pornography. In the years following his expulsion from Big Brother, he became a booster of this business model online, where he has amassed a staggering number of followers – almost 11 million on Elon Musk’s X alone – including a large and growing proportion ofyoung boys.In some ways, Tate is the ultimate Maga manWomen who knew Tate during this period in England say that he was forceful, manipulative, coercive and violent. Four of them havefiled civil suits against himfor rapes and sexual assaults that they say he committed between 2013 and 2016. At least one says that Taterepeatedly strangledher (Tate denies wrongdoing). In the new bookClown World: Four Years Inside Andrew Tate’s Manosphere, the British writers Jamie Tahsin and Matt Shea speak to one woman who said she knew Tate during this time, who recounted a brutal scene of violence and intimidation at his hands. She told them that once, while hiding from an irate Tate in a bathroom, hescreamed at herthrough the door: “I don’t give a fuck if you call the police. I’m going to beat the shit out of you.” In addition to the British civil suits, Tate is now wanted by police in Bedfordshire in relation to an investigation into rape and sex trafficking.A warranthas been issued for his arrest. (Tate denies wrongdoing.)At some point, Tate moved to Romania, saying in a now-deleted YouTube post that “40%” of the reason he chose the eastern European country was because he believed that sexual assault cases were less likely to be investigated there. No such luck. Tate’s compound in Bucharest wasraided in December 2022, and in2023 he and his brother Tristan were chargedwith sex trafficking of seven womenand money laundering. Tate himself was charged with rape, and Romanian prosecutors alleged that he coerced the women into performing for his webcam business through threats of violence and financial ruin. Tate is alleged to have continued his monetized system of sexual force while on house arrest in Romania awaiting trial: aftera second raidon his properties by the Romanian authorities in 2024, additional charges were filed against him, including for the sex trafficking of a15-year-old girl. That second indictmentlisted 35 known victims of trafficking(both Tate and his brother deny wrongdoing).Meanwhile, Andrew Tate has become one of the most influential public figures of his generation – perhaps not in spite of his alleged abuse of women, but because of it. His was thethird-most Googled name in 2023; videos have been widely shared of him saying that women are a man’s property, that women are to blame for their own rapes, and that women who talk back to men or accuse them of cheating should be beaten. (“It’s bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up bitch,”Tate saysin a typical video.) Others show himdeclaringthat “humanity cannot survive with female empowerment” and that women should not be permitted to drive. Videos of him have been watched more than 11.6bn times on TikTok alone.What is Andrew Tate accused of and why has he travelled to the US?Read moreIn addition to his enormous social media following and ongoing webcam business, Tate is a prolific producer of content, including videos and podcasts, and is a frequent guest of rightwing media figures from Tucker Carlson to Candace Owens to Piers Morgan. He monetizes his followers through a number of subscription content services, including a seminar course offering called The Real World (previously branded as Hustler’s University and offering a “PhD” – “pimping hoes degree”). Hustlers’ University/The Real World charges a subscription fee and also works on a multi-level-marketing model, where Tate acolytes both buy his content and get a kickback for recruiting other men downline. (Tate has denied that the venture is apyramid scheme.) Among other things, the courses instruct men in how to,as Tate puts it, “Inspire a girl to make money and give you the money.” A hacking leak of the platform’s data revealed that the subscription service has well over800,000 users.Tate also offers a more expensive subscription service, called The War Room, for especially devoted fans.The War Roomcosts $8,000 (for a special additional fee of $5,000, members can sign up for “the Test”, an opportunity to fly to Romania to be beaten up by a professional MMA fighter). The War Room bills itself as an all-male secret society meant to “free the modern man from socially induced incarceration”; in practice, according to aBBC investigation, it operates as a kind boorish fraternity, something of a mixture between male-bonding, self-help, and – allegedly – a pimp networking and professional development group. In Telegram messages obtained by the network, members of Tate’s War Room network discussed how to coerce and trick women into sex and prostitution; the BBC identified 45 women who the War Room members were targeting for abuse in the chats over a period of 13 months. They allegedly did not stop at planning. The BBC spoke to women who said theyhad been groomedand forced into web cam pornography by War Room members; Tahsin and Shea, in their book, also speak to women who said they had beengroomed into webcammingby Tate followers. The women describe experiences typical of gendered abuse: being isolated from their friends and family, subjected to violence and threats, and forced to perform various demeaning or menial acts as a sign of their submission. “This is how you train dogs,” one War Roommessagereads. The picture that emerges from the allegations is of a massive, organized, and monetized global network of sexual exploitation, operating largely in the open, helmed by a man who is being lauded and rewarded by legions of fans for his misogyny.Is it any surprise that Andrew Tate is a supporter ofDonald Trump? Is it any surprise that so many in Donald Trump’s administration are supporters of Andrew Tate? In some ways, Tate is the ultimate Maga man. Like Trump, he seems to have pushed American men dramatically to the right, especially on questions of gender equality. And like Trump, Tate appears to have inspired much more abuse than he has personally committed.The men’s appeal is not only in providing their followers with the vicarious pleasure of witnessing their public sadism, but in granting ideological and rhetorical permission to pursue sadism of their own. Any man can be a rapist, the logic goes, and so any man can have—to soothe their own sense of inadequacy – the comfort of knowing that there is at least one person less powerful than him. In that way, Tate’s logic of monetized sexual exploitation is perhaps a decent model of Trump’s theory of governance: that force and domination are their own end.The Trump regime is now stuffed with alleged rapists and sexual abusers. Besides Trump himself, there is his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and Hhealth and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr; Trump’s first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, was accused in a House ethics report of “regularly” paying for sex, including with minors. These are not deficits or embarrassments in Trump world: they are assets. Sexual violence may have been the first form of authoritarianism: for the Trump regime, it also seems to be the paradigmatic one.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsAndrew TateOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationGendercommentShareReuse this content"

We know what we don’t want, which is, basically: everything the couple have done so far. We disapproved of the tell-allOprah interview, andHarry’s memoir,Spare– they were too revealing, too appallingly frank. We hatedtheir tell-nothing Netflix documentary,Harry & Meghan– far too boring, what was the point?And we particularly loathe the new Netflix show,With Love, Meghan, which garnered what must be a record number ofterrible reviewslast week – “an exercise in narcissism”, “toe-curlingly unlovable TV”. Where once the pair were ridiculed for their whining self pity, now they are diagnosed with the opposite problem – critics find the new venture “desperately upbeat”.It’s not that the reviewers are wrong. It is bad TV. Meghan is stiff and awkward and operates entirely in cliches. A cooking show can just about handle a dull presenter if they are skilled and making something interesting – but here is Meghan’s “skillet spaghetti”: dry pasta over a layer of cherry tomatoes and feta, to be boiled up together. She doesn’t look as though she enjoys cooking or is any good at it. Perhaps this would be OK if there were at least a few dynamic guests. But Meghan instantly neuters any conversation that strays off the assigned path (praising her; echoing her platitudes) with a look of true alarm.What I find interesting, though, is the utter outrage humming through the press about all this, an emotion that underlies every one of these reviews. After all, this is fairly innocuous stuff, as it comes. The duchess is irritating – but no more so than, say, any other Californian lifestyle influencer, or rich actress launching a brand of rustic fantasy tea towels and “inspirational” candles. Even Gwyneth Paltrow did not provoke this level of hate. Neither is Meghan flogging dubious wellness cures, a curse that hangs over so many similar enterprises. She’s just making ladybird crostini out of tomatoes and balsamic glaze, and inviting us to admire her taste in flower arrangements. It’s boring, yes, but is it worth all this fury?Everything the Sussexes do is wrong. When they paid a sombre visit to a cemetery one Remembrance Sunday, it was pilloried as a PR exercise – they were aping true royals. When they behave instead like mere celebrities, they are scolded as embarrassments to the crown.It should be a relief to royalists, really, that the “confessional” part of their careers seems to be over, and they are attempting to establish themselves as bland lifestyle influencers. There is no gauntlet thrown down before William and Kate this time, no shaming secrets revealed. Yet this new phase is provoking more anger than ever.I suppose it’s obvious what we want: for the pair to keep their mouths shut. We would like them to act as if they were still working royals, but without the work. We want decorum, and dignity. We do not want them to do anything as vulgar as make money.This, I suppose, is the price of cutting royals loose: embarrassmentThe trouble is, we do not want to pay them, either. The couple need protection, and the public – justifiably – do not wish to foot the bill. As working royals, they received a taxpayer-funded sovereign grant, but we’ve cut them loose, as has King Charles, who no longer pays the rest of Harry’s income. That decision was cheered most heartily by the same corners of the media now slamming Meghan and Harry for their adventures in the private sector. Let them make their own money! No, not like that!But what else are they supposed to do? A childhood in “the firm” doesn’t exactly set you up for an ordinary job: Harry managed in the army, but this particular career was always going to end prematurely as his status put his fellow soldiers at risk. His wife could go back to acting, perhaps – buttheir security billalone is said to run to £1.5m a year. TV companies were willing to spray them with cash for the price of some light self promotion: they signed a £78m multi-year deal with Netflix in 2020. Wouldn’t you take it?But then the charges laid at their door have always been confusing, to say the least. A chief criticism seems to be that they are using their proximity to the throne to make money. Well, yes. That particular grift must date back to the birth of the monarchy. It also precisely describes the industry – authors, reporters, TV crews – making these accusations in the first place. Not to mention British tourism. Why shouldn’t money be made off the royals? Isn’t that how we justify their existence these days?Another is that the TV industry is a tawdry and shaming way to make a living. We tend to draw a tender veil, here, over the various ways in which the monarchy has accumulated its wealth over the centuries: empire, slavery, killing rivals and pheasants. There are worse sins than presenting a badNetflixshow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We pick overWith Love, Meghanas if the pair were still subject to royal standards, courting popularity in the British press. But they aren’t. We hear over and over that the duchess isn’t “helping herself”. But she is. Last week the show hit Netflix’s top 10. It has just been renewed for a second season.This, I suppose, is the price of cutting royals loose: embarrassment. They are no longer answerable to us, no longer cowed by bad press. King Charles cannot pull them into line. And yet, somehow, they still represent the royal family. Charles has expressed a wish to “slim down” the monarchy, sending more royals off to seek their fortunes in the wide world.

Though I make absolutely zero claim on having any Mystic Meg capabilities,this time around it turned out that I had interviewed both Adrien Brody andMikey Madison, respective winners of this year’s best actor and actress, for theObserver.Asked whether they believed they were in with a chance they answered the only way an actor can in their situation: by not really answering the question at all.Madison notedthat her filmAnorawasn’t even out yet, so it was weird talking about awards. Brody,star ofThe Brutalist, mumbled: “If that day comes…”.The only actor I’ve spoken to who didn’t observe this protocol of humility and bashfulness was Adam Pearson, whomI interviewedlast October for his filmA Different Man. The buzz for his (excellent) performance was already ratcheting up and there was talk of a best supporting actor nod. Pearson, however, made no attempt to dampen the flames. “I want to go to the Oscars and clean up,” he told me. “I’ve already gone to Ikea, I’ve got the flat-pack shelves in the shed ready for it.”In the event, Pearson wasn’t nominated, which is a shame, because he’d have given one hell of a victory speech. Still, Ikea shelves always come in handy.Covid amnesiaHow are you going to mark – “celebrate” is definitely the wrong word – the fifth anniversary of the Covid pandemic? Sunday has been designated theNational Day of Reflection,or maybe you would go by 23 March 2020, the date the first national lockdown in the UK began.Perhaps you could grab your trainers and do the “silly billies” with Joe Wicks in your living room? Or go for a walk of exactly one hour’s duration and sporadically scream “TWO METRES!” at your kids? Or order some online shopping and leave it in the bath for two days to disinfect?View image in fullscreenNowhere to play: Rhyl, north Wales, on the first day of Covid-19 lockdown, 23 March 2020.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesOf course, everyone’s experience of the lockdowns was deeply personal, and those who lost family and friends – more than 230,000 people died in the UK – will want to reflect in their own way. Mostly, it seems, we choose not to look back on this bizarre and traumatic period; “collective amnesia” is often used to describe our response.I’ve found myself thinking about it at strange times recently: walking past a skate park that was packed in the balmy spring of 2020, but sits dormant and unloved now.I’m going to try to remember some of the positive aspects: those few months when we revered school teachers as we always should; the strange acts of kindness between neighbours, rather than pass-agg WhatsApp arguments over whether you should put CCTV on your street. And maybe at 8pm on the 23rd, I’ll quietly bang a pot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My research shows that a resilient society should be rooted in wellbeing, not wealthSat 8 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 06.51 ESTShareFive years ago, we were beginning to face the imminent reality of lockdown. We were confronted with an uncertain future in which our habitual ways of coping, succeeding, displacing and overworking were going to be put mercilessly on hold because of an unprecedented existential threat. And for a few months we lived through a see-saw of emotions: public and private grief at the scale of loss; anger and confusion over the restrictions imposed, withdrawn, re-imposed; exhaustion at the pressure of sustaining basic public services – and also a kind of guilty, sporadic excitement at possibilities we hadn’t guessed at. Clearer skies, silent roads; time; a sense of what mattered and who mattered, to us as individuals and to the whole of society. Fragile shoots of some sort of renewed spiritual imagination pushed a centimetre or so through the soil.Our capacity for not learning from crises, however, is impressively well developed (as it proved to be after the financial meltdown of 2008). After a few years of floundering and posturing, we are back where we were, our fingers firmly in our ears about the nature of international crises, medical or environmental, engaged in a hectic struggle to prove that we are not going to be “defeatist” about our economic future. We are back with the superchargedlanguage of “growth”as the all-sufficient and self-evident goal of national life – cheered on by a global turn to bloodthirsty competition and the prospect of futile, theatrical trade wars.View image in fullscreenA Times front page, June 2024Being “anti-growth” – or, in the new vocabulary of the past few months, beinga “nimby” or a “naysayer”– is high on the new catalogue of deadly sins. But before we settle down with our new government’s rhetoric about growth as the priority that trumps (I use the word advisedly) every other social or environmental goal, it is imperative that we ask what is meant by this language. What is it we want to “grow”?We are constantly being fed a narrative in which growth is something that needs no explanation or justification. We are being hypnotised into the position of the gangster (played by the immortal Edward G Robinson) in the Bogart/Bacall classicKey Largo, who, challenged as to what he really wants, agrees that the answer is simply “More”.But there are some better answers that could be given – answers that correspond more to what actual citizens might say they hope for from public policy. I’ve been working with theCentre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity(Cusp), led by Prof Tim Jackson at the University of Surrey, where some of these possible answers have been analysed and “road-tested” in a series of wide-ranging public conversations. The evidence emerging is clear. Those involved in these conversations – and the very diverse social and economic groups they represent – are convinced that stable, successful, confident and positive societies are not produced by the pursuit of growth for its own sake, but by clarity and purposiveness about what growth is supposed to serve. People look for more stable patterns of employment. We want opportunities for secure work and fulfilling leisure for ourselves and our children – dependable public services and affordable housing. We want – a fundamental matter, surely – resilience, a durable, trustworthy environment rather than a state of fevered anxiety. We want breathing space, literally and metaphorically: it’s no accident that “breath” and “spirit” are the same word in so many languages.“Growing” an economy against such a backdrop should mean growing the capacity to sustain all this. But isolate growth from public good (let alone environmental security), and you are simply planning for breakdown: individual psychological collapse in varying degrees of seriousness and collective implosion aslimited resources run out, competition becomes more violent and gross inequalities of power are intensified. And, as Donald Trump’s second presidency is already showing us, one of the early casualties of a mindless focus on local growth detached from the realities of the natural and the human world is the rule of law, national and international – the protocols and skills we put in place to make power accountable.View image in fullscreen‘We are being hypnotised into the position of the gangster (played by the immortal Edward G Robinson) in the Bogart/Bacall classic Key Largo.’Photograph: World History Archive/AlamySo when we hear politicians – and especially politicians of the left who are supposed to have some investment in the hopes and ideals just mentioned – appealing to the imperative of growth, we should be asking insistently what the word means, what we are supposed to be growing into or towards. So far, we have heard dismayingly little from government about how we are to develop towards a genuinely resilient society – resilient in the sense of being able to cope with unprecedented challenge without losing our commitment to one another’s wellbeing and safety.The uncomfortable truth is that in our present global context, growth frequently means the opposite of such shared responsibility. Concerns about profit weaken accountability; the distance of workforce from decision-making reinforces alienation and insecurity. Who specifically wants this? Presumably those whose profits are most at stake. Is it that impossible to turn this into an argument for growth understood as the building of a durable tax base, with incentives to plough back profit into job creation?“Public opinion research shows that the vast bulk of the population are more progressive and ambitious than what political parties present as being in the centre.” This is one of the conclusions of the Common Sense Policy Group (including Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson, whose classic study of equality and wellbeing,The Spirit Level,first published in 2009, is still both admired and ignored by policymakers), at the end of its 2024 collection of “manifesto” essays,Act Now.The work of Cusp suggests the same conclusion. There isgrowing evidence, set out in detail in the essays in Act Now, that policies capable of creating resilient wellbeing without assuming an endless spiral of simple economic expansion – such as universal access to essential goods and services, reducing working hours, and introducing carbon and wealth taxes – are not utopian fantasies.What if we marked the fifth anniversary of the beginning of lockdown with a speech or two from government starting from here – from the urgent need to demystify the fundamentalism of growth-in-the-abstract and to articulate something of what we want prosperity for? To encourage us to be clear about where we want to be as a society, in terms not just defined by possession and control but alert to the hunger for belonging, dignity, stability, a legacy worth passing on to a new generation? It might begin to look as if we were not, after all, incapable of learning. It might suggest that government was not wholly uninterested in building a new consensus around security, respect and hope.Rowan Williams is the former archbishop of CanterburyExplore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)OpinionCoronavirusPublic services policyInequalityEconomic policyWorkers' rightsInternational tradecommentShareReuse this content"

I delved into romantasy and found a good few cluesMax FletcherIn these novels, the heroes are – to borrow a term from the fandom – cinnamon rolls: soft-hearted, sweet and, yes, deliciousSat 8 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 06.14 ESTShareFeyre Archeron has many talents: she can skin a wolf and track a deer, and in the words of an amorous fairy she looks “absolutely delicious”. An impoverished hunter gatherer, Archeron is the protagonist of Sarah J Maas’sA Court of Thorns and Roses, or Acotar as it’s known to fans. This five-book series belongs to a genre called romantasy, so called because it blends romance and fantasy. And it’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that it has the popularity of both combined. Acotar has sold more than 13m copies and all five books are in the top 10bestselling fantasy titlesof 2025 to date. If you haven’t heard of them, the chances are that you have seen someone reading one on the train, perhaps concealed beneath the dust jacket of something less salacious.Most of romantasy’s readers arewomen aged 18 to 44, and part of the genre’s appeal is its reversal of gender roles. Archeron, for example, can’t read. But that’s only because poverty has forced her to focus her energy on hunting. Her illiteracy is therefore ironically a sign of strength. Maas’s men, meanwhile, may live in gorgeous palaces with well stocked libraries, but as the plots develop they come to depend on Archeron for their salvation.It’s not hard to see why millions of women are drawn to worlds in which female characters are beautiful hunters and men are bookish hunks. Especially when, in reality, only13% of menread daily, and then mostly for personal growth rather than pleasure. Men gravitate towardsself-help and nonfictionand make up only about 30% of thefiction-buying market. Romantasy capitalises on the scarcity value of literary men and leverages their appeal as sensitive and emotionally intelligent.View image in fullscreenFull disclosure: I’m one of the 13%, and I was surprised to find that my daily reading habit might indicate anything other than my unfitness for the modern world. I decided to make a journey into romantasy – a quest, if you will – to see if there was anything else these books have to teach men about what women want. I’m talking morally, of course, not carnally. Because, despite Acotar’s much vaunted sexual content, Maas is more interested in friendship than any other F-word. In the third book of the series, A Court of Wings and Ruin, for instance, by the time the various couples get into bed, it’s clear that their bond is about far more than just “rippling muscles”, “corded muscles” or even “muscles covered in intricate and beautiful tattoos”. It’s also about, you know, feelings. Accounts of these books often emphasise their sexual content, as though it’s somehow scandalous for women to be reading romance. But what is really surprising is how conservative they are.Which is not to say that their male leads are shrinking violets. Both Maas and Rebecca Yarros, in her equally popularEmpyrean series, establish early on that the male lead could literally kill his female counterpart. He is the Beast to her Beauty but, just as in the original fairytale, his brutality is only skin deep. In order to pursue his relationship with the heroine, he is forced to come to terms with the complex trauma that turned him into such a sexy monster.It is only then that he can reveal himself to be, to borrow a word beloved by romantasy fans, acinnamon roll. In other words, soft hearted, sweet and, yes, delicious. He may be handsome and powerful, but the hero’s real draw is his emotional vulnerability. So strong is the connection readers form with these characters, in fact, that BookTok is full ofreaders weepingwhile reading emotional passages. Asone young womanbawled while reading the tragic ending of A Court of Wings and Ruin, “I feel like my family is dying.”Men sometimes find romantasy threatening –one took to Reddit, for example, after he found his girlfriend’s secret stash of books: “The fact that THESE are her fantasies doesn’t sit right with me at all.” But these books are more about community than a desire to actually date men of such cringeworthy perfection.A romantasy fan I know, who happens to work in theatre, surmised that meeting Maas’s heroes in real life would be as disappointing as meeting famous actors: “In reality, they are far stupider than you imagined.” She has nevertheless found that romantasy has enabled her to reconnect with old friends who, after she recently became a mother, she rarely gets the chance to see: “It makes conversation so easy,” she said. “I mention a scene and we can talk for hours.”The connections that romantasy can foster meant it boomed during Covid. And now that our times are becoming ever more turbulent, readers areembracing the genrelike a comfort blanket. The societies romantasy depicts are often as chaotic as our own – Yarros’s Fourth Wing, for instance, is set during a time of total war. But everyone is given very clear roles that make their world, however dangerous, more predictable than our own: scribes report the news, infantry fight the battles and riders fly the dragons. And, of course, there is an elaborate prophecy that the protagonist needs to fulfil.Romantasy’s ordered worlds sometimes made me uncomfortable. Maas and Yarros are both obsessed with status. Their heroes may be secret softies, but it is no accident they are all titled. In the first book of Acotar, for example, Archeron is abducted by an aristocratic fairy, or high fae, called Tamlin. But, when she finds out that Tamlin is also a high lord and ruler of a domain called the Spring Court, she begins to find her abduction rather more propitious. Despite her physical strength, it seems Archeron’s way out of poverty lies through men. She may as well be in a Jane Austen novel.But it is possible to take this critique too far. Readers don’t come to romantasy looking for moral edification. The genre’s fans even codify booksaccording to acronymssuch as ETL (enemies to lovers), which shows they are looking for familiar narratives into which they can escape. And these novels are remarkably absorbing.I spent a very happy Sunday with Acotar, the washing piling up in the sink, tea-stained mugs gathering around me so that, when I was done, I could be under no illusion that I was a warrior king. Or even a particularly good husband. I was just happy to be a reader.Max Fletcher is a London-based writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ishiguro, now 70 and in receipt of a Nobel prize in literature and a knighthood, has fetched the elegant cakes himself, and is immediately solicitous. Am I chilly? Am I hungry? Am I worried whether my device will record our conversation?It’s an attentiveness to minute, even mundane detail that is evident in all his work. From The Unconsoled to The Remains of the Day, Ishiguro is the creator of some of the most unsettling and memorable fiction of the last 40 years. But perhaps no book of his is more loved than his sixth novel, Never Let Me Go, which has outsold all his others and been adapted not only into a major film but now a stage production.Still finding new readers 20 years after its publication, the novel is credited by the author with starting a train of thought and thematic inquiry that shaped its successors, The Buried Giant a decade ago, and 2021’s Klara and the Sun. All three, Ishiguro believes, are centred around the most basic and unavoidable fact: we are all going to die, and yet we must live as if we aren’t. Never Let Me Go is set in a society in which children are cloned in order to provide healthy organs to extend the lives of others; after two or three of these involuntary “donations”, they will “complete”, or die. But a rumour circulates among them that in some cases – if you can prove you are truly in love, for example – you may be granted an exemption from the process; you may be allowed to live.It is this unfounded belief that there may be a means of escape that powers the novel’s emotional heart. “Somewhere, irrationally, we can’t quite accept our fate,” Ishiguro explains, “and we long for this special dispensation. I think that it’s not just because we want to carry on living on and on and on. I think it’s because we don’t want to face the pain and sorrow and loneliness that comes with death. We fear the loss of loved ones. We fear the parting.”The novel’s title is a song that its narrator, Kathy H, plays on repeat during her time at the clones’ boarding school, Hailsham; it is both a physical possession, on a cassette tape that is later lost and which she searches to replace, and a talisman, an emblem of a time before she knew how her life, and those of her friends Tommy and Ruth, would develop. Ishiguro invented the song, which was later recorded by his friend and collaborator, the jazz musician Stacey Kent; subsequently, he taught himself to play it – he gestures towards a baby grand piano in the corner – “but that was very much after the fact, so that if anyone asked me about it, I’m not embarrassed by being totally ignorant”.It is a romantic song, of course, but its plaintive, beseeching title can be addressed not only to a lover, but to life itself; a plea for continuation and connection. “I think that’s an instinct that is strong in all of us. And it seems to me there’s something sad about it, but there is something quite admirable as well. There’s some kind of courage there, and an affirming of the good things about being alive, in that instinct of saying: look, it hasn’t been easy to build love and family and friendship, but I’ve done it and surely we can, all of us, just have a little bit more.”I’ve never been a great writer of prose. I can’t do it. It’s not out of choiceNever Let Me Go had a long gestation period, as Ishiguro explains in his introduction to a new edition; for many years, it existed merely as thoughts and notes about a group of students whose lifespan – perhaps as the result of a nuclear accident – was markedly different from their peers. The breakthrough came via a combination of external factors and timing: societal interest in the potential benefits and dangers of cloning, at its most headline-grabbing in the shape of Dolly the sheep; and a shift in writing and publishing that made a place in so-called literary novels for the techniques and practices of speculative fiction.“I gave myself permission to use what traditionally might have been called genre tropes,” Ishiguro explains. “And that wasn’t because I was being terribly brave or anything. I think the climate around me changed; the next generation of writers, people about 15 years younger than me, didn’t see anything weird about it, at least the people I happened to become friends with, David Mitchell or Alex Garland. They were taking their cues from all kinds of places and I really liked their work.”Alongside the feel of dystopic science fiction that attends Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro also detects a relationship with another emerging genre. Its readership has far exceeded that of his other novels, including The Remains of the Day, and is responsible, he says, for the noticeable numbers of younger people who come to events and readings: “I think one of the reasons is that it’s like a YA book before YA was a label. It’s not meant necessarily for young people, but it’s got a lot of what have now become the tropes of a YA novel: children at school together, jealousies and little power battles. I think that’s part of the reason it keeps finding a readership; it’s a YA novel that then expands into something else.”View image in fullscreenIshiguro collects the Nobel prize in Stockholm, 2017.Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/AFP/Getty ImagesHe is amusing and illuminating about the insulated feel to literary fiction prior to the 1990s: the novelists that featured alongside him on the celebrated inaugural list of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists in 1983 – Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes and Pat Barker among them – may have been a new generation, but they were still associated with those who had come immediately before. “I think, literally, the Sunday Times magazine that had our photograph actually said: Will these be the future William Goldings and Graham Greenes?” Ishiguro remembers.“It was a fairly compartmentalised bit of the publishing world, and we weren’t supposed to be part of this other stuff. Although we made less money and didn’t sell any books, we were rather proud of the fact that we were proper literature people and understood literary values, and we understood the value of each other’s work. It was that kind of coterie, and so the idea of science fiction was quite frowned on.” I ask him about a counter-example, fellow Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, who moved between genres with apparent freedom. He smiles in perhaps slightly wistful agreement: “Well, I suppose she didn’t give a shit. She went with her imagination, Margaret Atwood as well, more recently. I mean, these people, they didn’t care about such things.”But when the literary landscape started to change, Ishiguro was well placed, in terms of influence and temperament, to take advantage of the loosening of the stays. He had both read and created comics – he is ambivalent about the term “graphic novel” – since he was a child, and a lifelong passion for music and film gave him a different perspective on the idea of mixing styles and genres. His heroes were Bob Dylan, swapping folk protest music for rock’n’roll for country and western, or Miles Davis or even Picasso; and in film, he had the constantly shifting figure of Stanley Kubrick, with A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon all in his imaginative wheelhouse, to inspire him.Aren’t you a bit like that, too, I ask him: you moved from the Japanese setting of your early novels, to the country-house environment of The Remains of the Day, to the wild, dreamlike indeterminacy of The Unconsoled, after all. “Yes,” he replies, laughing, “I do it consciously because I’m emulating Bob Dylan and Stanley Kubrick.”View image in fullscreenCarey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in the 2010 film adaptation of Never Let Me Go.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyHaving recently seen Timothée Chalamet as Dylan in A Complete Unknown, he says he wonders how aware the singer was of the consternation he would cause when he chose to use a Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar; whether, even, there was a certain naivety at work. “I have no idea. I can’t get inside Dylan’s mind.” Certainly in terms of the differences between his own books, he says, “I was following something more internal. I wasn’t angling for someone to shout ‘Judas’.”It’s hard to imagine angry crowds challenging Ishiguro, who is unfailingly polite and self-effacing, and who has written so piercingly about the human tendency to become entangled in self-deception and contradiction. And his ability to see beneath surface motivations is also applied inward. Despite enthusiastically embracing the flow of genres and styles, Ishiguro is strikingly insistent on his own limitations. As we’re talking about his preference for first-person narratives, and his commitment to creating distinctive voices who will establish the tone and content of his novels, he makes a frank declaration. “You have to understand, I have to also play to my strengths and not to my weaknesses,” he says, and then, “I’ve never been a great writer of prose.”It’s quite difficult not to point out – and indeed, I do – that he won the Nobel prize and so, definitionally, he must be pretty great. “There are all kinds of good ways to write. One of them definitely is to write wonderful, virtuosic prose. There’s no doubt about it. Sometimes I read things and I marvel at the beauty of the actual prose.” And you don’t think that’s you? “Well, I can’t do it. It’s not out of choice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It is unsurprising to discover that he is currently at work on a novel set in the compartment of a train; you can almost already imagine how claustrophobic it will be, how obscurely significant its journey, how bewildered its passengers.And yet, he explains, it’s more lighthearted than that; something he wrote as an antidote to the pressures of travelling when he was promoting the 2022 film Living, for which he adapted Kurosawa’s film Ikiru, transplanting the action to 1950s London. Its protagonist, a bureaucrat who is terminally ill, was played by Bill Nighy, whom Ishiguro propositioned in the back of a taxi. “What happened was that Bill’s cab hadn’t turned up, so we gave him a lift to his cab, which was in the wrong place. So it was only a few minutes, but during that time, I said: ‘Bill, I know a part that will get you the best actor Oscar.’ And Lorna said: ‘Stop bothering Bill, he’s got lots of work.’”View image in fullscreenNighy’s interest, however, was piqued, and he did indeed get nominated for an Oscar, losing out to Brendan Fraser’s performance in The Whale. As the byzantine voting campaigns played out, Ishiguro began to get a sense that it wasn’t going to go to his man, and “I started to feel that I went and promised Bill this Oscar, and maybe he’s not going to get it. This is terrible!”Ishiguro is joking, but also not: he’s a man of noticeable intellectual fastidiousness, and one of the things he has been thinking about recently is his responsibilities as a writer. “I’ve become quite wary of the power to provoke emotions in readers – and that is the gift, if you like, that I’ve been praised for; the Nobel citation actually says something like ‘emotionally powerful’. And most of my writing life, that’s how I justified my job. I would say that you won’t learn much about history from me; go to a historian. However, a novelist can provide the emotional dimension; we offer some sort of emotional truth that is not there in nonfiction, however scrupulously well researched and documented.”View image in fullscreenBut over the last few years, he’s become increasingly worried that stirring up strong emotional responses has a far darker dimension, as we see in the way that political movements are able to harness citizens by appealing to their instincts rather than to evidence. “In the post-truth Trump era, there’s this relentless attack on accredited news media. It’s not just Trump: it’s a general atmosphere that whatever the evidence, if you don’t like it, you can just claim some alternative emotional truth for yourself. The whole status of what might be true has got very blurred lately. And so I feel that this power to actually cause emotions in people and create apparent emotional truths, is quite an odd thing.”That can only be intensified, he believes, by the increasing power of AI. “AI will become very good at manipulating emotions. I think we’re on the verge of that. At the moment we’re just thinking of AI crunching data or something. But very soon, AI will be able to figure out how you create certain kinds of emotions in people – anger, sadness, laughter.” AI is likely to have a significant effect on the creative arts, too, and Ishiguro has recently called for the British government to protect writers’ and artists’ work from the predations of tech corporations, describing the current era as a “fork-in-the-road moment”.So in a post-truth society aided by AI and algorithms, is it enough for fiction to pack an emotional punch? “If I was deploying that kind of gift for the service of a politician or for a large corporation that wanted to sell pharmaceuticals, you wouldn’t necessarily think it was commendable, you’d be highly suspicious of it. But if I’m doing it in the service of telling a story, that is considered to be something really valuable,” he says. “It’s something that increasingly makes me feel uneasy, because I haven’t been praised for my incredible style, or because in my fiction I exposed great injustices in the world. I’ve usually been praised for producing stuff that makes people cry.” He laughs. “They gave me a Nobel prize for it.”They did, and despite his concerns, the stories he tells will continue to be a source of great pleasure and importance to his readers. I ask him what his novels are to him. Are they now part of his psychology, his internal landscape? “In some ways, I feel they’re quite distant from me. The classic analogy is children: they were very close to you, and then they go their own way, but you feel bonded to them.” He considers. “They are my work, but I feel who I am is somewhere else.”Never Let Me Go: 20th Anniversary Edition by Kazuo Ishiguro is published by Faber on 13 March.

Instead – after realising that far from being left adrift by pop’s ever-changing styles, people were still interested in what he had to offer – he recorded another 37 albums (taking his total to more than 100), penned two bestselling autobiographies and a film score and carried on performing shows. Then last year he announced that he’d stop touring when he reaches 77, but he’ll be 76 this May and his packed live schedule doesn’t suggest a performer saying his last goodbyes.“There was a time when I thought, maybe it’s time to gracefully bow out,” the prog keyboard caped crusader explains, before his latest gig in Bradford. “But unfortunately I can’t. Music is the world to me. It’s just become blatantly obvious that I’m going to keep doing it until they put an epitaph on my gravestone reading: ‘It’s not fair. I’m not finished yet.’”Elkie Brooks knows exactly how he feels. The “Queen of British blues” (whose hits include Pearl’s a Singer and Lilac Wine) has had 13 Top 75 albums in total and is on the road again at 80, having performed a “farewell tour” when she was 40. “The promoter thought it might be a nice idea,” she chuckles. “I’ve been saying ‘farewell’ ever since.”View image in fullscreenThere’s Only One … Graham Nash.Photograph: Ralf LouisThe pair are not alone in rocking way past pensionable age. When rock’n’roll was considered a young person’s game, the young Mick Jagger once said: “I don’t wanna be singing Satisfaction when I’m 30,” but he still tours with the Rolling Stones at 81, while other venerable rockers treading the boards include Bob Dylan (83), Paul McCartney (82), Bruce Springsteen (75) and Mavis Staples (85). Folk legend Peggy Seeger is even touring this year aged 89. “It’s like a drug,” Wakeman explains. “Once it’s inside you, you can’t do without it.”The top stars don’t need the money but perform because it is rooted in their psyche and the demand is there. For Graham Nash, the Blackpool-born co-founder of the Hollies and supergroup Crosby, Stills and Nash, it’s about “the passion of music, and the energy I get from performing a new song to an audience. And when it’s a song I’ve sung a million times, I’m going to sing it with the same passion I had when I wrote it.”Seventy-five-year-old, California-born roots singerBonnie Raitthas spent 54 years on the road and says she can’t think of anything more fun. “When I started out, my heroes were the jazz, blues and classical people who played well into their 70s and 80s. But touring is like a travelling summer camp. Then every night I get to have a party with the audience.”I’m about to turn 83. I don’t have a vocal coach, I do 22 songs a night, 25 shows a tour. I’m singing as well as everGraham NashStars get hooked young. Wakeman first performed in childhood and Salford-born Brooks got the bug through singing in her uncle’s wedding band. Raitt watched audiences going “nuts” when her father sang in musicals such as Oklahoma! “None of us could believe this was his job,” she remembers. “So once I took to it and got to open for James Taylor and Muddy Waters there was no turning back.”Nash was a teenager when he entered a talent contest at Manchester Hippodrome with his pal Allan Clarke. “On that show were myself and Allan, who later formed the Hollies, Freddie Garrity, who became Freddie and the Dreamers, Ron Wycherley, who became Billy Fury, and Johnny and the Moondogs, who became the Beatles.” John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison had dashed for the last bus back to Liverpool by the time Nash and Clarke were declared the winners, but Nash says “2,000 people going crazy was the moment I knew I loved singing for people”.In the Hollies, he experienced the archetypal touring life: “Five of us in the back of a Transit, trying to get to sleep on the amps and drum cases. One night the doors flew open and I fell out of the van.” Aged 20, Wakeman lived similarly during his time in the Strawbs. He chuckles. “You couldn’t get my keyboard rig in a Transit now.”View image in fullscreen‘The trick is to pace yourself’ … Bonnie Raitt.Photograph: Scott Newton/Photo Courtesy of Austin PBS/Austin City Limits Photo by Scott NewtonJoining prog rock giants Yes in 1971 took his touring experiences to a very different level. “Staying on Sunset Strip with a whole bathroom and a shag pile carpet. I thought: ‘Bloody hell. I could move in here.’” But for older artists comfort is essential, rather than a luxury. “I wouldn’t want to be running around in a van trying to break into the business, loading the equipment and not getting decent hotels or food,” Raitt says. “The trick is to pace yourself.” She’s been touring for the last four years, and she does five months on the road out of every 12. “Enough to keep my band and crew working with me and to keep it fun.”In her youth, Brooks hated touring. “Just me in my little Mini with a little suitcase, driving everywhere, finding my own bed and breakfasts. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.” Now she tours the country with long gaps between gigs, pointing out that her vocal warmup, soundcheck and show still add up to more than three hours of exertion. “You wouldn’t ask Mo Farah to run the marathon again the next day, would you?” On show days, she avoids speaking to rest her voice. Raitt concurs: “One of the great gifts has been texting and email to save your voice during the day.”I never want to hear people walk out of a concert and go: He used to be really good.Rick WakemanIt also helps to stay fit. Brooks became a black belt in aikido when she was 50. Raitt does yoga and weights, hikes and takes a bike on tour. Wakeman merely walks his dogs. “We recently sold a house and in one of the outbuildings I came across this strange equipment,” he chuckles. “My wife said: ‘That’s the gym you built four years ago.’”As a member of Yes, he enjoyed excesses such as mocking a studio up like a farmyard, after which his keyboard had to go for repair because it was full of woodlice. “We’d come up with mad suggestions,” he chuckles. “‘Why don’t we travel by camel?!’ It was ridiculous, but it was the 70s.” His own excess stopped at drugs – “I’ve never popped a pill or smoked a joint” – but, he says, too much booze and cigarettes gave him a series of heart attacks by the age of 25, so he quit both. “I try not to think about all that,” he admits, more seriously, “because you ask yourself: ‘Should I still be here?’”“Honestly, to go on at the Newcastle Fiesta in 1964 or 65 you needed half a bottle of brandy,” argues Brooks, who admits that in Vinegar Joe, the band she formed with Robert Palmer in the 1970s, taking cocaine was like having a cup of coffee. “The thing was, we’d go on in Sheffield at 10pm, then we’d be doing a gig in the London Roundhouse at 3am. Two shows a night. I often wondered why the record company were taking cocaine but we were taking it just to stay bloody awake.” She stopped after meeting Trevor, her sound engineer husband of 47 years, who didn’t touch the stuff. “I wanted him to like me,” she says. She last drank alcohol before a show in 1979, when “a stomach upset meant I couldn’t keep anything down”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I realised they must be looking at me and seeing the same thing.” He still uses marijuana before shows, but says, “I’m about to turn 83. I don’t have a vocal coach, I do 22 songs a night, 25 shows a tour. Songs such as Military Madness or Immigration Man are still relevant and I’m singing as well as ever.”Some older stars carry scars from a lifetime on the road. Along with those heart attacks, Wakeman has had “double pleurisy, double pneumonia, arthritis, diabetes” and has to plunge his throbbing arthritic hands into an ice bath after every show. “I had some health problems in America this year and if it wasn’t for the show I’d have been in bed or calling the medics,” he reveals. “But when you go on stage, something takes over – adrenaline or whatever – and you feel great, until you’re back in the dressing room and you feel dreadful.”View image in fullscreenRick Wakeman … not planning to put his musical career on ice any time soon.Photograph: Lee Wilkinson MultimediaRaitt has had to postpone shows in recent years because of laryngitis or “wear and tear” and says her older musician pals joke about “who’s getting their knees done or who’s got tendonitis and so on. But in every city there are parks I love to go to, friends I love to see. And there are people who saw me in the 1970s who still come and see me now.”Younger fans discover veteran artists through parents, radio, magazines or streaming. It amazes Nash that he can pack a hall at his age and Wakeman appreciates every second in ways he could never have done when he was younger. What would make him stop performing? “If I couldn’t play like I want to. I never want to hear people walk out of a concert and go: ‘He used to be really good.’”Raitt wants to prove that she’s as “badass” as ever, but insists: “I’m not slowing down and I’m not going to stop until I can’t do it any more.” Brooks jokes that when she can no longer hit the high notes, “they’ll find a place for me in Tesco on the tills”. Nash saw Spanish guitar giant Andrés Segovia play when he was 92. “And he knocked me on my ass with the energy and brilliance of his performance. So I think: ‘Why not me?’”Perhaps there’s a life lesson here for all of us.

It’s a very Jack White kind of location: highly stylised, lovingly restored, but not entirely removed from its unglamorous surroundings.Lit in deep blue and strobing white, the colour palette of his solo career, White and his band have played tracks from his most recent album, the surprise-releasedNo Name, firsthanded out freeon white-label vinyl to unsuspecting shoppers at Third Man stores in Nashville, Detroit and London last summer (Third Man Records is White’s own imprint).It’s Rough on Rats (If You’re Asking)is a particularly rousing workout full of guitar shock and awe, from an album that has drawn relieved and delighted comparisons to White’s first band,the White Stripes.He’s also stormed throughBlack Math, from the White Stripes’ fourth album, 2003’sElephant, a disc recorded entirely on analogue gear at Toe Rag Studios in Homerton, Hackney, just a few miles down the road. Roaming across his discography, White and his band have just absolutely pulverisedBroken Boy Soldier– a 2006 cut fromthe Raconteurs, another White side outfit. It’s virtually unrecognisable in this early 70s acid-blues-rock version. Mini whirlpools of flailing bodies ebb and flow through it all.View image in fullscreen‘Johnny Guitar, from Hackney.’Photograph: David James SwansonWhite began this gig with an affirmation – that “everything that comes out of my mouth tonight will be the truth!” A little while later, though, he introduces himself as “Johnny Guitar, from Hackney”. You can’t help but grin. It’s 2025, the postwar world order is in grave flux, but we are on surprisingly steady ground here tonight. Kaleidoscopic garage-punk blues fills the air, and a mischievous artist who always delivers is playing fast and loose in more ways than one.Since White first started damaging speaker cones as half of the White Stripes in the early 00s, this Detroit-born Nashville transplant has enjoyed a relationship with fact perhaps best described as capricious. White Stripes drummer Meg White being his “sister” was a key foundational sleight of hand.But White doesn’t actually want audiences to believe every tall tale he tells. A keen student of legends past, he has long been drawn to obfuscation and myth-making – creative strategies that go back to Bob Dylan and beyond, to blues people and showfolk of all kinds.Rather, White wants us to believeinhim – in the intensity with which he curates his 360-degree aesthetic, and in the righteousness of the sound-world he has manifested from source materials brimming with raw, pre-modern resonance.Most of all, he wants us to be won over by the fervour with which all this is delivered. He stalks around in bone-white shoes, shaking his replenished mop of curly black hair (it was short and blue for a while). He faces off against the keys player, wears grooves in the stage. The band make everything heavy and roiling, then they pull out a blithe, garage-pop song such as the White Stripes’You’re Pretty Good Looking (For a Girl).The viral terrace-chant riff to Seven Nation Army causes the usually immune security guards to whip their heads aroundThere’s never been a bad set of musicians backing this showboating guitarist, but tonight’s trio – go-to drummer Patrick Keeler (the Raconteurs), bassist Dominic Davis (from the Buzzards, a previous White backing band) and Bobby Emmett, a relative new boy vamping on keys, who wears his shades all night – are a particularly taut lineup. White joins Emmett at his organ station for a keyboard-heavy, rococo romp through the White Stripes’Apple Blossom. Elsewhere, there are long, jam-like codas, near-constant segues; at one point, Iggy and the Stooges’ I Wanna Be Your Dog emerges out of the squall.The encore is nearly as long as the first set. At the end, the viral terrace-chant riff to Seven Nation Army causes the security guards – normally immune to whatever music is going on behind them – to whip their heads around. Somewhere in the middle isArchbishop Harold Holmes, an instant classic White tune from the new album, where truth, falsehood, patter and faith are remixed to a Led Zeppelin-like swinging chug.In the lyrics, White plays the itinerant preacher, coming to your town. It is, in part, a riff of hucksters ancient and modern, promising a cure for all ills. “And if you are suffering a strange sickness,” White hisses, “Or someone is blocking up all of your success, you need to see me right away so I can fix this.”The many parallels between religious and musical spectacle are well studied but tonight, White makes a very convincing salesman of rock’n’roll’s fundamentals. Under all the bluster, his belief in the power of pacy, sly electric blues to cure a lot of ills remains very persuasive. He really is the kind of showman who can make you feel better for a while.Watch the video for That’s How I’m Feeling by Jack White.Explore more on these topicsJack WhiteKitty Empire's artist of the weekThe White StripesThe RaconteursPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But as a judge once ruled, that’s just a role she performs. So who is the real Lorraine Kelly?BySimon HattenstoneSat 8 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTShareLorraine Kelly opens the front door with a huge smile. “You interviewed me, years ago, d’you remember?” Now she looks disappointed. “Ach, you don’t, do you?” Of course I remember. And she’s hardly changed. I’ve brought a photo of us on the GMTV sofa to show her. Back then, she’d just turned 40, was a staple of breakfast telly and was about to launch her own show; a household name, if not quite the mononym she is today. Now she’s 65, her show is still on ITV five mornings a week, and last year she was awarded a lifetime achievement Bafta. Oh, and she’s just reinvented herself as a bestselling novelist. The Island Swimmer, which reached No 2 in the Sunday Times hardback fiction charts, is about to come out in paperback.“So how’ve you been?” she asks. Kelly is the kind of person who you can pick up with where you left off a quarter of a century ago. She’s also the kind of person you feel you know, even when you don’t. Perhaps that’s been her great gift as a TV presenter. She was a good journalist as Scotland correspondent for TV-am but not outstanding. She’s a decent interviewer, but she won’t be remembered for her incisive interrogations or scoops. What she is brilliant at, though, is being Lorraine – warm, likable, nosy, funny, occasionally steely and sharp-tongued, sometimes potty-mouthed and always 100% herself. Which is why it was a shock in 2019 when she told a tax court that theLorraine on TV is different from the real Lorraine; that on television she performs the role “of a friendly, chatty and fun personality”.Her Buckinghamshire cottage, backing on to the Thames, is as you might expect – plush but super homely. Inside, there are big comfy sofas and piles of illustrated cushions (one is of a saintly looking Dolly Parton, another of Angus the dog is captioned: “This house is solely for the convenience of our border terrier”). Paintings of Angus, daughter Rosie and her husband of 33 years, Steve, adorn the walls. You can’t move for family photos – her grandparents dressed to the nines; her newlywed parents gorgeous at 18; Rosie with her baby daughter Billie. She dotes over the last photo. “See, I am a real Granny Smith!” she says. I look at her, puzzled. “That’s my married name! Steve is Steve Smith.” I’m already beginning to see the difference between Lorraine Kelly the TV show presenter and Lorraine Smith, wife, mum and grandma.Daytime TV regulars will know just how obsessed she is with being a grandmother. She can’t stop talking about it. Wow, I didn’t know you were a gran, I say. Now it’s her turn to give me a look. “You cheeky bugger. Well itisthe best thing that’s happened to me.”View image in fullscreenKelly with her daughter Rosie, 2021.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageThe Island Swimmer is pure fiction – a romantic mystery about a woman returning to her home in Orkney after leaving unexpectedly many years ago. And yet look at the photos, explore her home, and you can see bits of Kelly’s life in the book. The photo of her parents reminds me of the parents of the book’s protagonist Evie and her older sister Liv, with whom she has a troubled relationship. Kelly stops at another photograph – this time herself as a six-year-old with her baby brother Graham. “That’s me looking dead happy that my wee brother’s here! I look like a demon.” Blimey, I say, you look just how I imagine the young Liv would in her furious jealousy. She bursts out laughing.“Yessssssss!Hahahaha! It’s me as a child, oh my God!” It is exactly how she felt – he was the golden child, and she had been usurped. She admits it inspired the relationship between Evie and Liv. “My nose was put out of joint when he was born. But now I really like him. He just makes me laugh so much.” What did he think when he read the book? “He thought it was hilarious. It’s not his thing, but he enjoyed it.’’ In the book, Liv is accused of attempting to drown Evie. Did she ever try to drown Graham? “Oh no! It wasn’tthatbad.”Above the spices shelf in the kitchen, bottles of whisky are lined up like a military platoon. Which is her favourite? “I like Highland Park.” Highland Park gets an honourable mention in the book. “But Steve and I are not guzzlers of whisky,” she says. What’s their favourite tipple? “G&T,” she says. Funny how G&T is the drink of choice for a number of your characters, I say. “Well you have to write about what you know!”She and Steve used to work together as part of a small team when they were young – him as the cameraman, she as the journalist. “I knew right away as soon as he walked in the door. This wee fella from Dundee, I thought, yep that’s him, thanks very much! Then it took me a year, but I got him in the end.” Why did it take her so long? “It was a small working environment, there were only five of us. It was awkward.” What was special about him? “He’s the kindest man. He’s funny, he makes me laugh a lot, he puts up with me, he’s very stable.”On with the guided tour. There’s a whole shelf of books dedicated to the explorerErnest Shackleton. “I’mobsessedwith him. Always have been.” Kelly doesn’t like standing still. She moves as quickly as she talks. We stop at the magnets on her fridge – souvenirs from places she’s been to. One of her favourites is Twatt in Orkney. “I love that there’s a place called Twatt, as if you couldn’t love Orkney enough.” She moves on to a photo of Steve with Billie. “That’s my husband with baby Billie, when she was just born. But I don’t like to talk about Billie, as you know. Even though she is the best thingever.”Is it better than being a mum? “When you’re a mum you don’t know what you’re doing. Now you have all the love and you don’t have any fear.”Angus is barking at the door. “Come and say hello to Simon!” Angus trots in, yappy and affectionate. A second later Steve arrives back from a game ofpadel. He’s a stocky, handsome man in shorts and a Dundee United top. I ask him if he’s still working. “No!” When did he retire? “Oh God, years ago, 10 years ago or something.”Is it true that he watches all Kelly’s shows?“Yes, I  do.” Is he a tough critic? “Nooooo.”“Noooo!”Kelly echoes.“But it’s lovely that he watches.”Would he ever say, that was a bit shite? “No, I don’t criticise. I’ll just say, well, that was a weird guest! We watch together, don’t we, Angus?”Kelly: “You do, you’re very good. As does my mother.”Could he imagine Kelly retiring? “No. She never will. She’s a grafter. She’ll always do something.”“I do love the writing, though,” Kelly says. “It’s great if you can just get in the zone. I’ve been very lucky to get a chance to do it.” She’s aware that she might have remained unpublished if she hadn’t been well known.Kelly’s publicist had suggested we talk over lunch. I find interviewing while eating quite tricky – too convivial to ask difficult questions. Thankfully lunch consists of three Caramel bars and a Penguin. We head off into the lounge as Kelly tells me despite her 40 years in the business, she’s never counted her chickens.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianShe was born in the Gorbals, spent her early years in Glasgow and then moved to East Kilbride 20-odd miles away. Her father was a TV engineer and her mother a shop assistant; they were the talk of the tenement when they were the first family to get a colour television in the late 60s. “Everybody came to our living room to watch this Frank Sinatra concert.” She says her mum and dad seemed cooler than most of her friends’ parents, partly because they were younger and partly because they were into Dylan rather thanMantovani.She was a bright child – though not as bright as Graham. She would have been the first in the family to go to university, had she not got a job on the East Kilbride News at the age of 17. From the off, she loved it, and was treated as one of the lads in a predominantly male environment. In 1983, she joined BBC Scotland as a researcher, and a year later became TV-am’s Scotland correspondent. It was after covering the Lockerbie disaster for TV-am that she moved to London to present Good Morning Britain in 1989.Kelly says she has never lost the insecurity of a freelancer. She learned her lesson when she was sacked from GMTV while on maternity leave and replaced by Anthea Turner. Ever since, she’s always made sure she’s had something else on the go to fall back on, whether a radio show, newspaper columns or now, her novels.“Rosie was teeny-tiny. We’d just moved south, we had a mortgage, and it was scary to have that peeled away from you. I wasn’t a member of staff. I didn’t have any rights. I didn’t get maternity pay. I’d like to think we’re a bit more enlightened these days, and that wouldn’t happen.”Cow & Gate proved to be her unlikely saviour. The processed baby milk manufacturer agreed to sponsor a slot on GMTV so long as Kelly presented it. From there, she went on to host her own show, Lorraine Live, and since then hasn’t looked back.Oh dear God! I can’t believe what’s going on in America. It’s heartbreaking. It’s being torn apartIn 2010, she launched her current show, simply called Lorraine. It’s changed little in format over 15 years, though they recently decided to accentuate the positive because the world is so bleak. “We made a conscious decision that we’ll try to see the light.” She means light as opposed to dark, rather than trivial. As an example, she cites a recent guest, Auschwitz survivor Renee Salt. “At end of the interview she said: ‘I just want peace. If I’ve got anything to say to the world it’s for goodness sake please don’t let this happen again.’ It was extraordinary. For someone to still have faith in human kindness and peace, wow! That teaches you a lesson, doesn’t it?”Does she worry we could see a return to fascism, with the rise of right-wing populism? “Oh dear God! I can’t believe what’s going on in America. It’s heartbreaking. It’s being torn apart. I don’t see how we can go from Obama who, for all his faults, was a good man. How did we go from this articulate, compassionate, interesting person to what we’ve got now? I do spend a lot of my time being baffled. I do.”Trump has just announced his plan to turn Gaza into the Rivieraof the Middle East when we meet. “I mean …” For a moment even Kelly is lost for words. “It is easy to be depressed about everything. That’s why I think we have to get the joy where we can. I did think it was going to be OK in this country when Keir Starmer got in because I thought, OK he’s a bit dull, but we need grownups. And thenthe first thing he did was take away the heating allowance from pensioners. What are youdoing? Why would youdothat?”View image in fullscreenWith husband Steve Smith after being made a CBE.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThis is Kelly at her best – demolishing arguments or policies not with logic or facts, but with blunt rhetorical questions that reflect what so many of us think. “Then he said things are really shit and they’re going to get even shitter. We don’t want to hear that.” Now she’s on a roll. “We really don’t. There are ways of communicating that: ‘Things are bad, we know, but don’t worry because we’re all trying our very best to make it better.’ You don’t have to overpromise and underdeliver, but you could just go, ‘We’re going to do our best to make it better, stick with us!’ We don’t want to hear all that negativity right now. We just don’t. It might be me putting my head in the sand, but I don’t think it is. We just need a bit of hope.”And she’s still not done. “I don’t recognise this government as a Labour government. And he keeps mythologising Margaret Thatcher which is … scary.”Kelly has always said it the way she sees it – though perhaps not as uncompromisingly as this. I ask whether she was political as a kid. “Oh yes, I was in theAnti-Nazi Leagueand hadCNDbadges. When you’re young you should absolutely be saying, this isn’t good, this isn’t right.” Not just when you’re young, I say. She nods. “You should be shouting from the rooftops.” She looks at my plate of Caramels. “Go on, have a biscuit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I mean David Attenborough, who is holding the universe together!Why does she think the world has become so toxic? She stares at her mobile phone, and pokes it with her finger. “That!All the villages had idiots and extremists, but they were sitting there on their own. Now they’ve found their kindred spirits on thisbloodything.” She’s talking even faster and her voice is getting louder. “Jesus Christ,David Attenboroughgets people being shitty to him! I meanDavid Attenborough, who is holding the universe together! People shout at him – climate change deniers, hunters have a go at him. And you think, well if they’re having a go at him, what’s the point?”People sometimes think of you as soft and mumsy, I say. “The mad fools! Hehehehe!” But you’re pretty tough? “I can be. Especially if I’m defending somebody or something that I believe in.” Such as? “When people are unkind. When I was at school there was this lovely person who was our bus driver, bravest person I’ve met in my life. Her name was Jane. She used to be a chap and was now a trans woman. Jane got people speaking shit to her, saying offensive things. I remember saying to somebody, ‘Shut your face, don’t be so bloody rude.’”But, even then, she says people were more open-minded than they appear to be now. “We were much more tolerant. Again, it’s social media giving nutters a voice. It makes no sense to me. I know a fair few people who are trans and they just want to get on with their lives. I don’t think trans people should have to come on the television, or be part of the debate, to justify their existence. I just think everyone has to be a bit more tolerant. That’s why I put a trans person in my book.”The elderly Freya is the wise, generous heart of The Island Swimmer. “Freya being trans is probably the least interesting thing about her. I was keen to show she’s just Freya. I love her. She’s just a lovely, lovely person.” It’s touching how she talks about her characters as if they are friends – or enemies. Just as she swoons over Freya, she rages over Evie’s boyfriend, the controlling Jeremy. “He’s like all the horrible people I’ve met in my life distilled into one.” Why did she call him Jeremy? “It’s the kind of name, with apologies to all the Jeremies in the world, you think: oh, he’s going to be a knob.”She looks down at Angus, adoringly. “Like Angus is a great name; a strong name. Apologies to everyone who can’t help that their mammy called them Jeremy.” Kelly has just finished writing her second novel, and is currently editing it. She tells me proudly that she’s now signed a deal for a third and fourth.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianEarlier this year, she hit out at “toxic people in telly” – particularly men. In an interview with the Mirror, she said: “The behaviour of Gregg Wallace and other people that we’ve seen, should it come about as all true, is appalling.” She talked about the abuse of power and said that TV bosses who enabled this behaviour were as much to blame as the perpetrators. Last year, she said some male presenters lacked “generosity”. Interestingly, she singled out former fellow morning TV star Phillip Schofield as one who was generous.Schofield resigned from ITV in 2023and was dropped by his talent agency after admitting to an “unwise, but not illegal” affair with a younger colleague. Today, she says: “I think Phillip was awful daft. I think he made a lot of choices he shouldn’t have. But all I can go by is what it was like to work with him, and it was easy. He was lovely, and I think it’s really sad.”As I get older, I want to do other things. I’ve been doing this for 40 years, working my arse offKelly has recently been under attack herself. She has been criticised on social media for not presenting her show five days a week.An X account called LorraineKWatchkeeps track of her absences. At the end of last year, the account, which has 25,000 followers, concluded that she had only hosted 59.7% of the episodes. This year she has presented 67.5% at the time of writing. I thought she might laugh it off, but she doesn’t. “It’s really hurtful actually. It really is. I’ve not spoken about it before. I’m a grafter and I work really hard and I’ve had to take Fridays off for the past year. I just thought it was weird to care so much.” Why was she taking time off? “Initially, it was for my mum who has been ill. And it sort of brings you into line with everyone else because if you look at This Morning, everybody else does four days. And as I’m getting older, I want to do other things, more writing, all of that. Mate, I’ve been doing this for 40 years, working my arse off.”I guess the difference is that your show is called Lorraine, I say. “I get that. I get that 100% because This Morning is just called This Morning and GMB is just GMB.” But she says it does feel horribly personal. “Maybe it just started off as a wee joke, but it’s the way that everyone piles on. It starts off as a wee tiny thing and it gets bigger and bigger. I find it really sad.”We talk about the highs. There have been so many, she says. And this is when you really see that Kelly is one of life’s great enthusiasts – a professional fangirl. She talks about meeting Star Trek heroes Leonard Nimoy (“Mr Spock was my first crush!”) and William Shatner; interviewing real-life space hero Buzz Aldrin; being sent to San Francisco for a zero-gravity flight for her 60th birthday; travelling to America on the QE2 with the Cure (“They were delightful – so polite and cute”).She has been groundbreaking in normalising conversation about once-taboo topics such as miscarriage and menopause. In 2017, Kelly revealed that menopause had left her feeling “flat and joyless”. She only shared her experience because at the time she couldn’t find a famous guest willing to talk about it.Perhaps the thing we remember most from her show are the spontaneous Lorraine moments, often when doing live links with the GMB show – she toldEsther McVey she didn’t remember her, after the Conservative MPsaid they used to work together;tore a strip off Jennifer Arcuri, the businesswoman who had an affair with Boris Johnson, for saying nothing in her interview (“What’s the point in you coming on and not saying anything?”). In 2023, she voiced surprise at Nigel Farage’s relative youth (“Is he only 59? I thought he was a helluva lot older than that. That’s astonishing. It just shows you get the face you deserve!”)I ask about the lows. She struggles to think of any. The few there have been tend to be personal. “I had a miscarriage, which was horrible, and I went back to work too fast. That’s the thing I do. I plough on. But lows, not really.” She says she would love to have had more children.View image in fullscreenHair and makeup by Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using makeup by Mario and hair by Sam McKnight.Photograph: Harry Borden/The GuardianIn 2019, she took HMRC to court after receiving a £1.2m tax bill. The battle was about whether she was an employee or a freelancer, and whether she appeared as a performer or herself. Kelly won the case, but for the first time she got a drubbing in the press. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled Lorraine “presents a persona of herself” so could be described as a “theatrical artist”, meaning payments to an agent were allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: “For the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public ‘Lorraine Kelly’; she may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies.” It made Kelly sound like a fake, and her USP had always been authenticity.Was that a low? “Yes,” she winces. “That was horrible. But we had no choice. We took them to a tribunal because what they were trying to do was unfair. They were trying to say that I was a member of staff when I’m a freelance, so they sent me a massive tax bill.”She says it felt like a David and Goliath battle against HMRC. “The thing that has negated some of the stress and angst and bad publicity is that it has helped so many people – not just people in the media or famous people, but, say, hairdressers and beauticians who had been treated as staff by HMRC but were actually freelancers.” How did it affect her? “Your peace of mind goes.”To have argued that Lorraine is a character … I begin to say. She answers before I finish as she tends to do when she’s on the defensive. “Yes, that was weird. But that was the only way we could do it.” A lot of people took the piss out of you, I say. “Oh, they did but that’s OK.” Does she genuinely think that Lorraine is a character? Yes and no, she says. “I am a version of me on the telly. And yes, I’m kind of like that but I’m a lot more open, a lot more sweary, and I’m not that person. There’s nobody that goes on television who is themselves.” She says she’s quieter in real life; less sociable. “I am not the life and soul of the party. My husband is. I’m the first one there and the first to leave. I’m at my happiest with people I trust and know, watching something on the telly and having a nice meal.”What really hurt about the court case, she says, was people thinking she’s a tax dodger. “I’ll show you my tax returns. I pay my taxes on time every year, of course I do.” She looks at my plate. “Have another biscuit.”I ask Kelly if Steve was right when he said she’d never give up work. “I would do the telly as long as people want me to do it.” Is she enjoying getting older? “Yes!” Is her brown hair natural? “Look, I’ve got grey.” Hardly any. “I know, but my mum and granny were the same, then it just went white. Like Helen Mirren. She’s beautiful, but she still looks like a normal human being. She’s not got the boiled-egg face. I don’t like that. I’ve not had anything done. I’m too scared, and I don’t want to. I want to look normal, I want to look like me.” Is there any pressure to have work done? “Not in the job I do, no. I was never hired for my looks!” She hoots with delight.Well you say that, but you have been hailed as a sex symbol. “Hahhaha! By whom? Blind people?” Actually, it was the Daily Mail, among others. “Well it’s very kind, I’ll take that all day long.” She’s also been called a gay icon. “I’ll take that all day long, too.” And she’s been labelled the nation’s naughty mum. “I didn’t know that. I’ll take that too.” What title is she going for next? She thinks. “Novelist of the year? No! I couldn’t possibly!”She’s just delighted to still be working, still be relevant, and still be finding new things to do. “I love this stage of my life. Especially with the wee one.” She grins. “But I don’t mention her. I like to keep that quiet!”The Island Swimmer by Lorraine Kelly is published by Orion in paperback on 13 March.

In her work, which combines performance with drawing and installation, she highlights the undervalued aspects of women’s lives, often with reference to food and cooking. In 1995, she founded Daily Life Ltd to make art that “explores and celebrates everyday life and human behaviour”. Her artworkAn Edible Family in a Mobile Home, originally created in 1976 and featuring a family composed of cakes, biscuits and meringues, is at theWhitworth, Manchester, until 20 April. Baker lives and works in London.View image in fullscreen1.BookWifedom by Anna FunderI listened to this on Audible, which is my favourite thing to do when I’m painting and drawing and buzzing about. It tells the story of George Orwell’s wife, Eileen O’Shaughnessy. Funder expresses her passion for Orwell, but in all the biographies written about him, by men, she found scarcely a mention of his wife. Eileen was so fundamentally a part of his work and his life. It’s such a revelation how hard their existence was, and how much she supported him. It’s anastonishing account, moving, tragic but also fascinating. Really worth reading.2.PlaceThe Mall Wood Green, London N22View image in fullscreen‘Architecturally grim but I have enormous affection for it’: The Mall Wood Green, north London.Photograph: Matthew Chattle/AlamyI am, I would say, a naturally gifted shopper. I just love shopping and I get very excited in supermarkets and covered markets. It’s shopping for anything – art materials or kitchen utensils or whatever. We moved to Wood Green a few years ago and I’ve started going to this shopping centre much more. Architecturally it looks pretty grim but I have enormous affection for it. A few years ago they set up one of these NHS health assessment centres inside [the mall], which is so convenient. My favourite bit is the kitchenware shop [Karaca]; the guy who runs it is rather assertive that everything they stock is the best.3.GalleryNational Gallery, LondonWC2NView image in fullscreenChrist and the Woman of Samaria by Duccio Maestà, from Siena – The Rise of Painting 1300-1350, at the National Gallery, London until 22 June.Photograph: Duccio/Museo Nacional Thyssen- Bornemisza, MadridThe National Gallery has to be the tops, really. As an art student, I very frequently went in there and copied paintings, particularly Cezanne’sLes Grandes Baigneuses. What with life and family, I find it really difficult to get to galleries, and I’ve had so much surgery over the years that I live a lot online – on the National Gallery website you can access the catalogue and look at paintings really close up. But I’m determined to spend more time in the actual gallery. They’ve got a new show on aboutSienese paintingthat I’m really looking forward to.View image in fullscreen4.PodcastThe Week in ArtMy passion is painting and sculpture, truly, but I was very disillusioned with that back in the early 70s: it was so elitist and male. So I got into performance art, which was extraordinarily liberating. Now, through all these brilliant podcasts, I’m learning more about the visual arts.The Week in Artis absolutely my favourite. The host Ben Luke has got such a wonderful voice. The last episode I listened to was aboutAnselm Kiefer. I used to be very passionate about his work, and the extremely interesting conversation with the curator reignited my enthusiasm. For a disabled person, the online world is extraordinarily enriching.5.TheatreSh!t Theatre: Or What’s Left of UsView image in fullscreen‘Really so moving’: Sh!t Theatre: Or What’s Left of Us, performed by Rebecca Biscuit and Louise Mothersole at the Soho theatre, London.Photograph: PR HandoutSh!t Theatre should be on the NHS. They are an incredibly talented company, clever and witty but also quite political, and they take on unusual subject matter. The director they worked with,Adam Brace, died suddenly in 2023, so this latest show is, in a very helpful, thoughtful way, dealing with grief. It’s about their visit to a folk club in Leeds to do research, and all the people they meet there, and it’s interspersed with singing. It was really so moving.

Though it gestured at being a serious thriller – a sort of Gone Girl for cable – the film, based on the 2017 novel by Darcey Bell, ultimately devolved into ridiculousness, untethered from logic yet with plenty of road for more twists. Lively’s Emily Nelson, an archly manipulative psychopath straight out of a Justin Baldoni lawsuit, remains her best work since Gossip Girl. And most pertinent to Amazon MGM studios, the film found post-theatrical success on streaming, becoming a modern camp classic during the pandemic.The Electric State review – Millie Bobby Brown’s bot war yarn is soulless digital contentRead moreBut Feig, by his own admission at theSXSWfilm festival on Friday evening, is wary of sequels, and for good reason – rarely does lightning strike twice, especially in suburban Connecticut. A Simple Favor ended in settled-enough fashion, with (spoiler alert) Emily in prison for the murder of her secret identical twin sister and attempted murder of her husband, with Kendrick’s Stephanie, a successful mommy vlogger, and their hapless mutual ex Sean (Henry Golding) living in peace in San Diego.Feig’s reservations were warranted: Another Simple Favor, again written by Jessica Sharzer along with Laeta Kalogridis, unsurprisingly does not match the intoxicating magic of the original, which feinted at something sinister and twisted in the facades of motherhood before plunging off the deep end. It is neither suspenseful nor thrilling, but something else: a movie so confidently ridiculous, so stylishly absurd and so self-aware of its mandate for fun that you can’t help but enjoy it, reasonable wariness – and all reason, really – be damned.Another Simple Favor picks up where the first one left off, in that it begins in its latent camp sensibilities and barrels full-force into unabashed silliness. As with the original, Kendrick’s ever-peppy and self-effacing Stephanie opens the proceedings in medias res, vlogging (or, because it’s 2025, livestreaming) from house arrest in Italy. Why? How? She recaps for her followers: she has spent the intervening years baking zucchini bread and solving Reddit’s best mysteries with haunting results, once again revealed in pulpy flashbacks. Her fellow Connecticut moms, played by Kelly McCormack, Aparna Nancherla and Andrew Rannells, are as bitchy as ever. And Emily, now the “faceless blond” of Stephanie’s under-selling true-crime memoir, is walking free, sprung from prison by the generosity of her mysterious new fiance, an Italian hunk/mob heir named, yes, Dante (Michele Morrone).Emily crashes Stephanie’s sparsely attended book reading, slo-mo strut and jumpsuit-chic outfit on lock, with a request that’s less another simple favor than a massive, confounding ask: be her maid of honor at her lavish wedding in Capri? Stephanie accepts, which is the first sign that this movie will be uncovering new shades of the word “ludicrous” at every turn. From the minute Emily’s private jet takes flight, Another Simple Favor abandons any pretense of seriousness or grounding – in fact, the first movie’s deranged plot twists serve as the bread and butter of this sequel’s many in-jokes, the characters quick to point out the whole perverse web of backstabbing deceit as it grows ever more complex and unhinged.Italian mob weddings being what they are, the blood begins to spill almost as soon as the guests arrive. Golding’s Sean is there, now more surly and pathetic (and naked – no one can ever accuse Another Simple Favor of not knowing its audience), as well as Emily’s beloved son Nicky (Ian Ho), who is 10 going on 20 with some understandable mood issues. So, too, is Dante’s unimpressed mob boss mother (Elena Sofia Ricci), Stephanie’s incompetent book agent Vicky (Broadway’s Alex Newell), Emily’s senile mother (Elizabeth Perkins, taking over for Jean Smart) and her long-lost loony aunt Linda (Allison Janney), rounding out a cast of one-dimensional characters who test one’s patience but ultimately do not distract from the mission of smooth-brained amusement. (Janney, especially, can do a lot with a little.)Another Simple Favor drops threads and drags on, but survives on its self-assured baseline pleasures: the gorgeous yet nonsensical setting of Capri, the lush wonders of Renée Ehrlich Kalfus’s costume design (Lively once again sports a murderers’ row of completely impractical suits) and the two leads’ perfectly calibrated banter, at once winking and convincing. Lively, especially, shines in her grand return performance amid the widely scrutinized legal battle surroundingIt Ends with Us. The slippery Emily is a particular pitch of bemused psycho that could easily tip into cartoonish or smug, and she holds it. Kendrick’s comic timing, meanwhile, remains sharp as a tack. Without both, the whole pageant would collapse.And it nearly does. Feig’s crisp direction notwithstanding, Another Simple Favor attempts some plot twists better left unsaid and forgotten. But even overstaying its welcome at two hours, soaring past the boundaries of taste and reaching the astral plane of should-be offensive absurdity cannot derail the experience of watching these toxic frenemies back in action. It may not be the next chapter we needed, but more money-mandated sequels could stand to have this little self-seriousness.Another Simple Favor is screening at the SXSW film festival and will be available on Amazon Prime Video on 1 MayExplore more on these topicsSXSWFirst look reviewBlake LivelyPaul FeigAnna KendrickComedy filmsFestivalsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Virginia Feito reveals the real-life inspiration for her shocking story of a psychopathic Victorian nannySat 8 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 03.55 ESTShareWhatever people make of Virginia Feito’s new book, a scabrous, morbidly funny murder ballad, they can’t say they weren’t warned. Thanks to several instances of real and imagined violence to men, women, children and babies – not to mention a deer, a duck and three whippets – Victorian Psycho lives up to its name, and to the first sentence of its prologue: “Death everywhere.”“It’s not like a surprising twist that builds slowly over the pages,” the 36-year-old Spanish writer says of her second novel. “You know where we’re going from the very start.”Feito’s debut,Mrs March– which explored a wealthy, Upper East Side woman’s descent into suffocating paranoia – earned comparisons to Patricia Highsmith and Daphne du Maurier. Like its predecessor, Victorian Psycho is written in English and has already been snapped up for ascreen adaptation. But it is, quite deliberately, a radically different book.The novel, whose title is a hat-tip to  both Bret Easton Ellis and the 19th-century literature Feito grew up on, chronicles the homicidal thoughts and deeds of Winifred Notty, a governess who arrives at a remote country house in Yorkshire with rather more than the imparting of a traditional education in mind.“Ever since I was little, I’ve loved gothic horror and I think there’s a lot in the children’s literature that I was reading from a very young age, likeThe Secret Garden,” says Feito in the flawless English that is the product of her time in an American school in Paris and a British school in Madrid. “That book starts with a cholera epidemic that’s killed everyone and Mary is alone in her bungalow in India, which is the most gothic thing I’ve ever read. And then there’s a bit of gothic in Roald Dahl, who is a huge inspiration – especially his short stories.”Feito also loved the Brontës and Dickens, but with Victorian Psycho, she says, she wanted to creep into the darker recesses of the 19th century. So parts of the book are inspired by the crimes of killers such asConstance Kent, who slit the throat of her half-brother and threw his body down a privy, andAmelia Dyer, the “baby farmer” thought to have murdered as many as 400 infants placed in her care.If her debut was a deeply disturbing satire on social conventions, Feito turns up the volume in the new novel, “because it was fun, but also because they did drip belladonna into their eyeballs!” (A poisonous Victorian beauty hack to make your pupils dilate.)“It’s not that I was limiting myself with Mrs March, but this one felt like it had to be arage,” says Feito. She notes that the new book’s publication comes at a time when issues of female anger and physicality are being explored in films such asTitaneandThe Substance. Victorian Psycho plays with the era’s demure Angel in the House stereotypes by giving the reader a protagonist without inhibitions, filters or limits.“I guess I was kind of poking at that: what if the evil psychopath were female this time?” she says. “What does that mean? And will readers justify her because she’s female?” Feito wants to see how far she can push things before the reader begins to lose sympathy for the abused and vengeful Notty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But then I’m like: Eurrgh! Why are we so morbid?Today’s culture, she argues, seems to have lost its fear of psychopaths, with some – such as TV serial killer Dexter Morgan – even moving from antihero to hero. “You root for them because you secretly want them to get revenge against the people who wronged them,” says Feito. “I wanted to avoid that. Sure, you can feel empathy because Winifred has had an awful childhood, but I’m very explicit about the violence she’s committing against children.”All of which raises a question: isn’t she feeding the reader’s appetite for Grand Guignol and depravity – only to reproach them for gobbling up all the gore? Feito laughs and pretends to scold one of her readers: “You love it, you sick fuck!” But she admits she is equally guilty. “I watch loads of true crime, freaking out over shows likeMonster by Ryan Murphy. It’s fun and I sit there cheering them on. But then I’m like: ‘Eurrgh! What’s wrong with us? Why are we so morbid? These are real people who died.’”Feito, who studied English and drama at Queen Mary University in London, says it was always inevitable that she would write in English rather than Spanish. The four years she spent at the American school when the family moved to Paris for her father’s work proved formative. “I was reading and writing and speaking at school and watching television in English because I didn’t understand French very well,” she says. “So I clung to English and I found that I took to it really, really well. You can almost add an ‘-ing’ to anything and it’ll exist, probably. And if not, nobody will be mad. It’s so much more playful.”Femgore: why romcoms are out in women’s fiction – and cannibalism is inRead moreThese days Feito says she is intimidated by her native tongue and doesn’t understand its rules very well. She was delighted to turn down the offer of translating Mrs March into Spanish herself – “I couldn’t; I would have destroyed it” – and, besides, writing in English also offers the opportunity for some entertaining back and forth with her translator, Gemma Rovira. “It’s always fun to get these emails, like: ‘When you’re slashing the baby’s neck, is it penetrating the skin or is it going around it?’”More seriously, it allows Feito to read her own work from a distance. “It transforms it. It’s another animal, so to speak,” she says. “I see myself in there, but then there are other things that make me sound way smarter, which I appreciate very deeply.”With Mrs March being developed for the screen by Elisabeth Moss, and a film of Victorian Psycho, starring Margaret Qualley, also on the way, she has no regrets about her decision to leave a job in advertising a few years ago to write full time. Now she is thinking about her third novel, listening out for another arresting narrator.It’s an ode to the Victorian literature that I love so much, but it’s also subverting it“When I started Mrs March, I had a few other ideas that were much more developed and I knew where they were going,” she says. “But I chose Mrs March because of the voice.” It was the same with Winifred. “It came to me in the middle of the night and it’s at the beginning of the book, where she says, ‘My breasts jiggling in my corset.’” With that one line, Feito had her protagonist and knew exactly who she was. Given Victorian Psycho’s body count, carnage and general air of barely corseted ultraviolence, does she see it as a feminist, revisionist take on the 19th-century novel? As a parody? A homage?Mrs March by Virginia Feito review – a brilliant psychological studyRead more“I think it’s all those things,” Feito says. “It’s an ode to the Victorian literature that I love so much but it’s also subverting it. To be fair, there was a lot of death and violence and the grotesque in Dickens. But he ended it in a hopeful way and he didn’t delve into the most graphic aspects because readers weren’t really ready. But I think we’re ready now.”Victorian Psycho is published by 4th Estate.To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

She is the sum of the data that her handheld scanner feeds back into the system. If the algorithm decrees it, she is rewarded for efficiency (a bar of chocolate from her callow, barely post-adolescent manager). If she falls behind, she’s scolded by someone oblivious of (and indifferent to) the fact that Aurora is struggling on several levels: the unexpected cost of repairing her phone has wiped out her food budget for the month; the work is soul-destroying and repetitive. But most of all, she’s isolated, disconnected and painfully lonely.This terrific English-language feature debut from Portuguese-born, Scotland-based director Laura Carreira makes a satisfying companion piece to Ken Loach’sSorry We Missed You. Both films tackle the human cost of the convenience we take for granted (On Fallingalso shares a production company, Sixteen Films, with Loach). But Carreira brings something else to the mix: there’s a tactile quality to her humanist vision.It’s not just about the grinding mechanics of the job, but also Aurora’s yearning for intimacy with another human being. The most poignant scenes capture charged, fleeting moments of physical contact. Aurora tentatively rests her head on the shoulder of her new flatmate Kris (Piotr Sikora). There’s a flash of awkwardness, then both retreat into the reassuring anonymity of their phone screens. Later, a single shot shows Aurora’s hand resting on the arm of a stranger who helps her. It’s heartbreaking – a moment that encapsulates Aurora’s aching emptiness and hunger for connection.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for On Falling.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

Elsewhere, Jonathan Dove’s rousing new community opera puts down firm rootsFiona MaddocksSat 8 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Mar 2025 08.37 ESTShareDisrupt the cycle of life at your peril. Two operas written a century apart, performed last week, shout this imperative. Their perspectives appear at once contrary and unanimous. Leoš Janáček’sThe Makropulos Affair(1926), staged by Scottish Opera, examines the human instinct to outwit death, via the unlikely tale of a 337-year old woman in thrall to an immortal elixir. A world premiere by Jonathan Dove,Uprising, the latest in Glyndebourne’s community opera series, addresses the survival of the planet itself, threatened by humanity’s habit of looking away.The chance to encounter Janáček’s penultimate opera, last seen in Scotland in 2012,needs to be grabbed. Slow to be appreciated, it remains a relative rarity compared withJenůfaandKáťa Kabanová. This co-production with Welsh National Opera – new in Cardiffin 2022– is as good as it gets, with a characterful cast superbly directed by Olivia Fuchs, and conducted with perception and fervour by Martyn Brabbins. The Irish soprano Orla Boylan sings the mysteriously ageless Emilia Marty, in fact born Elina Makropulos more than three centuries earlier. Now on her umpteenth reinvention and name change, Marty is both an alluring grande dame and a figure of pity, especially here in Boylan’s exemplary reading.Makropulos, with an incomprehensible legal wrangle at its heart, can be thought chilly. These forces, with impassioned playing by the Orchestra of Scottish Opera, prove otherwise.Janáček’s angular, pulsating score moves restlessly, beguiling in its whispered use of viola d’amore, toy drum, clippety percussion and ethereal string harmonics as the life-weary Marty is at last able to die. The voluptuous music of the final act comes as an urgent release, pent-up lyricism and poignancy surging forth. The swift-moving Czech text, based on a 1922 play by Karel Čapek, is now sung in English – in this opera, a wise decision. Any Czech music expert will tell you, rightly, that Janáček’s music is inseparable from the accents and rhythms of his native language. David Pountney’s crisp translation cleverly mirrors those sounds where possible, freeing the quick exchanges to sound like conversational banter (the English surtitles were hardly required, so clear was the cast’s delivery).The environmental message, simply told, is vital, but the impact on so many young performers surely counts for yet moreOne other change also helped. A between-scenes attempt in this production to explain the plot by addressing the audience direct has been ditched. Instead, we hear a crackly 78 rpm on a horned gramophone play part of an unfinished Janáček symphony composed at the same period (pre-recorded by the Orchestra ofScottish Operaand then sonically manipulated). It suited the spirit of this 1920s, Hollywood glamour-style production, elegantly designed by Nicola Turner and team. The Norwegian tenor Thorbjørn Gulbrandsøy, making his Scottish Opera debut as Albert Gregor (stepping in for an indisposed Ryan Capozzo), had mastered the English text, presumably at speed. Henry Waddington, Mark Le Brocq, Catriona Hewitson, Roland Wood, Michael Lafferty and Alasdair Elliott were strikingly characterised in the numerous ensemble roles. With only four performances in total in Glasgow and Edinburgh, this production deserves more outings.Dove’sUprising, to a libretto by April De Angelis (who collaborated with Dove on the highly successfulFlight), takes a global view of climate crisis from a teenager’s vantage point. A schoolgirl, Lola (the Welsh soprano Ffion Edwards, exuberant and intense), begins a solo school strike. Classmates first mock and bully, then join her. They become part of an international youth movement in which Greta Thunberg and eight other real-life activists make fictional appearances.Conflict hits home. Lola’s mother (mezzo-soprano Madeleine Shaw, powerful and expressive), working for the enemy developers, arrives in the forest, in hard hat and hi-vis jacket, to fell the very trees her daughter is fighting to save. Tensions and sadnesses are acknowledged but not laboured, with enough wit to avoid piousness. A final reconciliation between mother and daughter remains uneasy and painful.View image in fullscreenFfion Edwards, centre, and company in Uprising: ‘unforgettable’.Photograph: Richard Hubert Smith/ Glyndebourne Productions LtdUprising, persuasively conducted by Andrew Gourlay, directed by Sinéad O’Neill, is the latest in Glyndebourne’s community opera series, now central to the company’s year-round activities. The first,in 1990 on Hastings Pier, was also by Dove, who has a rare gift for embracing, with absolute certainty, a range of talents and ages, mixing amateurs and professionals on stage and in the orchestra. His own brand of minimalism is crafted with subtle orchestral colour, soaring vocal lines and anthemic choruses. A cast of six performed with more than 100 participants from 33 school and colleges in the Sussex region.Among many uplifting choruses, a hymn to trees in all their variety was especially affecting, names of species recited like poetry. The opera ends with rewilding and hope, but no utopia. The environmental message, simply told, is vital, but the impact on so many young performers surely counts for yet more. AGlyndebournesupporter, the late Jim Potter, commissionedUprisingin 2020 on learning of his terminal illness. He lived to hear Dove perform some of the finished score. Glyndebourne’s community operas, always unforgettable, attract a different crowd from the illustrious summer festival. Parents, grandparents, siblings are there for the first time, or returning. This is their Glyndebourne too. Opera audiences need nurturing. As a form of propagation, it’s hard to beat.Star ratings (out of five)The Makropulos Affair★★★★★Uprising★★★★Uprisingwill be semi-staged at Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden, on15 & 16 March, followed by concert performances at Usher Hall, Edinburgh and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on28 & 29 March respectivelyExplore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverOperaGlyndebourneScottish OperaJonathan Dovelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It was 1998 and they had told their daughter – who was just emerging from a four-month bout of chronic fatigue – that it was time for bed. Half an hour later, her mother went to check on her and found her still dressed and standing in her bedroom doorway. Asked why, her daughter replied: “I’m doing my routine.”Middleton – who would grow up to become an actor known for her performances in Mank and Downton Abbey – had developed obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a condition that affects 2% of the global population, and left her convinced that if she didn’t complete certain rituals, something terrible would happen: her parents would die, the house would burn down or she would vomit (one of her greatest fears). Her compulsions entailed silently tapping and counting to eight at specific points around the house: doorknobs, doorframes, the corners of rooms, the edges of mirrors.In Scorpions, Middleton lays out what it is like to live with OCD, skilfully and often poetically articulating the mental distress that comes with the condition. The scorpions of the title are how she characterises the illness, creatures that “wield their own special power over my brain, shaping the architecture and rhythm of my thoughts … Small armoured bodies scuttle along an intricate web of neural pathways, disturbing the delicate flow of logical thought.”We are not short of books about OCD:Rose Cartwright’s Pure,Bryony Gordon’s Mad GirlandDavid Adam’s The Man Who Couldn’t Stop. Middleton’s is a worthy addition to the roll call, throwing more light on the impulses and cycles of thought that many people with OCD strive to keep secret out of fear of judgment.Social niceties go out the window, and friendships, particularly new ones, are easily destroyedMiddleton has had OCD for 30 years and, in that time, public understanding has increased. But with that, she warns, has come a tendency to simplify and trivialise the illness. Years ago, she recalls receiving a coffee mug as a Christmas present with the words OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE emblazoned on it in pink letters. “It is hard to imagine a line of gift items with ANOREXIA or PTSD boldly stamped across them for all to see,” Middleton writes. “So why is OCD continually used as shorthand for lighthearted craziness?”There is nothing cute or whimsical about Middleton’s absolute certainty that she has left her front door open after leaving the house, despite having gone back to check multiple times, or her mortal fear of being around people she suspects – usually on scant evidence – may be coming down with a virus. When this happens, social niceties go out the window, and friendships, particularly new ones, are easily destroyed. Middleton describes a typical conversation between her and the scorpions in the dead of night, a time when her senses are heightened and fears easily stoked. “Trust us, we can help you,” they say as she becomes convinced she is going to throw up. “All you have to do is count. It’s so simple. We’ll do the rest.”As a memoir, Scorpions is unusual in telling a strikingly personal story while revealing comparatively little of its author’s everyday life. This is clearly deliberate: the book is no celebrity tell-all, and readers hoping for glimpses of Middleton’s life as an actor will find precious few. What they will get, however, is an unusually immersive, candid and often bleakly funny account of a mental health condition. Middleton offers no theories as to the cause of her illness, and presents no easy cure. Instead, her aim is to provide comfort to others living with OCD and to show that “life with [it] is not a hopeless one. It is surmountable, with the right guidance and medical help, and whether my scorpions are hibernating or voraciously present, I have learned to live alongside them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

McCann’s bravura account of the wire-walk forms the centrepiece of that novel, which relates the interlocking lives of different New Yorkers who are touched by Petit’s thrilling but benign assault on the Manhattan skyline.In his new novel, Twist, McCann is drawn to another type of wire and another obsessive, boundary-pushing hero. The wires, this time, are the undersea cables that carry data around our hyperconnected planet. And the hero, John Conway, is an engineer and free diver who travels the world, repairing them when they break.McCann’s subject is timely. Experts have been warning for a while that our globalised lives depend on these links to a degree that few of us have considered. To travel around the world, our voices and digital data are only briefly airborne before 1.5m km of fibre optic wires transport them across the sea floor, where they are prey to hostile actors and natural disasters. Over the past two years, there have been multiple instances of underwater cables being damaged in the Baltic by ships linked to Russia or its allies.The book is full of wonder at the scale and beauty of the natural world – and anger at humanity’s capacity to wreck itThe novel is narrated by a fiftysomething Irish journalist and novelist, Anthony Fennell, who’s got himself an assignment to write a long feature about Conway’s cable repair vessel, the Georges Lecointe. He travels to Cape Town to join the ship then sails with the crew up the western coast of Africa to the site of a cable break. McCann/Fennell lets us know early on that Conway will be the puzzle at the book’s heart, and that it won’t be an easy one. “Others have tried to tell Conway’s story,” he writes, “and, so far as I know, they got it largely wrong.” Physically gifted – he can hold his breath for eight minutes – Conway is charismatic and secretive, with a few mysterious blanks in his CV. He’s also in a strained relationship with his South African partner, a beautiful actor-director called Zanele who is preparing to stage an unauthorised production of Waiting for Godot. While Fennell and Conway sail north to repair the cable, Zanele is in the UK, on a path towards an unexpected kind of celebrity.One touchstone for the book is, of course, McCann’s own Let the Great World Spin, where a single act of physical virtuosity links different threads of story. “What I needed was a story about connection,” Fennell tells us, as he takes the assignment at the novel’s opening, “about grace, about repair.” In fact, while Philippe Petit’s story fits that bill, the one Fennell ends up with is much less graceful and restorative. The other, more determinative influence on the book isHeart of Darkness. McCann pays overt homage to Conrad’s novella, and the shape of his plot is clearly indebted to it. A boat sails on an uncertain voyage towards the Congo. On board, an introspective narrator speculates about the motives and character of an ambiguous, inspirational and possibly sinister individual.There are some excellent things in this novel. The account of the journey and the observations of the work on board the ship feel as if they must be rooted in McCann’s own reportage. We are on board for days, among the polyglot, multi-ethnic male crew. The book is full of wonder at the difficulty of their work, at the scale and beauty of the natural world – and full of anger at humanity’s capacity to wreck it. As they trawl the bottom of the sea for the broken cable, they pull up forms of sealife that may be entirely new, yet nowhere is free from human-made rubbish. And much of the digital content pouring through the cables is vacuous, spiteful and wrong. As Zenele’s show in the UK gets caught up in a moment of digital infamy, McCann forces us to contemplate how all these phenomena are connected.At his best, McCann evokes physical activity in an intense, cinematic way. There are passages of extraordinary vividness. The depths of the ocean; freedivers plunging to the sea floor on a single breath; out-of-the-way cable relay stations on Africa’s west coast; sea sickness; extreme weather; an internet outage that paralyses part of Cape Town: these are all evoked with a power that seems to persuade you that you’re either a participant or a witness. And the novel builds to a bravura climactic escapade: part Philippe Petit, part Mister Kurtz, partTheodore Kaczynski.I loved the thoughtful, essayistic inquiries into nature and the environment, and the consciousness-raising voyage towards the broken cable. But I have to confess that I’m not entirely in sympathy with all McCann’s aesthetic decisions. As a narrator, Fennell can’t compete with Marlow, because he’s a spare part on the Georges Lecointe, where Marlow is captain of his steamboat. There’s an occasional note of portentousness in the prose, and a fondness for eye-catching lines that I would file under “Kill Your Darlings”: “A moment dolphined up”; “The early choices in any story present vectors that can spray in dozens of different directions, a rorschach of possibility.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Conrad’s novel joined the shockingly unexpected dots between the trophies of modern European culture – car tyres, piano keys – and the horrors of the Belgian Congo.

If you continue east from the Dordogne and Lot, you’ll discover a land of volcanic peaks, hot springs and welcoming auberges in one of France’s least populated departments. And, as I learn, it makes for a refreshingly different destination for a springtime road trip. The snow lingers on those peaks until early April, but I’m here in early May and the meadows abound in an extraordinary display of wildflowers, such as arnica, narcissi, orchids and myriad other species that thrive in that volcanic soil. The landscape is one of the most richly biodiverse in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe flavours of this land transfer into the local cheeses, too, for it is on these meadows that the capricious Salers cows graze and are then milked for Salers Tradition cheese (the cows will only yield milk if their calves are present). The semi-hard cheese is thought to date from the second century and is one of France’s rarest, with fewer than 10 producers left.I stop to take in the heart-soaring view of the glacial valley. It cradles farms and hedgerows, overlooked by craggy peaksThe villages around here are picture-postcard pretty – Anglards-de-Salers, tiny Saint-Bonnet-de-Salers and Salers itself – a rambling series of grey stone buildings with cows grazing in the fields around it, jangles of cowbells carrying on the breeze. All is quiet but for a few hikers tramping through the central square, though it isn’t long before my wandering leads me to the heart of the action atLe P’tit Comptoir, a wine and cheese bar where diners feast on huge boards of local charcuterie and cheese, and quaff bottles of wine. Madame gives me a table and I tuck into a small platter, postponing a glass of wine until later when I reach my destination, Pailherols, an hour and a half away.View image in fullscreenA hiking trail descending from Puy Mary in the Cantal.Photograph: Mauritius/AlamyThe afternoon’s route takes me over one of the Cantal’s most vertiginous peaks, Puy Mary, but first I stop just outside Salers to stand in the afternoon sun and take in the heart-soaring view of the glacial valley. It cradles farms and hedgerows, overlooked by craggy peaks on the horizon whose shadows creep gently downward, swallowing hamlets into their darkness. Below me on the hillside are twoburons, small stone huts that are a local feature. They were built by cowherds who, while their cows grazed on the higher pastures, would reside in them each summer, making cheese and surviving on the local specialityla truffade, an unctuous concoction of stringytommecheese and sliced potatoes – a hearty and sustaining dish for those working this rugged land.From there, the route winds up and up with the triangular form of Puy Mary ahead of me, its rust-coloured slopes dotted with the remnants of snow. The narrow road skirts around it, with a steep drop to my right. It gives me palpitations, but the views are worth it; the route continues across more valleys and peaks, and my knuckles are white from the careful steering, until I eventually arrive at Pailherols just after dark.25 of the best hotels, B&Bs and chateaux in FranceRead moreIn winter, this village of 152 inhabitants is a cross-country skiing hub, but in spring it brings the hikers and road-trippers who check into the cosyAuberge des Montagnesand its sister hotel,Chez Marie. The owners, Vincent and Marie, welcome me like a long-lost friend, and soon I’m seated in the wooden-beamed dining room primed for Marie’s menu of locally reared, honey-roasted pork and blond lentils from the commune of Saint-Flour. “Just wait till you see the view in the morning,” says the ebullient Vincent as he pours me a glass of volcanic wine. “Your room looks out over a small lake and it is wonderful.”View image in fullscreenChez Marie hotel in Pailherols.The next morning is bright and sunny, and the view over the lake is indeed superb, but even better is the vista as I drive away from the village. I’m stopped in my tracks by the sight of vast meadows carpeted with yellow dandelions and cowslips. There isn’t a cloud in the blue sky, and the only building I can see for miles around is aburon; a pertinent reminder of when people’s lives revolved entirely round the summer transhumance and making cheese.It’s just half an hour to the charming town of Pierrefort, where newly flowering wisteria creeps across its grey-stone houses, and the central square boasts a volcanic stone statue of a horned Aubrac bull – the breed that produces beef and milk for Laguiole cheese, which was also made in theburons. The locals are so proud of these bulls (which they say “wear eye makeup” owing to the white fur around their eyes) that in the early April festival La Fête des Tersons the animals are paraded through the town, and there is food, music and entertainment. Therestaurant at the Hôtel du Midihas the best menu in town, thanks to chef Gilles Charbonnel, who runs the place with his two sisters. My dish of tender beef with artichoke and potatoes is superb – filling and hearty, but with a flourish of sophistication.Food isn’t the only appeal of Chaudes-Aigues – it’s also where you find Europe’s hottest springsIf Charbonnel is spoiled for local produce for his menus, so too is Aurélien Gransagne, chef atHôtel Sodade and Serge Vieira restaurant, which has two Michelin stars, both in Chaudes-Aigues, a further 30 minutes south. Yet, the food isn’t the only appeal of this small town on the edge of the Aubrac plateau – it’s also where you find Europe’s hottest springs. Although the volcanic peaks are far behind me, their11m-year legacystill bubbles beneath the landscape and surfaces in 32 springs across town.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the side of the pavement, La Fontaine de la Place au Beurre is a modest tap that dribbles water at 65C (150F) into a stone trough. I dangle my fingers into the steaming water and am reminded that for full immersion theCaleden thermo spawith its jets, pools and spa treatments is only five minutes away.My curiosity leads me further up the lane to find the other spring, this one a scorching 82C (180F) and sputtering from a spout in the wall into a drain, emitting a slightly sulphurous whiff.Vincent van Gogh’s Arles: visiting the pretty Provençal city that inspired his greatest masterpiecesRead moreThe closing time for the nearbyGeothermia museum of geothermal energy and thermalism(therapeutic use of hot springs) is approaching, so instead I follow a trail that explains, via information boards, points of interest relating to the town’s history and how it has harnessed this volcanic warmth. In Place Pierre Vialard, I learn how, from 1332 onwards, the houses were built so they could harness the geothermal heat and in so doing created one of Europe’s first central heating systems with about three miles of pipes made from pine.Before dinner, I drive up the hill above the town to see it from the extraordinary setting of the Serge Vieira restaurant, built around the ruined tower of the Chateau de Couffour. The restaurant is closed until late May, but the view from its grounds is worth the detour as the landscape really opens up – with Chaudes-Aigues tucked in the valley below and the Cantal landscape coming alive with trees laden with bright white and pink blossoms.I head back down to Hotel Sodade, where I’m spending the night, and get to taste chef Gransagne’s refined dishes – steamed asparagus with mousseline and poached egg, followed by tender pork, fennel puree and confit carrots. When I spot a side ofla truffadeon the menu, I can’t resist ordering it; my chance to discover – having seen theburonsand the flowers of this curious volcanic landscape – a dish that has been served here for centuries.The trip was provided by Cantal Tourism; for more information seeauvergne-destination.com.Amuse Bouche: How to Eat Your Way Around Franceby Carolyn Boyd is published by Profile(£18.99).

Some people don’t wait – they wear shorts and sandals even when it’s cold and frosty outside – but I cope in my own way with my cooking. Today’s recipe gives the appearance and flavour of a spring dish, but with none of that season’s ingredients. There’s a lot of green frippery – artichokes, peas, leeks and fresh herbs – but the artichokes are jarred and the petits pois are from the freezer. If you’re struggling to wait for spring, too, perhaps this is the recipe for you.White bean, leek and artichoke stewTo clean the leeks, slice the full leek (both white and green parts) crossways from top to bottom, then put in a bowl of cold water. Vigorously swish the leeks with your hands, and all the sand and dirt on them will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Scoop out the leeks with your hands, then put in a sieve to drain and dry off.Prep15 minCook30 minServes45 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for the toast2 red onions, peeled and finely diced1¼ tsp fine sea salt4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 leeks(200g), whites and greens thinly sliced and rinsed160g drained jarred artichokes in oil(ie, from a 285g jar)400g tin butter beans in water, drained200g frozen petits pois1 vegetable stock cube, dissolved in 250ml boiling water1 tbsp lemon juice10g fresh mint, leaves picked10g fresh flat-leaf parsley¼ tsp coarsely ground black pepperSourdough, to servePut the oil in a wide, deep frying or saute pan for which you have a lid, and set it on a medium heat. When hot, add the onion and salt, and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Stir in the garlic and leeks, cover the pan and leave to cook for eight minutes, until the leeks are soft.Add the artichokes, butter beans, frozen petits pois and stock to the pan, mix well, then cover again and cook for a further five minutes.Add the lemon juice, then chop the herbs and stir them in, too, along with the ground pepper.Taste and adjust the seasoning as you wish, then distribute between shallow bowls.

For me, this is when simple, wholesome ingredients truly shine: winter roots, stored pulses and hardy greens take centre stage, offering nourishment and depth. These are the months to embrace thoughtful cooking, making the most of what is available and lingering over meals that bring comfort. Whether it’s the aromatic spices of slow-roast lamb or the earthy warmth of soup, both of today’s dishes reflect the beauty of working with what the land provides, and celebrate the joy of slowing down – in the kitchen and at the table.Carrot, celery, farro and borlotti bean soup (pictured yop)This comforting, gentle soup is homely in feel, but I’d be more than happy to serve it at the restaurant, too. Farro and borlotti beans are very good together, young spring carrots are delicious and celery is good with almost anything.Prep15 minCook35 minServes440mlextra-virgin olive oil1brown onion, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed5 sage leaves, roughly tornSea salt and black pepper4 carrots, peeled and chopped into characterful chunks (about 250g)3 celery stalks, trimmed, cut in half lengthways and then into 1cm chunks250g cooked borlotti beans250g cooked farro600mlchicken stock(homemade, ideally), or waterTo finish1 handful chopped flat-leaf parsley30ml extra-virgin olive oil60gparmesan, gratedPut a medium-sized, heavy-based pan on a medium heat and, once hot, add the olive oil, onion, garlic and sage. Season with a pinch of salt, then saute, stirring, for five minutes.Add the carrots and celery, turn the heat down low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes more. Stir in the cooked borlotti and farro, then pour in the stock. Turn up the heat to medium, cook for 10 minutes more, then taste, adding a generous amount of ground black pepper and a good pinch of salt, if you think it needs it.Ladle into bowls, finish with the chopped parsley, extra-virgin olive oil and grated parmesan, and serve.Slow-cooked shoulder of lamb with chilli and fennel seedsView image in fullscreenSkye Gyngell’s slow-cooked shoulder of lamb with chilli and fennel seeds.Shoulder of lamb contains more fat than the leg, which gives the meat a sweeter, fuller flavour and, when cooked in this way, becomes meltingly soft and tender. Red-wine vinegar helps to cut the richness, and also gives the dish a sharp yet mellow note. The chilli adds gentle warmth, while the fennel seeds bring a subtle, aniseed aroma that complements the lamb beautifully.Prep10 minCook3 hr 45 minServes4½ shoulder of lamb(about 1kg), bone inSea salt and black pepper1 tbsp olive oil200ml white wine½ tsp fennel seeds1 dried red chilli, roughly torn3 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch fresh sage1 bay leaf4 anchovy filletsin oil, drained3 tbsp red-wine vinegarHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Trim the lamb of most of its surface fat, then season it with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Put a large frying pan that’s big enough to hold the shoulder on a medium heat and add the olive oil. When it’s really hot, lay in the lamb shoulder, then brown well on all sides – you want a good colour all over.Transfer the seared shoulder to a roasting tray, pour off the fat from the frying pan and return it to the hob, this time on a low heat. Add the wine, let it bubble and reduce for a couple of minutes, then pour over the lamb.Toast the fennel seeds in a dry pan until fragrant, then add them to the roasting tray with the chilli, garlic cloves, sage, bay leaf, anchovies and vinegar. Tightly cover the tray with foil, then put it on the middle shelf of the oven and roast for three hours.After this time, take the tray out of the oven, remove the foil lid, then return to the oven for a final 30 minutes, by which stage the lamb should be utterly soft and brown.Serve with boiled new potatoes, or farro or pearl barley.Skye Gyngell is chef/proprietor ofSpringin London, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, and culinary director ofHeckfield Placein HampshireExplore more on these topicsFoodWinter food and drinkMain courseSoupVegetablesCereals and grainsCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

Once a niche alternative, it now lines supermarket shelves in endless varieties – oat, almond, soya, hazelnut, coconut, rice, pea – and is often the product of choice in coffee shops. Whether for ethical, environmental or dietary reasons, more and more people are ditching dairy. But not all plant milks are created equal. Some taste fantastic on their own but split in hot coffee or tea, some are ultra-processed, and others still have questionable sustainability credentials. Even so, according to the environmental charityHubbub, oat, almond and soy milk generate at least 68% fewer planet-warming emissions than conventional dairy milk, require less land and fresh water, and have a lower impact onwaterwaysthrough chemical run-off andeutrophication.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I tested 10 plant-based milks, judging them on taste, texture, ingredients, sustainability and how they perform in coffee, and I enlisted my local cafe,Oru, in south-east London, to help me assess them for taste, texture and stability once heat is applied. Here’s how they measure up.Best all-rounderCalifia Farms organic oat barista blendView image in fullscreen£2.30 at Ocado★★★★★A balanced, clean oat flavour, with mild sweetness and a smooth, creamy texture. Works well in coffee, tea, cereal and smoothies. It froths exceptionally well, too. It’s made with organic EU-grown oats, manufactured in Europe and free from gums or stabilisers.Califia Farmshas a sustainability initiative focused on reducing carbon emissions and improving packaging recyclability, and, alongside Plenish, isThe Good Shopping Guide’s best-scoring plant milk for sustainability.Best bargainThe Original Oatly whole oat long life drinkView image in fullscreen£2 for 1 litre at Asda£2 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆The pale cream colour is similar to that of dairy milk, and it has a subtle aroma and a relatively neutral flavour profile. Drunk straight,the mouthfeel was slightly cloying, but it works well in cereal, tea and filter coffee. It’s excellent for lattes and steams easily with a stable microfoam. Oatly calculates theclimate footprintof its products and puts this one at 0.49kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e)/kg, although the brand has a low sustainability score onThe Good Shopping Guide.And the rest …Plenish organic barista almondView image in fullscreen£2.25 for 1 litre at Tesco£12.99 for 6 x 1 litre at Amazon★★★★☆Crisp and white, with a clean mouthfeel and subtle almond aroma. Works well straight as well as in tea, coffee, cereal and smoothies. Steams well for lattes, too, but tricky to make latte art.Rude Health organic brown rice drinkView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 1 litre at Morrisons£2.30 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆Bright, white colour, with a fresh, clean flavour and a deliciously full taste that’s never overpowering. Very sweet, though. Best enjoyed straight, or in tea, cereal or smoothies. Not suitable for latte, because it won’t steam. It’s made with whole brown rice, including the bran, so it has a naturally sweet taste without added sugars. The ingredients include spring water, organic brown rice, organic cold-pressed sunflower oil and sea salt.Rude Healthis a certified B Corp.Plenish organic soyaView image in fullscreen£2.25 for 1 litre at Sainsbury’s£2.25 for 1 litre at Tesco★★★★☆The flavour is balanced, and it has a subtle scent of soya beans. Refreshingly unsweet, too, unlike most oat and nut milk. The mouthfeel is clean, with good viscosity. Best enjoyed straight, in tea, cereal or smoothies. Not for latte or steaming. Made with a simple ingredients list, namely spring water, EU-grown organic soya beans and sea salt, this is a great source of protein.

This contains a larger percentage of oats than most brands, resulting in a thicker texture, creamier colour and sweeter taste. Delicious straight and on cereal, and also good in tea. It steams well and has a smooth microfoam texture, making it decent for lattes. This one is made with UK-grown oats, harvested and packed within 100 miles, so has a climate footprint of only 0.35kg CO₂e/kg.Rude Health organic hazelnut long life drinkView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 1 litre at Ocado£16 for 6 x 1 litre at Holland & Barrett★★★★☆A beautiful, pale hazelnut beige, with a wonderful, nutty aroma. The taste is naturally sweet, nutty and delicious, and there’s a clean mouthfeel and pleasant aftertaste. Best enjoyed straight, or in tea, cereal or smoothies. Not suitable for latte. Made with simple ingredients – spring water, organic rice, organic hazelnuts, organic cold-pressed sunflower oil and sea salt – this provides a rich, sweet flavour without added sugars.Arla Jörd chilled oat and hemp drinkView image in fullscreen£1.90 for 1 litre at Sainsbury’s★★★☆☆A subtle but pleasant hemp flavour, with a clean taste and a pleasant mouthfeel. Best enjoyed straight with tea or cereal. Not really suitable for coffee, though, because it develops a bitter flavour when heated; it’s also difficult to foam. Unlike many similar products, this is free from rapeseed oil, and I opted to include it here because hemp is such an incredible plant, which contributes to soil health and carbon sequestration. That said, Jörd has a low sustainability score onThe Good Shopping Guideand isowned by Arla, the fourth largest dairy producer in the world.Minor Figures barista oatView image in fullscreen£2.10 for 1 litre at Ocado£2.10 for 1 litre at Amazon★★★☆☆A smooth texture, but a slightly artificial aroma and aftertaste. Works well in tea, coffee (to which it imparts a slight acidity), cereal and drunk straight. Froths adequately for lattes, too.Minor Figuresis a certifiedcarbon-neutral companythat offsets 100% of its carbon emissions by supportingGold Standard carbon-offsetting projects.Alpro soya chilled dairy alternativeView image in fullscreen£1.88 for 1 litre at Asda£2 for 1 litre at Ocado★★☆☆☆For me, this is a nostalgic product that I used to drink in the 1980s, but now, while the taste is sweet and it has a good viscosity, I find it has an off-putting artificial aroma.

For me, going there and chatting to and supporting the stallholders and farmers (many of whom I have now known for years) feels a bit like going to church; there’s something soulful about it, wrapped in community spirit. But it can mess with my Sunday lunch timings, so here is a rich, comforting braise that you can start before you go out to do your favourite Sunday ritual. I hope you love it as much as we did and which should supply some delicious ham leftovers for sandwiches.Braised brown sugar ham hock with harissa lentils and creme fraiche (pictured top)This delicious sugar- and mustard-crusted ham hock with braised lentils flecked with a touch of harissa is a total feast.Prep15 minCook2 hr 40 minServes4-51.4kg smoked ham hock, skin peeled off1 onion, peeled440ml cider1 tsp black peppercorns120g dijon mustard, plus extra to serve3-4 tbsp soft dark brown sugarFor the lentils3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish1 medium onion, peeled and diced2 carrots, peeled and diced2 celery sticks, finely dicedSalt and black pepper2garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2 bay leaves1 tbsp harissa400g green lentils1 large handful fresh parsley, roughly choppedJuice and grated zestof ½ lemonTo serveCreme fraicheSteamed greens or a crisp saladto serveSubmerge the ham hock in a large pan of cold water, cover and bring to a boil. Once the water is bubbling, drain it off – this will remove any excess salt from the ham. Cover the ham again with cold water, then add the onion, cider and peppercorns, pop the lid back on and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook gently for 90 minutes, topping up with boiling water as necessary.Drain, reserving the braising liquid, and transfer the ham to a rack in a roasting dish.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Spoon enough mustard over the hock to cover it generously, then pat the sugar all over it, too. Reserve 500ml of the braising liquid for the lentils, then pour enough of the remaining liquid into the dish around, but not touching, the ham, to fill it by several inches. Roast for 40-50 minutes, until the meat is caramelised on the outside and tender and falling apart underneath. Turn off the oven, cover the meat with foil and leave in the oven with the door ajar to keep warm.Try this recipe and many more of Thomasina’s ideas in the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Meanwhile, set a large saucepan over a high heat, then turn down the heat to medium, pour in the olive oil and saute the onion, carrots and celery for 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the garlic and bay leaves, and cook for a few minutes. Add the harissa and lentils, stir for another minute, then pour in the reserved braising liquid and 500ml water, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a low simmer and cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes, until the lentils are tender. They should be brothy; if they look dry, loosen with a few more ladles of the ham cooking water. Season with salt and pepper, some lemon juice and a few tablespoons of olive oil, then stir in most of the parsley.When you’re ready to eat, ladle the lentils into bowls and lay slices of the ham to one side of them. Spoon over some creme fraiche and a dollop of mustard, then scatter over the remaining parsley and a little lemon zest. Season with lots of black pepper and serve with steamed greens or a crisp salad.Toasted pecan praline sundaeView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ toasted pecan praline sundae.Toasted pecans seasoned with burnt, salty sugar transform vanilla-scented ice-cream into a crazily good pudding.Prep5 minCook50Freeze4 hr+Serves8-10360ml whole milk360ml double cream1 tsp vanilla extract, or 1 vanilla pod, split5 large egg yolks40g golden caster sugar¼tsp salt200g condensed milkFor the praline200g pecans100g golden caster sugar½tsp fine sea saltFirst, make the ice-cream base. Warm the milk, cream and vanilla in a medium saucepan. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and salt until light and fluffy, then pour in the warm milk, whisking as you do so. Pour the mix back into the saucepan.Wash the egg yolk bowl, tip in the condensed milk and set aside. Put the custard pan back on a medium heat and cook, stirring regularly, until it thickens to the consistency of double cream and coats the back of the spoon. (You can raise the heat to speed up the process, but keep stirring and be careful that the mix doesn’t curdle.) Whisk the custard into the condensed milk, then pop in the fridge to cool.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Scatter the pecans over a baking tray and toast for 12-14 minutes, until golden. Line a second tray with silicon or baking paper.Meanwhile, put the sugar, salt and two tablespoons of water in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat and swirl to melt the sugar. Once the sugar has melted, let it simmer while swirling the pan to distribute the darkening patches. Once the caramel is smelling deliciously toasted and is an even dark brown, pour it over the lined tray and leave somewhere cool to set for about 10 minutes. Once set, tip into a food processor and blitz to breadcrumbs. Weigh out 140g and put the rest in a serving bowl.Freeze the custard in suitable container, stirring every half an hour, for about two hours, until it starts to thicken, then stir in the reserved 140g praline and freeze again, stirring every half-hour, for another two hours-plus, until set. (If you have an ice-cream machine, simply churn the custard with the praline until set.)Serve the ice-cream in small bowls topped with a sprinkling of extra praline, with the rest in a bowl at the table. Hot chocolate sauce is always a good extra, too.Explore more on these topicsMain courseThomasina Miers recipesFoodPorkMeatDessertIce-cream and sorbetBritish food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s endlessly adaptable, and great for feeding a crowd or prepping ahead for a laid-back breakfast or brunch.Strata, or savoury bread puddingStrata involves layering custard-soaked bread in a buttered dish, and covering it in more custard, plenty of cheese and just about whatever other flavoursome ingredients take your fancy. Cubed bread seems to be common in many recipes, but, as a big fan of the quintessential British bread-and-butter pudding, I’ve used sliced bread instead (I was surprised to learn that this American-style savoury bread pudding has been around since the early 1900s – one of the earliest recipes appears inJuniata L Shepperd’s book Handbook of Household Science, published in 1902).I flavoured my strata with chopped spinach, roast leeks and sun-dried tomato paste, a combination that I can very much vouch for, but I would recommend working with whatever you’ve got to hand. Conjure your inner chef and create your own delicious flavour combination of one, two, three or more main ingredients.Serves6600ml whole milk150g grated cheese– gruyere, cheddar, blue cheese, parmesan50g parmesan rind(optional)1 tbsp dijon mustard(optional)3 sprigs fresh thyme, stripped to get 1 tsp leaves (optional)¼ tsp grated nutmeg, or to taste (optional)5 medium eggsSalt and black pepper500g old bread(sourdough, wholemeal, brioche), sliced200-400g optional fillings(choose 1, 2 or 3), all chopped – spring onions, cherry tomatoes, frozen spinach (defrosted and squeezed dry), leftover roast vegetables or sauteed mushrooms, cooked sliced sausage, bacon lardons or ham.Additional flavourings (all optional and to taste)PestoSun-dried tomato paste, or chopped sun-dried tomatoesSoft goat’s cheeseFirst make the custard, heat the milk in a saucepan with 100g of the grated cheese and any of optional flavourings. Stir until the mix begins to boil, then take off the heat. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture, whisking all the while, and season to taste.Prepare and chop all your optional fillings. Pour enough of the custard mix into a large enamel dish or deep roasting tin to cover the base, then scatter a third of your fillings on top.Working one slice at a time, dip the bread into the custard, then layer in the dish. Pour over the remaining custard, ensuring the bread is evenly soaked, then scatter the fillings on top and dot with any of the optional extra flavourings. Finish with the remaining 50g grated cheese, then lay another dish or tray on top, gently press down to submerge the bread, and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour.Lift off the top dish, then bake the strata ina 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or warm.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteBreadMeatVegetablesBakingItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
