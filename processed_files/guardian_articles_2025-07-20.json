What bracingly confident televisionRebecca NicholsonSun 20 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere is an overwhelming darkness to The Narrow Road to the Deep North, Justin Kurzel’s adaptation of Richard Flanagan’s Booker prize-winning novel. Thematically, this is to be expected: it is about a group of Australian prisoners of war constructing the Burma railway in the mid-1940s, at the tail end of the second world war. It is about the lasting trauma of conflict and imprisonment. It spans half a century, and though it tempers its darkness with a rich love story, it is largely violent, fatalistic and sorrowful. But visually, too, you may find yourself fiddling with the contrast and brightness settings. This very much matches its mood to its palette.Jacob Elordi is perfectly handsome and haunted as the younger Dorrigo, a poetry-loving doctor who is about to be married to the well-to-do and socially connected Ella (Olivia DeJonge). The show covers three timelines, two of which follow closely on from one another. Elordi takes the main shift, Dorrigo as a young man. It opens in the thick heat of battle, going straight into the action. Young soldiers trade barbs with gallows humour, as they joke and tease, and place bets on how long they think they are going to live. Their banter is interrupted by exploding mines, the casualties already considerable, just a few moments in. The survivors are captured and put to work on the railway. It is hellish from the off, a vivid nightmare of torture and a tale of impossible endurance.Forty-nine years later, towards the end of the 1980s, Ciarán Hinds is the older Dorrigo, a successful, wealthy and celebrated surgeon, still married to Ella (now played by Heather Mitchell). Dorrigo is brooding, even more haunted and undergoing a reckoning with his own history. He is also celebrated as a war hero, but he is combative, arrogant, even reckless, in his professional and personal life. He gives a furious television interview, ostensibly about his experiences of war, to promote a book, the nature of which is deliberately abstruse. This enforced reflection causes him to remember what he has tried so hard to forget and, as a drama, flipping between timelines, it builds up a picture of what made him the unhappy, unfaithful man he has become. It does this slowly, convincingly and in great, awful detail.The 1980s storyline, in which Dorrigo’s philandering ways are laid bare, provides some respite from the relentless violence. This is visceral, in its truest sense. Kurzel captures the bodily horror of war in an almost confrontationally frank manner. As they hack away at rock and trees, the men are emaciated, filthy, full of malaria and dysentery. The camera nestles in among them, and hovers above, conveying a real sense of their closeness and suffering. At one point, a leg must be amputated. This is a gory and drawn-out ordeal. At least, in the darkness, it is partially obscured, though the audio alone is gruesome enough.For all of its bodily horrors, this is a passionate, full-bodied love story too, a strand that is delicately balanced but just as impactful. Before he is called up, Dorrigo visits his uncle Keith (a small, mighty performance from Simon Baker) and is immediately drawn to Keith’s young wife, Amy (Odessa Young). She is intrigued, if not impressed, but when they meet again at a poetry reading in a bookshop, after Dorrigo has become engaged to Ella, that initial spark ignites into a forest fire. It takes time for their mutual attraction to become more than yearning and longing, lingering looks and touches, but the pacing of it is moving and affecting. Compared to the grinding chaos of the jungle, their affair is sad and beautiful, as romantic as it is doomed.This is a literary drama and it makes no apologies for that. Dorrigo loves Catullus and Aeschylus. The men perform Romeo and Juliet for each other in the jungle. Amy cements her attraction to Dorrigo with a fragment of Sappho, which reads, simply, “you burn me”. At times, its novelistic roots are more obviously on show; some of the dialogue is writerly and elevated, as the characters reflect poetically upon human nature and cruelty.And there is much cruelty to consider. There are so many killings, so many deaths, and one particular execution, in the jungle, is one of the most distressing scenes I have watched on television in a long time. The Narrow Road to the Deep North, then, is not an easy prospect, but it is an immensely powerful one, driven by strong performances and a bracing confidence in its ability to tell this story, at its own pace, in its own way. My only complaint is that I would have liked to have been able to see just a little more of it.The Narrow Road to the Deep North aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer in the UK. It is available on Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJacob ElordiDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Most kitchens are full of healthy but unglamorous alternatives. Nutrition experts name their favouritesRachel DixonSun 20 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 16.41 EDTShareWhat is a superfood?According to Italian scientistswriting in the journal Frontiers in Food Science and Technology in February, the term was coined in the 1960s to describe foods that could fight malnutrition. It wasn’t until the 00s that it was co-opted to sell exotic and expensive ingredients to health-conscious customers. During the pandemic, interest in so-called superfoods increased again, especially those said to “boost immunity” and “protect against pathogens”.The researchers, Giulia Santunione and Giuseppe Montevecchi, define superfoods as “a marketing term used to describe nutrient-dense foods claimed to have health benefits”. In sales terms, the superfood label has been a huge success. The global superfoods market is projected to rise from an estimated $155.2bn in 2022 to $344.9bn by 2033. The US is the lead grower of kale and blueberries; Peru is the biggest exporter of quinoa and maca root; China is the top producer of goji berries and spirulina; India is a major producer of turmeric; and Japan specialises in matcha tea.The truth about fruit juice and smoothies: should you down them or ditch them?Read moreIn other ways, it has been a disaster. “Large-scale plant production can lead to the overexploitation of agricultural areas, causing negative impacts on biodiversity and soil health, as well as precarious working conditions for workers,” write Santunione and Montevecchi. They cite goji berries as a particular concern: they need a lot of water, are often grown as a monoculture, and there are questions over fair wages for farmers. Quinoa is more sustainable in terms of water, but increased demand has affected traditional farming practices, may have contributed to soil erosion, and has led to higher prices for local people.Alongside these concerns, there is a growing awareness that a diverse diet, rich in a wide range of plants, is a better path to health than fixating on a handful of miracle ingredients. With all that in mind, I asked nutrition experts to nominate their favourite everyday foods that are just as beneficial as blueberries. Here are 17 of their unsung superfoods, none of which necessitate a trip to a health food shop. In fact, you probably eat most of them already.Oats“This humble wholegrain is a powerhouse of nutrients, includingfibrethat successfully helps lower cholesterol and bioactive compounds that can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation,” saysDr Federica Amati, a research fellow at Imperial College, London, and the author ofEvery Body Should Know This. “Wholegrains are a health-protecting food group that most of us are lacking, so oats are worth adding back in the pantry.”View image in fullscreenOats contain B vitamins, antioxidants, calcium, magnesium, selenium, iron and zinc.Photograph: Tetra Images/Getty ImagesOatsare also a superfood for Veronika Prošek Charvátová, a senior researcher at the vegan campaign groupViva! Health. “One cup of oats (80g) contains more than 10g of protein and a good dose of many B vitamins, antioxidants, calcium, magnesium, selenium, iron and zinc,” she says. “The protein is a high-quality one called avenalin, found only in oats. It contains health-supporting beta-glucans, which can also be found in expensive supplements, but a bowl of muesli or porridge does the job just as well if not better.”“Eat the steel cut or jumbo rolled oat versions, which contain more fibre, healthy fats and protein than the quick-cook versions,” adds Amati.Peas“Peas are a great source of protein, fibre and complex carbohydrates – the type that is digested gradually, giving you a steady energy supply – and they are naturally low in fat,” saysDr Justine Butler, the head of research at Viva! Health. “Regular intake has also been shown to be beneficial in terms of weight control, improved sugar metabolism and lower blood pressure. These little gems can be used in a variety of ways including as a side vegetable (even mushy peas!), or incorporated into risotto, pasta dishes, curries or salads to provide a little extra protein.”CarrotsView image in fullscreenThe popular orange vegetable is good for digestion and gut health.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images“Carrots may feel like a dull everyday vegetable, but they are anything but,” saysRosemary Martin, a UK-based registered dietitian. “Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, an antioxidant that converts into vitamin A in our body to support vision, immune function and skin health. Carrots are also a source of fibre that improves digestion and gut health.” She suggests eating them raw in summer salads, or cooked to add sweetness tosoups, stews and curries.PotatoesPotatoes don’t count as one of your five a day – but that doesn’t mean they aren’t good for you. “Potatoes are often underestimated for their nutritional value, despite being an important source of several vitamins and minerals including vitamin C, iron, potassium, magnesium, vitamin B6 and folate,” says Sammie Gill, a registered dietitian with theBritish Dietetic Association. “Always try to keep the skins on (even with mash) – removing the skins means removing fibre. Microwaving, rather than boiling, is one of the fastest and easiest ways to cook them while preserving many of their vitamins and minerals.“Freshly cooked potatoes are high in starch, but if you cook then chill them, some of it is converted to resistant starch – a type of fermentable fibre that acts as ‘food’ for your gut microbes. Fermentation of resistant starch by gut microbes is linked to the production of short chain fatty acids, which are known for their beneficial effects on human health. For example, a cold potato salad is a good source of resistant starch.”TomatoesView image in fullscreenTomatoes are a powerful antioxidant.Photograph: Maria Korneeva/Getty Images“Tomatoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium and the red compound lycopene, a powerful antioxidant linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers,” says Martin. “When they’re in season, fresh tomatoes are the perfect addition to summer salads and salsas, but tomatoes are incredibly versatile in their cooked, canned and paste forms all year round.” In fact,lycopene is most accessibleto the body incooked tomatoes, especially alongside a healthy fat such as olive oil. Even ketchup is a decent source of lycopene – just watch the salt and sugar levels. Tomato juice may help reduceLDL cholesterol (the bad kind) and increase HDL cholesterol (the good kind), and help muscles recover after exercise.Green leafy vegetablesDon’t obsess about kale – all leafy greens are superfoods. “The price of broccoli, kale, rocket, brussels sprouts, cabbage and spring greens varies wildly, so it’s best to choose them when they’re in season, as they are usually the most affordable,” says Prošek Charvátová. “They all are packed with nutrients including iron, calcium, potassium, folate, vitamins C, E and K, antioxidants and fibre. On top of that, they contain special compounds called glucosinolates that may help to protect against cancer. They also contain small amounts of vital omega-3 fats, as well as protein.”WatercressHaving said that, Martin singles out watercress as one of the most underrated greens. “Watercress is a nutrient-dense green that is an excellent source of vitamin K, which plays a vital role in bone health. It also contains vitamin C, calcium and iron, which contribute to immune health, bone strength and the production of red blood cells.” She suggests adding it to salads, sandwiches or soups for its fresh, peppery flavour.Lentils“Lentils are a great, inexpensive source of protein, healthy carbohydrates and fibre, and are also low in fat,” says Butler. “They are an ideal staple in anyone’s diet, not just because they are packed with essential minerals and vitamins, but also due to their health-protective properties. Studies show they are useful in the prevention of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.One studyfound people who ate the most pulses (about 3.5 servings a week) had a 35% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those eating the least.” She suggests using lentils to make soups, stews and dal, adding them to salads, or using them to replace mince in a shepherd’s pie or bolognese.BlackberriesView image in fullscreenBlackberries, fresh or frozen, can boost immunity.Photograph: Diana Miller/Getty ImagesBlueberries tend to get the superfood tag, but there are many more berries to add to your porridge. “Blackberries are a potent source of anthocyanins – vibrantly pigmented antioxidants that protect our cells from damage,” says Martin. “Blackberries are also a great fruit for supporting digestion and blood sugar regulation due to their fibre content. In addition, they are rich in vitamin C for immune health and collagen formation.” They also have the bonus of being free across much of Europe and North America. Out of season, buy them frozen. Martin suggests eating them as a snack or in a smoothie, but it’s hard to resist ablackberry and apple crumble.Brazil nuts“A single serving of just four brazil nuts – once a month, not every day – may lower our cholesterol levels faster than statins and keep them down even a month later,” saysDr Michael Greger, the author of the bestselling bookHow Not to Die. This was the finding ofa small studyof 10 healthy people. “More is not better; eating four brazil nuts every day may bump us up against the tolerable daily limit for selenium, so stick with a single serving of four just once a month.” If you can’t be quite that abstemious, one or two a day won’t hurt.PopcornView image in fullscreenWhy not add smoked paprika, or curry powder?Photograph: Kinga Krzeminska/Getty ImagesGill highlights popcorn – sadly, not the salty, sugary stuff you get at the cinema, but the homemade variety. “Popcorn is a whole grain containing about 10g of fibre per 100g. It also contains phytochemicals, mostly concentrated in the pericarp – the outer shell that is key to the popping process,” she says. “Popcorn will probably keep you feeling satisfied for longer than other snacks, such as crisps. At the supermarket, choose the hard popcorn kernels you heat on the hob. You can elevate it by adding your own toppings: freeze-dried fruit, honey, smoked paprika, olive oil, pepper, curry powder, melted dark chocolate, cinnamon sugar, parmesan or herbs such as rosemary, thyme and oregano.”Black beansWhile it’s best to eat a variety of beans, black beans are a favourite ofDr Emily Leeming, a research fellow at King’s College London and the author ofGenius Gut. “Beans are a great source of sustainable plant protein and are packed with fibre – just half a can contains about 7g of fibre,” she says. “Black beans are a surprisingly high source of polyphenols, containing seven times more than wild blueberries.” According toa 2021 study, diets high in polyphenols can reduce the risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Black beans go well in Tex-Mex-style scrambled eggs or tofu andspicy soups, and make a goodveggie burger.TofuView image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s baked tofu chilli.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian“Tofu is one of the most nutritious foods around,” says Prošek Charvátová. “It’s high in protein, low in fat – and what little fat it does contain is the healthy kind. It provides fibre and is a good source of B-group vitamins, magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc, and a great source of calcium and iron. Research also shows that it can help reduce your risk of heart disease and several types of cancer.” If you think you don’t like tofu, you’re probably cooking it wrong. Try Meera Sodha’sbaked tofu chilli,tofu fried riceorIndo-Chinese tofu.Edamame“You’ll always find a bag of frozen edamame in my freezer,” saysKaren Ansel, a New York-based registered dietitian nutritionist and the author ofHealing Superfoods for Anti-Aging. “They’re loaded with heart-healthy plant protein, plus fibre for a happy digestive system. Since they are slowly digested, they also keep me full for a long time. I love them for a quick snack, especially since I can defrost them in the microwave in seconds. They’re also an easy way to bump up the protein in main dishes such as grain salads or vegetable stir-fries. They last for months in the freezer, so I always keep a bag on hand for healthy meals in a pinch.”Artichoke hearts“Artichoke hearts have been shown to lower our LDL cholesterol, the primary driver of the primary killer of men and women,” says Greger. “Look for no-salt-added artichoke hearts in the frozen section of the supermarket and aim to get about 100g a day.” Use them in aMediterranean stewor avegetable paella-style dish.TahiniView image in fullscreenTahini on toast works a treat.Photograph: Tanika  Tavares/Getty Images“Love a delicious spread on your toast but want something that will support your health?” asks Amati. “Tahini [ground sesame seeds] is a brilliant option – packed with healthy fats, calcium and bioactive compounds that are associated with improved blood pressure. Simply spread some tahini with a teaspoon of honey for a creamy, slightly sweet spread for your toast.”SugarMichael Moss, the author of the bestselling bookSalt Sugar Fat, makes the case for reclaiming sugar. “The food industry stole and corrupted sugar from us, along with other things such as colour and texture and salt and even convenience,” he says. “In small amounts, sugar is terrific and very nutritious. For example, I always add a pinch of sugar to my spaghetti sauce, simply because my mum did. And thinking of her makes my scratch cooking so much more alluring.” Indeed,a study in Brazilfound that buying sugar as a cooking ingredient – rather than in processed foods – was associated with health, as those households were still cooking traditional dishes.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingFoodHealthNutritionVegetablesSugarSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet we never learn from the pastJohn HarrisA landmark book exposes the history of loathing that underpins such scandals as Winterbourne View. It has received next to no attentionSun 20 Jul 2025 07.42 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTShareBBC Radio 4 has just aired a short series about the writer Virginia Woolf, tocelebrate the centenaryof her novel Mrs Dalloway. According to the publicity blurb, the aim of Three Transformations of Virginia Woolf was to explore what she “has to say to us today”, and how she “captured and critiqued a modern world that was transforming around her, treated mental health as a human experience rather than a medical condition, and challenged gender norms”.Because the three episodes immediately followed the Today programme, I distractedly caught two minutes of the first, before flinching, and turning it off. The reason? Only a few days before, I had read a diary entry Woolf wrote in 1915, presented alongside the acknowledgment that she was “suffering deep trauma at the time”, but still so shocking that it made me catch my breath.It was a recollection of encountering a group of learning-disabled people, who were probably residents of a famous institution called Normansfield hospital. “We met and had to pass a long line of imbeciles,” Woolf wrote. “The first was a very tall man, just queer enough to look at twice, but no more; the second shuffled, and looked aside; and then one realised that everyone in that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature … It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly be killed.”That passage arrives a third of the way through a brilliant new book titledBeautiful Lives, straplined How We Got Learning Disabilities So Wrong. Written by the playwright and drama director Stephen Unwin, its story goes from the Greeks and Romans to the 21st century. Much of it is a history of the misunderstanding, hatred and appalling mistreatment experienced by endless millions of people. But partly because Unwin has a learning-disabled son – 28-year-old Joey, who he says has “challenged everything I was brought up to believe in and turned it on its head” – it is also a very topical demand for all of us “to celebrate the fact that such people exist and have so much to offer”.A sign of the ignorance Unwin spends some of the book railing against is the fact that this superbly original work, published in early June, has not been reviewed in a single mainstream publication. In the context of the attitudes he writes about, that is probably not much of a surprise – but there again, the book is so timely that its passing-over still feels shocking. After all, it follows the same unquestionable logic as all those high-profile discussions and debates about institutional racism and empire, and demands a very similar process of reckoning.On this subject, there is a mountain of questions to ask. Some are about language that still endures: “imbeciles”, “morons”, “cretins”, “idiots”. How many of us know about the first official Asylum for Idiots – later the Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives – founded in Surrey in 1847, and infamous for what Unwin describes as “widespread cruelty … and soaring mortality rates”? However much young people study history, do their syllabuses ever cover theMental Deficiency Act of 1913, which formalised the idea that people categorised as “idiots” and “imbeciles” (and all disabled children and young people) should be institutionalised, let alone the fact that it granted local councils powers to remove such people from their families by force? Why is the US’s record oninstitutional cruelty and cod-psychologyeven worse than the UK’s?There is another part of the same story, centred on aslew of 20th-century politicians and cultural figureswho believed that learning-disabled people – and disabled people in general – were not just pitiful and wretched, but a threat to humanity’s future, an idea expressed in the absurd non-science of eugenics. They included that towering bruteWinston Churchill, DH Lawrence (who had visions ofherding disabled peopleinto “a lethal chamber as big as the Crystal Palace”), and lots of people thought of as progressives: Bertrand Russell, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, the one-time Labour party chair Harold Laski, and the trailblazing intellectuals Sidney and Beatrice Webb.Their credo of pure and strong genes may have been discredited by the defeat of the Nazis, but we should not kid ourselves that everyday manifestations of loathing and condescension that underlay those ideas do not linger on. Ours is the age of such scandals as the one that erupted in 2011 atWinterbourne View, the “assessment and treatment unit” in Gloucestershire, where people with learning disabilities were left out in freezing weather, had mouthwash poured into their eyes and were given cold showers as a punishment.The year 2013 saw the death in an NHS unit ofConnor Sparrowhawk, the autistic and learning-disabled young man whose life was dramatised by Unwin in a profoundly political play titledLaughing Boy, based on a brilliantly powerful book written by Sparrowhawk’s mother, Sara Ryan. As well as its principal character’s life and death, it highlighted the fact that the health trust that ran the unit in question was eventually found to havenot properly investigatedthe “unexpected” deaths of more than 1,000 people with learning disabilities or mental-health issues.Right now, about 2,000 learning-disabled and autistic people arelocked awayin completely inappropriate and often inhumane facilities, usually under the terms of mental health legislation. Only5% of learning-disabled peopleare reckoned to have a job. Six out of 10 currentlydie before the age of 65, compared with one out of 10 for people from the general population.Shut away and ignored: thousands of disabled adults are at the frontier of the human rights struggle | John HarrisRead moreBut this is also a time of growing learning-disabled self-advocacy, which will hopefully begin to make change unavoidable. One small example: at this year’s Glastonbury, I chaired a discussion about the cuts to disability benefits threatened by the political heirs of Laski and the Webbs. The speakers onstage included Ady Roy, a learning-disabled activist who is involved inMy Life My Choice, a brilliant organisation that aims at a world “where people with a learning disability are treated without prejudice and are able to have choice and control over their own lives”. He was inspirational, but it would be good to arrive at a point where what he did was completely unremarkable.It may sound a little melodramatic, but it is also true: such people, and allies like Unwin, are at the cutting-edge of human liberation. Far too many others may not have the same grim ideas as Woolf, Lawrence, Keynes and all the rest, but their unawareness and neglect sit somewhere on the same awful continuum. That only highlights an obvious political fact that all of us ought to appreciate as a matter of instinct: that the present and future will only be different if we finally understand the past.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLearning disabilityOpinionVirginia WoolfDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

What if they refuse to play ball?Lucy KnightSun 20 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 06.02 EDTShare‘Ican be a bit much,” a friend said to me. A group of us were in a cafe discussing the first date she had scheduled for later that day, and she was worried about how she might come across. It wasn’t the first time I had heard a woman label herself as “too much”, “intense” or “a lot”. I expect even the most feminist of women have found themselves wondering, like the newly single Jessica (Megan Stalter)in Lena Dunham’s new Netflix show, Too Much, whether they would be better off if they just toned it down.Thanks to the lingering presence of “weirdly archaic feminine ideals”, says the author Amy Key, many women still believe that being “a contained, neat person” will make them more desirable on a date, or at work, or in social situations. “That is linked to the idea of the space that you occupy too,” she adds, whether that’s the metaphorical “space” that you command in conversations or the physical size of your body. The unspoken rule, in both cases, is that less is better.Trying to contort your body and personality to meet these ideals is “such a pointless exercise”, because in all likelihood you will fail if that’s not who you are, says Key, whose memoir,Arrangements in Blue, is about embracing long-term singleness. “But it’s really hard to not give those ideals authority.” Often, in her experience, others will: she has been told that if she lost weight or stopped doing certain things, then she would be more likely to attract a partner.The comedian Helen Bauer, whose forthcoming Edinburgh show, Bless Her, is about learning to love yourself, thinks concerns about being too much all come back to society’s “creepy” fascination with youth. From a young age, Bauer, who describes herself as “big and loud”, noticed that boys and men were drawn to “youthful, small women who are quiet and waiting to be told what to do”. When you start interrogating that desire, she says: “It just gets so gross so quickly. Why do you want them small?”Bauer remembers first feeling she was too much as a child. When her sister had a period of being selectively mute, she remembers people saying it might be “because Helen talks so much”.View image in fullscreen‘Big and loud’ … comedian Helen Bauer.Photograph: Raphaël NealLike most hang-ups we have as adults, fear of being too much often has its roots in childhood experiences like Bauer’s, says Lucy Fuller, a psychotherapist. If an exuberant child is consistently told by adults to “pipe down” or “be quiet”, it “very often puts them in a place of shame”, says Fuller, and this can continue into adulthood. It is usually young women who bring concerns about taking up too much space into therapy sessions, she says. Men, on the other hand, “can sit in their ego more confidently” due to cultural norms.The correct feminist response to all of this, of course, is to embrace being exactly who you are and not worry about fitting into patriarchal boxes. With women’s rights “teetering again all around the world, I’ll be as much as I need to be, and a little bit more, in the face of that”, says Deborah Frances-White, host of The Guilty Feminist podcast and author of Six Conversations We’re Scared to Have.The majority of men are looking for women who will take care of them and not challenge themPoppy Jay, the co-creator of the podcast Brown Girls Do It Too, says the number of times she heard the expression “too much” from Indian relatives growing up “is unreal”. But now, like Frances-White, she wears her “too much-ness” as a “badge of honour”. There are always going to be people who think her podcast – which is about sex and relationships – is too much, “but I’m going to be 40 in a month, and the older you get, the fewer fucks you give”. When it comes to her own dating life: “You should see my Hinge profile – it is too much,” she says, but she likes it that way. “This is the way you weed out the weak links.”That said, she admits that she does dial parts of her personality up and down in different situations. Most people “can’t handle ‘too much’ girls, so if you want to get laid or you want to get somewhere, especially in work spaces, the sad reality is, you do have to code-switch”.“I genuinely think the majority of men are just looking for women who will take care of them and not challenge them,” adds Jay. They’ll have sex with a “too much” woman, she says, but they won’t marry her.Not all men, of course. But men like Felix (Will Sharpe), Jessica’s new boyfriend in Too Much, who are actively drawn to loud, confident women, are “few and far between”, thinks Jay. She and a friend have a mantra, she says, only half-jokingly: “Get them to fall in love with you and then show them the crazy.”Paradoxically, a certain amount of “crazy” or “messiness” can be seen as cool, withraw, messy aesthetics being popular with gen Zon social media. But there are unspoken parameters attached to this, thinks Key. Although plenty of people enjoy watching a “messy woman” on TV or on social media, she says, some of this comes with an attitude of: “I’m going to consume this as content and find it funny and relatable but I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship with you.”Key also points to the stock fictional character known as the “manic pixie dream girl”, often the high-spirited love interest in film and TV, who has the same traits as someone who would be perceived as too much, but isn’t viewed that way because of her other stereotypically desirable characteristics. She may be “super-annoying, but is in a slim white cisgender body so it’s kind of fine and acceptable”, says Key.View image in fullscreen‘The trick is to know how to dial it up and down’ … Deborah Frances-White.Photograph: Callum BakerJay agrees that certain groups are afforded the privilege of behaving in a way that is too much, whereas others can’t. As a south Asian woman, she says that when it comes to the workplace, she could never behave the way that some white women do in TV shows such as Too Much. Though she makes fun of the way her relatives have wanted her to “be obedient, fall in line”, she recognises that the motivation was often to make sure that she would fit in and be given opportunities.Tobi Green-Adenowo, wheelchair dancer and founder of the Disabled Power Network, knows that, for some people, just the fact that she is a black woman and a wheelchair user will have already put her in the too much category. She has got used to people using phrases such as “Here comes trouble” simply because she has had to make a certain amount of requests relating to her access needs. For a long time, she used a manual wheelchair rather than a powered one, because the latter’s bigger, clunkier presence was another thing that made her feel she was taking up more space than she should. Though she is a lot more confident now, like Jay, when it comes to work opportunities, she sees the way she presents herself as a balancing act.“You still want to keep those professional relationships with people, but you do also want to express to them that perhaps they’ve got biases that they may need to change,” she says. “Sometimes I have really bad anxiety over it … How do I approach this without getting blacklisted?”Frances-White accepts that she will always be too much for some people – she sees it as the cost of being a “dynamic force”, which is what makes her good at her job. “The trick is to know how to dial it up and down – and when to do that.”Arrangements in Blue by Amy Key review – cathartic meditation on singledomRead moreAs well as that, I suspect a lot of women who think of themselves as being too much need to stop being so hard on themselves. Fuller says she finds it sad that if a social interaction hasn’t gone well, many women look for supposed flaws in themselves, rather than examine the behaviour of the other people involved. Yes, you might have been seen as too much by a certain person or group, “but if you were with another group of people then that might not have been the case”, she says. She encourages her clients to challenge those beliefs about themselves.Back at the cafe with my friends, one of the women I was with responded to the friend who was concerned about her date. “Women always say to me, ‘I’m too much’ when they’re going on dates with men. But what if you’re not too much? What if these men are just not enough?”Explore more on these topicsWomenRelationshipsWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few things are worse than returning home to discover a horticultural graveyard. Plants can survive unsupervised during the winter, but heatwaves, a lack of ventilation, and no one around to water mean summer holidays are a recipe for disaster.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But fear not. A bit of planning and the right kit can make all the difference between a happy homecoming and a shrivelled mess. Whether you go full-tech or just trust in a good soak and a friend, there’s a holiday plant-care method for every budget and plant. Regardless of how long you’re going away for, here are some of the best tips and tricks to keep your houseplants alive, hydrated and happy in your absence.Holiday care for houseplantsAsk a friendSometimes the simplest solution is the best: ask a neighbour, family member or friend to look after your plants while you’re away. Leave easy instructions and group plants that require similar care. It’s a lot to expect someone to visit several times a week, but even one mid-holiday visit can make a huge difference. Or, as I’m doing with my neighbour, swap plant-sitting duties with a fellow plant lover: you water theirs, they water yours.Relocate and group your plantsMove your plants away from windows where they might be scorched by direct sunlight. Place them together on a table in a room that gets indirect light. This helps create a more humid microenvironment, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation and can prevent the plants from drying out. Try placing shallow trays filled with water and pebbles nearby to provide extra humidity and buy you a few extra days of grace. For extra moisture, soak your plants’ soil in the bath or sink first and let it drain before grouping them.Mirrors, caddies and skinny shelves: 12 space-saving tricks to make small rooms feel biggerRead moreSelf-watering globesView image in fullscreenH&Mwateringglobe£9.99 at H&MThese elegant glass orbs are plant decoranda hydration device.

It allows you to keep a virtual eye on your plants, and if the levels get too low, you can always bribe a friend to pop over.Moisture-retaining gel crystalsView image in fullscreenWestlandwater-savinggel£6.49 at the Range£12.99 at B&QSoak these in water to let them expand, then mix into your compost before you go. They’ll release the water slowly as the soil dries. Especially useful for thirsty tropicals or ferns that throw a fit the moment they dry out. The downside?

Inside Reform’s unofficial plan to bag a Tory big beastOfficially, the party says there is no mission to court Conservative defectors, but insiders suggest otherwise, and warn against the dangers of doing soRowena MasonWhitehall editor andBen QuinnSun 20 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 14.42 EDTShareAt last year’s GB News Christmas party,Suella Bravermanwas the centre of attention. The former home secretary is popular in rightwing media circles, but it wasn’t her straight-talking brand of conservatism that was topic of the evening, rather it was the growing whispers about what some thought was her imminent defection to Reform UK.“It was like a panto – everyone saying: ‘Oh yes you will’, and her saying: ‘Oh no, I won’t’,” says one Reform party guest. “We all thought she was just biding her time until the right moment.”The chatter had been given fresh impetus by the fact that Braverman’s husband, Rael, had joined Nigel Farage’s party. With Reform soaring in the polls and talk of defections rife across Westminster, the “Suella moment” seemed to be approaching.Officially,Reform UKinsists there is no concerted mission to attract Tory defectors, with no joiner too grand to not be directed to an online “defection portal” which has been set up to vet new members.In reality, insiders say, there has been a scattergun campaign to bring senior Tories onboard; an operation that could yet have more success when MPs head back to their constituencies for the summer recess and meet the reality of Reform’s popularity with disillusioned voters.View image in fullscreenReform sources say the party has ultimately got fed up with waiting for Suella Braverman.Photograph: Zuma Press/AlamyThe headhunting so far has largely been driven by personal connections with Farage, Richard Tice and other senior figures, based on political friendships forged in the crucible of the Brexit leave campaign and the green room of GB News.Success has come with the recruitment of the former Tory chairSir Jake Berry, the former cabinet ministerDavid Jones, Andrea Jenkyns and Marco Longhi, as well as a steady flow of local councillors and Tory activists.But the big-name Tory rightwingers who are often linked to Reform, including Braverman,Jacob Rees-Moggand Liz Truss – have so far resisted the entreaties of their former colleagues who have made the leap.Reform’s patience in waiting for them, it seems, is not limitless.This week, for example, appeared to be the point at which Reform turned on Braverman: the party suddenly ratcheted up the attacks on her record, and that of theConservativesmore widely, over their role in a government cover-up of a scheme to resettle thousands of Afghans exposed by a dangerous data leak.“We weren’t not going to go in studs up just because someone might defect to us in future,” says one Reform insider.Zia Yusuf, the party’s cost-cutting chief, publicly condemned the former home secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said any minister at the time was a “traitor” for not speaking up about the scheme in the Commons.In response, Rael Braverman quit, saying he could not be in a party “led” by Yusuf, while Braverman herself released a statement explaining why she was bound by a superinjunction against speaking out.Reform sources say the party had ultimately got fed up with Braverman, and that senior figures are increasingly sceptical that Conservatives tainted by former administrations are actually useful to the party.We’re not ‘Tories 2.0’ but the more defections we take, it looks like thatReform sourceConservatives who are thinking about changing rosettes are often tight-lipped about their plans, but those who have already joined less so. Jenkyns, the former Conservative MP who is now Reform’s Lincolnshire mayor, says most defectors “didn’t take much persuading, they were fed up with the Conservatives”, but that Braverman had come up with “lame excuses” for staying.One Tory who knows Braverman says her reluctance to defect is partly out loyalty to her association and partly her family’s history with the party. At the same time, they suggest that many Reform-inclined Tories are waiting to see what happens if there is enough momentum to oust Kemi Badenoch as party leader, with persistent mutters about November as the likely date of an attempted coup.They also scoffed at the idea that Reform would turn their noses up at Braverman if she did decide to cross over.Some in Reform are, indeed, still sympathetic to Braverman, with one senior politician saying: “She’s had a really tough couple of days and there is a lot of flak flying around. This Afghan thing is awful. We are calling for a judge led inquiry and it is just difficult for everyone.”There are differences of opinion within Reform about the issue of defections, and whether taking MPs from their less popular rival parties is helpful.Sources in the party say they have turned down plenty of former Tory MPs who want a shot at getting their old seats back and make lists of unrealistic demands about what they would want from Reform.With an attitude of “they need us more than we need them”, Reform is sifting applicants through its portal in a vetting and interview process run by the party’s “head of discipline and defections”, the former Vote Leave activist Tom Waterhouse.In terms of Tory big beasts, Farage is believed to draw the line at the idea of accepting Truss if she were to approach the party, with Reform insiders briefing that she is too toxic.However, Rees-Mogg would appear to be a different matter, despite his obviously posh Conservative pedigree. Yusuf has been complimentary about the Tory former MP in recent days, saying he is a “high intelligence, highly educated, high integrity person” for having claimed that ministers could have spoken about the Afghan leak superinjunction in parliament, contrary to Braverman’s claims.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage (L) and Jacob Rees-Mogg chatting at a farmers’ protest in London against changes to inheritance tax rules for land ownership in February.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesRumours have been swirling for months that he has been tapped up for a Reform-backed run at his old seat, now called North East Somerset and Hanham, if there were to be a byelection triggered by Dan Norris, the incumbent MP who was suspended from Labour after his arrest in April over allegations of rape and child sexual abuse. But Rees-Mogg denies ever considering or discussing defection, saying he is staying in the Tories.Since Brexit, it has become increasingly common for Tories and Reform figures to mingle at the same events, parties and media outlets, driving a common sense of politics, purpose and friendship.Jones, the former Conservative cabinet minister who defected two weeks ago, says he was not approached as part of an arm-twisting campaign but took the decision alone. “I came to the conclusion entirely on my own,” he says. “I realised I spent quite a lot of the last parliament unhappy with what my own government was doing, which made me realise that if they were Conservatives, I was no longer a Conservative …“I knew Nigel but I had no contact with them at all until after I left the Conservatives. I met him on a few occasions and worked with him and Richard Tice on Leave Means Leave … I knew his views were very close to my views. A lot of senior people in Reform have a Conservative background and it’s natural that our paths would cross.”Berry, the other recent defector, has attracted more scepticism within Reform circles, as a former remainer and an advocate of net zero. Matthew Goodwin, the academic and GB News presenter, wrote this week: “Why is Reform welcoming a former Tory who had a front-row seat to the striking failures of the dominant regime in this country and yet concluded, asrecently as July 2024, during a contest for the leadership of the Tory party, that the answer to Britain’s problems is … ultra-liberal Tom Tugendhat?… I mean, how do you go from believing that the next prime minister of this country should be Tom Tugendhat to thinking, only one year later, that the next prime minister should be Nigel Farage?”Asked on GB News about his route to Reform, Berry acknowledged going on a “journey” and saying he came to think the country was broken. He has long had regular slots on GB News and TalkTV, mingling with some of his new colleagues.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage is applauded during his visit to the Reform UK group at Kent county council in Maidstone this month.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAThe question now is whether further big-name defections are coming. Acknowledging some of the concerns about admitting Tories, a senior Reform UK source said the party knew it had a “balancing act” to maintain as it sought to eat into traditional Labour support.“We obviously don’t want to be ‘Tories 2.0’. We’re not ‘Tories 2.0’ but the more defections we take, it looks like that. So it’s pretty much done,” the Reform source said in relation to defections from sitting Tory MPs.“We’ve got lots of high-quality people who have been around the block and succeeded in life who are, for the first time in their life, saying they are prepared to put their heads above the political parapet and stand. They are, frankly, of a higher quality than most current Conservative MPs, so we don’t want a bunch of Tory has-beens coming ahead of them.”Meanwhile, Farage also has the job of trying to keep his existing MPs, party officials and backers onside as his ex-deputy Ben Habib and former party MP Rupert Lowe attempt to peel off his supporters for new ventures on the right.Reform watchers say there are tensions not just over defections but the direction of policy and personalities, with some saying the big egos knocking around HQ are a “ticking timebomb”. The recently defected Jones says such rumours do not bother him: “After all, I’ve just come from the Conservatives. It’s politics.”"

However, compensation only accounts for part of the total 27bn figure, a larger share being legal costs. In the past six years, the NHS has spent £24.6m on legal fees for claims that did not result in damages.NHS Resolution, the organisation that handles negligence claims for the NHS trusts in England, recorded in itsmost recent annual report, published on Thursday, that the cost of settling all maternity-related claims was £37.5bn. This amounts to nearly two-thirds of its total £60bn clinical negligence liabilities bill, a sumdescribed by senior MPsas “jaw-dropping”.Estimated cost of harm from maternity incidentsJeremy Hunt, the former Conservative health secretary, said: “It should be a matter of national shame that we now spend more on maternity litigation than the total cost of running maternity services.”Hunt said the NHS was still not doing enough to learn from mistakes and the biggest problem was that clinicians fear being sacked for admitting errors.Jess Brown-Fuller, the Liberal Democrat hospitals spokesperson, accused the Conservatives of a “scandalous” neglect of maternity services.She added: “The crisis in our maternity services is being laid bare through the trauma that so many families have to deal with. Now these figures are showing just how much damage it is causing to our health service.”The £27.4bn figure is the estimated value of maternity claims arising out of incidents since April 2019. NHS Resolution said the figure could change as there is an average three-year gap between an incident and a legal claim, the most serious birth injuries resulting in payments made over several years – and sometimes for the duration of the child’s life.The figures have been revealed amid growing alarm about the state of maternity care in NHS hospitals across England. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, last month ordered a national investigation into “failing” services for women and babies, following a series of scandals in Shrewsbury and Telford, Nottingham, Barrow-in-Furness, Leeds and elsewhere.Inspections of 131 NHS maternity units across England classed as many as two-thirds as “inadequate” or “requires improvement” for safety between 2022 and 2024.The Care Quality Commission, the healthcare regulator,saidissues including staff shortages were “systemic” and “widespread”, with almost half of the 131 maternity units it reviewed performing below standard.Hamilton said the state of maternity care in the UK was “completely unacceptable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further £247m was paid out over birth defects owing to clinical negligence.Natalie Richardson, a medical negligence solicitor for Patient Claim Line, said there had been a 79% increase in the number of birth and pregnancy cases the firm had taken on this year.Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, whose maternity units were last monthdowngraded to inadequateover safety concerns, paid out nearly £72m in compensation due to 107 obstetrics failings in the nine years to March 2024 – including 13 fatalities and 14 stillbirths.In the same period, Nottingham University hospitals NHS trust was ordered to pay nearly £60m for 80 clinical damages claims related to pregnancies – including seven deaths.That trust is at the centre of avast criminal investigationinto suspected corporate manslaughter over the severe harm of potentially more than 2,000 babies and women.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it had inherited “an unacceptable situation where too many families are suffering from botched care” and the NHS is “paying billions for its mistakes, rather than fixing them”.It added: “We are committed to breaking that cycle and providing mothers and babies with safe, compassionate care once and for all.”NHS England said it was taking immediate steps to strengthen maternity services, including closer oversight of underperforming trusts. It added:“We recognise that too many women and families are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve, and we are committed to changing this.”NHS Resolution said: “The high cost of compensation arising in maternity comes from a small number of very serious incidents resulting in brain injury to a baby at birth. These incidents are devastating for families and reflect the need to make provision for lifelong and complex care needs.”Explore more on these topicsNHSMaternal mortalityWomen's healthHealthEnglandCare Quality Commission (CQC)PregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

The legacy of Orgreave has been to undermine “the wider mining community’s confidence in policing for decades,” it said.Cooper said that as an MP for a former mining area in West Yorkshire, she understood the community feeling. She made it clear that the inquiry would address the collapsed prosecutions as well as the policing on the day.“People have waited for answers for over 40 years,” she said. “The scale of the clashes, the injuries, the prosecutions, the discredited evidence, all of those things – there’s still so many unanswered questions.”At Orgreave, about 8,000 miners assembled for a mass picket called by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and were met by 6,000 police officers from forces nationwide, led by South Yorkshire police. The violence that ensued has become an infamous episode in British history,police charging on horsebackand hitting miners over the head with truncheons.View image in fullscreenMounted police charge picket lines at Orgreave.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianSome miners did throw stones before the police charge and retaliated after it, and the next day 28 officers werereported to have been injured. Official reports later put the figure at 72.The NUM, however, has always believed the police violence was pre-planned, and that the South Yorkshire force, and Margaret Thatcher herself, who described the Orgreave picketing as “mob rule”, greatly exaggerated the extent of miners’ misbehaviour.The prosecution of 95 miners for the offences of riot and unlawful assembly collapsed on 17 July 1985 after their barristersrepeatedly accused police officers of lyingin their statements and in court. Michael Mansfield KC, who represented several defendants, said after their acquittals that it had been “the biggest frame up ever”.View image in fullscreenArthur Scargill, then the NUM president, in front of the line of riot police at Orgreave.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianThe form of the Orgreave inquiry is modelled on theHillsborough independent panel, whose 2012 report isrecognised as a landmark, establishing crucial details about the disaster and overturning the false South Yorkshire police narrative that was intended to avoid responsibility and blame the victims.Orgreave papers destroyed by police thought to include report on notorious truncheon beatingRead moreThe inquiry, which will have the power to compel people to provide information, will be chaired byPete Wilcox, the bishop of Sheffield, who haslong regarded it as importantfor community healing. As dean of Liverpool from 2012 to 2017, Wilcox worked with James Jones, then the bishop of Liverpool, who chaired the Hillsborough panel.TheOrgreave Truth and Justice Campaign(OTJC), founded by strike veterans and activists in 2012, welcomed the announcement. Joe Rollin, a founder member, said he was “cautiously elated” by the prospect of the inquiry.“We’ve got a long way to go – and people know us, we’re determined, and we’ll not give up until we get the justice we deserve.”Arthur Critchlow, one of the miners prosecuted, suffered a fractured skull from a police truncheon blow at Orgreave. He was with the OTJC representatives who met Cooper, and said he lived with the trauma every day.“It’s a massive injustice. For the 48 days of that trial I was convinced I was going to get life in prison.” The inquiry announcement was fantastic, he said. “I just hope the miners will be vindicated, and the majority of the country will realise that we weren’t lying – the media were lying, and the police were lying. I just want the truth, for people to know what the police did, and who ordered it.”View image in fullscreenMiners and police clash at Orgreave.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianThe NUM president, Chris Kitchen, said: “We are over the moon. We’re hoping the inquiry will show that our dispute, which we believe was industrial, was political, orchestrated from No 10, or higher up the food chain towards No 10.“And that the police were used as a parliamentary force to push a political objective, against working-class lads that were fighting for their jobs in this community and the industry.“We never came to this field to cause a riot or to deliberately lame people. I don’t think that was the same for the police, who came tooled up, with a plan to injure us, and to try and get the public perception on their side and end the strike.”A spokesperson for South Yorkshire police said: “We will fully cooperate with the inquiry in a bid to help those affected find answers.”Explore more on these topicsThe miners’ strike 1984-85PoliceYorkshireSouth YorkshirePolitics pastShareReuse this content"

Get ‘the best of the Highlands’ for £9mRead moreProperty price rises are also being constrained by the amount of properties up for sale, which has reached the highest level in a decade, the website found, adding that homeowners who want to sell during the summer have to work harder to attract potential buyers’ attention than during the spring.“What’s most important to remember in this market is that the price is key to selling,” said Colleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove.“The decade-high level of buyer choice means that discerning buyers can quickly spot when a home looks overpriced compared to the many others that may be available in their area.”The highest number of falls in asking prices from new sellers was in London, where they dropped by 1.5% compared with a month earlier, and slid by 2.1% in inner London.Temporary cuts to stamp duty in England and Northern Irelandcame to an end at the start of April, after the announcement by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her October budget. Scotland and Wales set their own taxes on house purchases.The April stamp duty increase has had a greater impact in London, where property prices are higher, and the increase in stamp duty on second homes and properties bought as an investment is thought to be having an effect.In the past, monthly price drops could have been viewed as a sign of a slower housing market, but the number of property sales is still growing year on year, and lower asking prices are helping to make house purchases more affordable for buyers.Average asking prices from new sellers are only 0.1% higher than they were a year ago, at a time when lower mortgage rates are improving buyer affordability. Also helping is the fact that average wage rises are outstripping house prices and inflation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dean Walters, 65 and from Harlow, had earlier been charged with affray and will appear at court in September.Far-right activists associated with groups including Britain First were among those in a crowd that gathered outside the Bell hotel on Thursday, where local people including women and children were protesting peacefully.Clashes with police broke out as groups of men, some of them masked, tried to reach a small anti-racism march that started at Epping station and went through the town before it was hemmed in.In an apparent response to allegations that the police had taken a “two-tier” approach that favoured the counter-demonstration, Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: “Unfortunately, across social media we are seeing inflammatory comments which suggest we were supporting and enabling certain protesters.“This is categorically not true. We police without fear or favour, remaining impartial at all times and have legal responsibilities to ensure peaceful protest is facilitated.”Tensions were high in Epping after the appearance in court on Thursday of an asylum seeker charged with three counts of sexual assault.Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denies the offences, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month at Chelmsford magistrates court.Neil Hudson, the local Conservative MP, has been calling on the Home Office to close the hotel and described the violence in the town on Thursday as “completely unacceptable”.“Police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe.

Officials from the UK Foreign Office were allowed on an exceptional basis to visit the couple last Thursday to check on their welfare.The couple, who celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary this week, were held up until eight weeks ago at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison in the capital, Kabul, their children said.They were then transferred to the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), with the promise of release within two to three days, they said. Two further months have since passed.The children said their parents had better conditions at the GDI but still had no bed or furniture and slept on a mattress on the floor.Sarah Entwistle, one of the children, said: “For the past two months, we have maintained a media blackout, hoping to demonstrate our intention to show respect to the Taliban, and ‘trust the process’.“The UN will be making a statement on Monday calling for immediate release. In the light of this, we are also publicly appealing again to the Taliban for this.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has confirmed$9bn in cuts to its foreign aidbudget, while a number ofEuropean countries have also reduced spendingon overseas aid.Anthony McDonnell, the lead author and the research and a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said: “When we conducted our research on the economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance, it was anticipated that resistance rates would continue to follow historical trends.“However, the sudden cuts to Official Development Assistance by the US, which has cut its aid spend by roughly 80%; the UK, which has announced aid cuts from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income; and substantial reductions by France, Germany, and others, could drive up resistance rates in line with the most pessimistic scenario in our research.“Even countries that have been successful in keeping AMR rates under control cannot afford to be complacent. Unless AMR programmes are protected from aid cuts, resistance rates across the world will likely increase at a rate in line with the worst-affected countries.“This would result in millions more people dying worldwide, including across G7 nations. Investing in treatment for bacterial infections now will save lives and deliver billions in long-term economic returns.”The research calculated the economic and health burden of antibiotic resistance for 122 countries and forecast that in that in this most pessimistic scenario, by 2050, GDP losses in China could reach just under $722bn a year, the US $295.7bn, the EU $187bn, Japan $65.7bn and the UK $58.6bn.According to theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation(IHME), deaths from AMR are expected to increase 60% by 2050, with 1.34 million people in the US and 184,000 in the UK alone predicted to die each year from antibiotic resistant bugs, while numbers of those becoming seriously ill from drug-resistant bacteria are also expected to jump.Superbugs increase the number of hospital admissions and lead to longer and more intensive hospital stays, costlier second-line treatments and more complex care, meaning resistant infections are roughly twice as expensive to treat as those for which antibiotics are effective.The study estimates global health costs of treating AMR could increase by just under $176bn a year, while in the UK, they would rise from $900m to $3.7bn and in the US from $15.5bn to just under $57bn.Higher rates of resistant bugs would also shrink the UK, EU and US workforces by 0.8%, 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the study found.But if countries invest more in tackling superbugs – increasing access to new antibiotics and high-quality treatment of these infections – the US economy would grow $156.2bn a year and the UK $12bn (£9.3bn) by 2050.Responding to the findings, Dr Mohsen Naghavi, a professor of health metrics at IHME, said: “Today the threat of AMR is increasing, and without immediate action from all stakeholders the medicines we have access to now could stop working, potentially causing a simple infection to become deadly.”That would involve policy changes from the US, European and UK governments, the development of new drugs and ensuring everyone understood that antibiotics were ineffective against viruses, he added.A UK government spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan recognises antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a major threat and commits to urgently tackle its spread, including through new vaccines.“We have made important progress - reducing antibiotic use in meat and pioneering a world-first subscription model to incentivise the development of new treatments. We also continue to work closely with international partners to influence global efforts to limit the spread of AMR.”Explore more on these topicsAntibioticsMicrobiologyGlobal economyForeign policyAidHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

Experts would be appointed to work inside water companies and ensure they are obeying the law and improving the environment.The new ombudsman, replacing the Consumer Council forWater, will have strengthened legal powers to help consumers who face problems from water companies, such as sewage floods in their gardens and taps running dry due to burst pipes.‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreWater customers currently find it difficult to get water companies to respond and properly compensate them when they are left without water for days. Signing up to the CCW is voluntary for water companies and it is often left to local MPs to solve complaints.During broadcast interviews on Sunday, Reed saidOfwat was “failing”and he would be “changing the whole system”. Critics say Ofwat has presided over a culture of underinvestment in water infrastructure and financial mismanagement by companies since its creation in 1989.Thames Water, the most troubling case for the government and the UK’s largest water company, is loaded with £20bn in debt and struggling to stave off financial collapse.Reed also vowed to halve sewage pollution by 2030, making rivers, lakes and seas “the cleanest since records began” after years of sewage dumping by water companies.He said he would resign from his role if the government failed to hit the target. “Politicians come and say we’re going to do things. Of course our job should be on the line if we don’t.”However, he came under fire from sewage campaigners for announcing targets which they say are no better than those in Ofwat’s plan to turn around water company performance, which came out in December.During the price review process, when the regulator and water companies negotiate how much bills need to go up by to invest in the water sector, Ofwat last year announced the investment from bills would cut sewage spills by 45% from 2021 levels.Reed announced he would cut sewage spills by 50% by 2030 against 2024 levels. However, Ofwat’s goal would reduce sewage spills to 204,893 by 2030, compared with Reed’s that would reduce them to 225,199 by that year.The £104bn to be invested in fixing England’s creaking sewage infrastructure is coming from a record increase in water bills. Reedsaid he was “furious”about an average 36% rise but was unable to rule out further above-inflation increases in future to fix the broken water sector.He added he expected to see a “small, steady increase in bills” rather than the shock hikes announced in the current price review period.Feargal Sharkey, the former Undertones frontman turned sewage campaigner, said the new targets were worse than those Ofwat announced during the price review process.He said: “How on earth can anybody conjure up a sewage reduction plan that is worse than the one conjured up by the previous government a year and a half ago? The government has decided to axe Ofwat while announcing targets which are worse than theirs. Their plan is not worth the paper it’s written on.”In a speech after the Cunliffe report’s publication on Monday, Reed is expected to say: “Today’s final report from Sir Jon Cunliffe’s independent water commission offers solutions to fix our broken regulatory system so the failures of the past can never happen again.“The government will introduce root and branch reform in the biggest overhaul of water regulation in a generation.”Reed is under pressure from other political parties to go further in his overhaul of the water sector and change the current privatised for profit model. Nigel Farage told the BBC the water industry was in a “hell of a mess” before adding that the government should not bail out investors if water companies went bust, even though Reform UK’s policy is to bring 50% of the sector under state control.Reed argued that nationalisation would cost “upwards of £100bn”, diverting resources from the NHS and taking years during which pollution would get worse, although this isheavily disputedby academics and campaigners.Farage said it would cost “a lot less” than £50bn if the right deal was struck. “It’s public-sector thinking, we need private-sector innovation,” he added, although the industry is currently run by the private sector.Explore more on these topicsWater industryWaterWater billsSteve ReedHousehold billsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Britain was singled out for arresting a man praying near an abortion clinic.But while Vance might enjoy the Cotswolds – home to the Chipping Norton set whose ranks include David Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson – a different reception could await when he later travels on toScotland, which is home to anti-Trump sentiment.In his Munich speech, Vance hit out at the Scottish government over abortion rights, saying it was distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones”, warning them that “even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”.He added: “The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and acrossEurope.”A spokesperson for the Scottish government said Vance’s claim was inaccurate. It appeared to be a reference to the introduction of safe access zones within 200 metres of abortion clinics, banning any form of harassment.“Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was,” added the spokesperson.Vance’s trip to the UK comes at a time when tourist traffic going in the opposite direction has plummeted against the backdrop ofTrump’s policies and rhetoric.The number of UK residents visiting the US wasdown 14.3% in Marchcompared with the same month in 2024, official figures showed. However, Britons continue to make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceDonald TrumpEnglandCotswolds holidaysScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It involved a mass picket of a Birmingham fuel depot and has been called the British miners’ Agincourt. The picket was initially 400 miners from Yorkshire, led by a 34-year-old firebrand called Arthur Scargill, but was swelledby at least 15,000 engineering workersfrom surrounding factories.View image in fullscreenThe miners’ strike outside Saltley colliery.Photograph: Trevor Roberts/Daily MailThe picket was successful and helped bring Edward Heath’s government to its knees. Heath, subsequently forced to introduce a three-day week, lost the election in 1974 while Scargill was propelled to national fame.198417 June7pmA meeting is held at Silverwood Miners Welfare, in Rotherham.View image in fullscreenArthur Scargill in 1984.Photograph: Jane BownScargill, now president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), addresses miners about the following day’s picket. He says 2,000 miners from South Yorkshire collieries would be at Orgreave, an enormous plant outside Rotherham where coal was processed into coke to be used in British Steel’s vast factories, 40 miles east in Scunthorpe.That evening, miners from further afield arrive, staying overnight in places such as the Northern College, in Barnsley. Others sleep on floors.18 June4amAbout 400 pickets gather near the plant.View image in fullscreenPit headgear at Orgreave.Photograph: West Fine Art/Alamy6amIt is shaping up to be a beautiful day with not a cloud in the sky.View image in fullscreenMiners sunbathing later in the morning.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianIt was “scorching” even at that time, recalled one picket. “All the Scottish boys had their tops off, it was that warm,” he said.Map of Orgreave7amA union official is being filmed. “They tell me it’s the biggie,” he says, as men cheerfully stream behind him. Birds are singing. Spirits are high. The official continues: “It’s about seven o’clock. A few of us are here already. I’m told there’s going to be thousands. Let’s have a look, see what happens.”Police seem to be directing the miners to a field. Some play football. Nearby villagers bring out trays of orange juice and iced water.But why were they being guided by police? “I’d never seen this before,” recalled one. “Normally they’d stop you on the motorway and make you walk, six or seven miles.”When miners get over a railway bridge and on to a hill overlooking the plant they see some of what is to come. Police officers are lined up in staggering numbers in front of the plant.View image in fullscreenPickets gathering for the strike.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianBill Frostwick, a miner from Durham, recalled: “They were so well organised, man, it was a trap. And we fell for it, went straight in.”The number of police, some on horseback, some with dogs, is remarkable. But so too is the number of miners, in jeans, trainers, T-shirts and no shirts, looking down at a motionless thick black wall of police, sometimes 10-deep.View image in fullscreenSome of the police deployment at Orgreave.Photograph: Steve Eason/Getty Images8amThere are an estimated 8,000 pickets facing 6,000 officers.

Three years after taking over as the chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, the straight-talking Glaswegian has become a darling of the Labour government: awarded a damehood, namechecked in thechancellor’s Mansion House speechand hailed for furthering a Labour party manifesto pledge to double the size of the mutuals sector.But outside Westminster’s warm embrace, a storm has been brewing. A 43% increase to Crosbie’s maximum pay package,worth up to £7m per year, is due to be rubber-stampedwithout a binding vote by members, effectively sidelining any opposition at Nationwide’s annual shareholder meeting on Friday. It has prompted outrage among campaigners who say it is the latest sign that the 140-year-old building society is losing its way.Those critics believeNationwide, which was founded in 1884 in south London as the Southern Co-operative Permanent Building Society, has deviated from its roots.Although owned by its members, itbought Virgin Money for £2.9bnlast year without asking for their approval and critics claim it is centralising power at the top while diluting the voice of its members.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves delivering her Mansion House speech next to Debbie Crosbie in November 2024.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersBut the industry is backing Crosbie, recognising the55-year-old former TSB boss’s role in pulling the sector into the political limelight.“The truth is that mutuals have often been seen as niche: a ‘nice to have but not essential’,” says Peter Hunt, the founder of UK-based mutuals consultancy Mutuo.Now industry bosses are hosted at No 10 summer garden parties and asked to join a government-run Mutual and Cooperative Sector Business Council. This autumn, ministers will launch a consultation on how to double the size of the sector, in line with Labour’s manifesto pledge. This kind of state-level attention, Hunt says, “has moved the dial”.Nationwide’s £2.3bn takeover gain prompts criticism of Virgin Money bossesRead moreIt is a sign that the sector has finally recovered from a wave of demutualisations in the 1990s that turned the likes of Abbey National, Bradford & Bingley, Halifax and Northern Rock into shareholder-owned banks. It was a blow to the UK’s building societies movement, whichtraces its history back to Birmingham in 1775when a group of friends, desperate to get on the housing ladder, pooled their resources to buy land and building materials.But by the time the 2008 financial crisis erupted, most demutualised firms were either acquired or nationalised through state bailouts. It left survivors such as Nationwide proud of how their simpler, more risk-averse business models, focused on savings and home loans, survived the financial implosion.Seventeen years later, Nationwide is the jewel in the sector’s crown, with 17 million members and £368bn in assets. It is the second largest mortgage provider behind Lloyds, with a 12.5% share of the market. “Nationwide is a domestically systemic banking institution,” the Building Societies Association (BSA) chief executive, Robin Fieth, says. “It gives scale and importance to the whole of our sector.”But some believe Nationwide’s growth has come at the expense of its democratic roots. While building societies centre on the idea of “one member, one vote”, there has been “a boiling frog problem”, according to James Sherwin-Smith, a longtime Nationwide customer who has campaigned to join the board as a voice for members.He says Nationwide has been “debasing … member rights … despite all the lovely positive PR that Nationwide puts out about having your say, and that they’re a beacon for mutual good. When I scratch the surface of that, I do not find substance.”Fury erupted last year over Nationwide’s decision tonot hold a member voteover its takeover of Virgin Money, while the takeover target’s own shareholders had a say. But there are other longstanding issues, including Nationwide’s use of “quick vote” options, which make it easier to back the board’s recommendations rather than cast individual or dissenting votes at its annual general meeting.There are also concerns that Nationwide has retained online-only AGMs, even after Covid lockdowns were lifted, in a move that risks disenfranchising members without internet access. Meanwhile, some members say it can be difficult to get a resolution or election on the ballot, requiring 250 to 500 endorsements from members, whose contact details can be a challenge to access due to data rules. Their signatures only qualify under strict conditions and can be disqualified if their balances or loans fall below a certain level – £100 or £200 in most cases – over the preceding two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But its board says banker-level pay is necessary if it hopes to compete with the likes of Lloyds and NatWest.Fisher says members only want Nationwide to compete with banks on size, but not on pay or purpose. Furthermore, Nationwide’s operations are far less complex than most banks: Crosbie does not have to manage an investment bank or international operations, nor relationships with shareholders. Even after the Virgin Money takeover, it remains a much simpler operation focused on mortgages.But Hunt says it would be inappropriate to measure Crosbie and her pay against bosses at much smaller building societies. “She’s the Lionel Messi of British building societies,” he said. “And she could play for any of the banks, so this is how they keep her in the Nationwide shirt.”The problem for democratically minded members is that the Building Societies Act may not be fit for Nationwide’s size. It means that, unlike its listed bank rivals, Nationwide is not required to hold binding votes on new pay proposals, like the one that could hand Crosbie up to £7m. While it could volunteer to hold a binding vote, Nationwide has refused.When asked whether the Building Societies Association would support reforming the act, Fieth said “it’s not a measure we’d oppose” but admitted it was not “No 1 on our shopping list”.Hunt also questioned whether members were “equipped” to have a binding say on pay. “If I was a member of Nationwide, how would I be equipped to know what any executive should get paid? How would I know? Just because I didn’t like the number? If you had a vote on MPs’ pay, I guarantee you the vast majority of the public will want them to [be paid] less,” he said. (The basic salary for an MP is £93,904.)Fieth echoed that argument, saying some members “found it difficult” to relate to the sums involved. “When you’ve got a balance sheet that’s £300bn, most people can’t compute that at all.”He said members should still be asking questions, but needed to keep long-term performance and innovation in mind. “Henry Ford said that if you’d asked people what they wanted at the beginning of the 20th century, they’d have said faster horses.”Sherwin-Smith said it was the board’s burden to keep members informed. “They should educate people and let them [hold a binding] vote, but to say you’re too stupid to have a say is the wrong attitude.”Nationwide declined the Guardian’s interview requests, but said it regularly engages with a panel of 6,500 members and surveys 500,000 members each year. It also said members have a chance to vote to re-elect board directors every year.“From the extensive engagement that we have with our members, we cannot see any evidence that our leading customer service, support for first-time buyers, growing market shares and record member financial value is in any way controversial,” Nationwide said.It previously said pay proposals although advisory, “always received overwhelming member support” and that Nationwide’s strong performance was driven in part by its ability to “attract, retain and motivate talented leaders.”Explore more on these topicsNationwideBanks and building societiesCorporate governancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 79-year-old author, who is speaking via video call while cat-sitting for her son at his house outside Stockholm, has been taken aback by the novel’s return to favour. For a long time, Sundström tried to distance herself from Engagement, as writers will of their most famous book. But readers wouldn’t let her forget, and now, with publication of the first English translation, the million-plus-selling novelist and translator is enjoying a resurgence. Recently, says Sundström, “a young woman – in her 50s, which is young to me nowadays! – told me she had been given the book as a present from her father at 16 and it had changed her life. It had made her feelseen.” Sundström shrugs as if to say: this is nuts, but what can you do?Engagement is not, after all, a traditional love story, but a study of a young woman’s fierce resistance to what she feels is the oppressive effect of being loved by a man. Martina and Gustav meet at college. Gustav wants their relationship to progress along traditional lines, an ambition that, Martina feels, risks leading her like a sleepwalker into a tedious, conventional life. At the casual level the pair’s relationship is loving and stable, but, observes Martina caustically, “Gustav is building so many structures on top of it that it’s shaking underneath them”. She wants to be loved but she also wants to be alone. She wants Gustav to stop repeating himself. When he asks her what’s wrong, she muses, “you can’t answer something like that. You can’t tell someone who wants to be with you always that he should be reasonable and ration himself out a little – if I saw you half as often, I would like you four times as much – no, you can’t say that.”The novel is often described as a “feminist classic”, which Sundström resists – the implication being that any political objective undermines its integrity as a novel. “Feminist books ordinarily end with a happy divorce.And this doesn’t.” Instead, Engagement is a dense, thoughtful book that takes on questions of sex, boredom, self-esteem and what Sundström calls, “the moral issue; the question of can you treat another person this way, the way Martina [treats Gustav]? At the end, she herself comes to the conclusion that you can’t, it isn’t right. She can’t go on exploiting him, because he’s helplessly in love with her.” The book is less about the experience of loving someone than about being theobjectof love, and given current discussions around young women “decentring men” and “heteropessimism”, it is a startlingly modern novel.It is also a dark comedy, something Sundström says tends to be overlooked. “It is a funny book! I often regretted that reviewers failed to mention that aspect.” How could it not be? Sundströmherself is full of merriment.She turns 80 this summer and says, “I can’t believe it myself. Most of my friends are more or less the same age, and none of us can believe it. We are the young ones, aren’t we?”With her pageboy hairstyle and unlined face, she could be comfortably 20 years younger. (“Genes,” she says, flatly.) At the beginning of our conversation, Sundström mentions she is going through old diaries wondering what to keep and what to burn.“I’m cleaning up with the perspective of soon dying,” she says, matter of factly,and although thegentle art of Swedish death cleaningis a well-known phenomenon, it strikes me that even for a Swede, Sundström is thrillingly, inspiringly brisk.We’ve had a backlash, and unfortunately we were freer in my generation than in my children’sLike her protagonist, she is also immune from groupthink to the point of awkwardness. In the novel, Martina wonders: “How can it be that most people lack self-confidence? And how can it be that I have enough self-confidence for an entire army? Of course I am beautiful and intelligent, at least intelligent enough to consider myself pretty enough – but that doesn’t usually help, does it?” It is still mildly confronting to read a young woman calmly assessing herself in this way, and Martina’s confidence is Sundström’s, the development of which goes all the way back to two key influences in her childhood. She was a great reader and identified most with swashbuckling heroes – the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Three Musketeers. And, along with her family, she attended a progressive Swedish church. “I grew up imagining that, to God, we are all equal and that my relationship to God, if I had one, was just as important as any man’s.”Sundström’s political development as a feminist, meanwhile, was influenced by the cautionary tale of her mother’s life. Sundström’s father was a journalist, while her mother gave up work to raise Sundström and her sister in what, looking back, the novelist calls “a kind of tragedy”. Although she was never bitter, Sundström recognises that she was, “in a way, disappointed”.The hardship of her mother’s generation makes Sundström sceptical of some aspects of the modern feminist movement, which she thinks has failed to acknowledge just how much has been gained. “We’ve had a backlash. Unfortunately, we were freer in my generation than in my children’s.My daughter told me she’s envious of my youth in that respect. They are much more concerned about their looks than we had to be back then. So many young people don’t have self-confidence nowadays.”Sundström started writing as a child, in journals and diaries, and at some point in late adolescence started to feel that it was inevitable she would write a book. In 1966, she published Student-64, a novel of rebellious youth, and 10 years later came Engagement, her third novel and a huge and instant hit. Since then, she has written 14 further books, six of them for children, and in a tone of dismay wonders if becoming a novelist was perhaps a mistake. She is also a translator and found working alongside Kathy Saranpa, the English translator for the new edition of Engagement, an interesting exercise in learning to let go. (After the interview, Sundström emails to correct several English words she used and for which she has thought of more precise translations.)“I’m very good at Swedish language, and I regret a bit that I didn’t devote my life to linguistics instead of literature,” she says. “It’s awful to say, but I don’t think literature is all that interesting. There are more interesting things in life. Language; etymologies; the developing of different languages.” In Swedish, the novel is calledMaken(The Husband) and she wonders if “Mate” would’ve been a better title in English. “I learned that ‘mate’ was originally written with a ‘k’. So it is ‘make’, originally.” There is a puzzled silence. “But that doesn’t help.” Or, she wonders, “‘Uncoupling’: I think that would’ve been pretty adequate. Both as a criticism of the idea of coupledom, and also the problems of divorcing.”Not living with my partner is the ideal. To be a couple, to see each other when we wish, and still have our own livesSundström herself has been divorced for 30 years and for the past few decades has had a romantic partner with whom she doesn’t live. “To me,” she says, “it’s the ideal; to be a couple, and to see each other when we wish, and still have our own lives. And not least because each of us has children with different parents. I never wanted to be a stepmother, and I didn’t want him to be a stepfather to my children because they had their own father.” Although, she adds, “I’m very thankful for the years I was in a family in the traditional way.” She recalls driving with her husband at the wheel and two children in the back thinking how lucky she was. “An ideal! And it’s me!”This is a classic example of Sundström’s resistance to any one hard and fast position. She gravitates naturally away from political orthodoxy and believes – the translator’s curse, perhaps – there is always more than one way to see things. “By nature, I’m allergic to everything that is the truth of the day,” she says. “You know, everybody writes the same things in the papers. For example, the #MeToo movement; it wasn’t possible to make any objections in that discussion. I would never have said anything publicly then, but I didn’t feel quite happy about it; these demonstrations against the Swedish Academy [which awards the Nobel prize in literature], organised as a kind of feminist action. I felt very strange [about] all that; it seemed simplifying. All conflicts can’t be seen in that context.”These are the ambiguities Sundström tackles so well in her fiction, where she can allow all the nuances absent in the headlines to play out. She created Engagement’s Martina as neither heroine nor cautionary tale, which is why she continues to be surprised at the fervour with which some young women take her up as a role model. A few years ago, she says, “I met a young girl who showed me her copy of Maken, and it was full of Post-its. And she said, ‘When I’m in trouble, or unsure of something, I think: what would Martina say?’” Sundström looks astonished. “I don’t know if I am supposed to be happy about that. Not for a moment was it my intention to propagate anything at all.”Instead, she conceived of the book while going through a period of being single, wondering about the long-term prospects of any relationship, and thinking that, as the culture war around marriage and divorce in the 1970s took hold, it might be good grist for a novel. “In 1976 the Swedish king got married, and all of us radicals, of course, were republicans – I have been a member of the republican association for as long as I can remember. And although [regard for the monarchy] wasn’t as mad as it is in Britain, I really was depressed about people engaging with that bloody wedding. And me walking around feeling single.” She laughs. “This idea of coupledom is even more oppressing to young people today than it was in my day. That means it is very oppressing.”We return to the subject of death. Sundström’s parents were unhistrionic about it too, she says. “My mother was a widow for five years, and when she was in hospital, I asked her: ‘Are you afraid of dying?’ And she seemed surprised at the question. ‘No! Why should I be?’” They didn’t talk about her being reunited with Sundström’s father, which is something, she notes disapprovingly, that people extend to their cats and dogs these days. “Imagine... what a crowd.” As it was, her parents, “were both so very calm, because they had lived in the conviction that this world isn’t the only one”.This is not what Sundström believes. And yet, thanks to those admirable, religious people in her background, she sees the world much as they did, in terms of social engagement. If she was young now, she says, “I’d be a Greta Thunberg”. For Sundström, to look at the world and see potential for something better puts the novelist and the activist in a single category: those with the ability “to imagine something else than this world”.Engagement by Gun-Britt Sundström, translated by Kathy Saranpa, is published by Penguin Modern Classics (£18.99).

Later photograph: Simon Webb/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Kit Hall. Archive photograph: courtesy of Susie McCabeBorn in Glasgow in 1980, Susie McCabe began her career in standup comedy in the early 2010s, quickly gaining recognition on the Scottish comedy circuit. The 2024 winner of the Sir Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow award, McCabe has supported Kevin Bridges and John Bishop on tour and, along with Frankie Boyle and Christopher Macarthur-Boyd, hosts the podcast Here Comes the Guillotine. Her show, Femme Fatality,is on iPlayernow. She performs her new show Best Behaviour at Edinburgh fringe from 30 July to 24 August.I’m three years oldand in my late nana’s ground-floor tenement Glasgow flat. She would have knitted that tank top, and the toy in my hand was a little monkey that my mum bought me as a present. Apparently I used to be obsessed with putting its feet in its mouth – I’m sure a therapist could have a field day with that.As for the expression, I look utterly miserable. My parents had tried to make me look like a sweet wee girl, putting me next to a little doll, when really I was a tomboy. That face is very much: “Nah, not having it.”My nan’s flat was my happy place. She and I were best friends, for ever. She was an unassuming person who would show her love with food rather than words. An independent, non-judgmental woman with the heart of a lion, and, without doubt, the biggest influence in my life.In gay clubs, people would coalesce around you. Suddenly, I had a whole community of people who would look out for meI knew very early on that I was different from the other girls. Everyone else did, too. Dad would ask: “Why won’t you just wear a dress? Why can’t you just stay clean? Why do you always have a football under your arm?” At school I was popular and had plenty of friends, but there were a couple of kids who tried to bully me a wee bit. All I’ll say is, I soon sorted that out.When I was at primary school, my hair used to go all the way down my back. It was thick and Mum used to plait it every morning. The pain! I had a massive Tonka truck that I took into school one day, and while I was running it through my hair, strands got tangled in the wheels. We had no other choice but to cut huge clumps out of it, but I was so relieved – as well as the tomboy thing, long hair is difficult when you’re running about trying to play football with the boys, who are also trying to pull your plaits.There was so much about my adolescence that was great – I loved to play football and rugby, and I had good teachers and friends. But I was also trying to deal with my sexuality. I was brought up Roman Catholic in the west of Scotland, duringsection 28. It was not a particularly easy time to come out. My mum and dad were not overtly homophobic, but there was not much information about the reality of being gay out there. TheBrookside kisswas pretty monumental, but before that there were so many negative connotations about being gay in the media, just scandals about gay priests.To deal with my sexuality, I smoked a lot of cannabis. Sport gave me a healthy outlet, thankfully. I also had good friends who supported me when I came out. When I told my parents, however, they put me out of the house, so I moved in with my nana. I stayed with her for two years and I worked in a jeans shop and then a gay bar.In many ways, those were some of the happiest days in my life: being gay was still a backstreet thing in the 90s – there was no holding hands in public. In gay clubs, however, people would coalesce around you. Suddenly, I had a whole community of people who would look out for me. After about two years, my parents accepted that my sexuality wasn’t a phase. It wasn’t always easy, especially for my dad, but he got there in the end.Growing up, I wanted to be a sports scientist and a physiotherapist. I told my parents this, and in true working-class Scottish style, they replied: “University is not for you.” Even though I had the intelligence to have gone, I don’t think I had the bandwidth to work hard as I was so caught up in having to come out. Instead, Dad made three other career suggestions. The first was: “Why don’t you be a police officer?” To which I replied: “Because snitches get stitches.” The next was: “Why don’t you join the air force like your brother?” My reply was: “Yeah, because I’msogood with authority.” Plus, this was 1998 – a time when homosexuals couldn’t even join the military. His third was: “Why don’t you be an air stewardess?” Wasn’t keen on that one, either. I am not a morning person. I’ve barely made myself a cup of tea by 6am, never mind making one for a plane full of people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In the summer of 2010, when a friend was diagnosed with cancer, it was a stark reminder that time is short and I should challenge myself. A friend suggested I try comedy. Well, the exact phrase was, “Shitebag if you don’t.” When someone says that to you at school in Scotland, you absolutely have to do it, and, even in adulthood, I feel the same necessity. So, I signed up for an eight-week course and did my first gig. Right away I knew, this is the thing I am meant to do.I was gigging for eight and half years, selling out solo shows and headlining clubs, when I eventually realised I was on the precipice and had to jump. Within a month of giving up my day job, I got signed to a comedy management company. I remember a year or so after, driving down the motorway and thinking: “I wonder what day it is?” I checked and it was Friday. I thought: “I’m living the dream.” When you work for a living you always know when it’s Friday and when it’s Monday. As a self-employed comedian, I was working seven days a week, with no days off, but it didn’t matter.Eighties pop diva Tiffany looks back: ‘I didn’t want to record I Think We’re Alone Now, but my girlfriends loved it’Read moreThis industry is a marathon– very few people break into it overnight. Even if you find fame on TikTok, you still have to put in the work: the gigs, the grind, learning your stagecraft. I grew up playing football with men and spent years working in building sites alongside them. That experience, always being the only woman in the room, built my resilience and determination. Those early gigs could have been tough – miners’ clubs, bowling clubs, golf clubs – mostly rooms full of white, bald heads. At first, I knew they might see me as “other”: a wee gay woman with a mic. I also knew that, deep down, we weren’t all that different. Once I started talking, I could get them onside. The first two minutes might be rough, but if you speak your truth, the walls come down. There’s nothing really separating us.While I am still that funny wee girl in the photo, there have been quite a lot of major life events recently that have made me feel like an adult. I had a heart attack on the way to the fringe last year, my wife and I separated, and my dad died in June. In life you get served curveballs, but I am very fortunate to be surrounded by decent people and living in a decent part of the world. Plus, it means my next show is going to be great.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyLGBTQ+ rightsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they’re better thought of as just another species of misinformationSteven PooleSun 20 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 16.42 EDTShareAhead of the 2016 US presidential election, opinion polls predicted a win for Hillary Clinton. She lost, and the polling industry went through one of its regular spasms of self-criticism and supposed reform. Alas, it did not vote itself entirely out of existence. France and Spain ban the publication of opinion polls in the days leading up to an election, but we should go one better and ban their publication at any time.No doubt it adds much to the gaiety of the British nation to see the Conservative party slip to third or fourth in the polls, but any poll asking who you would vote for if there were a Westminster election tomorrow, held at a time when there almost certainly will not be an election for another four years, is meaningless as a guide to the makeup of the next Parliament.If polls were simply useless that would be no reason to ban them, though. A better reason is that they are actively harmful: a species of misinformation that pollutes the public sphere.One fundamental problem, recognised long ago, is that there is no such thing as “the public”, thought of as a hive mind with a single homogeneous view. To report the results of any poll as “the British public thinks…” is simply a falsehood, except perhaps in the unlikely circumstance that fully 100% of respondents agree on some point. There is, for the same reason, no such thing as “the will of the British people”, a spectre conjured into being only when something very dubious is being proposed.So what is it exactly that opinion polls measure? A random sample, hopefully statistically reliable, of differing and irreconcilable opinions. Not informed opinions exclusively, of course, but also the opinions of conspiracy theorists, the news-phobic and the merely deranged. By such a scientific operation we may uncover the valuable truths that a third of Conservative voters wouldprefer to see Nigel Farage as prime minister, while 7% of American men believe they couldbeat a grizzly bearin unarmed combat.The way you ask the question can profoundly influence the outcomeA deeper question is whether polls actually create, in whole or in part, what they purport to be revealing. Does everyone go around with settled, reasoned views on every hot-button issue of the day, just waiting to be revealed by a questioning pollster? The answer was clear to the American journalist Walter Lippmann in his 1922 book Public Opinion. It is unrealistic, he argued, to expect people to be able to form “sound public opinions on the whole business of government”, and they shouldn’t actually have to. “It is extremely doubtful whether many of us would … take the time to form an opinion on ‘any and every form of social action’ which affects us.”The act of asking a question, though, heightens the importance of the subject in the mind of the questionee, creating an urge to have one’s say where there might previously have been neither urge nor say at all. As Walter Bagehot, the 19th-century political theorist and editor of the Economist, once observed: “It has been said that if you can only get a middle-class Englishman to think whether there are ‘snails in Sirius’, he will soon have an opinion on it.” As though to prove him right, in 1980 a third of American respondents helpfullyoffered their viewon whether the “1975 Public Affairs Act” should be repealed, even though that legislation did not actually exist.The way you ask the question, moreover, can profoundly influence the outcome. A 1989studyby the American social scientist Kenneth A Rasinski found that varying verbal framings of political issues changed the outcome: “More support was found for halting crime than for law enforcement, for dealing with drug addiction than for drug rehabilitation, and for assistance to the poor than for welfare.” Other such experiments have shown that the order of questioning also matters, that Americans express more support for government surveillance if terrorism is mentioned in the question, and that nearly twice as many people think that the government “should not forbid speeches against democracy” than it “should allow speeches against democracy”, though the options are exactly equivalent.Modern opinion polls, then, are part of the machinery behind the “manufacture of consent”, a phrase originally coined by Lippmann to describe the propaganda operations of politicians and the press. It is no accident, after all, that George Gallup had been an advertising man, with the Madison Avenue firm Young & Rubicam, before he helped to pioneer the methods of systematic opinion polling by borrowing from market research and PR. In 1936, Gallup and his colleagues correctly predicted the election of Franklin D Roosevelt, proving the old-fashioned forecasting methods outdated. Using the “new instrument” of polling, he declared happily in 1938, “the will of the majority of citizens can be ascertained at all times”. This was, of course, partly by way of advertising his own commercial interest as founder, in 1935, of the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Poll). His fellow pollster Elmo Roper described their nascent industry as “a veritable goldmine”.Profitable it may be, but the constant drizzle of polling also incentivises short-term, knee-jerk decision-making by governments. A leader may make a hasty policy change merely in response to a poll, and then if the polling improves, take that as proof that the new policy is correct. Keir Starmer was no doubt cheered when, following his Enoch Powell-adjacent speech on immigration in May, polling found that “more Britons [now] believe that the government wants to reduce net migration”. But a policy designed to massage approval ratings over the course of weeks is not always going to be the same as a good policy that will last years.It would be invidious after all this not to mention one consideration that strongly favours opinion polls, which is that they provide a steady stream of pseudo-news to the media. If each day did not bring a new revelation about the imaginary public’s confected opinion on one or another issue, there would be much less for news programmes to report on.

So why on earth is it allowed to continue? The answer is moral relativismSun 20 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 13.08 EDTShareThe quest for peace in major conflicts has rarely been so desperate and so seemingly futile. In Gaza, talk of ceasefires, truces and pauses typically ends in tears. In Ukraine, the war is now well into its fourth year withno end in sight, despite Donald Trump’s new 50-day deadline. Syriaburns anew. Sudan’s horrors never cease. Last year, state-based conflicts reached a peak –61 across 36 countries. It was the highest recorded total since 1946. This year could be worse.The sheer scale and depravity of war crimes and other conflict-zone atrocities is extraordinary. The deliberate, illegal targeting and terrorising of civilians, the killing, maiming and abduction of children, and the use of starvation, sexual violence, torture and forced displacement as weapons of war have grown almost routine. Israel’skilling last weekof children queueing for water in Gaza was shocking, made doubly so by the fact that scenes like this have become so commonplace.“Blessed are the peacemakers,” said Saint Matthew, but today, impartial mediators are in wickedly short supply. Surely everyone agrees: murdering and massacring innocents is morally indefensible. So why on earth is it allowed to continue? This same question is shouted out loud by grief-stricken parents in Rafah, Kyiv and Darfur, by UN relief workers, in pulpits, pubs and parliaments, in street protestsand at Glastonbury. Why? WHY?The curse of moral relativism provides a clue. The fact is, not everyone does agree. What is absolutely morally indefensible to one group of people is relatively permissible or justifiable to another. This has held true throughout human history. Yet today’s geopolitically and economically divided world is also ethically and morally fractured to a possibly unparalleled degree. Agreed, observed standards – what the American writer David Brooks terms a “permanent moral order” – are lacking.The collapse of the international rules-based order is mirrored by this crisis of the moral order. Without accepted universal principles, the peaceful settlement of conflicts, foreign or domestic, becomes highly problematic. “We have no objective standard by which to determine that one view is right and another view is wrong. So public arguments just go on indefinitely, at greater levels of indignation and polarisation,” Brooks argues. What’s left is coercion and manipulation.No individual better personifies the moral-relativist confusion permeating contemporary life than Trump, the master coercer and manipulator. He believes, for example, that he deserves the 2025 Nobel peace prize. Yet Trump, in collusion with Israel, did bomb Iran recently, andkilled numerous civilians. In his morally muddled view, that illegal act of aggression was justified because it restored the peace he had just broken.In a world wedded to war, Alfred Nobel’s venerable peace prize looksincreasingly anachronistic– and politicised. Barack Obama won it in 2009 for doing nothing. If only Trump would do nothing for the next four years. Worse, he has been nominatedby Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, arch foe to peace and morality. It might be preferable to replace the prize with a Warlord of the Year award – and put a bounty on the winner’s head.Making a moral case for peace can be confusing, even controversial; ask any church or mosque leader. For many people, it seems, morality is a dirty word these days. It’s fungible, negotiable and emotive – a matter primarily of individual choice and cultural belonging, not of duty, obligation or fidelity to a higher law. How else to explain why so many Americans turn a blind eye to Trump’s astounding moral turpitude, illustrated againby the Jeffrey Epstein affair? Social identity trumps social conscience.Much of the Russian public suffers from a similarlychronic moral deficiencywhen contemplating Vladimir Putin’s devastation of Ukraine. Intimidated dissenters avoid the subject. Others believe the disinformation fairytales spun by regime-controlled media. The majority inhabits astate of profound ignoranceabout the crimes committed in their name. When it’s over, Russians may claim, like Germans in 1945, that they didn’t know. Amorality is mitigated by mendacity.Israel’s denial of peace in Palestine also comes at a high moral cost. Its reputation is in shreds, its prime minister has an arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes. Antisemitism is surging internationally as a direct result. How can so many Israelis live with their army’s Gaza rampage, with thespectre of 58,000 corpses? Some say it would all stop if only the last hostages were freed; others that all Palestinians are Hamas. Some on the far right, forgetting their country’s history, suggest theidea of a Palestinian nation is fiction. They want all 2 million of Gaza’s residents caged inone huge concentration camp.Many Israelis passionately disagree. They desire peace. Their failure to force a change in government policy is moral as well as political. Also at fault are Americans, Russians and all in Britain and Europe, politicians and the public, who fail to speak out, who look the other way, who excuse the inexcusable for reasons of state or personal comfort – or who claim that murder and mayhem, wherever they occur, are relatively morally tolerable if committed, as argued by Saint Thomas Aquinas, in the prosecution of a “just war”.This very modern failure, this retreat into subjective, made-to-measure morality, this renunciation of shared responsibility, is reversible. Universal ethical standards still apply. They are defined by the Geneva conventions, by other secular instruments of international law, through religious faith and through the social contract. They should be respected and strengthened. They are necessary, sometimes inconvenient truths.Ordinary people in ordinary times may pick and choose their moral battles. But ending major conflicts, and easing the suffering of millions, is a moral imperative that demands a determined collective response from all concerned. That way lies peace. That way lies salvation.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rain Newton-Smith, another economist, has the task of repairing the CBI’s scandal-rocked reputation as its director general.Two of the four deputy governors of the Bank of England are women, too – as are the leaders of a string of powerful trades unions.This female takeover has been a quiet and matter-of-fact one – but it marks a significant change, very noticeable upon returning to covering the field, after a few years away.It has not yet been reflected in the gender balance of students picking economics at GCSE, A-level or as a degree, unfortunately.Research commissioned by the Bank of Englandshowed this year that economics classes at all levels remain about 70% male.But if anything, that makes it all the more striking that many of the most authoritative voices we will hear, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget, will be female.Aside from straightforward fairness, there are at least three potential benefits of this feminisation of the economic debate.The first, which Reeves herself has talked about directly, is the simple power of example: giving girls and young women the perception they could do jobs such as these.And while it must have been shattering, shedding a few tears at the dispatch box was a powerful part of that: many women of every age will have identified with her.Women just do cry more than men (a YouGov poll in 2015found that 45% of women had cried at least once a month in the past year; for men, it was 11%). This has zero bearing on their ability to do their job – and if anything, may point to sincerity, rather than insouciance.Whatever you think of their policies, Theresa May’s tears as she resigned, surely reflected better on her character than David Cameron’s jaunty little hum.A second potential benefit of having women at the top of economic policymaking should be better decision-making.Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now senior research fellow at thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, recalls that back in the 1980s “there were virtually no women around the table making tax policy decisions, and it was very interesting, because almost all the senior people there had non-working wives”. She recalls being stared at if, as the junior official present, she piped up to ask how a particular policy might go down with women.Four decades later, Boris Johnson’s bloke-heavy government was apparently capable of similar myopia.When senior Cabinet Office official Helen MacNamara testified at the Covid inquiry, she argued that senior women’s voices were all but absent from decision-making in the pandemic. “Decisions were being taken where the impact on women was either lost or ignored,” she saidin her written evidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By contrast, she said, time was found to discuss the implications for “hunting, shooting and fishing”.Across today’s economic landscape, there are plenty of pressing issues women may feel particularly moved to pursue – not least thegender pay gap (13%), which Reeves has pledged to narrow, and its less-noticed sister, the gender pensions gap (standing at a shocking 35% for private pension savings), which the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, is expected to highlight in a speech on Monday.The third and more speculative potential upside of having more female economic policymakers, is a shift in the tone of debate.Not all women are moderate, or reasonable, or ground their arguments in the everyday – Liz Truss is certainly a counterexample – but I would gently suggest that on average, they tend to be a bit less prone to bluster, bravado, and what the kids call “main character syndrome”.That was why it was depressing on Tuesday to see Reeves at the Mansion House,describing regulation as the “boot on the neck”of British enterprise, in danger of “choking off” innovation.No doubt the violent language was aimed at grabbing headlines (which it did) and communicating a clear message to her City audience. But it was jarring to read such a brute phrase in a public speech by the UK’s most powerful woman.There is no shortage of tedious macho language around Keir Starmer – with anonymous briefers proudly telling columnists the prime minister’s politics are “hard Labour”, and accusing MPs of “knobheadery”.Perhaps as her crunch autumn budget approaches, Reeves can help the government to find a different, more relatable vocabulary.Judging by the comments of that mainly female panel at the Institute for Government debate on Labour’s first year in power last week, the debate in the coming months will be every bit as robust as ever.But it will be fascinating to see if it can be conducted in a different, calmer way: and perhaps more closely anchored to what MacNamara argued was missing from that shameful Johnson period: people, and families, and how people actually live their lives.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomics viewpointEconomicsRachel ReevesWomenGender pay gapGenderWomen in politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Maybe that’s why, according to aDutch gossip account, the Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt and his wife, the model AnneKee Molenaar, could be splitting up only a year after they got married. I’m being facetious: I don’t believe the position of a distant ball of iron and silicate in relation to other balls of stuff (yes, that’s the scientific term) is influencing anyone’s relationship, or anything else.Neither, apparently, does De Ligt. According to this rumour, he doesn’t share Molenaar’s interest in all things woo-woo – or “spiriwiri” as they call it in Dutch. There are signs that Molenaar is woo-curious on herInstagram account, which features crystals and a book on tarot; it also suggests she is starting a new-agey-sounding business called “Annie’s Alchemia”, though there is little more than a trademark registration to show for it publicly.The rules of age gap relationships? Here’s what we can learn from famous men | Arwa MahdawiRead moreObviously, this story could be absolute nonsense. But is being a bit “alternative” – getting into energy healing, aura reading or consulting clairvoyants – grounds for divorce? I, and probably you, have friends with unconventional beliefs (I often have to arrange my features into bland neutrality on matters of celestial alignment; they do the same when I claim the hens I keep are “intelligent”) and I’m fine with it.Surely you should be just as, if not more, accepting with your partner? Getting slightlyspiriwiriseems pretty harmless, plus Molenaar’strademark filingcovers everything from cookware to tealights, so maybe she is planning a woo-flavoured but hard-nosed commercial lifestyle brandà la Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop? That could just be common sense: footballing and modelling careers are short and it is wise to consider the future. In the meantime, though, if you are a strict rationalist, it might be annoying to come home having conceded a crucial equaliser to be told your root chakra is probably blocked and you should put black obsidian in your kit bag and burn palo santo sticks over your boots.Things do change in relationships, and not just one partner having a spiritual awakening or the other developing an intolerance to woo. How you manage this fascinates me, because at my time of life, it happens a lot.Midlifers who have long run on predictable rails suddenly veer off course; it starts to feel as if time is running out and we react by making dramatic changes. People explore their sexuality; they get into ultramarathons, environmental activism or, yes, crystals; they stop drinking, start microdosing or jack in accountancy to train as reiki healers. You think you know your beloved intimately, definitively, then one day they tell you they want an open relationship, believe in fairies, or, far more challenging, they have decided to take up golf. I’ve done it myself: I went vegan four years ago, a tough sell for my spouse, who hails from a place where dairy is a religion.How do you navigate that? Therapists would say cultivate compassion; stay open; be curious. I’ve seen, and admired, people doing that around me. But some change is impossible to be cool about: if your partner becomes a“red-pilled” manosphere content consumer, anti-vaxxer orconspiracy theorist, most of us would struggle. Even when it is not ideologically beyond the pale, change can be treacherous to navigate. Fear is baked in to our reactions. Will they still love us? Can we still love them? It’s happening with weight-loss drugs: it’s fascinating – chilling –reading how one partner taking them can throw a grenade into a couple’srelationship, feeding insecurities and eroding shared pleasures. I’m grateful that my husband gracefully accepted my tofu-bothering, even though it means we rarely eat the same meal.Your partner changing (and if you are lucky enough to grow older with a person you love, it will happen) tests your generosity, tolerance and communication skills and challenges your sense of self. Even if you are pretty solid on all counts, you might still run up against something you really can’t get past and end up uncoupling. Isn’t that terrifying when you think about it? It’s enough to make anyone turn to crystals.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsOpinionMarriageMiddle agecommentShareReuse this content"

That gives me hopeRhiannon Lucy CosslettPen names have a long history. Now Liadan Ní Chuinn is shunning publicity in an industry that demands ever more exposureSun 20 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhat’s in a pen name? Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn’s debut short story collection, Every One Still Here, is receivingrave reviewsandrapturous praise, but hardly anyone seems to know who they are. A cursory Google turns up no photos or biographical information. All we know is that the writer is Northern Irish and was born in 1998, the year of the Good Friday agreement.A statement from Irish publisher The Stinging Fly reads: “The Stinging Fly has been working with Liadan on these stories for the past four years. From early on in the process, they expressed a desire to publish their work under a pseudonym and to protect their privacy throughout the publication process. No photographs of the author are available and Liadan will not be participating in any in-person interviews or public events.”Writing anonymously or under a pseudonym is along-establishedcustom in publishing. Jane Austen’s novels were attributed to “a Lady”, Mary Ann Evans went by George Eliot, and the Brontë sisters were Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Although women no longer need to disguise themselves as men, and “the low trade of writing novels” is less stigmatised, the tradition of the pen name has continued throughout the 20th century into the present day: John Le Carré was really David Cornwell; Eric Blair became George Orwell; and no one has heard of Erika Leonard, but everyone has heard of EL James. When questions regardingthe veracity of nature memoir The Salt Pathcaused outrage among the nation’s book groups, the fact that the author had changed her and her husband’s names was the least remarkable revelation. If anything, it can feel more unusual to meet an author whose books have the name they were born with on the cover.In the world of modern publishing, the spectrum encompasses everything from “uses a pen name but has an author photo and gives interviews” to “has an opposite gender or gender-neutral author persona”; “uses different pseudonyms for different genres”; “uses a different name for political reasons, eg to escape persecution in their home country, or personal or professional reasons”; and even “secret anonymity” (is anonymous but tries to make it so that no one actually knows they are). Nepotist offspring will often use a less famous parent’s surname to stave off accusations that they owe their success to their connections or, as in the case of AS Byatt, an author may use their married name to distance themselves from a novelist sibling (Margaret Drabble).Envy, ego, pride and pain: what I learned from publishing my first book | Hamilton NolanRead moreTotal anonymity, however, is a different business. The most famous modern example we have is of course Elena Ferrante (or it was, until she was possibly and, to my mind, veryrudely unmaskedby an Italian journalist). Yet even Ferrante did some press through correspondence, including writingfor the Guardian. To not give interviews at all, especially as a young debut author, is unusual indeed, and especially in a publishing landscape where “personal brand” is key, and short stories remain such a hard sell. You could say that Liadan Ní Chuinn’s collection being published at all is something of a miracle.Literary quality is not always prioritised above profile. I cannot tell you how many proofs I am sent by writers who are big on Instagram but can’t string a grammatical sentence together. With publicity budgets not what they used to be and many authors needing to do much of the work themselves, a debut writer who won’t give interviews or attend events represents a challenge to any acquiring publishing house and their publicity department.I admire Ní Chuinn. As an author myself – in the next six months I have two books coming out – I know that the stress of exposure and the risk of burnout can be very real. Ní Chuinn could be forgiven for looking at Sally Rooney, another writer in the same literary ecosystem who started young, and thinking that level of exposure looks unappealing. The way a young woman – because it’s usually a young woman – who creates something great becomes a sort of shorthand for everything that is wrong/right about her chosen art form is hardly an incentive to put yourself out there. Rooney’s writing shows adeep ambivalenceabout fame, and her decision to now largely only put herself forward in the media when it serves her impassionedpolitical beliefsis to be admired. Yet newspapers are still terribly prone to what I call “Rooney-itis”. Look, I’m doing it now.When you’re an author, public exposure doesn’t just affect you, but the people in your life whose stories often overlap with yours. When you are writing about sensitive topics that have a lasting, painful legacy on real people’s lives – as Ní Chuinn does in their excavation of the murderous legacy of English colonialism in Ireland – it can be an act of care and protection to remove yourself from the spotlight.Most of all, it makes the interaction between author and reader purely about the quality of the work. For a publisher to agree to publish an anonymous author, as so many did Ferrante, and publishers in Ireland, the UK and the US have Ní Chuinn, that writer has to be extraordinary. And Ní Chuinn is.It should give any avid reader of fiction – and any author who cares about sentences but is rubbish at TikTok – hope. The work can still be the thing, at least sometimes.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionShort storiesPublishingFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

But his story was crafted to cushion uneaseSun 20 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.01 EDTShareWe’ve entered the era of the superhero movie as sermon. No longer content with saving the world, spandex saviors are now being used to explain, moralize and therapize it. And a being from Krypton has shown up once again in a debate about real life; about borders, race and who gets to belong.Superman. Of all symbols.I’ve read reactionary thinkpieces, rage-filled quote tweets and screeds about the legal status of a fictional alien – enough to lose count. This particular episode of American Fragility kicked off because James Gunn had the audacity to call Superman “the story of America”. An immigrant, by definition, as he was always meant to be.What set things off wasn’t just the sentiment – it was who said it, and how plainly. Gunn, now headlining DC’s cinematic future, told the Sunday Times that Superman was “an immigrant who came from other places and populated the country”. He spoke of Superman’s inherent kindness as a political statement in itself, noting that the film would play differently in some parts of America before adding, bluntly, that “there are some jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness”. “But screw them,” he added. It was that line – less the immigrant metaphor, more the unapologetic framing – that sent the usual outrage machine into motion.Enter Dean Cain, a former TV Superman. Cain accused Gunn of politicizing the character, which is remarkably foolish, considering Superman’s been swatting at fascism since 1941. Meanwhile, over at Fox News, it’sbeen a full meltdownover the idea that Superman, canonically not of this Earth, might be played as … not of this Earth. Liberal brainwashing, they suggested. Identity politics in a cape.Superman: identity crises, fascist space holograms and a super furry animal – discuss with spoilersRead moreBut have they actually looked at David Corenswet? The man looks like he was made to sell oat milk in a Ralph Lauren ad. All cheekbones and cleft chin. If this is the foreign body in question, no wonder middle America has historically shrugged over Supes being an immigrant by definition.Even still, there’s something telling about any collective gasp over a white, blue-eyed man with an immigrant backstory. The scramble to defend him says more than intended. For all the hand-wringing over Superman’s alienness, what rarely gets named is how meticulously his story was crafted to cushion the unease of the topic at hand: otherness itself – the very thing people pretend was always central to his character.There are plenty of ways to frame the ridiculousness of this argument, clever ways to connect the dots, but the real fracture in Superman’s myth hits, oddly enough, during a quiet scene in Tarantino’s meditation on vengeance, Kill Bill: Vol. 2.In the scene, the villain, Bill (David Carradine) unpacks what makes Superman different from every other hero.“What Kent wears – the glasses, the business suit – that’s the costume,” Bill says. “That’s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us.”It’s one hell of a tell – the kind of observation that pulls back the curtain on how Superman was engineered to understand the world, and how the world, in turn, reinforced how he should fit within it.From the start, Superman was never meant to be an outsider. His creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster – sons of Jewish immigrants – didn’t craft him as a symbol of difference but as a projection of pure Americanness. They gave him a midwestern upbringing, an Anglo name in Clark Kent, and that square-jawed charm.Siegel and Shuster were working against the backdrop of unchecked antisemitism, at a time when Jewish immigrants faced hostility. But instead of exploring immigrant “otherness”, the artists imagined a version of America where that alienness could be easily discarded via an outfit change. Superman wasn’t an outsider – he was the ideal immigrant, effortlessly slipping into a world that required no resistance. His story wasn’t about struggling to belong, but about the fantasy of belonging, with the privilege of choosing whether or not to fight for it.That projection of safe, silent Americanness hasn’t remained confined to the pages of comic books. Today’s immigration politics run on the same fantasy. The myth of the “good” immigrant – quiet, grateful, easy to assimilate – still runs wild. It’s the same story that fuels the strange spectacle of politicians praising white South African farmers as victims of racial persecution, all while demonizing migrants from Latin America, the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa.The notion of who deserves to stay has always been racialized, selective and violent. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said that aperson’s physical appearancecould be a factor in the decision to question them. He later said it could not be“the sole reason”. But in April, Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a US-born citizen from Georgia, wasdetained in Floridaeven after his mother showed authorities his birth certificate. In New York, Elzon Lemus, an electrician, was stopped because he “looked like someone” agents were after. Maybe he didn’t wear his suit and glasses that day.Superman, the immigrant who makes people comfortable, has never been just a comic book character. He’s been a metaphor and living testament to the kind of “other” that wealthy nations have always preferred: those who blend in, assimilate and rarely challenge the systems that demand their silence.If you’re still not convinced that Superman’s assimilationist fantasy is alive and well, just look at a White House meme from 10 July 2025: Trump dressed as Superman, with the words ‘Truth. Justice. The American Way.’ It’s a glaring example of how cultural symbols are repurposed – hijacked, really – to serve a narrow and self-congratulatory vision of America. That’s the trick of Superman: he’s been a blank canvas of a both-sides heroism, which makes everyone feel seen.You don’t even need to like or dislike Superman for the Maga debate to pull you in, as it was always meant to. The culture war still appointed a celebrity to govern the most powerful nation on Earth. It still turned a corporate diversity initiative into a national crisis. And it took a serious conversation about immigration and made a polished, all-American character its face. The culture war distorts, and it continues, relentless as ever.Noel Ransome is a Toronto-based freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSupermanOpinionMigrationUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

They (and I) have spent too much time simply denouncing or pathologizing him and far too little time learning from him.And there is a lot to learn.Not since the middle of the twentieth century, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt led a constitutional revolution,has any president achieved so much of his agenda in so short a time. But to recognize Trump’s political genius is not to say that it has been put to good use or that he has been a good president.Like others whosee“connections and possibilities in circumstances that even people who are smart in conventional ways do not see,” the president has shown himself to be adept at reading the temper of the times, exploiting weaknesses in others, and assembling a coalition of the faithful that others would have never thought possible. What PittNews’Grace Longworthwrote last September has been confirmed since he returned to the Oval Office.“Trump is not as crazy or dumb as his opposition would like to believe he is,” Longsworth said.Trump’s genius is demonstrated by his ability to transform “calamitous errors into political gold”. In the past six months, he has continued to do what he has done since he first appeared on the national political scene. From then until now, hehas convinced millions of Americans to buy into his version of eventsand not to believe what they see with their eyes.Insurrectionists become patriots. Law-abiding immigrants become threats to America’s way of life. Journalists become “enemies of the people”.It’s magic.Of course, the last six months have not been all smooth sailing for the president, whois now embroiledin a controversy about releasing material about the child sexual offenderJeffrey Epstein.But Trump succeeds because he is undaunted by critics and unfazed by the kinds of barriers that would throw any ordinary politician off their game. When necessary, hemakesthings up and repeats them until what he says seems to be real.None of this is good for democracy.Trump has done what millions of Americanswantdone: transform the political system. He has not been afraid to call into question constitutional verities. The greatest, and most dangerous, achievement of the president’s first six months has been reshaping the balance of power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.The president has activated a political movement that has produced what Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackermandescribesas “constitutional moments.” In those moments, fundamental political change happens without any formal change in the language of the Constitution itself.“Normal politics is temporarily suspended in favor of a ‘constitutional politics,’ focused on fundamental principles.” Since January, the Trump administration’s actions have indeed focused the attention of the nation on such principles.Like it or not, Donald Trump isturningthe constitution on its head, changing it from a Republican to an authoritarian document. And with every passing day, we see that transformation happening.The Republican majority in Congressseems eagerto let the president reshape the constitution and take on functions that it clearly assigns to the legislature. Tariffs, Congress is supposed to decide. Dissolving executive departments, Congress is supposed to decide. War powers, they belong to Congress.But you’d never know any of that from the way the president has behaved since 20 January.The supreme courthas followed suit, giving its blessing to his aggressive assertions of executive authority even when they violate the clear meaning of the constitution. The court even severely limited the role of the lower courts bydenyingthem the right to issue nationwide injunctions to stop the president from acting illegally.Beyond Congress and the court, it seems clear that pro-democracy forces did not do all they could have to prepare for this moment. Trump’s opponents have not learned from Trump how to effectively counter his “constitutional moment”.So what can we do?We can learn from Trump the importance of telling a simple, understandable story and sticking to it. Pro-democracy forcesneed to pick a message and repeat it again and again to drive it home. There is surely no one in America who has not heard the phrase Make America Great Again and does not associate Maga with Trump. We can learn to appeal to national pride and drive home that national greatness requires addressing the daily experiences of ordinary Americans in language of the kind they use.Make America Affordable Again. Make America Work Again for Everyone. Think X, Instagram, and what works on a podcast.Pro-democracy forces can learn to be as determined and undaunted in defense of democracy as the president has been in his assault on it.Take off the gloves. Show your teeth, take no prisoners. Trump has shown that it matters to voters not just what you stand for but alsohowyou go about standing for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Remember Trump has gotten to where he is not by being an acolyte of Republican orthodoxy but by being a heretic.Inthe age of loneliness, pro-democracy forces need to give people the sense that theyare caught up in a great cause.We can learn from the president that if the pro-democracy movement is to succeed, it needs to offer its own version of constitutional reform. Stop talking about preserving the system and start talking about changing it in ways that will make government responsive and connect it to the lives that people live.The six-month mark in his second term is a good moment to dedicate or rededicate ourselves to that work.What’s giving me hope nowEvery Friday since April, I have organized a Stand Up for Democracy protest in the town where I live. People show up.They hold signs and cometo bear witness, even if what they do will not convert anyone to democracy’s cause. They want to affirm their belief that democracy matters, and they want to do so publicly.Some are fearful, worried that they will somehow be punished for participating, but they show up.In addition, Harvard University’s willingnessto resistthe Trump administration’s demands that threatened academic freedom and institutional independence set a powerful example. Whether or not the university reaches an agreement with the administration, Harvard’s examplewill still matter.It is also true, as Axiosreports, that protests against Trump administrationpolicies and allies “have attracted millions in the last few months: Tesla Takedown in March, Hands Off! and 50501 in April, May Day, No Kings Day in June, and Free America on Independence Day”. Another mass event, “Good Trouble Lives On,” occurred on 17 July, “commemorating the fifth anniversary of the death of civil rights leader and former Rep John Lewis”.Those events need to happen more frequently than once a month. But they are a start.Axios cites Professor Gloria J Browne-Marshall, who reminds us that “effective protesting often starts with an emotional response to policy or an event, swiftly followed by strategy … The current movement is reaching that second stage”. In that stage, it has a chance to “‘actually make change in the government’.”I think that the seeds of that kind of opposition have been planted. But there is no time to waste if we are to prevent Trump’s political ingenuity from succeeding in permanently reshaping the institutions and practices of our constitutional republic towards authoritarianism.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFighting BackTrump administrationProtestActivismUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

What value do I have?”The transition from a life of structured achievement to one of open-ended possibility is profound. For those accustomed to influence and achievement, finding new meaning requires more than just financial planning. When work has defined who you are for decades, retirement can trigger surprising emotional and cognitive challenges.Despite living on opposite sides of the globe and working in different industries and roles, Martin’s experiences were echoed by John, who recently stepped away from corporate life and a highly successful leadership career. “I have no regrets, I’ve succeeded, travelled and performed. But now, I feel quite lost.”The retirement identity gapFor both men, the feeling of being lost has been unpleasant, unsettling and isolating. They have found themselves “in between” identities, neither fully in their previous life nor settled into the next chapter.We know from psychological research that the space between work and retirement can be a profound challenge to one’s self-concept. It is particularly difficult for people who have succeeded in knowledge-based professions where cognitive performance and expertise are fundamental to professional identity: what do you do when you stop thinking for a living?“I went from having a demanding schedule with people depending on my expertise to suddenly having endless free time. It sounds like a luxury, but it felt more like falling off a cliff.” Martin was coping with the lost and “falling-off” feeling by taking on an ever-increasing list of projects, and John was grappling with a strong urge to “do one more business”. “I still have plenty of gas in the tank, maybe I’m not ready for a slower life.”The assumption prior to retirement that more time will automatically translate to greater fulfilment is common, but as Martin and John are finding, not necessarily true – especially when that time lacks the structure, purpose and community that a previous work life provided.Researchers havefound thathaving a lot of free time doesn’t necessarily equate to happiness. People derive a certain sense of joy from being productive and accomplishing things and might lose this sense of joy with a lot of unstructured time.Otherresearchers have shownthat retirees who maintain a strong social network – for example volunteering or joining clubs – are happier and healthier, while thelongitudinal Harvard studyon happiness has identified the loss of work relationships and connections as the biggest challenge to retirement wellbeing.Finding structure, purpose and community in new waysThe American writer William Bridges describes this in-between time as “the messy middle”. For John and Martin, navigating a meaningful life in this time of transition has involved purposeful experimentations and an acceptance of not knowing yet what all the components of retirement identity and purpose may look like. Martin in particular has found the messy middle metaphor helpful.In his messy middle, John has taken on some charity work to create purpose, various physical labour projects for some tangible sense of accomplishment, a consulting project to see if this provides an outlet for his entrepreneurial drive, and a travel adventure to develop new social connections. Martin is testing out a slower pace, intentionally dialling down scheduled commitments and staying with the uncomfortable experience of less “achievement”. “It’s a struggle, but I’m starting to see that there’s value in who I am, not just what I produce.”Martin has also been deliberately seeking out time with male friends, some of whom are also transitioning into retirement. He notes that these conversations are fragile, as men of his generation rarely venture on the thin ice of personal vulnerability.“We skate around the issue and often back off, but we all sense we are in the same boat. And in any case, hanging out and obliquely touching on meaning and purpose has been heartwarming in a black humour sort of way.”Processing a mixed bag of emotionsBoth men share the experience as a mixed bag of seemingly contradictory emotions. They both describe gratitude for being in a position to make choices, for opportunities and relationships, alongside the anxiety, frustration and (sometimes) sadness of a life in flux.'Life keeps evolving': six ways to have a happy retirementRead morePsychological researchsuggests that mixed emotions – like sadness and gratitude – are not contradictory but coexistent and neurologically integrated. This paradox validates John and Martin’s experience. Many retirees have similar experiences but struggle to put it into words.John has discovered sharing his writing about his experiences has helped him make sense of his own mixed bag. He has appreciated positive feedback from others that his reflections are encouraging in their transitions towards retirement.Retirement has come to be seen as an event, but perhaps it’s more like a passage – a crossing from the scaffolded certainties of working life to unmapped terrain that must be navigated. The real work of this next chapter is to embrace the messy middle not as a void, but as a creative space, where purpose and tasks no longer arrive by calendar invite.Martin and John remind us that meaning doesn’t retire when we do; it simply migrates and must be rediscovered. The messy middle requires testing new identities, trying new activities and practising patience. Just like work, really.This piece was inspired by aGuardian Modern Mindreader who replied to a previous post about time affluence and suggested a follow-upMartin and John are amalgams of a few different people, all of whom have given permission for their experiences to be shared here.

Ten years ago, when the government and regulators were considering whether to allow mitochondrial transfer technology, critics warned of “Frankenstein meddling” that would lead to three-parent children. It’s hard now to justify such hostility in the face of the painstaking work carried out by the scientific and medical teams at Newcastle, resulting in these healthy babies and ecstatic families.Mitochondria, like tiny battery packs, supply energy to every cell of the body. Their DNA is handed down in the egg from mother to child. In rare instances, there are genetic mutations, which means the baby may developmitochondrial disease. About one in 5,000 people is affected by it, making it one of the most common inherited disorders. As the cell batteries fail in various organs, the child can experience a range of symptoms, from muscle weakness to epilepsy, encephalopathy, blindness, hearing loss and diabetes. In severe cases, they die young.There is no cure yet, so the aim is prevention. Women who have some damaged and some healthy mitochondria can have IVF and pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) to select embryos that are clear of mutations or only slightly affected. The options for women with 100% mutated mitochondria used to be limited to donated eggs or adoption – until parliament changed the rules to allow the technology in 2015 and theNewcastle Fertility Centrewas granted a licence by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to use it in 2017.The process does indeed involve three people. The would-be mother’s egg and a donor egg are both fertilised by the man’s sperm. The nucleus of the donated egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus of the woman’s egg, but its healthy mitochondria remain. This composite egg is inserted into the woman’s uterus. The resulting baby’s DNA will be 99.9% from the parents and only 0.1% from the donor.Hardly a three-parent child.Yet there are controversies. Somecountrieswill not permit use of the technology because of concerns over human germline genetic modification. The lab-mixed DNA will be passed to future generations, with who knows what consequences. And a question hangs over something called reversal, or reversion. The results of the Newcastle research published in the New England Journal of Medicine show that some of the embryos with healthy donated mitochondria developed mutations somewhere along the line.Mutations formed in 12% of one baby’s mitochondria and 16% in another’s. That was not enough to affect the babies, who were healthy, but previous work by other scientists has suggested that mutations can increase with time, and nobody yet understands why.The Newcastle scientists and medics have been highly praised for their slow and methodical work. They have brought joy to some families and hope to others. But this is still experimental technology and caution is absolutely valid. And inevitably there are cost issues. People who can afford it will no doubt pay, but theNHSisunlikelyto be able to help the rest. Nonetheless, this groundbreaking research must surely be allowed to continue, albeit only in the same careful fashion.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In Britain and France, nationalist populist parties consistently lead in the polls. In Germany, the particularly extreme Alternative für Deutschland isneck and neckwith the conservative CDU. Specific dynamics might vary but the unsettling pattern is the same – large swaths of voters increasingly identify with authoritarian and often xenophobic political forces.Prolonged post-industrial malaise, wage stagnation and austerity have precipitated this wave of disaffection with the mainstream,especiallyamong the less well-off. Yet in London, Paris and Berlin, governments of the centre-left and centre-right seem intent on alienating disillusioned electorates still further. During his visit to London last week, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz,heraldeda new strategic partnership for changed times between Germany, Britain and France. But a much-needed economic reset, which dismantles failed fiscal orthodoxies, seems as far away as ever.The fallout from Sir Keir Starmer’s failed and misguidedattemptto target disabled benefit recipients, in order to stay within arbitrary financial rules, will haunt Labour’s summer. Last week, it was the turn of the centre-right French prime minister, François Bayrou, to sing from the same unpopular hymn sheet.Presentinghis government’s provisional budget plans for 2026, Mr Bayrou proposed a real-terms cut in all spending areas bar defence. He also advocated the freezing of tax thresholds, pensions and benefits, deep cuts to the welfare budget and the abolition oftwo national holidays. Mr Merz is similarlyintenton an overhaul of welfare benefits, including cuts to rent subsidies and harsher sanctions for the long-term unemployed.The accompanying rhetoric, in each case, has called for collective sacrifice to the common good. Sir Keir and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, speak of tough choices and trade-offs. Mr Bayrou last weekinstructedFrench voters that “everyone must participate in the effort” to reduce public debt, while refusing to countenance proposals for a 2% tax on very wealthy individuals. Mr Merz routinely lectures Germans on the need to work more.It won’t wash. The legacy of the pandemic, the cost of keeping ageing populations healthy and the moral imperative of the green transition undoubtedly represent huge challenges. Donald Trump’strade warsmay become another serious headwind to face. But large numbers of voters in western liberal democracies are no longer listening to arguments that claim “we are all in it together” – and with good reason. According to a recentsurvey by a French business magazine, between 2010 and 2025 the collective wealth of France’s super-rich grew from €200bn to €1.2tn – a 500% increase. Inherited wealth has more or lessdoubledas a proportion of GDP in advanced economies since the middle of the last century. Despite this massive upwards redistribution of rewards in western liberal democracies in past decades, mainstream parties are continuing to seek to balance the books by inflicting economic pain on vulnerable people and those just about getting by.A paradigm shift is urgently needed. Mr Merz rightly insisted in London that a different European approach was required to cope with a new and threatening era. That goes for the economy as well as defence and foreign policy. Shredded social contracts will not be renewed by bearing down on those already struggling, as the far right surges.Explore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionGermanyFranceThe far rightFriedrich MerzKeir StarmerAusterityeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The new champion’s next act was to fire an iron to within a foot of the cup. ­Scheffler enjoyed a sun‑kissed procession on the Dunluce Links. Had the R&A been so minded, it could have broken with tradition and handed over the Claret Jug on the 5th tee. By that point, he was seven strokes clear.Scheffler does not bother with major jousting.

His family surrounded him on the 18th green, in the latest reminder that the world No 1 does not particularly prioritise golf.His understated brilliance and shunning of the spotlight is intriguing. Scheffler recognises he is excellent at golf but he is unwilling to be defined by that.View image in fullscreenHarris English finished second overall but was unable to offer a real challenge to Scottie Scheffler for the Open title.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty ImagesThe record books will show Harris English finished second and he is due high praise. It is just that Scheffler’s imperious frontrunning distorted the tournament. English never had any prospect of winning. Chris Gotterup was not in the Open when arriving in North Berwick for its Scottish equivalent. Gotterupduly won therelast Sunday and reached 12 under par to secure third in Northern Ireland. What a wonderful sporting fairytale.Scheffler does not need help. He received some courtesy of the fact this was another benign Portrush occasion. With that, the capacity for huge errors was limited. Scoring was noticeably low across the field. ­Scheffler played his first five in three under. He whacked a bunker shot at the 8th into the face of the sand trap; a double bogey there was partly repaired with a straightforward birdie at the 9th. Those beneath him were scaling an ice wall in slippers. The R&A’s engraver could get to work long before Scheffler reached his 72nd hole. There was an inevitability about the outcome which could only raise parallels with peak Tiger Woods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It began with Oakmont Country Club informing members thatClark had been bannedfrom the premises after he inflicted grievous bodily harm on some lockersat the US Openlast month. ­Presumably others were ducking for cover as Clark shot a 76 on Thursday. His response, however, was admirable; Clark signed off with a 65 for 11 under and a fourth‑placed finish. He had Matt ­Fitzpatrick and Li Haotong for scoreboard company.Li made a fourth‑round 70 as ­Scheffler’s partner. “I asked if there is any time I can practise with him on thePGA Tour,” Li said. “He said yes. I said: ‘When I text you, you­better reply to me.’ He goes: ‘­Haotong who?’”Clark does sound genuinely remorseful about events at Oakmont. If he has a lingering gripe, it relates to his sanction from the club entering the public domain. “We were hoping it was going to be private,” Clark said. “I did something awful and I’m really sorry for it. Hopefully they have it in their heart to forgive me and maybe in the future I’ll be able to play there.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy received vocal backing from the crowd at Royal Portrush but said: ‘None of us could live with what Scottie [Scheffler] had this week.”Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianRory McIlroy had reached 10 under before a double bogey at the 10th. It seems incredible to think that his next round in a major will be the start of his Masters defence in April. The esteem he was held in by vast ­galleries over four competitive days in ­Portrush really was quite the sight and sound.McIlroy’s focus will now turn towards the Ryder Cup and hopes of a rare European win on American soil. He shared ­seventh in Northern Ireland with Xander ­Schauffele and Bob ­MacIntyre. “None of us could live with what Scottie had this week,” McIlroy said. “But for me to be in front of everyone here at home and to get that reception up the last, absolutely incredible. I’ll remember that for a long time.”Bryson DeChambeau blasted through the field to post a 64 and a nine-under aggregate. DeChambeau opened this major with a 78 and ended up finishing tied 10th. Insert joke about LIV golfers and 54-hole tournaments. Sergio García broke his driver on the 2nd hole in a fit of pique, rendering a 68 somewhat decent. He was asked post-round for his thoughts on the Ryder Cup in September, an event in which he is at present about as likely to feature as the aforementioned Old Tom.Scheffler will be there, ­having swept up half the year’s major crowns. Next year’s US Open – which concludes on Scheffler’s 30th ­birthday – will feature him ­attempting to complete a career grand slam. We are firmly in the midst of one of the ­greatest golfing careers of all time.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerRory McIlroyEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

If, of course, we are willing to stretch our definition of “entertainment” to include some of the other popular sensations. Suspense. Terror. Existential despair. Cold sweating. Temporary breakdown of the nervous system. Loud screaming at inanimate items of electrical equipment.But as we approach the final week of this operatic Women’s European Championship, this tournament has a fair claim to be one of the most thrilling in recent memory. And not just on the more intangible metrics: noise, penalty drama, side-eye, flying saves, players singing unprompted into pitch-side microphones, quality of fan walks. With three matches remaining, Euro 2025 has surpassed Euro 2022 in terms of goals, averaging a staggering half a goal more (3.57 against 3.06).Berger stars in shootout as Germany overcome early red card to fell France at Euro 2025Read moreThis is on course to be the highest‑scoring European Championship in history, excluding the limited four-team mini-competitions that were held before 1997. Only two tournaments ago, Euro 2017 averaged just 2.19 goals per game. A 63% rise in goals constitutes a seismic and really quite sudden development in the sport, one that raises a few supplementary questions. Have attacks got better? Have defences got worse? And, you know, what if some of these players actually learned to take a penalty?Perhaps the key finding here is that possession is no guarantee of control. If you exclude blowouts such as England 6 Wales 1 and include only matches between teams of roughly comparable strength (say, within 10 places of each other in the Fifa world rankings) then the side enjoying more possession has won just six games out of 17. The Netherlands had more of the ball against France andwere demolished 5-2.Norway’s 2-1 win against Finlandwas secured with 41% of possession.Winning games without possession generally requires one of a few to be true: a preponderance of set-piece goals, a reliance on fast direct attacks or a knack of being able to burgle the ball in the final third. None of which appears to be a disproportionate factor here. Set-piece goals are down compared with three years ago. The number of “direct attacks”, as defined by Opta, is at a similar level.Pressing, meanwhile, remains a potent weapon in the women’s game, perhaps even more so than in the men’s, where elite teams are now much more adept at playing through pressure, perhaps even baiting the press to create space. But at this tournament the number of successful tackles in the final third is actually down 23%. There were 708 high turnovers at Euro 2022 and just 495 so far at Euro 2025. Mis-controls per game are down from 38.1 to 35.2, which suggests an overall rise in technical quality. So where, exactly, are all these extra goals coming from?View image in fullscreenThe Netherlands lost 5-2 against France despite having more possession.Photograph: Marcel ter Bals/MTB-Photo/ShutterstockDig a little deeper into the data, however, and a more revealing picture emerges. The number of high turnovers may have dropped sharply, but they have become vastly more efficient in generating goals (one in 33, compared with one in 54). The number of errors leading to a shot has more than doubled. All of which indicates that teams are becoming far more surgical, sophisticated and ruthless in their attacking tactics, targeting them in areas of the pitch, phases of the game and perhaps even particular opponents where they will have maximum value.Underpinning all this is perhaps the biggest shift in the past three years: the quality of finishing. The 87 non-penalty goals at Euro 2022 were scored from 98.4 expected goals (xG); the 92 non-penalty goals at Euro 2025 have been scored from an xG of just 84.4. Simply put, teams are getting better at converting from virtually all situations, and arguably better at identifying the situations best suited to their style.View image in fullscreenElla Toone follows up to score England’s second goal against Wales after her first shot was repelled.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockDirect one-on-one dribbling has been a particular speciality of France and Sweden, the only teams to generate more than 10% of their shots through this method. Italy have created more shots from dead balls than anyone else. And England remain the undisputed queens of penalty-area chaos, generating almost three shots per game from following up on shots that have just been taken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps the key lesson is that – heroic German rearguards aside – keeping it tight at the back is less important than being able to generate shots. England, Italy and Germany are only the sixth, seventh and eighth-best defences in this tournament. Italy have the fifth-lowest average possession, but compensate with their lightning speed of attack. Crossing remains an important tactic, with the eight quarter-finalists all in the tournament top 10 on this measure.In many ways, though, Spain are the unicorn team at this tournament, perhaps even the unicorn team in women’s football, the only side reliably able to pass their way out of trouble anywhere on the pitch. Spain aside, the teams who have gone far in this tournament are those who have been prepared to abandon the ground game, and go long or direct when necessary.And so increasingly this tournament is boiling down to a battle between two models: the passing game pioneered by Spain, and the more pragmatic style practised by everyone else. There may be many ways to entertain. But ultimately, there will only be one way to win.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamItaly women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Julian Alaphilippe, the former world road race champion, raised his arms in triumph in Carcassonne, thinking he had won, only to be told seconds later that he had in fact ­finished third behind two Belgians.Ahead of the crestfallen Alaphilippe, Tadej ­Pogacar’s Emirates-XRG teammate Tim Wellens took a solo win on stage 15 of the Tour, well ahead of compatriot Victor Campanaerts, a teammate to Jonas Vingegaard.“Julian’s radio wasn’t working,” Alaphilippe’s Tudor Pro team mana­ger, Raphael Meyer, said in an effort to explain his rider’s ecstatic but misplaced fist pump. A win from the French rider would have been all the more remarkable, given he had crashed earlier in the stage and popped back a dislocated shoulder, all on his own.View image in fullscreenJulian Alaphilippe’s radio had been damaged in a crash earlier on stage 15.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Vingegaard it was another stressful day on which his Visma-Lease a Bike team showed questionable strategy. They have one day good, the next bad, while Pogacar and his team remain a model of consistency.If Vingegaard’s team increasingly resemble a house on fire, Pogacar’s remains an impregnable fortress. In the shadow of Carcassonne’s citadel the 34-year-old Wellens, already a stage winner in the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España, took his first Tour de France stage win.The Dane had been caught up in the same early crash in which Alaphilippe came down. Inexpli­cably, as ­Vingegaard, second ­overall to Pogacar, chased to rejoin the peloton, some of his teammates, ­including Campanaerts, were at the front, forcing the pace and distancing their team leader.It took a radio intervention from Pogacar’s own team car to return the goodwill shown to the Slovenian in Toulouse, after his own crash on stage 11. Finally, with 128km to race, Vingegaard and Florian Lipowitz rejoined the main group.Even the defending champion seemed bemused by what was going on around him. “There were three Visma guys, all trying to go in the break again and they had Jonas ­chasing at the back,” Pogacar said. “It was just a weird situation.”While Pogacar was eventually able to repay the sportsmanship shown to him four days ago, Wellens was not in the mood to hang around and made his decisive solo move with 43km to race, on the Col de Fontbruno.The Belgian champion never looked back and pushed on into the final kilometres on the rolling roads of the Languedoc, to win by almost a minute and a half from Campanaerts.As the Tour began, Vingegaard’s wife and personal manager had criticised the Visma-Lease a Bike team for failing to commit wholeheartedly to her husband’s cause. On the road to Carcassonne, her fears seemed well-founded, with both Campanaerts and Wout van Aert apparently racing for the stage win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a big day for Belgium, with Belgians coming first and second.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/AP“I hope he gets the full support of the team, rather than there being all sorts of different goals,” Trine ­Vingegaard Hansen said this month. “If you’re also aiming for stage wins with other riders, then those resources can’t be used for Jonas. You can only respect how Tadej ­Pogacar’s team handles it. When he starts a race, there’s no doubt about who the leader is. Everyone knows their role. I think that’s super important.”Pogacar, meanwhile, despite ­saying after the stage he had a slight summer cold because of the fluctuating temperatures and too much time spent in air-conditioning, never looked in trouble.As Vingegaard was pondering his teammate’s motivations, Pogacar was becoming Wellens’s ­cheerleader-in-chief. “How is he looking?” he radioed his team car as Wellens progressed. “How does Tim look? You should reply: ‘He looks fabulous!’”Monday is a rest day, while the 16th stage on Tuesday takes the peloton from Montpellier to the daunting Mont Ventoux, where Pogacar will almost certainly seek to increase his lead with a prestigious stage win.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

The 38-year-old Ukrainian had once again become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world after a performance filled with light, panache and a kind of battering precision that had normally sober ringside observers reaching for words such as “genius” and “magician”.In the wake of such savage alchemy, someone asked Usyk a question that made his face light up again. After all he had done, and with almost desperate speculation as to who might be able to challenge him now, how did Usyk find the motivation to keep fighting? “Oh, listen, bro,” he said, as he made a distinction crucial to any clear understanding of his extraordinary achievements in and out of the ring, “I don’t have motivation. I have discipline. Motivation? It’s temporary. Today, for example, you have motivation. But tomorrow you wake up early and you don’t have motivation.”Oleksandr Usyk wraps Ukraine’s flag around himself and his fists around Daniel Dubois | Barney RonayRead moreHe flashed his familiar gap‑toothed grin. “When I wake up early for training I never have motivation. I have only discipline. Motivation is needed only for amateur sportsmen – not for professional boxers. Amateur boxers might only work three times in a week. They say: ‘Oh, but today I don’t have motivation for training.’ Uh-uh. No, bro. Motivation is good but discipline is better.”Those seven little words reveal the essence of Usyk. His brilliance is rooted in iron discipline. In a similar way he is not always motivated to speak about death and grief in Ukraine as the bombs fall and the body count rises. Usyk once told me that he wishedI had interviewed himlong before the war with Russia. “I’m a really funny guy,” he said. “I love to laugh and to dance. But it’s not possible when we need to talk about what Russia is trying to do to Ukraine. We need to be focused and disciplined in telling the world the truth.”Usyk did not really want to come out and talk after the intensity of his display against Dubois. His manager, Egis Klimas, urged us to keep the post-fight conversation short and to avoid repetitive questions. Usyk wanted to be with his wife after being separated from her and their four children for 14 long weeks.But the champion, as always, brought discipline and decency to his press conference. He listened closely, kept saying “good question” and, even in his halting English, produced a depth of thought that does not always illuminate such encounters. “Boxers only have three punches. It’s the jab, the hook and the uppercut,” he said as he demonstrated each one to us. “But combinations take a long time [to master].”He explained how the shimmering combination that dropped Dubois in round five meant his stricken rival was open for the final shuddering overhand left that ended the fight. It came from the lessons they had learned during hisprevious victory against Duboisin August 2023: “We learn from the first fight and we had a long time – two years. We prepare combinations.”View image in fullscreenIn his post-fight press conference, Oleksandr Usyk did not give any clues about who his next opponent would be.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersUsyk imitated the last clubbing blow that had left Dubois sprawled across the canvas. “It’s a punch we named Ivan. The left hook is like this …” He offered up a textbook punch before reverting to the roundhouse smash which closed the show. “That is Ivan!” he exclaimed. “It’s a Ukrainian name. Ivan is like a big guy who lives in the village and works on a farm. A really big guy!” Usyk puffed himself up to look like a hulking Ukrainian farmer. “What is your name?” he asked himself. Using a low growl, Usyk replied in the voice of the imagined farmer: “My name is Ivan.” The boxer grinned helplessly. “Yeah, it’s a hard, hard punch.”Usyk was pressed on who he may fight next. “Now I want to rest. I cannot say who my next opponent will be. I prepare for three and a half months. I don’t see my family, my wife. Every day I live with my team, with 14 guys, in one house [he laughed again in mock despair]. Every day only the same faces. Now I want to go back home.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionQuick GuideWho next for Usyk?ShowJoseph Parker:This is the most logical next bout for Usyk as Parker, apart from being the WBO’s mandatory challenger, is in a rich vein of form.  He deserves another world title shot and, while he would be a heavy underdog, his brilliant trainer Andy Lee is the one man in boxing who might just have the intelligence to ask a few fresh questions of Usyk.Derek Chisora:It is a curious anomaly that a relatively crude brawler like Chisora, who should have retired years ago, has been the only heavyweight to make Usyk look uncomfortable. When they met in 2020 it was only Usky’s second fight as a heavyweight and he found Chisora’s maundering pressure initially hard to handle.  Two of the three judges had Usyk winning by an extremely tight 115-113 margin.   But we should shudder to think what Usyk might do to the battered veteran in a rematch.Tyson Fury:There is little doubt that Fury is the most skilful and toughest opponent Usyk has faced.  Their first fight, in May 2024, was a classic and the rematch seven months later was another gruelling battle.    Usyk won both and Fury, claiming to have been robbed, retreated into retirement.   But, inevitably, The Gypsy King is already talking of a comeback and, on Saturday, he said: “Oleksandr Usyk knows there is only one man who can beat him. I did it twice before. I am the man and, no matter what anyone wants to say, I won those fights.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Jake Paul, the former YouTuber, had climbed into the ring an hour earlier and come face-to-face with Usyk. The master cackled again at the surreal certainty that he would pick apart a boxing novice as easily as a small boy might separate a butterfly from its wings. “I’m ready for Jake Paul,” he joked, “but I need to rest.”Usyk discussed his faith and the transient nature of life, then paid tribute to Britain, which he described as his “second home” as he has won so many of his greatest fights in this country – from Olympic gold to becoming the undisputed world heavyweight champion for a second time at Wembley. “I’m very grateful for this country,” he said, with characteristic charm. “Thank you so much.”Discipline shone out of Usyk as he raised his arms and then lowered his head in a respectful bow before, as if in a puff of magic, he disappeared into the dark and rainy night.Explore more on these topicsOleksandr UsykBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One-nil up in the series with two to play and the chance to seal the deal in one of the world’s greatest sporting arenas? For anyone raised on the mythical deeds of past Lions tours this should be as good as it gets.So why was the mood so pancake-flat at the final whistle after the27-19 first Test win in Brisbane? Primarily because the best sport requires at least a hint of jeopardy. From an early stage at the Suncorp Stadium, sadly, there was absolutely no doubt which side was going to win. For the first time in living memory, a Lions Test victory had become a foregone conclusion.Tuipulotu believes ‘stars have aligned’ for him as Lions arrive in MelbourneRead moreThe boot has occasionally been on the other foot, notably in 2005 when it swiftly became clear the All Blacks were a class above Sir Clive Woodward’s squad. There is no massive shame when that happens, and to witnessDan Carter twinkling in the second Testwas a privilege. But Saturday was different: playing against distinctly moderate opposition, the Lions were so far in front after 42 minutes that everything else became irrelevant.This is not remotely to diminish the excellence of Tom Curry, Finn Russell, Tadhg Beirne and Huw Jones, among others. The Lions can beat only whatever is put in front of them. If England’s cricketers come over later this year and take a big early lead in the Ashes series they are not going to waste time worrying about the shaky state of Australia’s top order. But, goodness, it has made the second Test this Saturday a bellwether fixture. Here’s hoping the Wallabies, for the sake of all concerned, will emerge a lot quicker from the blocks this time.They should have Rob Valetini and Will Skelton back, and Angus Bell, among others, could be promoted from the bench. What the hosts cannot afford to be is as deeply mediocre as they were made to look in the first half in Brisbane. Because another one-sided contest would do more than just bruise Australian pride. If the gap cannot be narrowed it risks undermining everything this series is meant to be about. The Lions’ unique appeal is based squarely on the four‑yearly crackle of pre-game anticipation. It also has to make onlookers feel they are watching something genuinely special. In that regard, the game on Saturday fell short of the levels required.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman evades the challenge of Australia’s Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIn certain quarters, of course, this is a minor problem. The father of one high-profile Lions player, over a beer on the eve of the game, told me how sick he was of hearing about the need for a closely contested series to lure more neutral eyeballs. His view is that winning every Test convincingly and grinding the Wallabies into the dirt is all that matters. Lions series are about winning: they do not arrange open-top bus parades for plucky losers. On a basic sporting level he is, of course, correct. But when sold-out stadiums fall quiet and even rugby diehards at home start channel-hopping to find more gripping viewing, something is not quite right. If the Lions return home having barely been run close in a single competitive game in Australia it will be a desperately sad state of affairs.So, for everyone’s sake, one of two things now has to happen. Either Australia must boomerang their way back into the series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as a matter of urgency, or the Lions need to give a statement performance that will stand the test of time. Listening to Australia’s head coach, Joe Schmidt, suggesting after the game that the experience of this Lions series would benefit his younger players in the forthcoming Rugby Championship is to suspect the second option is the more likely.Either way, Andy Farrell will surely be stressing the need to dial things up at the MCG. He will have been frustrated by the lack of bench impact in Brisbane and may be tempted to inject some fresh energy. Henry Pollock, Jac Morgan, Josh van der Flier, Owen Farrell, Blair Kinghorn and Jamie George could all enter the conversation, whileJoe McCarthy’s injurymay prompt a modest forward reshuffle. Might Beirne and Ollie Chessum both start? One of them will probably have to feature in the second row.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farrell rightly hailed the big-match temperaments of Curry, Beirne, Russell and Jamison Gibson‑Park but will now be seeking an all‑court, 80-minute performance similar to the final Test in Sydney in 2013 when the Lions stood up magnificently with the series on the line. He will want James Lowe and Tommy Freeman to show they can finish as sharply as Australia’s Max Jorgensen, for Jones and Sione Tuipulotu to dovetail sweetly once again, and for the Lions to generally be more ruthless in their opponents’ 22. He will want more ball claimed in the air and even more pressure heaped on the Wallabies’ playmakers.Above all else, perhaps, he will want his chosen ones to show that, even if they were facing the All Blacks or the Springboks, they possess the requisite class and composure. That the thousands of fans who have made the long pilgrimage here have invested shrewdly. And that, emotionally, the Lions are still capable of stirring feelings other teams cannot.If, alternatively, they allow Australia back into the series – or, heaven forbid, lose the last two Tests – they will regret it for the rest of their days.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

She struggled again ­during Thursday’s quarter-final­victory against Swedenand has now revealed the unacceptable ­vitriol she has been a victim of while on ­international duty.‘We’re never beaten’: Esme Morgan talks up England’s mental toughness at EurosRead more“From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse,” the 27-year-old defender wrote on Instagram. “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race. As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.”Carter has received widespread support, most emphatically from her teammates. In a collective statement, the Lionesses said: “Representing our country is the greatest honour. It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated ­differently ­simply because of the colour of our skin. Until now, we have chosen to take the knee before matches. It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism. We have agreed as a squad to remain standing before kick‑off on Tuesday.”The statement added: “Those behind this online poison must be held accountable.”Lotte Wubben-Moy went further by announcing she was also ­coming off social media. In a statement, the Arsenal defender said: “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse. The issue goes beyond sport. But what is being done about it? On the very platforms we post on? I will not continue to feed the very ­platform that enables abuse with no consequence.”Speaking about the Lionesses’ decision to stop taking the knee, Lucy Bronze said: “It was driven by the group – obviously certain individuals more than others. I think it was just the fact that we feel as a ­collective, is the message as strong as it used to be? Is the message really hitting hard? Because to us it feels like it’s not if these things are still ­happening to our players in the ­biggest ­tournaments of their lives.“It’s about putting another statement out there to say, you know, it’s something that still is a problem, it’s something that still needs to be put right. More needs to be done in football, more needs to be done in society, what that is right now as an individual, I don’t exactly know. But it’s something that we collectively as a team and as a federation want to work towards, we want to make changes. This is a small step trying to create another change.”View image in fullscreenJess Carter (front row, second right) lines up with her England teammates before their Euro 2025 quarter-final against Sweden.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe Football Association is ­working with authorities to track down those responsible for tar­geting Carter. The chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “As soon as we were made aware of the racist abuse Jess received, we immediately contacted UK police. They are in touch with the relevant social media platform, and we are working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.“Regrettably, this is not the first time this has ­happened to an England player, so we had measures in place to allow us to respond quickly and where possible provide information to support any potential police action. We will continue to discuss with the rele­vant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Gotham, we believe in a culture of mutual respect and remain committed to building a game – and a community – where everyone feels safe, respected and celebrated. There is no place for racism in our sport.”Carter, who was excellent in ­England’s4-0 group stage victoryagainst the Netherlands, went on to thank “genuine” England fans for their support, making clear her “focus is on helping the team any way I can” before their semi-final against Italy on Tuesday. “Hopefully, speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won’t have to deal with it,” she said.“We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballRaceOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

Gupta, who joined the ICC this month from the Indian broadcaster JioStar, will chair the working party, which also features the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, Richard Gould, and the Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive, Todd Greenberg.The Guardian view on Test cricket: slow-burning intensity can deliver the finest sporting pleasures | EditorialRead moreThe two-division concept first emerged from meetings between CA and the ECB during the women’s Ashes last January. CA, in particular, is a major advocate and has pushed a model that would involve Australia, England and India playing against each other twice every three years rather than the current setup of two series in four years. Although this would appeal to broadcasters and be hugely lucrative, the ECB is understood to have reservations about scheduling more Test series between the so-called big three, as it would further entrench their huge financial advantage over other international sides.The presence of Gupta, Gould and Greenberg on the working group suggests there is a strong possibility the two-division model will be adopted, although the devil will be in the detail of their findings.With such a significant change requiring the support of a two-thirds majority of the ICC’s 12 full members, the biggest challenge will be to agree on a system of promotion and relegation between the two divisions to prevent the smaller nations being cut adrift. An increased package of financial support for countries starting in division two may also be required. Under the current ICC Test rankings, the world Test champions, South Africa, plus New Zealand and Sri Lanka would join the big three in division one, with Ireland, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh in line to be admitted to the World Test Championship for the first time to join Pakistan, West Indies and Zimbabwe in division two.This development came as the ICC announced in Singapore that England will stage the next three World Test Championship finals. The first three showpieces have been held in England, most recently last month at Lord’s, as South Africa were crowned champions for the first time by defeating the holders, Australia.The ICC also discussed creating a new Twenty20 Champions League or World Club Championship that would feature franchises from the Indian Premier League, the Hundred and the Big Bash, but no formal proposal was tabled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ICC has expressed interest in running its own version, but it would be a complex undertaking, not least as many of the IPL owners have bought franchises in other countries including South Africa’s SA20, Major League Cricket in the and ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates. The owners of Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad are also in the process of buying into four Hundred franchises.Some of the world’s top T20 players represent as many as four or five franchises each year, so determining whom they would represent would not be straightforward, with 2027 seen as the most likely start date for a new global tournament as that coincides with the end of the ICC’s $3bn (£2.25bn) Indian TV deal with Disney Star.Explore more on these topicsInternational Cricket CouncilWorld Test ChampionshipCricketSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sources at the Premier League champions say reports in Germany of a deal being agreed for a £69m fee are premature, although it is believed that the France Under-21s forward does favour a move to Anfield.In the crazed transfer trolley dash, the next glossy off-the-shelf solution is all the rage | Jonathan WilsonRead moreEkitike is expected to eventually join Liverpool as they look to overhaul their striking department, a situation further necessitated by thedeath of Diogo Jota this month.Luis Díaz could well depart from Merseyside, with Bayern Munich an interested party in the Colombia international, and Darwin Núñez is still very much for sale despite a move to Napoli the Uruguayan wanted having gone cold. Neither departure will be at a cut price.A deal for the 23-year-old Ekitike, who has an £86m release clause in his contract with Frankfurt, continues to be negotiated despite reports of Alexander Isak, in whom Liverpool are known to be interested, being unsettled at Newcastle. Eddie Howe left the Swede out of the squad that lost 4‑0 at Celtic in a pre‑season friendly on Saturday, with the manager admitting later it wasbecause of recent transfer speculation. Howe did go on to say, however, that he was “confident [Isak] will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window”.Liverpool are prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make Isak their new No 9 but the chances of them signing – or indeed being able to afford – the 25-year-old forward remain remote, hence the stepping up of their interest in Ekitike.Isak has also been linked with Arsenal, as previously was Ekitike, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions for Frankfurt last season.Liverpool have already signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez this summer, with Giorgi Mamardashvili linking up with the club after agreeing a move last August.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEintracht FrankfurtTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The former Tottenham full-back joins Graham Potter to continue the Hammers’ summer business, which has been slow going so far.“He was a big, big part of me making the decision,” Walker-Peters said of Potter. “I’ve always liked his style as a coach and I think it’s going to suit me best. He spoke about trying to make the club like a real family feel and that’s what I’m all about and I’d like to think I’m a good fit.”Liverpool continue talks over signing Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht FrankfurtRead moreWalker-Peters, who won two caps for England in 2022, spent five years at Southampton, enduring two relegations, and now joins a club whose other summer signings have been El Hadji Malick Diouf, a left-wing back from Slavia Prague, and the youngster Daniel Cummings from Celtic. Walker-Peters is likely to play on the right.Potter said: “He is a player I’ve always thought highly of and been impressed by whenever he has faced one of my teams. He has a really good pedigree, a top professional who has established himself as a respected Premier League player and still has his best years in front of him.”Meanwhile, Evan Ferguson, the Republic of Ireland striker, has travelled to Italy to complete a loan move from Brighton toRoma. On Sunday evening footage emerged of Ferguson being greeted by around a hundred fans at the airport after flying over in a private plane.Speaking from Las Palmas, where Brighton are preparing for a pre-season friendly with the Spanish club, the Albion manager, Fabian Hürzeler, said Ferguson still remains part of Brighton’s future plans. The aim of the season-long loan is to reboot a career affected by injuries and loss of form under Hürzeler and his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi.“For us it is always important the individual players have an environment where they can develop, we decided the loan was the best option for us,” said Hürzeler. “He is still a player of us, he still brings quality with him, he is a target player and I am sure when he gets more game time he will one day be back and be an important player for us.”In Italy, there had been reports a deal has been agreed for an initial loan with a €40m (£34.5m) option to buy. Ferguson spent half of last season on loan at West Ham, a disappointing spell during which he started just one match and failed to score for Potter, the manager who first blooded him at Brighton.

He out-threw, out-landed and out-hustled a champion 16 years his junior for long stretches on Saturday night in Las Vegas, but the scorecards told a different story.Pacquiao’s spirited return to the ring after a four-year layoff ended in a majority draw against Mario Barrios when the WBC welterweight titleholder won the final three rounds on all three scorecards. One ringside judge handed down a 115–113 verdict for Barrios, while the other two had it 114–114, allowing the 30-year-old Texan to retain his belt by the narrowest of margins. (The Guardian scored it115-113 for Pacquiao.)“I thought I won the fight,” Pacquiao said afterward. “It was a close fight. My opponent was very tough. It was a wonderful fight.”The result was met with lusty boos from a pro-Pacquiao crowd of 13,107 inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena, which had spent much of the evening roaring their support for the 46-year-old from the Philippines. And for much of the bout, it looked like they were about to witness boxing’s only eight-division world champion make history yet again.View image in fullscreenMario Barrios, left, fights Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in Las Vegas.Photograph: John Locher/APFrom the opening round Pacquiao fought with surprising urgency, using angles and volume punching and his signature hand speed to offset Barrios’ height, youth and four-inch reach advantage. He won the first frame behind a flurry of jabs and straight lefts, sparking loud cheers with every landed punch.Manny Pacquiao v Mario Barrios: WBC welterweight championship – live reactionRead moreThough Barrios began to find a home for his jab and counter right hands in the second, Pacquiao resumed control in the third with a sharper rhythm and faster hands, dictating the pace of the action. He buzzed Barrios in the sixth with a snapping left hand, then again moments later with another lead shot that caught the champion square. “His stamina, he could still crack,” Barrios said. “He’s still strong as hell. His timing, his rhythm, everything. He was still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.”Pacquiao’s performance, particularly in rounds six through nine, had the feeling of a time warp. He zipped in and out of range with fluid footwork and mixed in combination like a man half his age. By the end of the 10th, Pacquiao appeared to be well ahead on the scorecards. Even Barrios seemed to acknowledge he had to dig deep to close the gap. “Not necessarily that it was getting away from me,” Barrios said. “I just knew I had to try to step it up to really solidify a win.”To his credit, Barrios did just that. He clearly won the 11th, landing his best combination of the night and forcing Pacquiao into a rare sequence of retreat. In the 12th, he kept the tempo high, trading shots and finishing strong – just enough to sweep the final three rounds on all three official cards and retain the WBC’s version of the title at 147lb. “I thought I still pulled it out,” Barrios said. “But I still tip my hat to Manny. It was an absolute honor to share the ring with him, somebody with so much experience who has accomplished so much in this sport. We left everything in the ring. Nothing but love and respect.”The fight marked Pacquiao’s first sincehis unanimous-decision loss to Yordenis Ugásin 2021. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame last month, and few expected him to compete again at this level, much less push a reigning titleholder to the brink. “I’m more experienced,” Pacquiao said. “I’m a more tactical fighter than before. I’m not as careless as I was when I was young. Now I’m more careful.”View image in fullscreenMario Barrios, right, lands a shot to Manny Pacquiao’s body on Saturday night.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesThat maturity showed in his measured footwork, selective bursts and veteran nous, including moments where he appeared to be refereeing the fight himself. But even Pacquiao admitted his comeback camp had been rushed. “I only had two months training,” he said. “What I need to do is continue my training. In a championship fight like this, I should train four months, [or at least] three months and a half. But because of the election in the Philippines, I started late. But it’s OK. I love the Filipino people, and I love to give honor to my country.”Pacquiao, whose professional record now stands at 62–9–3 with 39 knockouts, said he would “absolutely” consider fighting again and made it clear he wants a rematch. “Yes, of course,” he said. “That’s the only legacy that I can leave behind. To give inspiration to the Filipino people and to be proud wherever you are.”Barrios, whose ledger moves to 29–2–2 after a second straight draw, seemed open to the idea. “Absolutely. This was huge for boxing,” he said. “What me and him were able to bring here today, I would love to do it again.”Four decades on from his professional debut, Pacquiao once again proved that age is just a number and that greatness, even in a draw, still carries the power to inspire. “It’s an inspiration to old boxers,” Pacquiao said. “If you have discipline and hard work, you can still fight. I’m so thankful to God, because without God, Manny Pacquiao is not here. God is the source of all the strength and good health that I have right now.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingManny PacquiaoUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He could not say whether the dead had been killed by the Israeli army, armed gangs or both.Israel’s military said soldiers had shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who it claimed posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties. But it said the numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found. It did not immediately comment on the incident in the south.There was new alarm as Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for areas of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organisations attempting to distribute aid are located.In central Deir al-Balah, residents said Israeli planes struck three houses in the area and dozens of families began leaving their homes, carrying some of their belongings, Reuters reported.View image in fullscreenPalestinians are transported to hospitals after the incident in the Zikim area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBefore these reports emerged, the pope called for “an immediate end to the barbarity of the war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict” at the end of the Angelus prayer at Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence near Rome.The pope also spoke of his anguish overthe Israeli strike on Gaza’s only Catholic churchlast week, which killed three people and injured 10. Among the injured was the parish priest, who used to receive daily calls from the late Pope Francis.Israel has expressed “deep sorrow” and opened an investigation into the strike on the church, which was sheltering about 600 displaced people, most of them children and many with special needs.“This act, unfortunately, adds to the ongoing military attacks against the civilian population and places of worship in Gaza,” the pope said on Sunday.“I appeal to the international community to observe humanitarian law and respect the obligation to protect civilians, as well as the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force, and the forced displacement of populations.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian casualty of Israeli fire, who was seeking aid supplies, according to medics, is carried in the northern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersOn Sunday the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Unrwa, said Israeli authorities were “starving civilians in Gaza”, including 1 million children.“Unrwa has enough food for the entire population of Gaza for over three months stockpiled in warehouses,” it said in an earlier social media post that included photos of a warehouse in Arish, Egypt.“Open the gates, lift the siege, allow Unrwa to do its work and help people in need among them 1 million children,” the agency said.From Gaza to Ukraine, peace always seems just out of reach – and the reason isn’t only political | Simon TisdallRead moreUnrwa said last week that babies weredying from “severe acute malnutrition”.Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa in Gaza and the West Bank, accusing the agency of having been infiltrated by Hamas, although an independent review found Tel Aviv hadfailed to provide evidenceof its claims that Unrwa employees were members of terrorist organisations.The agency had been the main distributor of aid in Gaza and provider of basic services, including health and education, to Palestinians across the region.View image in fullscreenPalestinians fleeing Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APSince May aid has been largely distributed by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in place of the traditional UN-led system. Food has become scarce, and very expensive, since Israel imposed a blockade on 2 March.The UN has said that as of 13 July, 875 people had been killed in recent weeks trying to get food, including 674 in the vicinity of GHF sites. The remaining 201 victims were killed on the routes or close to aid convoys run by the UN or its partners.Children have been killed fetching waterfor their families.Meanwhile, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders on Sunday in areas of central Gaza packed with displaced Palestinians, a sign of an imminent attack on neighbourhoods in Deir al-Balah, which has alarmed the families of Israeli hostages, who fear their relatives are being held there.“Can anyone [promise] to us that this decision will not come at the cost of losing our loved ones?” the families said in a statement.The Israeli military dropped leaflets from the sky ordering people in several districts in south-west Deir al-Balah, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza have been sheltering, to leave their homes and head south.View image in fullscreenInjured Palestinians are transported to hospitals in the Zikim area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The [Israel] Defense Forces continues to operate with great force to destroy the enemy’s capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area,” the military said.Israel’s forces have not yet entered these districts during the current conflict because they suspect that Hamas may be holding hostages there. At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed still to be alive.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage.At least 58,895 Palestinians have been killed and 140,980 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPope Leo XIVIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAidPalestinian territoriesGazanewsShareReuse this content"

A hot dry spring in the UK this year, for example, partly droveunexpectedly high UK inflation figurespublished last week, dampening expectations for further interest rate cuts this summer.The report also suggests “high rates of inflation can directly alter election outcomes in modern democracies”.Maximilian Kotz, a Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow at Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the lead author of the report, said:“It is clear the cost of living played a role in last year’s election in the US.”He added: “These effects are going to continue to become worse in the future. Until we get to net zero emissions extreme weather will only get worse, but it’s already damaging crops and pushing up the price of food all over the world.“People are noticing, with rising food prices No 2 on the list of climate impacts they see in their lives, second only to extreme heat itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Legal advocates and attorneys general have argued that it poses accountability issues and contributes to a climate of fear.On Sunday, Todd Lyons, the agency’s acting director, was asked on CBS Face the Nation about imposters exploiting the practice by posing as immigration officers. “That’s one of our biggest concerns. And I’ve said it publicly before, I’m not a proponent of the masks,” Lyons said.“However, if that’s a tool that the men and women of Ice to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it.”Lyons has previously defended the practice of mask-wearing,tellingFox News last week that “while I’m not a fan of the masks, I think we could do better, but we need to protect our agents and officers”, claiming concerns about doxxing (the public revealing of personal information such as home addresses), and declaring that assaults of immigration officers haveincreasedby 830%.Whiledatafrom January 2024 to June 2024 does show 10 reported assaults on Ice officers compared to 79 during the same period last year, those six months have also seen Ice agents descend in record numbers on streets, businesses, farms and public spaces, rounding up and detaining mostly Latino people as part of a massive Trump administration push to rid the US of as many as 1 million immigrants every year.Videos have flooded social media showing Ice agents wearing masks over their faces, detaining people without immediately identifying themselves, refusing to answer questions or explaining why people are being detained, and pushing them into unmarked cars with tinted windows.“I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don’t identify themselves,” Lyonssaid. “Men and women of Ice, and our DoJ partners, and local law enforcement partners who do help us are identified on their vest.” The only identification many agents wear is body armor marked with the word “police”, despite not being police officers.The interview was described as the first major network sit-down at Ice headquarters in Washington.Lyons also confirmed in the interview that Ice obtained and is using Medicaid data to track down immigrants believed to be in the US unlawfully, despite undocumented peoplenot being eligibleto receive Medicaid.White people comprise the largest share of Medicaid recipients, at39.6%.A June report from the Pew Research Center found that84.2%of Medicaid recipients are born in the US, 6.6% are naturalized citizens and 9.2% are foreign-born non-citizens authorized to be in the US.As well as the tens of thousands of arrests, there have been several reported cases of masked criminals posing as Ice officers, such as a man in Raleigh, North Carolinaaccusedin January of kidnapping and raping a woman, threatening to deport her if she didn’t comply, or a man in Brooklynattemptingin February to rape a 51-year-old woman. In April 2025, a Florida womanposedas an immigration officer to briefly kidnap her ex-boyfriend’s wife from her job.Ice agents have also been reported to overstate assaults, such as in New York City mayor candidate Brad Lander’s arrest by immigration officers, where Lander wasaccusedof assaulting officers despitecharges being droppedlater that day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In California, state legislators last monthproposedthe No Vigilantes Act, which would require federal agents to provide identification, including their last name and badge or ID number.“We have a Los Angeles Police Department that has to deal with crime in this city every single day – and they’re not masked, and they stay here,” said the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, in a Sundayinterviewwith ABC News.“I don’t think you have a right to have a mask and snatch people off the street.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a difficult situation, and we have to take it very humbly and seriously.”But the result also weakens Ishiba’s position just days before the country needs to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration to avert the imposition of punishing tariffs in its largest export market.Ishiba later told TV Tokyo: “We are engaged in extremely critical tariff negotiations with the United States … we must never ruin these negotiations. It is only natural to devote our complete dedication and energy to realising our national interests.”Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy,faces a deadline of 1 Augustto strike a trade deal with the US.Japanese imports are already subject to a 10% tariff, while the auto industry – which accounts for 8% of jobs – is reeling from a 25% levy.Weak export data last week, which showed plummeting US-bound auto deliveries, stoked fears that Japan could tip into a technical recession.If Ishiba goes, it was unclear who might step up as the LDP’s 11th premier since 2000 now that the government needs opposition support in both chambers.“Ishiba may be replaced by someone else, but it’s not clear who will be the successor,” Hidehiro Yamamoto, politics and sociology professor at the University of Tsukuba, told Agence France-Presse.The centre-left main opposition Constitutional Democratic party now has a total of 37 seats, with the centre-right Democratic Party for the People now on 22.The far-right Sanseito party won 14 seats, up from one seat, giving it a significant presence in the upper house. Birthed on YouTube in 2020, it has been the election’s surprise package with its“Japanese first” campaignand warnings about a “silent invasion” of foreigners.Turnout was 58%, six points higher than the last upper house vote, with a record number of people casting ballots in advance, in part due to the election falling in the middle of a three-day weekend. Sanseito has been appealing to a sizeable disillusioned segment of the population who feel ignored by the mainstream parties and rarely vote.Opposition parties advocating for tax cuts and welfare spending have struck a chord with voters, exit polls showed, as rising consumer prices – particularlya jump in the cost of rice– have sowed frustration at the government’s response.“The LDP was largely playing defence in this election, being on the wrong side of a key voter issue,” said David Boling, a director at the consulting firm Eurasia Group.“Polls show that most households want a cut to the consumption tax to address inflation, something that the LDP opposes. Opposition parties seized on it and hammered that message home.”The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very jittery government bond market, as investors worry about Japan’s ability to refinance the world’s largest debt pile.Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters.It remains to be seen whether the party can follow the path of other far-right parties with which it has drawn comparisons, such as Germany’s AfD and Reform UK.“I am attending graduate school but there are no Japanese around me. All of them are foreigners,” said Yu Nagai, a 25-year-old student who voted for Sanseito earlier on Sunday.“When I look at the way compensation and money are spent on foreigners, I think that Japanese people are a bit disrespected,” he said after casting his ballot at a polling station in Tokyo’s Shinjuku ward.In Japan, which has the world’s oldest population, foreign-born residents hit a record of about 3.8 million last year.That is still just 3% of the total population, a much smaller fraction than in the US and Europe, but comes amid a tourism boom that has made foreigners far more visible across the country.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificThe far rightPopulationnewsShareReuse this content"

And, critics say, this is all happening as university research and government labs face big cutbacks in funding and staff.Trump has pushed for more fossil-fuel production, rhapsodized about “beautiful coal”, dubbed climate change a “hoax” and invoked his “drill, baby, drill” mantra to promote more oil and gas projects after receiving $75m in campaign donations in 2024 from fossil-fuel interests.Scholars have hit out at the administration for firing hundreds of scientists and experts working on a major federal report detailing how climate change is impacting the country. The administration has also systematically deleted mentions of climate change from federal websites while cutting back funds for global warming research.“Trump’s actions are a patent attempt to roll back decades of environmental progress, not because it makes any sense, economically, but because it does two things that Trump wants,” Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian of science, told the Guardian“First, it helps his cronies in the oil, gas and coal industries, who we know he met with a Mar-a-Lago before the election, and who gave substantial sums to his election campaign.”Oreskes said it’s also “part of a larger attempt to deny the credibility of environmental protection, tout court”.“Look at Trump trying to force uneconomic coal fired power plants to stay open,” she continued. “That makes no economic sense, and defies the principles of free market economics that Republicans claim to support. But like the guys who jack up their trucks to make more pollution, Trump is trying to deny the necessity and credibility of environmental concerns.”Oreskes stressed that much of the science Trump “is in the process of destroying forms the basis for environmental and public health protection in this country: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Geological Survey and the EPA, plus all the federally funded science at universities across the country, including my home institution, Harvard. None of this makes economic sense.”Many scientists echo Oreskes’s concerns as do Democratic attorneys general, who filed a lawsuit in May challenging the legality of the Trump administration’s declaration of a national “energy emergency” to justify its radical policies.Meanwhile, regulatory and spending shifts at the Environmental Protection Agency, including staff and research cuts, have revealed the administration’s disregard for scientific evidence – particularly about climate change and its adverse economic effects.In response to the cuts and policy shifts, a total of 278 EPA employeessigned a letterin July denouncing the agency’s politicization and decrying policies that “undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The EPA then put 144 of the employees who signed their names to the letter on leave for two weeks while an “administrative investigation” was conducted.“This isn’t quite at the level of the 17th-century church’s persecution of Galileo for saying the Earth goes around the Sun, but it’s in a similar spirit of ideology trying to squelch science,” Michael Gerrard, who heads the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told the Guardian.“Trump’s use of an invented ‘energy emergency’ to justify more fossil-fuel production defies not only physics but arithmetic. The numbers show that the US is producing more oil and gas than any other country, and that Trump’s actions in knifing the wind and solar industries will raise the energy prices paid by US consumers.”Gerrard stressed too that, on the Texas flooding, “the lack of sufficient warnings highlight how short-sighted are Trump’s drastic cuts to the National Weather Service and other federal scientific work”. He added it was “especially so since climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, and Trump’s attacks on green energy and support of fossil fuels will make those worse”.Such criticism has not seemed to faze Trump or top agency appointees like EPA administrator Lee Zeldin.Last month, 1,500 staffers who work in EPA’s office of research and development (ORD) were told in a staff meeting that they would have to apply for about 400 new posts in other EPA offices. What will happen to employees who don’t land new positions is unclear.“Gutting the … [ORD] is a loss for health,” warned Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice-president of nationwide healthy air at the American Lung Association.Further experts and watchdogs have stressed that the health of millions of Americans was threatened by Zeldin’s May announcement of plans to cut its budget by $300m in fiscal year 2026 – a move that’s part of a makeover to reduce spending levels to those of the 1980s under Ronald Reagan.On Friday, the EPA doubled down on the cuts and say it would be reducing its entire workforce byat least 23%through voluntary retirements and layoffs.Gerrard noted that the administration’s misguided energy moves and rejection of science are having enormous societal costs: “Laboratories are being shut down around the country, experiments that might be on the cusp of great discoveries are being halted, and young aspiring scientists are rethinking their career paths. Other countries are recruiting US scientists and offering them friendlier environments.”Looking ahead, Oreskes, too, warns that the Trump administration’s denigration of science will do long term damage to public health, the environment and scientific progress“The scientific agencies that Trump is destroying, such as the National Weather Service, save the American people and American business billions of dollars in avoided property damage and health costs,” she said.“But if you want to deny the true costs of climate change, then you may be motivated to destroy the agency that documents these costs [Noaa]. And if you want to deny the need for environmental and public health protection, then an effective way to do that is to destroy the scientific agencies and academic research that for decades have proven that need.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpClimate crisisShareReuse this content"

Now those who love the remote North Rim are reckoning with the destructionAnnette McGivneyin Cortez, ColoradoSun 20 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 07.02 EDTShareWhen lightning struck on 4 July along the remote North Rim of Grand Canyon national park, sparking a small wildfire in a patch of dry forest, few predicted the terror and loss that lay ahead.Fire managers decided that conditions seemed ideal to let the blaze burn at a low intensity – a practice known as “control and contain” that helps clear out excess fuels and decreases the chance of a more catastrophic wildfire in the future. Rains from previous weeks had left the forest floor moist and weather forecasts indicated the summer monsoon season would arrive soon.It feels like a piece of who we are has burned with itGrand Canyon park employeeBut a week later, the park’s strategy fell apart. On 11 July, the fire burst through its containment lines and began to rapidly pick up speed – exploding tenfold in a day.“The fire sounded like a freight train coming towards us,” says a firefighter, who was part of the National Parks Service crew battling the blaze.By 12 July, it seemed the destruction was unstoppable. Over the next 24 hourssome 70 buildings would be destroyed, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, dozens of visitor cabins as well as park administrative offices and residences. Images of the smoldering lodge and the smoke-filled canyon filled news stories and social media feeds.Suddenly, it felt like the whole world was questioning the decision to not put the blaze out immediately. Almost two weeks after it began, the so-calledDragon Bravo fireis still only 2% contained and encompasses nearly 12,000 acres (4,856 hectares), as more than 750 firefighters have battled the blaze.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises as the Dragon Bravo fire burns on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, as people wait to watch the sunrise at Mather Point on the canyon’s South Rim in Arizona, on 15 July 2025.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersThe park’s North Rim has long been the sleepy cousin of the more bustling South Rim, bringing in just 10% of the park’s annual visitors, and inspiring loyal fans. News of the tragedy has hit Grand Canyon lovers hard. The area has been shut down for the remainder of the season, and hundreds of national park and concession employees have suddenly found themselves without homes and jobs. An untold number of summer vacations to the park have been cancelled.But there is also a more existential loss. A place beloved by visitors and employees for its beauty and solitude has suddenly been ripped away. And the heart of that sanctuary, the Grand Canyon Lodge – the park’s Notre Dame – is in ruins.“It’s hard to put into words how devastating the loss of the Grand Canyon Lodge is,” wrote one longtime Grand Canyon North Rim park employee on social media. “The Lodge and North Rim weren’t just buildings and trails – they were a home to us … and now it’s gone. It feels like a piece of who we are has burned with it.”How the blaze startedAs the initial shock subsides and the reality of the loss sets in, questions are swirling about how the tragedy occurred – and how to move forward.In hindsight, the decision not to tamp out the fire swiftly has drawn the most scrutiny. But the Grand Canyon fire crew member who was on scene in early July, who asked not to be identified for fear of losing his job, said it seemed like a reasonable call based on assessment at the time.For the first few days after it broke out, the blaze behaved exactly as expected. But then on 11 July the humidity level suddenly plummeted. Embers began jumping containment lines in the dry air as strong winds changed direction and the fire escaped down a drainage, picking up momentum as if gasoline had been dumped on it. By the next day it had exploded from 120 acres to 1,500 acres.View image in fullscreenThe Dragon Bravo Fire burns on as seen from Grandeur Point on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon on 14 July 2025.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersSome 500 visitors at the North Rim had already been evacuated due to another fire burning outside the park, dubbed the White Sage fire. The remaining residents were evacuated, and the park’s fire crew began hosing down structures. But the team was lacking adequate equipment and manpower, the firefighter said.According to the firefighter, some of the department’s already limited resources had been sent to fight the White Sage fire. They were missing two fire engines and a bulldozer, and they needed more boots on the ground. Plus, aerial suppression support would not arrive until the next day.By nightfall on 11 July, the fast-growing fire had surrounded the crew and they were instructed by managers to take cover in the North Rim’s fire station. Soon, he said, the fire was everywhere. Nearby, another group of firefighters were trapped on a helipad, flanked by flames 100ft (30.5 metres) tall.“We were trapped,” recalled the firefighter. “We thought we were going to die. Propane tanks from surrounding buildings were exploding all around us. Our homes and our friend’s homes were burning and there was nothing we could do.”The North Rim did not need to burn the way it did and put firefighters in harm’s wayKen PhillipsLocated at a cool elevation of 8,000ft on the Kaibab plateau in northernArizona, Grand Canyon national park’s North Rim is a four-hour drive from the more famous South Rim. The isolation is what makes it special for park employees and visitors, but the largely undeveloped region is also especially vulnerable to wildfire. A single paved road connects the park to Jacob Lake, a small village some 50 miles away.The ponderosa pine forest ecosystem of the Kaibab plateau relies on regular low-intensity fires to stay healthy, but those fires were supressed by federal policies throughout most of the 20th century. National park managers have attempted to restore the Grand Canyon’s natural forest ecosystem over the last two decades through prescribed fires, or by allowing lightning-sparked wildfires to burn.The strategy went off without a hitch as recently as July 2022, when a lightning strike started a fire on the North Rim that grew to only 1,300 acres as fire crews tightly managed the boundaries of the blaze.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Canyon Lodge on the park’s North Rim was described as ‘idyllic’.Photograph: Michael Quinn/APHowever, other examples have been less successful. In June 2006, a lightning-sparked fire trapped several hundred visitors after strong winds pushed the flames beyond its containment lines. The only paved road out of the park was blocked by flames, but law enforcement officers led visitors to safety on a web of winding dirt roads.Ken Phillips, who worked at Grand Canyon for 27 years and served as chief of emergency services, believes the decision to let the Dragon Bravo fire burn was a mistake. He also points out that lives could have been lost if visitors had not already been evacuated due to the White Sage fire.“The North Rim did not need to burn the way it did and put firefighters in harm’s way,” he said. “There is a history of escaped managed wildfires at Grand Canyon. It is very tragic that the lessons learned from those fires weren’t heeded in this situation.”In response to a request for comment about the handling of the fire, a spokesperson directed the Guardian to a public statement from Ed Keable, the Grand Canyon superintendent, that described the wildfire as a “devastating event”.In a previous statement tothe Arizona Republic,Rachel Pawlitz, a park spokesperson, defended the initial handling of the fire and also contradicted what firefighters said they experienced on 11 and 12 July. “We’ve lost buildings but hundreds of lives were saved due to the fact that this fire was expertly handled,” she said. “The firefighters did not put themselves or others at risk when they managed the initial firefight, pushing historic wind gusts that caused the fire to jump multiple containment features and move toward facilities instead.”‘Like the death of a close friend’Built in 1936, the Grand Canyon Lodge sits at the tip of a peninsula jutting out into the canyon allowing unmatched views of the natural wonder. Visitor cabins, perched on the rim nearby, are shaded by towering old growth pine and spruce trees.Kathryn Leonard, the state historic preservation officer for the state of Arizona, calls the style of the historic buildings “national park rustic”. The lodge and cabins echo the surrounding environment with rock walls made from Kaibab limestone and roofs supported by exposed ponderosa pine trusses.View image in fullscreenThe view from the Grand Canyon Lodge before it burned down.Photograph: Erik Ammerlaan/APThe Grand Canyon Lodge was uniquely “idyllic” and “open” according to Leonard. Once visitors entered the building, they could walk down a stairway where a sun room with leather couches featured a giant south-facing picture window looking out onto the Grand Canyon, some 5,000ft deep and 20 miles across. The best view in the house was on the lodge patio where visitors leaned back in Adirondack chairs and watched the sunset while sipping a beer.Pictures of the lodge that circulated on social media after the fire showed that all but two Adirondack chairs had been destroyed. Everything else was ash except for the limestone walls.“I couldn’t believe that the lodge was gone until I saw the photo,” said Phillips, the former emergency services manager. “The loss of the entire North Rim developed area is like the death of a close friend.”“The scale of this loss is breathtaking,” agreed Leonard. “Historic resources are non-renewable and the workmanship in the cabin and lodge interiors can’t be replaced.”Yet Leonard is also cautiously optimistic that some elements of the building can be salvaged. “There could be a way to rebuild that does not attempt to replicate what was there but honors it.”Beyond the charred facilities, the more lasting damage could be to the Grand Canyon’s environment itself.View image in fullscreenA firefighter stands near smoldering debris amid the charred remains of a burned structure near the Grand Canyon Lodge on 13 July 2025.Photograph: National Park Service/ReutersThe forested area on the Kaibab plateau where the Dragon Bravo fire is burning encompasses the recharge zone feeding Roaring Springs, the park’s sole drinking water source. Rain and snowmelt percolate down through the ground to feed the springs located several thousand feet below the canyon rim. Surface water in the area also flows off the plateau and into Bright Angel Creek.“From a hydrology perspective, the fire is a disaster,”said Mark Nebel, who until recently retiring, oversaw water monitoring at Grand Canyon.Nebel worries that ash, sediment and chemical fire retardant may seep through the ground and into the aquifer that feeds the springs. These pollutants will also likely be swept into the Bright Angel watershed this summer as flash flooding is expected to occur as a result of the fire.The US is woefully underprepared for wildfire season, say insiders: ‘The stakes are life and death’Read more“The drinking water quality in the park could be impacted for many years,” added Nebel.As Arizona governor Katie Hobbs hascalled for an investigationinto park service decisions and firefighters continue to battle the blaze, North Rim employees find themselves reminiscing about happier times.John McFarland, a former maintenance mechanic who lived and worked on the North Rim for 30 years, recalls how he organized a Fourth of July parade at the park every summer that was followed by an “epic” water gun fight in front of the lodge. Many of the buildings he cared for are gone, but he is taking the loss in stride.“The Grand Canyon is still there,” he said. “Some of the old growth trees are still there. The place will come back.”Explore more on these topicsArizonaNational parksWildfiresWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The practice has been happening since at least 2022, according to aninvestigation last yearby Lighthouse Reports, Le Monde, the Observer and Der Spiegel.The incident, revealed to the Guardian in a log known as a situation report or Sitrep from the Gris-Nez maritime rescue coordination centre, happened overnight on 9/10 July just hours before the Starmer-Macron announcement.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in media interviews last week thatFrancewas reviewing tactics that might produce change based on the principle of intervening in French waters and that it would take forward the conclusions of that review.According to the log, the incident began at 11.21pm on the night of 9 July when the gendarmerie intervened in the departure of a dinghy from Cayeux-sur-Mer by puncturing it. Then they lost sight of the boat and at 11.22 the coastguard was asked to search with air and sea resources.The coastguard identified the dinghy in the early hours of 10 July. Despite having been slashed it picked up more passengers along the coast and arrived in the UK with 55 passengers the same day after it was rescued by an RNLI lifeboat.Home Office datashows that 10 boats arrived that day carrying 573 passengers.French coastguard sources said the incident was evidence that even when the gendarmarie had slashed a dinghy, if it remains afloat those on board would not be deterred from trying to reach the UK. It also highlights that the boat-slashing tactic requires extra sea rescue resources.In an open letter to its directorpublishedin French media on 25 June from the French coastguard union, Solidaires Douanes, concerns were raised about “increasing institutional mistreatment of people in exile” as part of stop-the-boats policies.Separately it has emerged that the Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport has been earmarked to detain people who arrive in small boats before their return to France.It is not known how the Home Office will select those for return, nor for how long they will be detained. Brook House was previously the subject of a public inquiry afterdamning undercover footage of mistreatmentof detainees obtained by BBC’s Panorama.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not when they have already fled war and persecution at home, and survived unimaginable dangers on their journey.“The fact people are willing to risk their lives to seek safety in the UK in the first place should be enough evidence that so-called deterrents, regardless of how brutal they are, do not work. They only make people take ever more dangerous journeys. The only way to stop crossings is to offer safe routes to claim asylum.”Home Office sources said the French government had not yet announced the outcome of their review, but that officials hoped maritime operational teams would soon be able to intervene to stop boats in the water.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, four in 10, or nearly 15 million people, are not saving enough for their retirement, according to analysis by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).The revived Pensions Commission will examine the long-term future of the retirement system and make recommendations for change. Labour hopes its proposals, due to be reported in 2027, will gain cross-party support and be enacted beyond the current parliament.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said she was relaunching the commission to “tackle the barriers that stop too many saving in the first place”.The previous Pensions Commission, which produced its last report in late 2005, recommendedautomatically enrolling peopleinto workplace pensions.As a result of this, 88% of eligible employees now save for a pension, up from 55% in 2012. However, DWP analysis has found that saving levels have remained low among those automatically enrolled into a workplace pension scheme, with roughly half of private sector workers only saving around the minimum contribution level,which represents 8% or less of earnings.Torsten Bell, the pensions minister, said the original commission “helped get pension saving up and pensioner poverty down” and a revived commission would “finish the job and give today’s workers secure retirements to look forward to”.Bell appears to have changed his mind about the value of a commission, havingdismissed calls for a relaunchwhen speaking at an industry conference as recently as March, adding that a “technocratic” approach would not solve problems.The relaunched commission will include Jeannie Drake, who was a member of the original commission, along with the former chair of Barclays UK, Ian Cheshire, and Nick Pearce, a professor of public policy at the University of Bath.Analysis by the DWP has found that nearly half (45%) of working-age adults are not saving anything at all into their pension, with low earners, some ethnic minorities and the self-employed seen as particularly at risk.More than 3 million self-employed workers are not saving into a pension, it found, while this is also the case for a quarter of low earners in the private sector. Only one in four people from a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background are saving into a pension.There is also a stark gender gap of 48% in the private pension wealth of men compared with women. A typical woman who is now approaching retirement can expect a private pension income that is worth more than £5,000 less than that of a typical man.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Six water companies have said this is not sufficient to meet the regulator Ofwat’s target and have complained to the Competition and Markets Authority to seek further bill increases.However, asked by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg whether he would allow water companies to increase bills even further, as many have already requested, he said the decision would be up to regulators.“I‘m furious about the bill rises that we saw last year,” he said. “They happened because of 14 years of failure under the previous government. They could have intervened and made sure that that investment to fix the broken sewage pipes was going in. They didn’t.“The point is you can learn from the past to improve the future. If you see a crack in the wall of your home and you leave it for 10 years, it gets much more expensive to fix. That’s what happened with our water pipes. Bill payers were made to pay the price of failure.“I’m furious about that. By changing the whole system, root and branch reform, I can make sure enough money is going in every year that we will never again see that kind of massive bill hike that customers had to pay last year.”‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreMinisters will this week announce a consultation into creating a new water regulator, with a government-commissioned review expected to confirm on Monday that Ofwat, the watchdog that polices how much water companies can charge for services,will be abolished.Critics say Ofwat has presided over a culture of underinvestment in water infrastructure and financial mismanagement by water companies since its creation in 1989. Thames Water, the most troubling case for the government and the UK’s largest water company, is loaded with £20bn in debt andstruggling to stave off financial collapse.Reed also told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme that households expected “a small, steady increase” in water bills rather than massive hikes. “Bills need to be as low as possible,” he said.There needed to be “appropriate bill rises” to secure “appropriate levels of investment”, he said, adding: “A small, steady increase in bills is what people expect. That’s what happens in most bills that I pay this year.”Industry leaders have long complained about a lack of coherence in water regulation, with different regulators and agencies doubling up on areas of investigation. This has made it hard to have timely decisions, allowing investigations to drag on rather than prevent or address environmental harm and pollution.Reed said it was “outrageous” that Southern Water’s chief executive, Lawrence Gosden, was given a pay rise thatalmost doubled his income, adding that he should have turned it down.“Trust between the customers and the water companies is at the lowest point probably ever, and by paying their senior executives rises of that kind, what message are they sending to their customers?” he added. “I really would urge them to think about this very, very, very carefully.”He said he would resign as environment secretary if the government failed to halve sewage pollution in rivers by 2030. “Politicians come and say we’re going to do things. Of course our job should be on the line if we don’t.”Reed has come under fire from sewage campaigners for announcing targets which they say are no better than those in Ofwat’s plan.During the price review process, which is the negotiation by the regulator and the water companies about how much bills need to go up to invest in the water sector, Ofwat last year announced the investment from bills would cut sewage spills by 45% from 2021 levels.Reed announcend that he would cut sewage spills by 50% by 2030 against 2024 levels. However, Ofwat’s goal would reduce sewage spills to 204,893 by 2030, compared to Reed’s which would reduce them to 225,199 by that year.Defra sources said Reed’s target could be stronger than Ofwat’s because for 2021 storm overflows baseline only 87.8% of overflows were monitored. The 2024 baseline includes 100% monitoring. However, the two figures are largely similar.The price review process began in 2023, when plans were submitted under the previous Tory government. The £104bn to be invested in fixing England’s creaking sewage infrastructure is coming from a record increase in water bills.Feargal Sharkey, former Undertones frontman turned sewage campaigner said the targets unveiled on Sunday are actually worse than those Ofwat announced during the price review process.He told the Guardian: “It’s an act worthy of a Greek tragedy telling your regulator that you’ve come up with a plan that turns out to be worse than the one they come up with a year and a half ago. The government has decided to axe Ofwat while announcing targets which are worse than theirs. Their plan is not worth the paper it’s written on.”Explore more on these topicsWater industrySteve ReedGreen politicsHousehold billsWaterRegulatorsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

So he and wife booked an appointment to get it replaced.When he arrived at the office on 20 June, however, he was handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, who led him away from his wife without explanation, she said. She herself was kept in the building for 10 hours until relatives picked her up.The family said they made efforts to find any information on his whereabouts but learned nothing.Then, sometime after Leon was detained, a woman purporting to be an immigration lawyer called the family, claiming she could help – but did not disclose how she knew about the case, or where Leon was.On 9 July, according to Leon’s granddaughter, the same woman called them again, claiming Leon had died.A week later, however, they discovered from a relative in Chile that Leon was alive after all – but now in a hospital in Guatemala, a country to which he has no connection.According to Morning Call, the relative said Leon had first been sent to an immigration detention center in Minnesota before being deported to Guatemala – despite not appearing on any Ice detention deportation lists.A recent supreme court decision ruled theTrump administrationcould deport immigrants to other countries beside their country of origin.In his nearly 40 years living in the US, Leon spent his career working in a leather manufacturing plant, and raised a family. He had since retired.His condition at the hospital in Guatemala is unknown. He suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition, according to his family, who said they are planning to fly to Guatemala to see him.An Ice official told the Morning Call it was investigating the matter.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

Ahead of her new album, she talks fame, gossip and Trump’s America – and doesn’t hold backSun 20 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShare“Ilooove to lie,” sighs Reneé Rapp happily, sounding like a kid who has just discovered a new favourite toy. She’s talking about using creative licence in her songs, and how she realised, while working on her second album, that she didn’t have to stick to the truth of her own experience 100% of the time. But for a journalist, the admission – and her apparent glee about it – demands a follow-up: has she lied at all in the last 40 minutes?I expect Rapp, 25, to wave away the question. Instead she pauses, seeming to give it real thought. “Have I lied? You know, I don’t think so,” she eventually concludes.I’m still not sure if I believe her, but that’s part of the joy of Reneé Rapp. Whether you’re in her company or merely count yourself a fan, she gives the impression of being authentic, outspoken and honest, sometimes to her own detriment. But then, there’s a moment – a glint in her eye, or an edge to her tone that tips it into deadpan – when you have to wonder: is she being for real?We’re meeting at a cafe in King’s Cross on one of the first hot days in June. Even at the discreet corner table, Rapp radiates star power – jewel-tone shirt dress, sweater draped around her shoulders just so, heeled black boots despite the sweltering heat – and that kind of implacable confidence that’s both sexy and a bit scary. I don’t think the waiting staff recognise her, but they nevertheless seem flustered, bungling her coffee order.In fact, Rapp is more friendly and approachable than suggested by her glamorous, pull-no-punches image and on-screen association with preppy queen bees. Her breakout role was Regina George in the Broadway musical Mean Girls, followed by a turn as initially closeted, privileged daddy’s girl Leighton Murray in Mindy Kaling’s sitcomThe Sex Lives of College Girls. (Queen bee Regina George would never labour to reassure a waiter, as Rapp does, that she was happy – nay,thrilled– with a hot coffee after having ordered a cold one.) Since then, Rapp has also made her name as a pop star. Her debut album, Snow Angel, released in 2023, received positive reviews for its assured, R&B-infused pop.View image in fullscreenClique bait … Rapp in Mean Girls.Photograph: Jojo WhildenBut Rapp’s star really began to rise early last year with her press tour for the film adaptation of the Mean Girls musical. Fromblastingthe “asshole” owner of a tour bus company, topraisingrapper (and collaborator) Megan Thee Stallion’s ass as “the best” she’s ever seen, toadmittingto being ageist against millennial women, Rapp’s interviews were candid to the point of chaotic. Instead of opprobrium, her apparently off-the-cuff comments were met with widespread approval online, boosting her profile and sparking a running joke about her apparent lack of a filter: when guest-starring on Saturday Night Live during that time, Rapp was jokingly sentenced to “40 hours of court-ordered media training”.Rapp’s reputation for being refreshingly unfiltered, compared with the carefully crafted statements commonly made by celebrities today, initially took her by surprise. “It’s very weird, honestly, to be perceived that way, because I don’t really think about it,” she says.It’s true that Rapp does seem less guarded than many celebrities of her age and experience, but at the same time, she doesn’t court controversy or spout uninformed views.When she set out to become a singer, Rapp continues, “I never thought about how people would dissect even the way you speak”. It’s confusing that she’s become known for her media appearances, she says. “Like, wait, what would a normal response be? A fluffy, nonsense answer?” I’m afraid so, I say; but she’s not awaiting confirmation – she’s already off, her intensity rising as she speaks. “To me, that would make me crazy – if I was a journalist, that would drive me fucking up the wall!” (Yes, Reneé.) “Because I would be like, ‘Hang on, we’re not even like having a conversation’.” Her eyes behind her blue-tinted aviators flash. “That would make me insane.”But the expectation that Rapp will always speak her mind has raised the stakes ahead of her second album Bite Me, out next month. The six tracks made available before our conversation were mostly heartfelt love songs, showing off Rapp’s powerful voice and confessional lyrics. But the tone was set by the Joan Jett-referencing lead singleLeave Me Alone, building on the public image of Rapp as a party-girl pop star who refuses to be tamed. “Sign a hundred NDAs, but I still say something,” she drawls.View image in fullscreenFull English … Rapp performing at Wembley Stadium in June.Photograph: David Fisher/Shutterstock for GlobalIn the first major media appearance of her album promo campaign, with comedian Ziwe, Rapp confirmed she’d still not received any media training before going on to discuss her 4.5-star rating on celebrity foot rating site WikiFeet (“I’m so angry, my friends have five!)”,whether her great-grandparents owned slaves(she suspects they did) and which she “gave less of a fuck about: women’s rights or gay rights”. (Gay rights, for the record.) But I wonder if – refreshing though it may be – this no-holds-barred persona might sometimes work against Rapp, preventing her from being taken in earnest while seeding the idea that, in her company, anything goes. The day before our interview, Rapp held a Q&A for fans in London that wasreportedlyderailed by a small group who appeared to have had too many of the Reneé-themed cocktails.Rapp says now that she doesn’t feel pressure to be consistently “iconic” or chill in her press appearances – but she doesn’t deny that this Q&A didn’t go to plan. Rapp had been looking forward to getting into her new album with fans who cared about the nerdy detail. Instead, she struggled to hear their questions over the disorderly minority. “Honestly, it just made me sad.”The real sour note came afterwards, when she and Towa Bird – her British musician girlfriend – were rushed by fans while trying to get in a lift. I try to clarify exactly what happened, but Rapp seems unsure of the details herself. “To be honest, I kept my head down.”But she has no doubt about how it made her feel. “People running after you, into a fucking elevator bank – it’s such weird behaviour,” Rapp says, outraged. “I was so pissed, I was so upset. I was like: ‘You don’t get to chase my girlfriend and me – that’s not fine’.”At the same time, she sees it as part of the deal of being famous. “I don’t like to be disrespected, but I also understand that I’ve signed up for this shit, to an extent.”Indeed Rapp’s truest ambition was to be a pop star; she got into acting, she’s said, as a means to an end. As a child growing up outside Charlotte, North Carolina, she wanted to be Beyoncé – and to get out of her small, now Maga-voting town, Huntersville. “I just didn’t feel very comfortable there,” she says, pointing to her showbusiness aspirations and her emerging sexual identity.Well before she first came out (as bisexual, in 2022; she now identifies as a lesbian), Rapp was the only white girl within her friend group, she says. Her mother would tell her to never turn right out of their neighbourhood – it wasn’t safe for her and her friends. “Everybody has rifles, and if you look at them the wrong way, they will shoot you,” Rapp recalls. Today, she says, “there’re people who live in the neighbourhood that I grew up in, who don’t speak to my parents because I’m out.” It doesn’t bother Rapp or her family, she says with forceful disdain. “I’ve never asked for the approval of conservative white bigots – I’m certainly not going to start now.”She is equally outspoken about Palestine: speaking at the GLAAD Media awards in April 2024, she called for an “immediate ceasefire and permanent ceasefire”, and today has no qualms about denouncing “the genocide” under way. When I ask if she’s ever been advised not to comment, or to use different phrasing, Rapp doesn’t say she hasn’t. “It’s interesting, people would often mask it as ‘That verbiage may make people uncomfortable.’ I would argue that people being slaughtered makes me uncomfortable and should in fact make you uncomfortable.”Rapp feels obliged to speak out not just because it’s the right thing to do but, she says, because it’s so much harder for non-white women. She admits she was shocked when she first moved to New York in 2019, to joinMean Girlson Broadway and discovered “that people are still conservative bigots there”. Rapp starred in the show for about seven months before Covid brought it to a premature close.View image in fullscreenSchool’s out … The Sex Lives of College Girls.Photograph: ITVNow living with Bird in a “seemingly white-liberal-ass neighbourhood” of Los Angeles, Rapp says there are “extremists” a few doors down, with signs in the windows warning “We’re armed”.“Especially with our current administration, it’s just so in your face – the hate for people who could be considered ‘other’,” she says. “There’s just direct hate, and it’s so loud.”‘Trust me, I have not been out-girlbossed’: pop star Reneé Rapp on Mean Girls, mean girls and mental healthRead moreWhen I ask Rapp where she got the confidence to speak her mind, she answers simply: “I have phenomenal parents.” Her father, Charles, and mother, Denise, instilled in Rapp and her brother the importance of hard work and personal accountability.“They were just always like: ‘Be accountable to yourself, to your friends, to people you don’t know,’” she says. What Rapp took away was that “there’s no shame in being wrong, necessarily”; what mattered was being able to “look in the mirror” and hold your head up high.Though she is grateful for that foundation, it wasn’t always easy: even when Rapp was very young, her parents didn’t hold back in their feedback on her performances. Rapprecently claimedthat Denise even gave her daughter an alliterative name, “just in case” she wanted to become a pop star.View image in fullscreenPower couple … Rapp with partner Towa Bird.Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/Variety/Getty ImagesToday her parents are among only a handful of people who she can count on to be brutally honest with her, along with Bird – and maybe “two people” on her team.“I don’t trust anyone,” she says, “and I don’t say that in a ‘Oh, no, I feel lonely!’ way – I know that there are so many people who are never going to be honest with me. I think everyone is lying to me, all the time.”It perhaps explains her own premium on public-facing authenticity. Even when she says she loves to lie, it seems it’s only about the things that don’t matter.I put it to Rapp that, where other pop stars might be blandly noncommittal, her own strategy for getting around difficult questions she doesn’t want to answer is to deploy humour. “Exactly,” she says, like I’m her pupil giving her a correct answer.Of course, a veneer of authenticity can also be a way of obfuscating what someone really thinks. Her single Leave Me Alone is a prime example: the line where Rapp crows “I took my sex life with me, now the show ain’t fuckin’!” went viral for seeming to allude to her departure from The Sex Lives of College Girls (there were rumours that cast members had questioned her sexuality). Online, the show’s fans decried the line as tacky and disrespectful of the role that made her famous; Rapp’s fans said she was only being “iconic” again.Rapp only stirred the pot further in her interview with Ziwe, describing Sex Lives as being “such a good experience” in a way that played equally as sarcastic or sincere. “I wish I could go back,” she said, deadpan. Even whip-smart Ziwe seemed to fall for it, inquiring: “Really?” “Nope!” Rapp shot back.When I tell her about the online debate raging over her intentions, Rapp gives a Cheshire cat grin. “It’s like Beyoncé said: ‘You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.’”Having previously approached songwriting as an exercise in truth-telling, Rapp discovered with this album that she could embellish her experiences and even make things up without sacrificing emotional truth. She doesn’t feel the need to respond to speculation about what her songs are about.I ask Rapp if she gave her former Sex Lives co-stars a heads-up about the “show ain’t fuckin’” line. “I didn’t write it,” she says instantly. I’m momentarily flummoxed. Rapp spies her chance and runs with it. “I’ve not heard of that show, is it good?” she continues, cocking her head as though earnestly engaged.It takes me a beat too long to realise – she’s messing with me, right? “Yep.”Reneé Rapp’s new album, Bite Me, is released on 1 August.Explore more on these topicsMusicMean GirlsPop and rockMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

Guess!” Twyla Tharp imploredWayne McGregor, in a post-show interview at the Venice Dance Biennale. McGregor, the festival’s artistic director, didn’t dare venture a figure. “Two-hundred and twenty-seven pounds!” she told us all, delightedly.Never underestimate Twyla. The slight, white-haired 84-year-old is as sharp as ever, and a force in the dance world. She’s been choreographing for 60 years, for ballet companies and Broadway, dance both experimental and accessible, art and pop. And she is honoured this year with the biennale’s Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.Tharp is a smart, no-nonsense woman with a dry sense of humour, and her work is much the same. Only two pieces from her vast repertoire are staged inVenicethis year, but one especially, Diabelli (from 1998), set to Beethoven’s 33 Diabelli Variations, has the same precise, self-certain manner as the woman herself. It takes one idea – the rigorous exploration of music and form – and drills into it determinedly. The dance is non-stop, a showcase for the tremendous dancers of her company, all quite different bodies but brilliant technicians, rooted in classicism with Tharp’s easy synthesis of jazz, contemporary and vernacular dance forms. It is absolutely chock-full of steps. That might seem obvious, but a lot of contemporary dance now hinges on vibe, mood and repetitive riffs, whereas Tharp is just step after step, finely and deliberately wrought phrases in constant motion with absolute clarity. With its fairly unwavering tone, from the audience there’s perhaps not as much light and shade as Tharp herself sees – but she has no time for dawdling (there’s a similarity with McGregor’s own work here: the constant fast-paced flying mind, expecting you to keep up).The second piece is the European premiere of Slacktide, set to Philip Glass. It’s new, but interestingly, uses material from Tharp’s back catalogue, reversioned. Compared with Diabelli, the look is certainly more “now”, diffused light, dancers in black shorts and vests, and rather than the front-facing performance mode of the earlier work, the dancers are on their own trajectories, moving between solos and groups. It has a greater sense of freedom, dynamic and edge, but the same very serious conversation with choreography.View image in fullscreenProvocative … Carolina Bianchi’s The Brotherhood.Photograph: Mayra AzziThe winner of the Silver Lion, for an outstanding upcoming choreographer, was the Brazilian Carolina Bianchi. Bianchi has the same absolute commitment to her art as Tharp, but is a completely different proposition. She’s best known for the first part of her Cadela Força trilogy, The Bride and the Goodnight Cinderella, in which Bianchi takes a date rape drug live on stage and then attempts to continue the show while the audience watch its effects take over, made in response to her own experience of sexual assault.The second chapter of the trilogy, The Brotherhood, gets its Italian premiere in Venice and it goes deeper (very much deeper, at almost four hours in length) into Bianchi’s own attempts to process what happened to her: the injustice, the omnipresent patriarchy, the bewilderment over what gives men seeming licence to abuse women, from the rape of Lucretia to Gisèle Pelicot. She does this through film, performance, a faux interview with a famous theatre director, set-pieces with the male performers from company Cara de Cavalo, and addressing the audience directly. She considers hazing initiations, the myth of the troubled genius in art, the politics of the rehearsal room, the subtle undermining of women in professional life. There’s so much here, a bit of editing wouldn’t go amiss (although it doesn’t feel like 220 minutes) but then this is the ever-circling mind after trauma, always returning to the wound, never finding the answer.Fearless Bianchi is sometimes provocatively shocking, she is also constantly questioning herself, getting in her criticisms before anyone else can. Her subjects are theatre, art, violence and anger. And the real question may be, why aren’t we all angrier, all the time, about how commonplace this abuse is? Bianchi introduces herself on stage as predominantly a writer, and this is a text-based show within the realm of performance art, an interesting choice for a dance prize. But the body is absolutely at the centre of her work. Her central question, as she puts it, is what do we do with this body? How to live in a body that survives rape?View image in fullscreenHuman-machine hybrid hexapods … Chunky Move at the Venice Dance Biennale.Photograph: Andrea AvezzuElsewhere at the biennale, the opening show comes from Australia’s Chunky Move, a company established in 1995, now led by Antony Hamilton, who has choreographed U>N>I>T>E>D. The stage is dominated by a large mechanical contraption, a piece of rigging that holds what looks like a giant insect with flashing and glowing lights. The dancers have mechanical limbs too, multijointed insect-y legs attached to them, turning them into human-machine hybrid hexapods.It immediately brought to mind a piece McGregor made for his company in 2002, Nemesis, where the dancers wore mechanical limbs extending their arms. In fact the whole look is very millennium-bug-throwback, like a guerrilla army of hackers who’ve jumped the fence at Glastonbury, in baggy parachute pants with all sorts of straps and layers and clashing patterns and camo and reflective neon. It’s a crusty-cyberpunk look – if you ever went near Brighton in the 1990s, you’d recognise it. Except that in the 90s we barely had mobile phones or email addresses and this kind of tech felt like pure sci-fi, whereas now, the idea of humans getting tech implants or machines becoming sentient is basically the world we live in. So that’s unnerving. But what does Hamilton have to say about it? Not so much. The thing about all the cumbersome props is that they extend the body’s possibilities, but also reduce their ability to move. There’s a vague sense of struggle between embracing or fighting the machines but, just like in the real world, having the technology is one thing, deciding what to use it for, or what you want to say with it, is entirely another. It’s neither stirringly hopeful nor apocalyptic enough to be terrifying. Twyla would have those mechanical critters for breakfast.TheVenice Dance Biennalecontinues until 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsDanceVenice BiennaleVeniceTwyla TharpWayne McGregorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All Rights ReservedRami Malek lends his disquieting intensity to this surprisingly enjoyable spy thriller. He plays a mild-mannered CIA cryptographer sent on a bloodthirsty revenge quest after his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. What’s fascinating about this film is that, had the lead been any other actor, it would have devolved into generic pulp. But Malek, in the hands of director James Hawes, really leans into the character’s psychopathy. He has a dead-eyed stare throughout, the sort you’d usually expect to find on a film’s antagonist. Sure, this is a globe-trotting Bourne-style romp, but you’re never allowed to forget the ethical iffiness of, say, blowing someone up inside a swimming pool.Stuart HeritageLive sportAll-Ireland Senior Hurling: Cork v Tipperary, 3pm, BBC TwoThe championship final at Croke Park, Dublin.This article was amended on 20 July 2025.

I was about 11 when my dad bought me my first record player, and I wore it out by listening to it so much.The first song I fell in love withMy first love was an unrequited crush. I heard Let’s Stay Together by Al Green on the radio, went out and bought it, and played it over and over to heal the pain of teenage rejection.The song that changed my lifeI Want to Hold Your Hand by the Beatles was the first song I remember performing. It was when I was about six, with a band at a wedding. I’ve since been told that I was singing even younger than that. A friend of ours was a landlady in a pub, and she used to stand me up on the bar when I was about three and have me sing to customers. Those Beatles double LPs, the red and the blue, 1962-66 and 1967-70, were among the first albums I bought when I was a kid.The song that is my karaoke go-toPapa Don’t Take No Mess by James Brown, who is probably the most influential figure in the history of recorded music.

Set in 1980s Dublin in the doldrums amid a fractious family and a classroom pop band, it seems at pains to stay bright-eyed, heartwarming, no matter the darker turns of its story.This is its undoing, in some ways. Set with a throwback Top of the Pops soundtrack of new romantic and pop hits (Duran Duran, Blondie, A-ha, and more), it features a group of song-writing teens led by 16-year-old Conor (Sheridan Townsley), whose family’s fortunes are as low as those of recession-hit Dublin. There are his perpetually arguing parents in the background along with his depressed yet wise older brother, Brendan (Adam Hunter), and sister, Anne (Tateyana Arutura), who is under pressure to be the success of the siblings. In the foreground is the band, formed in a council-estate living room, with a motley crew of boys who want to make music to attract girls.Premiering in London following runs in Boston and New York, and directed by Rebecca Taichman, the production is staged in an exuberant if strange in-between register which mixes the naturalism of the coming-of-age film with break-outs into musical expressionism and kinetic projections that fizz around the stage.View image in fullscreenAll mesh and eyeliner … Grace Collender and Sheridan Townsley in Sing Street.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThis melange is certainly theatrical but takes away the nuance and grit of the story, which includes poverty, economic migration, bullying and incest. Spoken scenes are brisk and explanatory. There are a few very peculiar interludes with Brendan moving languorously across the sofa to music. It works better in the second half, which opens with a full-on gig in which we become a stadium-style audience.But Enda Walsh’s script remains spare and thuddingly simplistic in its story; Conor meets love interest, Raphina (Grace Collender), all fish-nets, mesh and eyeliner, propped against a phone-box, and seems to become an instant pop lyricist, with a few helpful platitudes from his brother.There is comedy as the band figures out its look – from Adam Ant-esque dress-up to Cure-style gothicism, but there are not enough adjoining scenes to the songs to give the drama, and its characters, much depth.It seems to aspire to be like The Commitments but feels like a paler reflection. What saves it is the score – the original by Carney and Gary Clark – and the singing. There are high-quality performances and strong voices particularly from Collender and Townsley. Emotion is eked out by the end, although the show drags its feet to get there. Ultimately, it is gig theatre, with a vacuum in-between its uplifting songs.At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 23 AugustThis article was amended on 20 July 2025. Conor’s older brother is Brendan, played by Adam Hunter, not Larry (Harry Curley) as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreLyric HammersmithMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With a wealth of past productions to choose from, Hynes has paired JM Synge’s stark one-act tragedy, Riders to the Sea, with Macbeth.While Synge’s distilled miniature is almost eclipsed by what follows, the plays are linked by a focus on the elemental forces of nature and the shadow of death, with small, telling moments of visual continuity between them. In Synge’s play, a grieving mother (Marie Mullen) has a premonition of the death at sea of her last surviving son (Marty Rea). The keening women and black-cloaked villagers’ laments are later echoed in the guttural cries of the weird sisters, hooded figures from folk horror, who accost Macbeth (Rea) and Banquo (Rory Nolan) on the blasted heath.In both plays the veneer of Christianity is flimsy, while older, primal beliefs and fears hold sway. A statue of the crucified Christ is suspended on the back wall, not high enough to be safe from the predations of Rea’s electrifying Macbeth, while a banquet becomes a twisted Last Supper where glasses are filled with blood-tainted water rather than wine.View image in fullscreenKeening … Marie Mullen in Riders to the Sea.Photograph: Ros KavanaghMullen’s compelling Lady Macbeth is transformed from her husband’s goading, bullying accomplice into a wreck, terrified of his rampaging. While the age-gap between the two actors adds another layer to this relationship, at times closer to mother and son like Volumnia and Coriolanus, it is also completely credible.With the superb cast of 11 making darting entrances through hidden flaps in the walls of designer Francis O’Connor’s stripped wooden set, the pace is unflagging, the menace unrelenting. For the audience seated on three sides, intensity is heightened by proximity to the performers.“O full of scorpions is my mind,” Rea spits out, as Macbeth’s mind and spirit curdle into something monstrous: bloodthirsty and unhinged. This is a medieval world, with shadowy forces and omens, candlelight and mud-covered floors, yet its portrayal of tyranny and the speed with which all civility falls away feels anything but remote.AtGalway international arts festivaluntil 26 July; then at Gaiety theatre, Dublin, forDublin theatre festival, 25 September to 5 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreFestivalsIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet, written by band members Richard Hudson and John Ford, it could hardly have been less typical of the output of Dave Cousins, the band’s founder and mainstay. Cousins, who has died aged 85, piloted the group through countless changes of personnel and musical styles for more than 50 years, and was at the helm for the band’s final performance at Fairport’s Cropredy Convention in 2023.He drew early inspiration fromLonnie Doneganand was greatly influenced by folk musicians such asWoody Guthrie, Lead Belly,Ewan MacCollandPeggy Seeger. Hearing a recording of the bluegrass musicians Lester Flatt andEarl Scruggsprompted him to learn the banjo, and he formed the Strawberry Hill Boys with Tony Hooper and Arthur Phillips. He drew extra creative fuel from Bob Dylan and California jangle-rockers the Byrds – Cousins’s voice carried echoes of both Dylan and the Byrds’ Roger McGuinn – and recalled how he used a guitar tuning taught to him byJoni Mitchellon the Strawbs’ debut album.The Strawbs performing Part of the Union in 1973“I developed my musical and songwriting styles from using these alternate tunings,” he later explained to the Musical U website. “I use tunings that I’ve worked out myself, that I don’t think anyone else uses. There’s one definite advantage to it – you write songs that are very different to what anybody else writes.”As the group morphed into the Strawbs and Cousins began writing material such asThe Man Who Called Himself Jesusand the 22-verse epicThe Battle(both from the 1969 debut album Strawbs), it became clear that this was an artist with his own distinctive voice and an eclectic range of interests. In 2021 he told the vinylwriter website: “Medieval buildings and churches. Ancient hill forts and long barrows. The nails from the hands of Christ. These are all embedded in the songs.”The Strawbs catalogue is littered with ingenious, arresting and often powerfully emotional music, creating an unusual fusion of folk and traditional music with the exploratory urges of prog-rock. The three-part songAutumn, from the album Hero and Heroine (1974), sounds like the King’s College Choir duetting with King Crimson.Down By the Sea, from Bursting at the Seams (1973), ranges from a huge twanging guitar figure through passages of savage power chords, dreamy folk-rock and a crescendo of brass, violins and kettle drums. On the band’s final album, The Magic of It All (2023), Cousins was still ready to challenge the listener with the 7/4 time signature ofReady (Are We Ready).View image in fullscreenDave Cousins had a distinctive voice and eclectic range of interests that informed his songwriting.Photograph: Andre Csillag/ShutterstockHe was born David Hindson in Camberwell, southLondon, the only child of Joseph Hindson and his wife, Violet (nee Luck). His father was killed in action in the second world war seven months later, and his mother remarried when David was six, duly giving him the surname of his stepfather, Jack Cousins.David met his future Strawbs collaborator Hooper on his first day at Thames Valley grammar school in Twickenham, south-west London, and the pair of them became half of the skiffle group the Gin Bottle Four. Cousins developed his musical interests further when studying at theUniversity of Leicester, where he was active in the jazz club and folk society while earning a degree in statistics and pure mathematics.After the death of his stepfather, Cousins worked at a variety of jobs in publishing and advertising to help boost the family finances, but music was his primary goal. In 1963 the Strawberry Hill Boys (named after an area of Twickenham) made their debut on BBC radio, playing a blend of folk and bluegrass with Cousins on banjo, Hooper on guitar and Phillips on mandolin.The group then featured on recordings with other artists, teaming up with the guitaristSteve Benbowfor an album called Songs of Ireland (1965) and with the singer Sandy Denny for All Our Own Work. The latter was recorded in Denmark in 1967, where Cousins had toured as a solo artist and had been working as a producer for Danmarks Radio, though it was not released until 1973, when it was credited to “Sandy Denny and the Strawbs”.The first recording released as the Strawbs (comprising Cousins, Hooper and Ron Chesterman on double bass) was the singleOh How She Changed(1968) on A&M Records. It was produced and arranged byGus Dudgeonand Tony Visconti, themselves rising stars in the music business. The pair also produced the group’s debut album, Strawbs. The material was mostly written by Cousins, as it was on the second album, Dragonfly (1970), where his penchant for ambitious, elaborately structured pieces revealed itself in the 11-minuteThe Vision of the Lady of the Lake.They scored a UK Top 30 hit with their third album, Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios, mostly recorded live at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. This featured new band members Rick Wakeman on keyboards (though he would soon leave to join Yes), Hudson on drums and Ford on bass, with Cousins contributing the lengthy compositionsThe Antique SuiteandWhere is This Dream of Your Youth.From the Witchwood (1971) made the Top 40, while Grave New World (1972) climbed to No 11 and Bursting at the Seams (1973) reached No 2. The latter was greatly boosted by two hit singles, Part of the Union and the Cousins-composedLay Down, a slice of raunchy folk-rock that climbed to No 12 in the UK. Cousins had drawn inspiration for Lay Down from the 23rd psalm, The Lord Is My Shepherd.The excellent Hero and Heroine album reached No 35 on the UK chart in 1974, as well as No 95 in the US, but subsequent releases failed to chart in Britain, though Ghosts (1975) cracked the US Top 50 and prompted the band to focus their touring efforts on the US. Nomadness (1975) was their last release on A&M.The Strawbs playing Lay Down in 1973In 1980 Cousins left the band to pursue his interest in radio, working as a programme controller atRadioTees before joining DevonAir Radio. He was influential in arranging the merger between DevonAir and Capital Radio, which earned him an executive position at Capital, and went on to play key roles with Xfm (now Radio X) and Radio Victory.In 1983 Cousins’s appearance on Wakeman’s Channel 4 TV show GasTank triggered a Strawbs reunion to headline the Cambridge folk festival, and the group would make sporadic live appearances over the next few years. They played a 25th anniversary tour in 1993, and in 1998 Cousins staged a 30th anniversary show at Chiswick House in west London. Fortieth and 50th anniversary events would follow at Twickenham Stadium and Lakewood, New Jersey.In 2001 Cousins joined the guitarists Brian Willoughby and Dave Lambert to form Acoustic Strawbs, and they released the album Baroque & Roll (2001), followed by an international tour. The full electric Strawbs reformed in 2004 and released their 16th studio album, Déjà Fou, on their own Witchwood label. Regular album releases followed, up to The Magic of It All.Cousins also released several solo albums, from Two Weeks Last Summer (1972) to the live album Moving Pictures (2015). His autobiography, Exorcising Ghosts: Strawbs and Other Lives, was published in 2014.Dave was married three times. His third wife wasGeraldine, with whom he settled in Kent.He is survived by five children.David Cousins (David Joseph Hindson), musician and radio executive, born 7 January 1940; died 13 July 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFolk musicJoni MitchellLondonUniversity of LeicesterSandy DennyDenmarkobituariesShareReuse this content"

So whose version gets it just right?Felicity CloakeSun 20 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 08.02 EDTShareFritto misto(the term for “mixed fry” sounds so much better in Italian, somehow) is, in the words ofKatie Caldesi, “an assortment of deep-fried vegetables, fish or meats … all bite-size, intended to be eaten with fingers and a wedge of lemon”. And she should know, because she loves the stuff so much that she served fritto misto at her wedding to chef Giancarlo. It’s pure crisp, relaxed holiday pleasure – a simple crowdpleaser that everyone can dig into together, with, as Caldesi observes, a winning element of surprise: “You don’t know what is hidden beneath the batter until you’ve bitten into it.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘Mixed small fish” of River Cafe’s fritto misto. Thumbnails: Felicity.On that note, and because my memories of the dish involve rustling salty piles washed down with well-chilledcarafes ofvino della casaat seaside restaurants, I always think of the fishy version (properlyfritto misto di mare), but I’ve given suggestions below for a vegetable alternative so everyone can enjoy the feast. After all, as the Tuscans say,fritta è buona anche una suola di scarpa(even the sole of a shoe tastes good fried).The fishAlan Davidson’s magisterial 1972 work Mediterranean Seafoodexplains that, while fritto misto is “one of the most common fish dishes in restaurants on the Italian coast … the composition varies according to what is available, and there are scores of possible combinations. In Venice,” he adds, “a typical mixture would be from the following range: inkfish or squid; soft-shell crabs; prawns or shrimp; eel; sardines. In Naples, the list would be shorter.” Quoting one signora Jeanne Caròla, he writes: “Ourfritto di pesce, the ultra-classical one, is not too varied: red mullet and squid only.”View image in fullscreenCesare Casella and Stephanie Lyness’s fritto misto demands fish fillets be used.With such a simple recipe, you should be guided by what’s freshest, or what looks best, at the fishmonger – that’s the Italian way. However, my job here is to test recipes as written, so obediently I went out to find large raw prawns, which most recipes call for, along with baby squid. Cesare Casella and Stephanie Lyness’s The Fundamental Techniques of Classic Italian Cuisinedemands fish fillets; Tessa Kiros’ Twelvespecifies red mullet, so, happening upon a fine Cornish example at my local fishmonger, I use that in both.Sasha Marx’s recipe for Serious Eats, meanwhile, substitutes the usual sardines and anchovies for the North American smelt, which I swap back to anchovies. Caldesi, too, goes for anchovies, though she sandwiches tinned ones in fresh sage leaves, thereby adding a pop of salty perfume that proves irresistible; in fact, one of my testers asks why I can’t just make a whole plate of those instead.The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbooksimply calls for “mixed small fish” (though its authors note that the day they went to the market, they were lucky enough to find “langoustines, soles, mullets, eels, prawns andmoscardini[baby octopus]”), which, in my case, means the anchovies and the whitebait I’ve already bought for Russell Norman’s version. These are soaked in milk for 15 minutes before cooking – though Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray don’t say why, it’s said to reduce the “fishy” flavour. Fresh fish ought not to need this treatment, so I’ve thrown caution to the wind and skipped this step.View image in fullscreenKatie Caldesi sandwiches tinned anchovies in fresh sage leaves, adding ‘a pop of salty perfume that proves irresistible’.Whatever you go for (do play about with my suggested selection below), it’s very easy to overcook seafood – to my mind, the prawns stand up best to the fierce heat of the hot oil, even more so if, like Marx, you leave the shells on. But if crunching through them isn’t your idea of fun, you might prefer to remove them first. If you fancy using fish (and the more textures and flavours here, the merrier, as far as I’m concerned), I find that small whole ones work better than fillets or cubes of mullet, which are difficult to cook perfectly and have a tendency to stick or fall apart. You could also use soft-shell crabs, scallops, mussels, even oysters; anything that appeals, really.The vegetablesVegetables are very much an optional extra, but I like the freshness that they bring to the dish – or as much as anything that’s been deep-fried can be said to be “fresh”. Caldesi suggests cauliflower and artichokes, Kiros artichokes, asparagus, courgettes and tomatoes, and Casella and Lynness courgettes and aubergine, plus sprigs of sage, parsley and basil. The artichokes, to my and my testers’ surprise, prove the favourites; they don’t seem to give off much water (courgettes and aubergines, on the other hand, are prone to turning soggy) and their shape provides lots of interesting ridges for the batter to cling to. But they’re so seasonal that I’ve substituted the more easily sourced fennel bulb, whose aniseed flavour I think pairs better with fish. If you’d prefer to keep things vegetarian, use a mixture of vegetables that take your fancy, but avoid anything with a high water content such as mushrooms and ripe tomatoes.The batterView image in fullscreenSasha Marx’s fritto misto: the mixture of semolina and cornflour helps to keep it crisper for longer.Where the recipes really differ is in the batter they use, which varies fromchef Pasquale Torrente’s mere dusting of semolina flour to the enriched, beer-spiked batter inthe Caldesis’ The Italian Cookery Course. Being a sucker for carbs, I admit to a fatal weakness for the more robust and shatteringly crisp batter shell – somewhere between tempura and a fish supper – produced by Caldesi, Kiros andAngela Hartnett’s recipes.As with so much here, however, it’s a matter of personal preference; if you like your seafood plain and simple, just dip it in seasoned semolina, or in the mixture of semolina and cornflour used by Marx, which does indeed help to keep it crisper for longer, or in the River Cafe’s flour before frying. (Semolina gives a grittier consistency; Casella and Lynness mix cornmeal and flour for a similar, but even craggier result.)Flour, according toHarold McGee’s seminal On Food & Cooking, is the ingredient that has the “largest influence on batter quality … the gluten proteins in ordinary wheat flour are valuable for the clinginess they provide, but they form elastic gluten and absorb moisture and fat, and so are responsible for chewiness and oiliness in the fried crust. For these reasons, moderate-protein flours make better batters than bread flour.” Though I don’t find any recipes that call for bread flour, several mention the finely milled 00 flour traditionally used in pasta making, possibly because it’s one that’s often found in Italian kitchens. The example I buy, however, proves higher in protein than my standard plain variety, so I’ve stuck with the latter, cut with cornflour, which, as McGee explains, “improves crispness because its relatively large particles are less absorbent, and its proteins dilute wheat gluten and reduce the chewiness of the crust”.View image in fullscreenThe dredge of Russell Norman’s fritto misto has ‘an ethereal, tempura-like effect’.Much as I appreciate an excuse to crack open a bottle while cooking, I favour the plainer, water-based batters to those made with beer and wine, or indeed eggs and milk (with a special mention to the whisked egg whites inNorman’s book Polpo, which give his dredge an ethereal, tempura-like effect). Cold sparkling water, in particular, produces a deliciously light, crisp result. If you’re a real perfectionist, you might take Hartnett’s advice and stir the batter over a bowl of iced water, because the colder the batter, the slower the gluten formation. I find simply using fridge-cold water and being careful not to overmix (chopsticks are, as she says, ideal for the purpose) work well enough for me.I don’t think Marx’s baking powder is necessary, given the sparkling water, nor Caldesi’s pinch of sugar, which I suspect is, like the milk in many recipes, more there to encourage the batter to brown than to add an overt sweetness. Fritto misto tends to be rather paler than, say, an onion ring; more a ghostly tentacle than a bronzed rubber band.The cookingView image in fullscreenLocal produce: Tessa Kiros’s fritto misto.This is one recipe that you must, I’m afraid, get out the oil for: the clue is in the name. A high heat is best – Casella and Lynness’s 165C feels too cool, and the seafood takes ages to brown, leaving some of it overcooked. Better to go in hot and fast, as Hartnett and several others recommend – though, unless you have a huge fryer, I’d also urge you to cook the different elements separately, to prevent the squid overcooking while the prawns are still floppy and wan. It’s also best, if doing both vegetables and seafood, to cook the former first, or everything will end up tasting of fish.Serve hot, with plenty of salt and wedges of lemon to squeeze over the top.Perfect fritto mistoThe ingredients list is just a guide, so feel free to swap in seafood and vegetables as desired.Prep25 minCook10 min(depending on the size of your pan)Serves42 fennel bulbs300g squid, baby or large, cleaned if necessary8 large raw shell-on prawns, or 12 medium ones200g small whole fish(ie, whitebait)16 sage leaves8 anchovy fillets in oil, drained125g plain flour, plus extra for dusting25g cornflourSaltNeutral oil, for frying250ml very cold sparkling waterLemon wedges, to serveTrim the fennel and cut it into chunky wedges.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Robert Billington/The Guardian.

Wash the small fish. Pat everything dry.View image in fullscreenPair up the sage leaves with ones of fairly equal size, then sandwich an anchovy fillet between each pair (you may need to trim one end off some of the anchovies for neatness).View image in fullscreenPut the flours in a large bowl and season with salt. Put a little more plain flour on a plate.Pour enough neutral oil into a large, heavy saucepan to fill it by no more than a third and heat to 190C (alternatively, set a deep-fat fryer to heat to 190C). Turn on the oven to low and line a baking tray with kitchen paper.View image in fullscreenWhen the oil is almost up to temperature, quickly stir the cold sparkling water into the bowl of seasoned flours, mixing as little as possible; don’t worry if there are lumps.As soon as the oil is ready, toss the fennel in the plate of flour to coat, shake off the excess, then dip it in the batter. Shake the excess back into the bowl and carefully drop the fennel into the hot oil (don’t overcrowd the pan or the oil will cool down too far and its contents will go soggy, so if necessary fry everything in batches), stirring once so it doesn’t stick or clump. Fry for a couple of minutes, until pale golden brown, then scoop out with a slotted spoon on to the kitchen paper, blot off any excess oil and put in the low oven to keep warm.View image in fullscreenRepeat with the prawns, followed by the squid, then the little fish, and finally the sage and anchovy sandwiches, making sure the oil comes back up to temperature each time, and bearing in mind that the prawns will probably take a little longer (three or so minutes if they’re large specimens) than the squid. Go by eye: the batter should be crisp and pale gold, rather than bronzed.View image in fullscreenOnce everything is fried and ready, tip on to a serving plate, season with salt and serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over the top (and with a bowl for the prawn heads and shells).Fritto misto: the capo of all fried foods, or does someone else fry seafood better?

As a child of refugees settling in Australia after the second world war, I experienced the searing poverty that myriads of displaced people dealt with as they tried to rebuild lives in far away, unfamiliar places. As a result, my brothers and sisters and I very rarely enjoyed the magic and thrill that come when a child gets a new toy.One day – I must have been no more than five – I was wandering through the local town hall with my mother. Some sort of fair was in full swing and I happened upon a table where, for a mere penny, I could try my luck to win a doll. I didn’t have a penny, but I did have a fervent wish to have a doll – particularly the beautiful one with the gloriously extravagant light blue dress!The kindness of strangers: she bought a new sim card for my mum and installed it on her phoneRead moreI lingered at the table watching people try their luck and hoping no one would win the doll I felt was mine. At some point, a woman – I’ll never know who she was – decided to play and won the chance to choose a doll from the dozen or so settled along the wall.As she prepared to claim her prize, she turned to me and, with a smile that I can still remember today, asked me to choose. I hesitated until she said: “Which one would you like to take home with you?”Feeling emboldened, I pointed tentatively to the doll with the magnificent pale blue dress. A moment later, the doll floated down from the wall and into my waiting hands. It was mine. I was overwhelmed with wonder.This incredibly kind woman had noticed the longing in the eyes of a little girl and made her dream come true. Her act of kindness was a moment of pure magic. I cherished that beloved doll until I was 17, when we left Australia to move to Canada and luggage restrictions forced me to bequeath her to another.That woman sowed the seeds of my own belief that small acts of kindness can change lives. We are regularly confronted with choices about how to treat other people and how to interpret their words and actions. I try to be forgiving and empathetic because I believe very sincerely in the goodness of people, in large part because of that day at the fair. Sixty-five years later, I can say I am a better person because of that woman.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

If the lofty scofferati could have found a way to scupper Big Mamma’s growth, they probably would have, because these restaurants are unashamedly focused on big, sexy, silly and Italian-inspired fun. The dining rooms are styled with the chaotic yet elegant detail of a big-budget movie set; no two are remotely the same, but each branch is connected by dependably over-the-top Italian serving staff, usually male and every one of them determined to be your best friend all the way from the antipasti to thedolci, even if your stiff British mentality fights their displays of chumminess.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’smillefoglie di patate con tartare di manzo e tartufo: ‘Not remotely delicious.’The latest Big Mamma opening,Barbarella in Canary Wharf, east London, is no different, and features all of those elements with which we’ve become so familiar: the tall, wobbly lemon meringue pie, the camp banquettes, the huge flappy menu with 100-plus items all written in Italian and in a teensy-tiny red font. At Barbarella, there are also oversized sculptures, vintageFiorucciin glass display cases and, vibe-wise, a large scoop of Gaga does House of Gucci.Why are clever food people so sniffy about Big Mamma, despite its restaurants being full to the brim every night? Well, there are two reasons: first, Barbarella and her sisters are determinedly fun; almost forced fun, if we’re completely honest. Just try telling your server that you’re not here to have a laugh, but instead have come for a sparse, sensible, calorie-counting meal, so there’s no need for a double martini or to be spooned tiramisu from a huge bowl by a winking man from Sicily called Gianluca. They just won’t understand you. The second, and possibly more logical reason for the raised eyebrows is because – let’s cut to the chase – the food inallof these restaurants isn’t always terribly good and is sometimes actively awful.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’s £36 linguine alla lobster: ‘Fine, if nothing earth-shattering.’Not that you’ll ever cajole any of the staff into admitting that: “This tiramisu is my favourite tiramisu in the world, even better than my own nonna’s,” is just one line directed at me at Barbarella. The staff simply cannot break character, so all the pasta is, according to them at least, “freshly made this hour” and “better than they serve in the village I come from in Italy”. Every T-bone steak is the juiciest and every brunello on the extensive wine-list is the most thoughtfully sourced. You’ve more chance of seeing Mickey Mouse at the front of a Disney parade with his headpiece off and smoking a Marlboro than hear a Barbarella server admit that this food is just OK – and hugely overpriced, too.Not that you’d really want that, either. Barbarella, like all of these places, is about escapism, boisterous group dining and being swept up in the moment, with someone else – a lover, a boss, a father-in-law – hopefully picking up the hefty bill afterwards. Lunching here stone-cold sober is a real eye-opener. I’ve only ever been to a Big Mamma restaurant while a bit tipsy, but here I’m being served a £24 plate of “millefoglie di patate con tartaredi manzo e tartufo”, or a sort of cold fried potato rösti with a spoon of unseasoned beef tartare that’s not remotely delicious. A courgette and cheeseinsalatalimps on to my table hoping for love, but it’s another hopeless state of affairs. This is not good courgette, these are not pleasant croutons.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’s tiramisu: ‘Rich, thick and cocoa-covered’ with optional seconds.Next up, lobster linguine for £36 in a thick, one-note bisque sauce and with half a lobster on top – fine, but nothing earth-shattering. A £38 fillet steak with green peppercorn sauce is by some distance the most delicious thing we eat, and comes with a side of actually great rosemary potatoes. Then again, it’s also probably the least Italian thing on the menu. But the tiramisu is, as ever, rich, thick, cocoa-covered and comes with that timeworn trick of offering a second scoop to denote largesse.Upstairs is the place to sit, it being the room with all the movie-star glamour; downstairs is, dare I say, a little less exciting. But, from my seat by the till (not somewhere I wanted to linger) and having to move plates about to make them fit on a tiny table that’s about as big as one of the pizzas, there’s just something about Barbarella that left me a little cold. Perhaps glamour isn’t supposed to be practical. The wild Italian party continues in Canary Wharf regardless, but I don’t think I’ll be running back for a scoop of gelato any time soon.BarbarellaUnit 3, YY London, 30 South Colonnade, London E14 (no phone).

In my experience, when clients treat you withrespectandunderstandthe boundaries,it’spossible to form a relationshipnot unlikethat between a therapist and a client.One client I was particularly fond of was a man a few years older than me. He is on the autism spectrum, which makes him somewhat socially awkward, but he isintelligent, creativeand empathetic – and passably handsome. I always felt he would make a wonderful partner fora woman who could see past his quirks.Last week, I ran into him at thelibrary. The first thing he saidwashe’d understand if I didn’t want to talk – but I was actually glad to see him. We spent about15 minutes chattingpleasantly, and when we partedhe asked if I’d consider meeting up as friends. I took his number and saidI’d think about it.I’m pretty sure he’s hoping for more than just friendship,butif my sense of him is accurate,he’d accept a “no” gracefullyand respect my privacy. The problem isI’m unsurewhat to do. Had we met under different circumstances, I mightwell have considered dating him, and I would definitely like him as a friend. I’m aware of the stigma directed at men who see escorts, but he doesn’t fit any negative stereotype.Even so, the facthe’s tied to a chapter of my life I’vemoved on from leaves meconflicted.I don’t knowif reconnecting would add something positive to my life – orblur boundaries I’ve worked hard to establishand maintain.I think the fact you’re writing to me shows youdowant to consider it, but are aware there may be some pitfalls. In some ways you’re front-loading the issues you would have – because you already know something of each other’s past – more than if you met someone the more conventional way.I consulted clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Dr Stephen Blumenthal, who has worked with people who visit sex workers. He wonders if this might be less a case of “wanting a relationship, but rather exploring your boundaries in relation to your previous work and the life you have now”.You said in another message that you had hitherto kept your past work private. Perhaps you now feel ready to merge your past and your present/future, and by allowing this man from your past to possibly be a friend, you can see if this will work for you.I think you have to be honest about what you want from this man, and if that’s possibleDr Blumenthal explains that he’s known “situations where men have formed relationships with sex workers. Some have succeeded and some have ended in disaster. It’s impossible to know how things will turn out, there’s no predetermined outcome. And yes, most people assume the relationship between sex worker and client is just about sex, but I’ve heard many a time it’s less about sex and often primarily an emotional relationship that has sex as part of it. It’s not always like that, of course, but it can be.”I think you have to be honest (as with all potential relationships) about what you want from this man, and if that’s possible. You’ve been very good at boundaries before, this will need a different set of boundaries and they may need renegotiating, both at the beginning and at various other times as things change – if either a friendship or a relationship blossoms.“The important thing,” says Dr Blumenthal, “is to be fully cognisant of where the original relationship came from. A lot of sex work is about an illusion – that the client is the only one, that maybe they’re loved by the sex worker. Here, exposing the relationship to the outside world may be problematic if you deny where it’s stemmed from.”All relationships, whether platonic or romantic, start with a bit of illusion and projection, and what makes them succeed is communication, with the other person but also with oneself. That communication may allow the relationship to grow, or founder. You seem grounded and have established boundaries. If you feel safe with this man then it may not be a bad idea to meet him again in a public place and see if you can develop a new way of being together.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You’re desperately hunting for somewhere to live and scouring rental sites. The odds are stacked against you. Rents are high everywhere – in London tenants are paying almost £1,000 for a shoe cupboard with a bed – and living rooms have gone from a regular commodity to a luxury. But matters are made worse by scammers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Young people now account for three-quarters of rental fraud, according todatafrom the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB). Last year alone almost £9m was lost across about 5,000 reported cases.Recently,the BBC reported how a family had lost £2,000after responding to a scam advert on the listings website Gumtree – the criminals had even shown them round the property before taking the money.Most scams take place through websites where individuals can advertise directly, and at no cost, rather than the big property websites. And, as would-be tenants turn to social media to look for rooms, so do scammers posing as individual tenants or landlords to trap unsuspecting victims.Some, such asSpareroom, offer users advice on how to spot a scam.What the scam looks likeThere are variations, but a common version involves someone posing as a landlord and posting on dedicated Facebook rental groups, or Gumtree, offering a cheap place to rent.Sometimes they can be studio flats, other times they’ll advertise a room in a two-, three-, sometimes four-bed flat.Once you message them with interest, they will typically put you in touch with the current “tenant” through a mobile number.The tenant will explain more details about the property, sometimes even accompanied by a video of a flat. However, when you ask to view the property they’ll be strangely unavailable – suddenly a parent has died, they’re abroad, or they’re just very busy. They will ask you to pay the deposit and often put pressure on you to act quickly.What to doDo notpay any deposit upfront without seeing a property, no matter how desperate you are to find a home.Make sure you go to see any property before you commit to renting.Gumtree advises: “Always ask to see proof of ownership, or the landlord’s right to let, and ensure a tenancy agreement is in place before paying deposits or holding fees.”Stand your ground; if something seems fishy, it probably is.On social media, or listing websites, check when the landlord’s profile was created. How long have they been active? Do they seem to be advertising multiple properties with similar messages? What comes up when you search their name?If a landlord is claiming to be part of the NRLA, you can check whether theiraccreditation is legitimate here.Report fraudulent accounts to Facebook and Gumtree.Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyScam watchPropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport?

Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear?The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.Morwenna FerrierWomenswearby Jess Cartner-MorleyThe full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needsView image in fullscreenFor sunglasses and rope sandals, see below.Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian£85 at Mint VelvetCounterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it’s hot, the air conditioning off when you’re inside, and doesn’t leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra – this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height – and ensure it’s a generous fit.Thecami that works as evening wearView image in fullscreen£40 at Marks & SpencerA friend asked me the other day if she could borrow “that lovely Stella McCartney camisole”. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.A clash courseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesInstead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.A tank top with a built-in braView image in fullscreen£19.90 at UniqloIf you have huge boobs, this isn’t going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn’t too tight.The £35 M&S swimsuit that’s a modern classicView image in fullscreen£35 at M&STwo years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.The not-too-long, not-too-short shortsView image in fullscreen£59 at Nobody’s ChildIt’s not so much that I’m too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts – no one is too old to wear anything – it’s more that I’m old enough to know I don’t have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it’s fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‑point of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I’d go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.An out-of-office shirtView image in fullscreen£98 at AnthropologieBecause sometimes you just really want something whimsical and holiday-fabulous. An embroidered boxy shirt is a good choice, because the laid-back silhouette offsets the cutesiness. This one is just joyful.The Mary Jane-ballerina hybridView image in fullscreen£119 at Massimo DuttiMaryrina? Ballet-Jane? The name needs work, but the style – a cross between a sturdy ballet flat and a Mary Jane – is a new staple. It looks great with baggy trousers, as it adds just enough femininity without sacrificing cool.A statement beltView image in fullscreen£46 at John LewisMy buy of the season is a secondhand leather belt with YSL hardware on the buckle, which I found for £30 on Depop. Charity shops are an excellent hunting ground too: you can get a leather belt for the price of something plastic on the high street that will age badly and end up in landfill. Alternatively, this Boden belt is a classic in a divine colour.The oh-so-versatile silk scarfInstead of trying to transport a sunhat in your suitcase, use a silk scarf to protect your scalp from the sun. You can also followAlexa Chung’s leadand use it to add pizzazz to wardrobe basics such as jeans and a white T-shirt by knotting it around your waist. You will find the best versions on vintage sites. For bold, punchy prints, look for versions from the 1960s and 70s.A delicious chocolate beach dressView image in fullscreen£11.99 at ZaraI have tried on a lot of open-knit beach cover-ups over the past few summers, and these are my condensed thoughts: short and sweet is, surprisingly, easier and more flattering than full coverage. The string-vest ones make you look like a large fish caught in a net – an embroidered pattern, as here, is better. Black, brown or navy are most useful. I like this one.An elegant update on skinny white jeansView image in fullscreen£39 at H&MA baggy bottom half of your silhouette is No 1 on your does-my-outfit-look-contemporary list now. These gorgeous trousers are the perfect modernising switch out for tight white jeans.The wrong-shoe theoryThis theoryis the quickest way of making a look more interesting. Think tailored trousers and a flip-flop. Sporty shorts and a ballerina flat.A wedding-guest-worthy dress that looks designer– for under £100View image in fullscreen£93.57 at Damson MadderHow delicious is this dress by small, independent London-based brand Damson Madder? Quirky-elegant Simone Rocha vibes for under £100, as it’s reduced from its £125 RRP. A few sizes are (unsurprisingly) sold out, but it was still available in sizes 10 and 20 at the time of writing. Quite tempted by the matchingruffle stripe bag also (£41.25)– is that wrong?The best wedding guest dresses and outfits: 30 favourites for every dress code and budgetRead moreA chic summer (cardi) jacketView image in fullscreen£125 at & Other StoriesKnits make great summer jackets – they’re lightweight and don’t crease, so you can roll them up and stash them in your basket when the sun’s out. This one’s simple shape will work with shorts and a T-shirt; but the gold buttons and glimmer of Lurex elevate it so it works over a party dress too.Women’s beach essentialsby Melanie WilkinsonThe mini-purseView image in fullscreen£7 at Three Potato FourI recently stumbled across these retro rubber coin purses online and bought not one butthreefor different family members. They are seriously practical and double up as cute bag charms. Pop some change in for emergency ice-creams.A sturdy kaftanView image in fullscreen£125 at ToastEvery beach wardrobe needs a kaftan, and if poppy colours aren’t your thing, have a look at this Toast version in “washed lime”. Just add tan sandals, a basket bag and anaperitivo.The splashproof bagView image in fullscreen£40 at YetiMake any tote beach friendly with this one-litre waterproof pouch. It has enough space to keep all your essentials dry, and comes in lots of fun, sweetie-coloured shades.An in-between hatView image in fullscreen£45 at Glassworks LondonI’m a fan of a baseball cap, and I’m looking to add a raffia version to my wardrobe. It’s more casual and sportier than a traditional straw hat, and a lot easier to pack, plus the peak will do an excellent job of keeping off the sun.The cocktail teeView image in fullscreen£24 at NextSlogan tees are everywhere at the moment, and this pastel-green style is punchy but subtle at the same time. Wear it with some white denim cutoffs. One guess what I’m ordering at the bar.Vintage-style shortsView image in fullscreen£22 at NextTowelling shorts remind me of the best kind of California beach photos, 1970s Slim Aarons and Hugh Holland, all sunkissed tans and hazy colours. This pair from Next ticks all the right retro boxes – just add a white vest.Scared of shorts? Here are 53 perfect pairs for every occasionRead moreThe sea-to-be-seen swimsuit/topView image in fullscreen£26.80 at Arket£67 at AsosBuy a one-piece that will double up as a top half to a daytime look – a two‑in-one buy. This rust-coloured swimsuit from Arket will look chic with white linen trousers or a maxi skirt, and the ruching is a considered design detail.For more inspiration, read our guide to thebest women’s bikinis and swimsuits for summerA beach-friendly hair tieView image in fullscreen£20 at Hunza GSalty water, sand and a sea breeze don’t so much give my hair a beach wave as give it a seriously bedraggled look. So I always pack one of my favourite scrunchies from Hunza G. They’ve got great hold, come in a multitude of colours, and look just as good around your wrist as they do in your hair.The no-towel towelView image in fullscreen£14.99 at H&MPacking for a beach day? You’ll need a towel. And a thin hammam style is my go-to. It will squash into any bag and dry super quickly. I like to get double the use out of it and wear it as a sarong as well. It’s thin enough, and most styles are lovely pastel colours with cotton tassels that work perfectly with beach outfits. And even if it’s a bit damp on your way to the beach cafe, chances are in 10 minutes it will be dry.Budget sunniesView image in fullscreen£12.99 at H&MI like to invest in a pair of beach sunglasses. They’re a cheaper alternative to the ones I wear for sightseeing (and they’re usually a bit more fun than said “proper sunglasses”). That way, it’s OK if I drop them in the sand or sea. I really like this pair with coloured lenses. Ideal for wave jumping.The cover-up you probably already ownThe enduring popularity of an oversized linen shirt means you probably have one in your wardrobe already, and it’s the chicest of beach cover-ups. Wear it open over your bikini, then tie it at the waist with a pair of cutoff shorts for a day trip.A straw-free summer bagView image in fullscreen€180 (about £156) at Call It By Your NameI’ve been hankering after a bag from French brand Call It By Your Name for a couple of years now. Its picnic bag style is just as good for the beach as it is for the park, with lots of easy-access pockets for all your bits and bobs. I adore the colours and, although not cheap, the bag will definitely be the main character of your beach wardrobe.Investment flip-flopsView image in fullscreen£95 at Ancient Greek Sandals£125 at Net-a-PorterI’ll be giving my beach shoes an upgrade this summer and investing in these fun, neon flip-flops. They work for the sand, just as well as they do with my favourite seersucker shirt and shorts co-ord, plus they’re hotly tipped as the shoe of the summer, so be quick. They’re not cheap, I admit, but the rubber is very sturdy, so they should see you through a few seasons.Women’ssummer accessoriesby Melanie WilkinsonA surprisingly wearable chokerView image in fullscreen£135 at MissomaThe red-coloured thread strung through these clear beads really elevates this choker necklace, and the shorter length makes it perfect for wearing with T-shirts and higher necklines.Some seasonal jewelleryView image in fullscreen£59 at Ottoman HandsMy summer jewellery is the complete opposite of the accessories I usually wear. When the sun is shining, I want coloured stones, turquoise necklaces and jewelled bracelets. If there is a shell involved somewhere, all the better. I adore these earrings.A city-friendly basket bagView image in fullscreen£49.50 at M&SSometimes a raffia woven beach bag doesn’t quite work for me. It can feel a bit much at the lido, and it can be a bittoobeachy if I’m lucky enough to be on a city break, especially when you’re surrounded by high-rises. That’s why I love this style from M&S. The leather-look braided handles stop it from being too laid-back and toughen it up a bit.The showcase hairstyleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesWear your hair up. Sounds simple. But there’s no better way to showcase your summer jewellery than to frame it with an up-do. Go for a low, sleek pony or a ballerina bun.A grownup bag charmView image in fullscreen£20 at Free PeopleUpdate your bag in seconds by adding a charm. From Labubus to Jellycats, the options are endless (special shout out to Anya Hindmarch’sPez charm), but if you don’t want to break the bank, this beaded fish from Free People is cute and fun.A wide-brimmed capView image in fullscreen£45 at SézaneOnce the sun starts shining, I’m never far away from a hat, but I gravitate towards block colours and neutrals. For a change, I’m going to mix things up with this softer-looking pale-blue gingham style and wear it with a floaty white dress and brown sandals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Subtly cherry red, not too big, and not too small – they’re just right.Climbing sandalsView image in fullscreen£35.99 at ZaraTechnical footwear has been having a moment for a while now; my Tevas are certainly still going strong. But I’m on the lookout for something on the more delicate side, and these sporty rope sandals will look just as good with jean shorts as they will with a floaty black dress.The best summer shoes: 44 sandals, pumps and trainers for everyoneRead moreThe out-of-office holdCarry your bag in your hand, not on your shoulder. Sounds weird, but it makes it feel less worky. Even if your bag has a long shoulder strap, loop it around in your hand and hold it like a shopping bag – instant update.The multi-use holiday beltView image in fullscreen£51 at Sessùn£51 at Place Des TendancesA woven belt is one of those accessories that is invaluable when you’re packing for a four-day holiday and trying to squeeze everything into an overhead locker-sized suitcase. It’s the perfect addition to a midi dress when you’re dressing up for the evening, and will equally give your cotton shorts a little something extra when you’re tucking in your linen shirt. I adore French brand Sessùn, and this belt would be a shrewd investment.The bag within a bagWhen you are using a roomy tote or beach bag, pop essentials such as bank cards and house keys into a makeup pouch. That way, they won’t end up at the bottom of your bag, and you’ll avoid having a panic attack thinking you have lost them.Beach-to-night rope sandalsView image in fullscreen£75 at Oliver BonasFisher sandals are a summer classic and perfect for wearing with linen trousers, as well as holiday dresses. I love that this Oliver Bonas pair is made from woven raffia and leather rather than all leather; it makes them less clumpy and a more versatile footwear option for the evenings.A proper summer bagView image in fullscreen£169 at Massimo DuttiChocolate brown is as popular as it was last season, and if you’re looking for a hard-working bag, I’d go for a supersoft suede style as it’s a great complement to white and oaty linens. This Massimo Dutti style will serve you throughout summer and into autumn.Menswearby Morwenna Ferrier and Chloe Mac DonnellSunglasses that aren’t Ray-BansView image in fullscreen£160 at AkilaSunglasses are the accessory you will use most day to day, so it makes sense to choose a pair that will go with everything. Ray-Bans suit everyone, and aviators tend to flatter most face shapes, but it’s nice to go for something different – and these thick rectangular frames will work just as well. The olive shade is a nice alternative to classic blacks and browns too.Staple socksView image in fullscreen$25 (about £19) at SocksssGen Z came for millennial trainer socks and they, err, won. Unless you want to look dated, you need to wear socks that are visible. Both in length – go for a pair that hits above the ankle bone, not under – and in colour, the more attention-grabbing the better. Socksss has several options, but I like its originalParadiseand Applebottom styles that come in various punchy shades and, as a bonus, are medical-grade compression, so your legs feel less heavy on hot days.The no-wallet silhouetteDo you really need your entire wallet if you have a bank card on your phone? Overstuffed pockets add unnecessary bulk. Try streamlining.A not-so-obvious holiday shirtView image in fullscreen£150 at NN 07£150 at LibertyBlame Baz Luhrmann, but a tropical printed shirt on holiday means you risk looking like a Montague extra who has wandered off-set. The Copenhagen-based brand NN 07 has some more subtle options, such as the above andthis, that still evoke a holiday mood.The alt capView image in fullscreen£65 at SatisfyThere are only so many local coffee shop or “ironic” caps we can take. So where to next? May I suggest a running cap. It still protects your scalp from the sun, but it’s lighter than a lot of others and offers a better fit. Try this one with a short brim from Satisfy, a cult Paris-based running brand.The perfect semi-short shortsView image in fullscreen£69 at End£70 at AsosI think I’ve landed on the perfect pair of shorts for a man. Butter yellow seems to be the colour of this summer, but if you’re worried it won’t suit you, wearing it on your bottom half is a good compromise. The 9in inside leg means these are just about long enough so your legs aren’t going to touch the seats on public transport, but also sturdy enough (they’re cotton twill) for cycling. Plus, a built-in belt is the cleverest thing.The beach-to-bar T-shirtView image in fullscreen£49 at CosI love anything colourful in summer, but this pale apricot T-shirt, which comes in various other modern colours, is just so fancy! It’s the dropped shoulders and almost elbow-length sleeves that elevate it from being something ordinary. You could wear it on a beach. You could wear it in a bar on the beach. Plus, it’s lightweight jersey (most jerseys seem to be mid-weight, which can be too much in the summer), meaning it has more give. And it’s not just us who love it, because it’s sold out in some sizes (extra small, small and medium were still available at the time of writing).A grownup beach bagView image in fullscreen£30 at M&SSometimes adulting means carting your stuff around in a structured tote rather than that flimsy one you bagged from an arthouse cinema circa 2012. This one from M&S has handles that are long enough to comfortably fit over your shoulders, meaning you can lug a towel, book and beers to and from the beach without complaining.50 men’s summer wardrobe updates under £100, from classic jeans to the perfect white T-shirtRead moreThe DIY pedicureView image in fullscreenBefore you wear sandals, show your feet some care. Soak them in warm water and epsom salts, then use a pumice stone to scrub off dead skin.A shirt that gets better with wearView image in fullscreen£75 at GantBreathable and lightweight, what’s not to like about a linen shirt? The summer essential looks even better with age, so it’s worth scouting out secondhand stores. If you are buying new, choose something with a lived-in feel. Gant dyes its take on the classic after it’s been constructed, giving it more of a vintage feel. The box pleat at the back adds structure, while the lack of an obvious logo is nice in an obvious-logo world.Trend updated trousersView image in fullscreen£93.75 at WaxOne of the key takeaways from the recent men’s fashion month is that trousers are getting baggier, again. You don’t have to go full pavement scraper, but try easing yourself into the trend with a looser silhouette. This pair with a barrel-shaped leg and single-pleated front are a good start. Wear them now with a white T-shirt and Birkenstocks, then in winter with a cosy jumper and thick-soled Derby shoes.An alternative to a hoodieView image in fullscreen£130 at RaphaOn paper, a fleece for summer sounds a bit mad. But hello, this is the UK and the evenings are cold. This half-zip fleece is thin enough to be tied around your waist without feeling annoying, or bunged in a backpack until you need it. If you’re going to a festival, take it instead of a hoodie. You can thank me when you’re wandering around at 5am trying to remember where your tent is.The sundowner hackAttach a carabiner to a tote bag so you don’t have to dig around to find keys at the end of a long day at the beach.Layer for the heatLight layering that stops the sun from directly hitting your skin can sometimes make you feel less sweaty. Natural fabrics are key. Try a linen shirt worn unbuttoned over a simple cotton tank top.Kids’ clothingby Morwenna FerrierAswim robe that does the jobView image in fullscreenFrom £65 at FrugiFrom £65 at NextUnless you’re on holiday in the Med, your child will be cold when they get out of the water, so there’s no point messing about in something thin. This is called the Atlantic robe with good reason. It has a fleece lining, a hood, and is long, so they can get dressed and stay inside it until you go home.A not-too-smart smart shirtView image in fullscreen£14 at M&SSometimes I find it a bit creepy seeing kids in adult clothing, but I recently got my son to try this on – Cuban collar and all – and I’m now biting my tongue. The whole knitted shirt thing is veryBode, but it’s also very beach, without being your typical T-shirt-with-a-dolphin on. It doubles up nicely as a jacket too, so they can wear a T-shirt underneath.The sandy toes minimisedIf you’re going to the beach, especially a sandy one, I’d advise bringing an extra hand towel – purely for kids to stand on when trying to get their shoes on without getting sandy toes.The gender-neutral swimsuitView image in fullscreen£25 at John Lewis£25 at BodenIt’s still hard to find girls’ clothes that aren’t bright pinkorboring and beige, but Mini Boden has a handle on gender-neutral colours. This zip-up, long-sleeved swimsuit is great because the zip is at the front, not the back, it covers the bits that tend to get burned, and has that built-in UPF50+ fabric, which isn’t 100% foolproof but will buy you some time. And it looks very cute without being too gender-coded.Goggles that fitView image in fullscreen£20 at Speedo£16.99 at AmazonI bought these for my eldest at a swimming pool. He took some persuading – how much do children actually need goggles? – but it has transformed his swimming experience in chlorine and the sea. They’re great because the seal doesn’t hurt when they’re on, and the size is really easy to adjust, so he can probably wear them for a few more years. Not too expensive either. They replaced a pair I bought at a seaside shop, which broke the same day, so you live and learn.The perfect rocky beach shoeView image in fullscreen£55 at KeenFrom £30.61 at AmazonObviously my children have grown up in Crocs, but I’m not convinced they’re ideal for the rocky crags of north Devon, which is why I bought them Keen sandals. They’ve got terrific grip, a special bumper that means no toes are stubbed, and a bungee cinch, which even my 18-month-old can virtually do up himself.A reversible jacketView image in fullscreen£38 at Little Green RadicalsAs anyone who has given their child an ice-cream knows, all childrenswear should be reversible, and this jacket has two pretty sides instead of only one. Best of all, it has poppers, not buttons. Also, £38 isn’t too bad for organic cotton clothing that is also Fairtrade.The meltdown-averting wetsuit hackMy son wears a wetsuit on the beach all year round. Invariably, he gets cold after being half-submerged for six hours, and it also keeps the sun off his back. The proper ones tend to have the zip at the back though, so tie a piece of ribbon to it so they can take it off themselves without a tantrum.From scrapbooks to garden games: 17 tips for keeping kids entertained over summer (some are even free)Read moreCuteseasonal trousersView image in fullscreenFrom £16 at NextThese barrel trousers are incredibly cute and come in four different ginghams, but more than that – they work on boys and girls. That shouldn’t seem radical, but it is. The purple and pink print is the nicest.Toddler-friendly cycling shortsView image in fullscreen£24 at ChildrensalonI’ve found cycling shorts ideal for when kids are crawling or toddling, as they don’t flap about like baggy clothes that can catch on corners or handles. And they barely notice they’re wearing them. I pop these on my youngest under a large T-shirt, and find it much easier changing him when poppers aren’t involved.A hat they’ll actually wearView image in fullscreenFrom £9 at John LewisObviously getting a hat for a child is working on the assumption that your child will actually wear a hat. But I’ve found a bucket hat tends to work quite well. Better at least than caps, which need to be more fitted. This one is twill, so there’s a bit of warmth in it, and it has a clever elastic toggle, which means you can tighten it as they grow (or at least grow their hair). I’ve got the three- to five-year-old version, and my son has just turned six, so there you go.The accident-proof nappy shortView image in fullscreen£24 at Polarn O PyretIf money were no object, I’d buy everything for my kids from Polarn O Pyret (its hatsare the best and longest lasting out there). But as it very much is, it’s only worth getting things they’ll wear on repeat. These nappy shorts are generously sized, almost look like seersucker, and are quite baggy in the right places so they can “contain” a lot while also making sure nothing, um, slips out. I also like the elastic waist instead of a drawstring. I don’t mind having my youngest in just his nappy, but this is undoubtedly preferable.The no-knee-scrape shortsView image in fullscreen£25 at ArketIf your son is anything like my eldest, he’s terrified of scraping his knees. This makes shorts season tricky, as it’s really hard to find anything that goes to knee-length or below. I actually go one size up and use the drawstring waist to make sure they fit. On that: so many kids’ clothes have buttons, which simply don’t work with a last-minute loo run. I also think this bottle green is terribly grownup.A summer-proof fleece for lifeView image in fullscreen£48 at Patagonia£80 at Early RiderYou need only one fleece for the kids on holiday, and if you have a raincoat you can layer it up. Patagonia is the best for outerwear, and this fleece is so incredibly light you can roll it up too. I love the hand-warmer pockets and that it dries really quickly. It isn’t cheap, but it has a hand-it-down ID label sewn in so you can pass it along.Explore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterWomen's swimwearDressesWomen's shoesWomen's shortsMen's topsMen's shortsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year, the husband-and-wife team who run it opened Beachside, a cafe on wheels offering local produce, including Heartland Coffee Roasters, and supper clubs with chefs from the area. A new sauna provides warmth after bracing sea swims. The site’s private beach is ideal for families who love to be on the water, with paddleboards and kayaks for hire.Further inland, in the heart of Eryri national park,Llyn Gwynant campsite(from £16pp; day visitors welcome from £5pp plus £5 per car) offers access to a river, mountain and lake, with boat hire on the doorstep.Glanllyn Lakeside caravan and camping park(from £27 a pitch) has a pebbled beach, ideal for launching kayaks and paddleboards, on the shore of Bala lake.Rewilding in action in DevonView image in fullscreenVisitors can spot beavers and lynx at Coombeshead rewilding centre in DevonCoombesheadis a 162-hectare (400-acre) rewilding site just north of the Tamar Valley, owned and run by Derek Gow, an author and campaigner specialising in species reintroduction and nature recovery.

Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.The bikes, which havebecome ubiquitousin London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.0:14Beep, beep, beep: the sound of a stolen Lime bike – audioThe noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in eastLondon, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”View image in fullscreenFriends Sinead McKenna (left) and Ellie Roberts in Clissold Park.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHer friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.View image in fullscreenSammy Gecsoyler recording sounds on Church Street in Stoke Newington.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian‘Absolutely outrageous’: wealthy residents living in shadow of Harrods wage war on e-bikesRead moreClad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.View image in fullscreenJohn Villeneau: ‘Everyone Limes it up and Limes it back’ on a Friday night.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHe said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.View image in fullscreenJane says: ‘When you get on those bikes, everyone turns selfish.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianShe said she had heard the beep, beep, beep sound twice since entering the park. The current stereotype seems to be that it is only young boys who drive the e-bikes recklessly, but Jane thinks this is incorrect.“I don’t think it’s just young people, I don’t think it’s just young boys or young men. I think it’s everybody,” she said. “When you get on those bikes, everybody turns very selfish.”A Lime spokesperson said: “We know that the vast majority of people use our bikes responsibly, and we take instances of them being stolen, damaged or misused very seriously. Previously, our hardware team has successfully delivered several targeted improvements to stop bikes being used fraudulently.“We are developing further measures to counter the latest attempts to damage and fraudulently use vehicles. We are also working with TfL and local authorities to hold offenders to account and we urge the public to report any incidents they see, including time and location, so we can take appropriate action.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingTransportPublic transportLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One with 77 crimson red counties and a license plate that once simply read: “OKLAHOMA IS OK.”But first, it is important to tell you about my firstOklahomaschool history lesson – one I learned when I was eight years old, after my parents moved our family cross-country.Tulsa’s reputation as a haven for the devout held deep appeal for my Jamaican parents, whose lives were steeped in Christian faith. The city’s predictable rhythms, its flatness, even its so-called boringness – it all offered a reprieve from what they saw as the chaos and moral drift of our old home in New York.One day, my new school gathered every fourth grader and led us to the backlot. We were lined up across the lawn and equipped with wagons, protractors and dulled stakes to drive into the ground. We waited for a teacher’s voice to yell, “Go!”We were to take off quickly, racing each other to find a plot we wanted to take for ourselves. We measured, as well as fourth graders could, the land we wanted to be ours. The entire affair was raucous as us newly minted “pioneers” yelled, laughed and named our plots whatever our imaginations would allow.View image in fullscreenAn Oklahoma land run on 16 September 1893.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveWe were re-enacting aland run– one of seven held between 1889 and 1895 – that marked the opening of lands oncedeededto Indigenous nations, only to be seized again as part of their forced removal across what we now call the American west.It may be hard to believe, butOklahoma City’s public schools didn’t get around to banning the practice from history lessons until 2014.In its place came a sanitized, feelgood version of state history – one that, like many civil war re-enactments, recasts the fight to preserve slavery as a story of bravery and idealism.During those history lessons, the ugliness was not even hiding in plain sight. The disregard for the lives on which the state was built was – and still is – a point of pride.Today, the University of Oklahoma – my alma mater and the state’s flagship university – leads every game, welcome event and recruiting fair with its famous chant: “Boomer!” followed by an echoed “Sooner!” It’s a rallying cry repeated across all its athletic programs, which, like many state schools, are funded far more robustly than classrooms.The violence that birthed Oklahoma wasn’t incidental, it was foundationalBoomers were settlers, mostly white, who agitated in the late 1800s to open land in Indian territory (present-day Oklahoma) for white homesteaders. Led by pugnacious figures such as David Lewis Payne (the putative “Father of Oklahoma”), they staged illegal incursions before the land was officially opened.The Sooners entered the land before the legal start time of a land run, cheating to claim the best plots. These rule-breakers are now mythologized in Oklahoma culture. The university’s mascot is not an animal or a person, but a covered wagon: an emblem of the pioneering spirit that carved a life from theft and violence.For much of my life, I struggled to feel pride in a place like this – not just because of its history, but because of the lie we told about it. The real story was buried beneath a more palatable narrative, where horrors were treated as little more than pit stops on the way to celebrating homesteaders. Land theft from Native nations, the displacement of Black families, the racial terror that shadowed statehood – these were footnotes, if they were mentioned at all.View image in fullscreenA record-setting crowd exchanging ‘Boomer’ and ‘Sooner’ chants across the field during a college football game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs on 11 November 2017, at Memorial Stadium in Norman, Oklahoma.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesBut over time, it was precisely those harder truths that gave me something solid to stand on. That reckoning – naming the harm, sitting with its consequences – is not just about the past. It’s a tool we need now, in 2025, when the country is suspended between two impulses: nostalgia and denial.Across the nation, the fight over whose history counts is really a fight over who gets to claim America. The violence that birthed Oklahoma was not incidental, it was foundational. And unless we confront that, there’s no building anything real.Misunderstand Oklahoma, and you misunderstand the country.Reinvention is Oklahoma’s playbookGrowing up in Tulsa, the north star for me and my friends was college, followed by a job that could take us anywhere but Oklahoma. Dallas and Houston seemed almost idyllic: more affordable than New York or Los Angeles while still offering an upgraded version of a lifestyle we were already familiar with.Nothing made me want to stay. Downtown Tulsa felt frozen in amber, a relic of its “oil capital of the world” heyday, long faded. The place felt ghostly. To me, its nightlife, diversity, direct flights and appetite for progress were all but nonexistent. Until recently, Oklahoma had not had a major-league sports team – though the Oklahoma City Thunder recently broke through, winning the 2025 NBA finals. What professional sports teams we had were literally and colloquially minor, baseball teams with stadiums that left much to be desired.This is a story of haunting familiarity to people whose home towns are seen as flyovers, rarely seen as worth a stop.And then, everything changed.In the decade since I left, Oklahoma has been refashioning its cities, courting new talent, and, according to the Kansas City Federal Reserve, beginning to reverse its long-running brain drain. College graduates like me once left in droves. Now, it seems that the tide is shifting.If you are an artist, Tulsa will subsidize your loft or studio. If Teach for America has whet your appetite, Tulsa will help with your housing costs. If you have a startup that might struggle with raising venture capital on the coasts, you will find that Tulsa will offer it to you.Even remote workers with no ties to the state can receive $10,000 or help with a down payment, just for showing up and staying for a year. Convenient, when the airport now offers direct flights to places my younger self could only dream about: New York, Miami, Los Angeles.These are all points of pride for many. But for all the praise,concernsdo remain: rising housing costs, shallow community ties, and whether programs such asTulsa Remoteoffer lasting benefits to longtime residents, especially since those efforts are not government-led efforts but philanthropic ones, and rely entirely on the continued generosity of a few wealthy individuals.View image in fullscreenLocal artist Alexander Tamahn paints a mural during the second round of the Senior PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club on 28 May 2021 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesReinvention has always been part of Oklahoma’s playbook. Again and again, the state has tried to become something new by recruiting outsiders, whether settlers in the land runs or now digital nomads with graduate degrees, while asking far less of itself when it comes to honoring the people and histories already here.That strategy may bring headlines, but it rarely brings healing.No matter how overjoyed I was to see my home state in the headlines for the NBA championship – rather than for being ranked49th in educationor49th in healthcare– my pride doesn’t come from Oklahoma’s polished reinvention.It lies in the hard work of seeing my state clearly, in all its contradictions: the violence and the love, the buried history and the stubborn hope.And to do that, we need to go back nearly 140 years.The Moses of Oklahoma’s all-Black townsI have spent the past five years combing through archives and crisscrossing Oklahoma and the Great Plains, chasing the story ofEdward McCabe: the visionary who tried to create a Black state within the US, a figure who stood at the centre of some of America’s most volatile collisions.In the 1880s, McCabe, the first Black statewide elected official in the old west, came to the Oklahoma territory with a vision so bold it startled both Black allies and white detractors: a state colonized by Black people, governed by their own hands, and as McCabe promised, “unmolested by the selfish greed of the white man”.It was a dream not of mere survival, but of sovereignty – and it’s why a reporter traveling from Minnesota dubbed him “The One Who Would Be Moses”.Edward McCabe.Photograph: Courtesy of the Oklahoma Historical SocietyThat dream, like so many others on that soil, was paved over by the very forces it tried to escape: anti-Black violence, white economic opportunism and settler colonialism’s endless appetite.McCabe did not ask for a utopia without contradiction. His ride to Langston – one of theall-Black towns he helped found– from his post in the territorial capital of Guthrie, where he served as county treasurer during the 1891 land run, was anything but safe.White cowboys stopped him on the road, ordered him to turn back, to stop where he stood. He refused, more than once. Then they opened fire. He lived to tell the story, but just barely. It was a warning: dreams built on contested ground do not go unchallenged, and Black ambition could be answered with bullets.His story, in all its promise and peril, was not that of a perfect man with a clean mission. He promoted colonization while ignoring the fact that the land he hoped to reclaim for Black people had already been promised, stolen, and promised again to Indigenous nations. He stood at the nexus of Black aspiration and Native dispossession. And in doing so, he reflected the central American dilemma: that ambition will never be clean because the ground itself is stolen.McCabe’s dream of a Black-governed state was mocked, sabotaged and eventually erased from civic memory. But in the erasures, we find the outlines of what was feared: not just Black people having land, but Black people on their own terms.That was always the deeper threat. Not a land grab, but a claim to belong. A declaration of autonomy.It matters that this particular expression of Black belonging emerged [...] in a place where white America was still shaping into its newest frontierThat is why I return to him: not because he got it right, but because he tried. His efforts, and those of his peers, can still be seen in the13 all-Black towns in Oklahoma(down from the 50 that once stood tall). These towns were founded as havens – places where Black Americans could govern themselves, own land and live free from white oversight. Many who built and settled these towns were just one generation removed from slavery, carrying the memory – often their own or that of their parents – of what it meant to be owned, uprooted and denied the right to belong. Their movement westward was not merely an act of escape; it was an act of creation. They were not just fleeing the violence of Reconstruction’s collapse; they were imagining something freer, fuller and governed by their own hands.Today, those towns are no longer exclusively Black, nor are they legally restricted to Black residents. Anyone can move there, marry there, build a life there. But their founding spirit endures.McCabe spoke in what newspapers would call “nigger talk” – a term of derision meant to dismiss any Black person who dared to articulate sovereignty, self-governance or the audacious idea of belonging on their own terms. But McCabe wore the insult as armor. He turned the slur into strategy, the scorn into a blueprint. And they tried to kill him for it. But what they didn’t realize is that this was not just talk, it was a creed. A blueprint. A framework for building a world not yet born.That is the lesson Oklahoma teaches.View image in fullscreenInterstate 244 separates the Historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church, left, from downtown Tusla on 24 May 2021.Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/APOklahoma has always been a place America used to test its next chapter. After Reconstruction failed, and the US government abandoned its promises to Native nations, parts of the territory were branded “no man’s land” – as if no person of value had ever lived there. But it was not empty; it was further removed. Oklahoma could have been a blueprint for belonging, a place carved out for those most marginalized: Black people fleeing racial terror, Native nations pushed from their homelands, immigrants seeking a foothold.Instead, it became a proving ground for the ugly zero-sum politics that plague America today, pitting groups against each other. Today, Oklahoma remains at theforefrontof deciding what counts as American – whether in its classrooms, its public religion or its laws. Just look at how it is redrawingchurch-state boundariesin public education, and even forcingsocial studies textbooksto convey 2020 election conspiracy theories as fact.If we are serious about holding this country together, we have to reckon with the real American inheritance, where ambition and betrayal, dreaming and dispossession, are not opposite. They are co-tenants.I crisscrossed America to talk to people whose views I disagreed with. I now have one certaintyRead moreWhat McCabe knew is that place matters. Not just as geography, but as some kind of theology. It matters that this particular expression of Black belonging emerged not in areas with longstanding, high concentrations of Black people – but in a place where white America was still shaping into its newest frontier. And it was in this place being reinvented that McCabe thought he could be most successful.My parents left New York searching for moral clarity in the middle of the country, but found none of this history in any brochure. For me, a child of migrants raised on the rules of holiness, I learned the unholy truth in reverse: that even sanctified ground can be built atop stolen land. That even the righteous can inherit the sins of the empire.Oklahoma is a map of America’s legacies. It doesn’t pretend to be a blank slate. Instead, its history offers a truer, unvarnished portrait of America, with its ambitions, its erasures, its stubborn beauty and its almost devotional violence.It’s not the place where dreams go to die. It has long been the place where dreams go to collide.Caleb Gayle is the author ofBlack Moses, a Saga of Ambition and the Fight for a Black State, out 12 August (Riverhead books)"

In the same parking lot, a 1950s-erasign advertised a motel that no longer exists. In the distance, only a few surviving businesses remained: a small community center, a veterans organization and a long-standing roadhouse bar popular with locals. A few miles to the north, an entire neighborhood was abandoned in the 1990s after mounds of blowing sandswallowed it whole; today, only rooftops and chimneys peek out from the towering sand dunes.Despite the general ghost town-like atmosphere, the cafe’s early-morning visitors were giddy.Neilson Lopes, a tourist from Brazil, happily perused a rack of neon T-shirts and snapped photos of the dimly lit cafe. He and his wifehad flown and driven, on the back of a motorcycle, thousands of miles to be there, in the middle of nowhere.“I’ve planned this trip for 10 years,” he said. “For decades, maybe.”View image in fullscreenThe Bagdad Cafe glows in the evening light along Route 66 in Newberry Springs, California.Photograph: Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesBecause while this Mojave Desert outpost – a tiny settlement of 2,000-some people called Newberry Springs– may look deserted to the uninitiated, it’s positioned on one of the most famous roads in the world:Route 66. The roughly 2,400-mile(3,900km) route stretches from theCaliforniacoast to Chicago, connecting both small towns and sprawling metropolises across the country. For many, the road embodies a sense of quintessential Americana, from its quirky roadside kitsch to its historic roots.And next year, Route 66 is turning 100 years old. Nationwide preparations for the big anniversary have been underway for years: caravans of people are planning to drive the entirety of the route, and Congress even created aRoute 66 Centennial Commissionin 2020 to commemorate the milestone.In small towns such as Newberry Springs, and an even tinier neighboring community 10 miles west called Daggett, residents are hoping the anniversary will bring in a flood of extra visitors. The Bagdad Cafe, where the1980s cult classic film by the same namewas shot, currently sees about 6,000 tourists each month. Locals anticipate that those numbers will double in 2026 – and they’re planning other ways to capitalize on the centennial, too.“We’re a teeny, weeny, little slice of Route 66,” said Renee Kaminski, a co-owner of Newberry Spring’s historic bar.“But we’re a mighty one.”map of Route 66Route 66, stretching from Chicago to Los AngelesA Route 66 town was dead. This man resurrected it into ‘a classic desert destination’Read moreA desert town ‘frozen in time’Out in remote Newberry Springs, an unincorporated community that lacks an official mayor or city council, a handful of residents have instead informally banded together to start sharing ideas for Route 66’s centennial.One of them, Karla Claus, has become a de facto ambassador for the town.Wearing a Route 66 crown atop an American flag cowboy hat, unbothered in a pair of jeans even as the thermostat topped 100F (38C), she described her grand plans for the centennial one recent summer afternoon.This anniversary, she said, is a chance for Newberry Springs to be reborn.“My vision is that we’re going to be one of the go-to destinations for those caravans [of Route 66 fans],” she said. “That we’re saying to those people: ‘Make sure you come here.’”To make that vision a reality, Claus, who is also the vice-presidentof the local chamber of commerce,recently received a micro-grantto start leading custom, history-focused Route 66 tours.View image in fullscreenResident Karla Claus has become a de facto ambassador for the town.Photograph: Amanda UlrichAnd there’s a lot of history to be shared.In 1926, as millions of Americans were buying their first car and taking to the open road, Route 66 was created as part of the nation’s first federal highway system. Car ownership had newly exploded; the Model T had only been introduced about two decades prior.The route was famously dubbed “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his classic 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. At the time, before the route became better known for itsflashing neon signs, old-school diners and eccentric roadside attractions, the road was a migration route for climate refugees fleeing the Dust Bowl.Hit hard by severe drought, dust storms and the Great Depression, hundreds of thousands of people funneled out of the Great Plains via the now-celebrated route and headed west.In Newberry Springs, Route 66 brought about a kind of heyday in the 1950s. Because of the constant flow of traffic, its main street was bustling: there were more businesses, a couple hotels and a popular rest stop with an expansive swimming pool.But when interstate I-40 came along in the 1970s, it spelled disaster for Newberry. The newer, faster freeway was laid parallel to that stretch of Route 66, meaning that drivers would now fly right by the small town without ever noticing it.The development was a death knell for other tiny towns across the state – and throughout the country. The animated movieCarseven spotlighted the issue by creating the fictionalRadiator Springs: a forgotten town on Route 66 that withered away after it was bypassed by the interstate.Rose Beardshear, the chamber of commerce’s treasurer, said the film is bringing the plight of Route 66 to life for the younger generation. Beardshear was driving through the nearby town of Daggett with her granddaughter when the nine-year-old suddenly said: “This is like the movie with the cars.”View image in fullscreenA motel along the old Route 66 in New Mexico. The route runs from the California coast to Chicago.Photograph: Dukas/Universal/Getty ImagesBut the boom-and-bust cycle for Newberry didn’t end with the interstate.The indie film Bagdad Cafe, about a dilapidated desert cafe and a stranded German tourist who finds an unexpected community there, brought waves of international tourists to Newberry; the movie was a massive hit in France and Germany. When the pandemic halted tourism, especially from other countries, the real-life Bagdad Cafe shuttered. It only reopened again recently (without serving food), after the owner started a GoFundMe to make necessary repairs on the building.Part of Newberry’s appeal for visitors now is that it feels removed from the 21st century; the town looks “frozen in time”, Claus said. Still, there are lots of improvements to be made before the centennial.The road less travelled: don’t miss these quirky stops along the famed Route 66Read moreBeardshear, for one, is hoping to transform a short stretch of the route into a “musical highway”.If all goes according to plan with the county, grooves or markers would be added to the side of the road, creating vibrations that sound like a song when drivers pass over them.Kaminski, the owner of the town’s bar called The Barn, has plans to host monthly themed events in 2026, including car shows and live music, and to create a campground of vintage trailers for tourists who are passing through. The Barn is also a landmark in itself; it first opened in 1952 andis reportedly one of the oldest continually licensed bars on Route 66 inCalifornia.“I think Newberry really illustrates that whole mantra of ‘Mother Road’,” Kaminski said. “We will take you in and make sure you’re safe on Route 66.”Preserving a living museumWest of Newberry lies Daggett, the minuscule villagethatBeardshear’s granddaughter thought could be the set of Cars. Daggett has another claim to fame for a different generation: Steinbeck briefly mentioned it in The Grapes of Wrath.Today, at first glance the community looks neglected. Only a few hundred people live in the area, and crumbling or forgotten homes abound. But one man named Daryl Schendel, whoowns an auto repair shop in nearby Barstow and spends his nights and weekends on historical preservation projects, sees far beyond that.“It may look junky when you go through it, like a little has-been town,” he said recently, driving through its small collection of streets. “But people don’t realize the history that was here.”The town itself is like a living museum: there’s a blacksmith shop that dates back to the 1890s on one corner, another pioneer-era hotel still standing a block away. For years, Schendel and others have collected thousands of historical artifacts related to Daggett, from old journals to glass bottles to the actual clothes that nearby miners wore in the 19th century.View image in fullscreenRoute 66 put the tiny town of Newberry Springs on the map. Locals are trying to preserve that history.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/The GuardianMuch of that history has been out of public view as Schendeland a small team work together to organize everything. But the Route 66 centennial has motivated him to move faster on at least one project: reopening a historic welcome center for the anniversary caravans passing by Daggett, where some of the artifacts he has stockpiled will be on display like a museum exhibit. Schendel received aRoute 66-themed grantfrom the National Park Service last year to help make the project happen.“I’m imagining this being a major new thing happening on Route 66,” he said. “And it’ll open up so many doors to the history of the area.”Both Schendel and the women from Newberry want their towns to become more of a destination for Route 66 fans – but they also don’t want things to change too much.Visiting somewhere that feels completely off the grid, they say, is part of the charm.“I can’t imagine anyone wanting Newberry to change into some city,” Beardshear said. “We want to maintain our rural character.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More precisely, and at the heart of the case, is the allegation that she contracted a global security firm to carry out the violent, cross-border kidnapping of her two youngest children. If convicted she faces up to 10 years behind bars.In the dock with her is the former TV sports journalist Gerhard Delling, one of Germany’s best-known football presenters and Block’s romantic partner since 2021. He is accused of aiding and abetting her in the alleged abduction operation.The case is being heard in a high-security court room usually reserved for terrorist trials, owing to the nature of those on trial, who include alleged former Israeli intelligence agents.View image in fullscreenA Block House restaurant in Bergedorf, Hamburg.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyAccording to the charges, Block is alleged to have contracted a group to ambush her ex-husband, Stephan Hensel, and their two youngest children, then 10 and 13, while they were watching a fireworks display as part of new year 2023-24 celebrations at Hensel’s home in southernDenmark, close to the German border.The men allegedly knocked Hensel down, before dragging his son and daughter into a forest, across a stream and into a car. The children had their mouths taped and one was tied up. They were allegedly threatened with death, with one man telling them: “Be quiet, otherwise we’ll kill you.”Danish police with sniffer dogs were quickly dispatched on the tail of the kidnappers, due to an alarm that had been attached to the boy by his father.The children were taken to a farmhouse in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany and held in a mobile home until Block arrived to pick them up on 2 January 2024 and took them back to her Hamburg villa. They were subsequently handed over to police and taken back to Denmark days later.View image in fullscreenGerhard Delling, left, Christina Block’s partner, is accused of aiding and abetting her.Photograph: Marcus Brandt/AFP/Getty ImagesBoth Block and Delling – who is accused of helping to organise the handover and the transport of the children to Hamburg – deny the charges.Among several alleged accomplices are August Hanning, a former head of Germany’s federal intelligence service, the BND, who according to prosecutors forged the initial contact between Block and the Israeli spy firm believed to have carried out the abduction. Hanning, who has spoken in public in defence of Block, denies any involvement in the abduction.Block has said the security firm acted of its own accord, and that her mother, who died about nine months before the abduction, paid for the operation which is thought to have cost hundreds of thousands of euros and to have been months in the planning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She also denies this charge.View image in fullscreenStephan Hensel, left, Block’s former husband, has custody of their two youngest children, with whom he lives in Denmark.Photograph: Marcus Brandt/AFP/Getty ImagesBlock’s defence team is expected to argue on her behalf that she had become desperate after her children were wrongfully kept by their father in Denmark when he refused to return them as agreed after a pre-arranged visit in 2021.Her lawyers say she had been granted sole custody of them, but Hensel had disregarded the German ruling. German police had taken the children back to Denmark after their abduction, at the request of Danish police. Danish authorities have refused to accept the German custody order. German media have widely reported that the same authorities have said the children do not want to have any contact with their mother.Block’s lawyers have said that she was looking forward to her day in court to be able to defend herself against claims by her ex-husband that she is a danger to her children.Hensel has been granted custody of the two children by a Danish court, a decision that Block has tried but failed to get German courts to quash. They now live with their father in Denmark at a secret address. All are said to have changed their names.The high-profile court case is expected to continue until Christmas and to hear from 141 witnesses and 22 experts. During the two days it has sat so far, Block and Hensel sat just metres apart but neither looked at nor spoke to each other.Their daughter, now 14, has said she wants to speak in court. However, the case was adjourned earlier this week and is not due to resume until 25 July, after concerns were expressed over whether the children should be allowed to give evidence, in particular as their father faces separate legal proceedings for failing to abide by the German custody ruling and the evidence in both cases might clash.The founder and patriarch of the Block House business, Eugen Block, 83, who wishes diners “much joie de vivre and pleasure” in the menus at his eateries, has said he had not seen his grandchildren at the heart of the row for several years. The custody battle had caused him “much heartache”, he told the Hamburger Abendblatt.Explore more on these topicsGermanyDenmarkEspionageIsraelEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vaccines alone don’t save lives, vaccination does. And although we have safe and effective vaccines available in the UK, uptake is too low to unlock the large societal benefits that vaccination can bring.Immunisation uptake across adult, adolescent and childhood vaccines has decreased in the UK and internationally for almost every vaccine (UK worst in G7 for MMR jab rates, as 30m children worldwide not fully immunised, 15 July). This should raise major alarms for global health. There is misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, and we face a lack of knowledge regarding the importance of vaccines.We also need to deliver vaccines beyond standard healthcare settings. The UK’s school-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine programme for adolescents has been successful in increasing uptake, and similar programmes for childhood and adult vaccines in equivalent settings could be trialled. The government’s10‑year NHS planproposes a new health visitor model to encourage vaccinations in communities. This is a commendable step towards increasing vaccination uptake. It could also help address broader issues around misinformation, hesitancy and inequalities in uptake.This, along with taking a long-term view to prevention, are critical components of revitalising uptake and protecting public health.Simon BrasselSenior principal economist,Office of Health EconomicsIt is heartbreaking that some children are seriously sick and a child has died from measles. Vaccines are the most successful and effective public health measures against infectious diseases. Measles is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory infection that is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and children under five, especially those with a compromised immune system or malnourished.Measles can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration, ear infections, diarrhoea and irreversible vision loss. More than 90% of susceptible individuals around an infected person can catch the virus.Vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 global health threats, on par with climate change, HIV/Aids and lethal pathogens. It’s time to raise awareness about the importance of vaccinations in combating infectious diseases, saving lives and protecting children, families and society.Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobWillesden Green, LondonMelanie Pilcher of the Early Years Alliance says of children in nurseries who are not vaccinated against measles: “It wouldn’t be right to turn children away because it is a parental choice at the end of the day, and we have to respect that” (Nurseries in England bring in Covid-style protocols as measles cases rise, 19 July). No, you do not have to respect that choice because it is a shortsighted, dangerous and potentially deadly choice. Dangerous to the parents’ own child and to the children around that child. In response, public health authorities must step up neighbourhood vaccination clinics, bringing the vaccine to families rather than demanding that families come to clinics.Matthew K BelmonteSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The line “To you I guess I’m just a clown who picks you up each time you’re down” struck me at the time as being a reference to how much he made me laugh, but now I realise that it was probably a plea to take him seriously.I’ve just turned 60 and heard the song played recently. It stopped me in my tracks, transporting me right back to that gorgeous, magical summer of laughter and flirting that somehow never became anything more. And all the more magical for that I guess.Name and address suppliedTo make a mix tape was an art form. There were only between 30 and 45 minutes each side, which required a good knowledge of the tracks to be put on to each one. Following that, how do you get the attention of the audience? Starting with a banger and trying to hold that for a couple more songs before easing off a bit.Towards the end of each side it was vital not to cut off any song but, if possible, to fade out. Even better if the tracks were finished just at the right moment before the tape ran out. A mix tape was a work of art, a work of love. You had to know your audience, your music and had to time it perfectly. I’m an avid lover of this lost art form.Christoph WagnerBoulogne-Billancourt, FranceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Can someone please make it happen?, 16 July), if only the lives of media princesses resembled what actual princesses of the past, and some current, endured, perhaps the obsession would fade. Most princesses of the ancien regime didn’t have great lives. Most could expect:1) An arranged dynastic marriage in her early teens to someone possibly twice her age whom she had never met (eg Isabel de Valois, 1545-68, third wife of Philip II of Spain).2) Giving birth surrounded by witnesses so that the heir to the throne was not slipped in surreptitiously.3) Early death in childbirth – Isabel de Valois again; also Jane Seymour in 1537; Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII; Anne de Foix Candale, queen of Hungary, in 1506; another Elizabeth, of Valois, queen of England in 1409; Maria Leopoldine, Holy Roman empress and queen of Hungary and Bohemia, died in 1649 at the age of 17. There are many more examples.4) Being sidelined at court because the king has a mistress of his own choosing (there are numerous examples of this).5) Entering a convent, by choice in some cases, but not in all.These women had little or no autonomy and their main job was as a brood mare. There are some exceptions, of course, but a dose of reality is in order.SheilaFfolliottProfessor emerita,department of history and art history,George Mason University, Virginia, US; vice-chair,The Medici Archive ProjectHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Churning out more papers faster has got us to this place. Given current incentives, AI will mean churning them out even faster. A paper written by AI, peer-reviewed by AI and read only by AI creates a self-reinforcing loop that holds no real value, erodes trust in science and voids scientific inquiry of meaning.Researchis driven by our wonder at the world. That needs to be central to any reform of scientific publishing.Instead, the driving forces can be addressed by two measures. Incentives for researchers can and should prioritise quality over quantity, and meaning over metrics. And publishers’ extortionate fees (fuelling profits of more than 30%) can and should be refused by those who pay them. Both the incentives and publishers’ contracts are governed by the funders of research – universities, research councils and foundations. Their welcome attempts to engage with these problems throughPlan S, which aims to make research publications open access, have not succeeded because these have been captured by publishers that twisted them to their advantage, making yet more profits.There are examples, often beyond the global north, of scientific publishing that is not geared towards generating profits for publishers.SciELO(which is centred on Latin America) is one, and the Global Diamond Open Access Alliance champions many others. We have much to learn from them. Research is in a parlous state in the English-speaking world – at risk for the truths it tells in the US, and for its expense in Britain. Funders have the power radically to alter the incentives scientists face and to lower the rents extracted by publishers.Dan BrockingtonIcrea (Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies)Paolo CrosettoGrenoble Applied Economics LaboratoryPablo Gomez BarreiroScience services and laboratories, Kew GardensYour article on the overwhelming volume of scientific papers rightly highlights a system under pressure. But the deeper dysfunction lies not only in quantity, but in the economics of scholarly publishing, where publishers cash in on researchers’ dependence on journals for academic careers. The academic publishing market systematically diverts public research funds into shareholder profits.Open access was meant to democratise knowledge, but its original vision has been co-opted by commercial publishers. It was BioMed Central (now Springer-Nature) that first introduced the “author pays” model to secure revenue streams. With article processing charges (APCs) now being the dominant open-access model, authors routinely pay between £2,000 and £10,000 to publish a single article, even if the cost of producing it does not exceed £1,000.Some of us attended the recent Royal Societyconferenceon the future of scientific publishing, where its vice-president, Sir Mark Walport, reminded the audience that academic publishing isn’t free and that if we want to remove paywalls for both authors and readers, someone must pay the bills.We argue that there is already enough money in the system, which allows leading publishers such as Elsevier to generate profit margins of38%. Our most recent estimates show thatresearchers paid close to $9bn in APCsto six publishers in 2019-23, with annual amounts nearly tripling in these five years. These most recent estimates far exceed the$1bn estimated for 2015-18that your article cites.As further emphasised at theRoyal Societymeeting, publishers monetise the current role that journal prestige plays in hiring, promotion and funding. Therefore, in order to make open access sustainable and to put a stop to these extractive business practices, it is essential to reform academic assessment and decouple it from knowledge dissemination.Stefanie HausteinAssociate Professor, School of Information Studies, University of Ottawa; Co-director, Scholarly Communications LabEric ScharesEngineering and collection analysis librarian, University Library, Iowa State UniversityLeigh-Ann ButlerScholarly communication librarian, University of OttawaJuan Pablo AlperinAssociate professor, School of Publishing, Simon Fraser University; Scientific director, Public Knowledge ProjectAcademic publishing is creaking at the seams. Too many articles are published and too many journals don’t add real value. Researchers are incentivised to publish quantity over quality, and some journal publishers benefit from this. This detracts from the excellent, world-changing and increasingly open-access research that we all need to flourish – and that quality publishers cultivate.Generative AI only scales up these pressures, as your article shows. Something has to change. That’s why Cambridge University Press has spent the last few months collaborating with researchers, librarians, publishers, funders and learned societies across the globe on a radical and pragmatic review of the open research publishing ecosystem, which we will publish in the autumn.Focusing on generative AI or on low-quality journals alone is insufficient. We need a system-wide approach that reviews and rethinks the link between publishing, reward and recognition; equity in research dissemination; research integrity; and one that takes technological change seriously.The system is about to break. We need creative thinking and commitment from all players to fix it and to build something better.Mandy HillManaging director, Cambridge University PressExplore more on these topicsPeer review and scientific publishingOpen access scientific publishingAcademicsResearch fundingResearchArtificial intelligence (AI)PublishinglettersShareReuse this content"

It’s a difficult situation, and we have to take it very humbly and seriously.”But the result also weakens Ishiba’s position just days before the country needs to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration to avert the imposition of punishing tariffs in its largest export market.Ishiba later told TV Tokyo: “We are engaged in extremely critical tariff negotiations with the United States … we must never ruin these negotiations. It is only natural to devote our complete dedication and energy to realising our national interests.”Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy,faces a deadline of 1 Augustto strike a trade deal with the US.Japanese imports are already subject to a 10% tariff, while the auto industry – which accounts for 8% of jobs – is reeling from a 25% levy.Weak export data last week, which showed plummeting US-bound auto deliveries, stoked fears that Japan could tip into a technical recession.If Ishiba goes, it was unclear who might step up as the LDP’s 11th premier since 2000 now that the government needs opposition support in both chambers.“Ishiba may be replaced by someone else, but it’s not clear who will be the successor,” Hidehiro Yamamoto, politics and sociology professor at the University of Tsukuba, told Agence France-Presse.The centre-left main opposition Constitutional Democratic party now has a total of 37 seats, with the centre-right Democratic Party for the People now on 22.The far-right Sanseito party won 14 seats, up from one seat, giving it a significant presence in the upper house. Birthed on YouTube in 2020, it has been the election’s surprise package with its“Japanese first” campaignand warnings about a “silent invasion” of foreigners.Turnout was 58%, six points higher than the last upper house vote, with a record number of people casting ballots in advance, in part due to the election falling in the middle of a three-day weekend. Sanseito has been appealing to a sizeable disillusioned segment of the population who feel ignored by the mainstream parties and rarely vote.Opposition parties advocating for tax cuts and welfare spending have struck a chord with voters, exit polls showed, as rising consumer prices – particularlya jump in the cost of rice– have sowed frustration at the government’s response.“The LDP was largely playing defence in this election, being on the wrong side of a key voter issue,” said David Boling, a director at the consulting firm Eurasia Group.“Polls show that most households want a cut to the consumption tax to address inflation, something that the LDP opposes. Opposition parties seized on it and hammered that message home.”The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very jittery government bond market, as investors worry about Japan’s ability to refinance the world’s largest debt pile.Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters.It remains to be seen whether the party can follow the path of other far-right parties with which it has drawn comparisons, such as Germany’s AfD and Reform UK.“I am attending graduate school but there are no Japanese around me. All of them are foreigners,” said Yu Nagai, a 25-year-old student who voted for Sanseito earlier on Sunday.“When I look at the way compensation and money are spent on foreigners, I think that Japanese people are a bit disrespected,” he said after casting his ballot at a polling station in Tokyo’s Shinjuku ward.In Japan, which has the world’s oldest population, foreign-born residents hit a record of about 3.8 million last year.That is still just 3% of the total population, a much smaller fraction than in the US and Europe, but comes amid a tourism boom that has made foreigners far more visible across the country.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificThe far rightPopulationnewsShareReuse this content"

Several people remained missing on Sunday.“At least 38 of those on board have been confirmed dead and 10 rescued,” the government said in a statement.The official Vietnam News Agency reported that all the tourists were Vietnamese, including several children.The boat overturned as a result of strong winds, the newspaper said. A 14-year-old boy was among the survivors. He was rescued after four hours trapped in the overturned hull.One survivor, Dang Anh Tuan, told the Associated Press that he survived by swimming out of a window of the upturned and water-filled boat.“It rained for about 15 minutes, and then the boat started to shake vigorously, tables and chairs were jostled around and seconds later the boat overturned,” said the 36-year-old. “Water gushed in and I lost all orientation.“I tried to breathe. But more water came in. I took a deep breath, got rid of my life vest and dove down. I saw a streak of light and followed it to swim out, escaping the boat, and then I climbed on the overturned boat to look for help.”Tuan and three others survived by clinging on to the capsized boat and its propellers, waiting another two hours until the rain stopped and rescue arrived.Before the accident, passengers had asked for the boat to turn back to shore, but the crew reassured them they were almost at their destination and kept the boat moving forward, Tuan said.VNExpress said most of the passengers were tourists, including about 20 children from Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital.A tropical storm was also moving toward the area.

A chatbot takes students through some of the coursework, such as how to write an email and recognise hazard signs.Duke Education, co-run by Collingwood co-vice-president and former AFL player Paul Licuria, offers courses for unemployed Australians.People interviewed by AI for jobs face discrimination risks, Australian study warnsRead moreWorkforce Australia providers cover the cost of training for participants through the Employment Fund, a pool of taxpayer funding used to place job seekers into training and to buy work-related items such as clothing.Sarah*, whose real name has been withheld, was put in the certificate III course by her job provider, MatchWorks, after she said she wanted to study social work.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“It was a chatbot-based learning system,” she claimed.In the first week of the course, Sarah was put in a chat room with classmates and taught how to message them, she said. The online course had pre-determined answers for students to choose.“It doesn’t really matter what answer I picked,” Sarah said. “You can’t ever have your own input in the class, it is always just to agree with the other classmates or with the teacher.”Screenshots shared with Guardian Australia show the chatbot teaching students how to write an email, including starting “with a friendly and professional tone” and explaining the email’s purpose before ending with a “positive and encouraging note”.View image in fullscreenThe chatbot-based learning system provides students with pre-determined answers to choose.Illustration: Duke EducationSarah lives in Perth, has two casual jobs in youth work and runs children’s programs. Her casual work is not currently enough to live off, so her income is supplemented by jobseeker payments.Sarah said her job provider pushed her to do the course. “I’ve written emails before,” she said. “It felt kind of irrelevant. I thought it was going to be more driven towards community work.”“I did ask them if I could do a different course but they were adamant that they already used the funding and that switching without any reasonable cause wouldn’t be possible to fund for.”In other parts of the course, which runs for six months, students are taught what hazard signs mean, including “first aid” and danger.In a previous version of its student handbook, Duke Education spruiked its use of AI.“Utilising AI-driven conversational learning, our trainers and assessors monitor each student’s progress, providing valuable guidance and feedback,” the handbook said. “Additionally, AI facilitates realistic simulated scenarios, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge with the ongoing support of our dedicated trainers and assessors.”However, in a statement to Guardian Australia, a spokesperson said no AI was used to run the course. When asked about the handbook, Duke Education provided a new version without mention of AI.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Students also receive learner guides, access interactive quizzes, and participate in one-on-one sessions with real trainers and assessors.”The organisation also defended the course material: “Workplace skills such as professional email writing and hazard identification are core competencies in community services.“These units are nationally endorsed and assessed through contextualised, practical tasks that mirror real work environments, such as communicating with support agencies or identifying risks in client homes or service settings.”“Whilst the conversational learning part of the experience has responses that are multiple-choice, learners are encouraged to reflect and think critically throughout,” the spokesperson said, adding that all formal assessments in the course involved “a combination of multi-choice, written or verbal responses, marked by a qualified assessor, so students can demonstrate their knowledge in their own words”.The Antipoverty Centre’s Jeremy Poxon said: “All throughout the employment services system, companies look to extract the maximum amount of money.“It sadly comes as no surprise to see an RTO using chatbots … the minister should come clean about how much public money is being used on these AI chatbot courses.“The employment fund should be used to help the poorest people in the country afford vital things they need.”MatchWorks said the course content was a matter for Duke Education. “MatchWorks ensures a tailored and personalised service to each participant based on their individual needs, circumstances and choices,” a spokesperson said.“MatchWorks encourages all participants to provide feedback about the education services they are receiving to ensure their needs are being met.”Duke Education’s spokesperson said “concerns about the broader employment services system do relate not to individual training providers like Duke”.Licuria was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWelfareInequalityAustralian educationJob huntingnewsShareReuse this content"

They expect a parliament to work together and they expect the parliament to last four years.”Labor under Dean Winter suffered a 3% swing against it to the Liberals. It was Labor’s worst vote in Tasmania in more than a century with the party securing 26% of the vote with three-quarters of the ballots counted.However, Winter hasn’t ruled out trying to form government if the Liberals are unable to get a left-leaning independent crossbench onside.“I’ve spoken to a number of members of the crossbench and offered Labor will try and work differently and collaboratively,” the opposition leader said.“I won’t go into the details of any of the conversations but we’ll treat people with respect. I think that’s what the crossbench is looking for and it’s also what Tasmanians are looking for.”Winter reiterated on Sunday that he would not “do a deal” with the Greens. Labor would need support from the minor party, which holds five seats, to govern.Winter said he would not compromise on Labor policy, including support for a $945m stadium which is opposed by the Greens and some crossbench independents.One of those independents, a re-elected Kristie Johnston, said she wouldn’t enter into a formal deal for confidence and supply with either major party and would provide support on merit.“They need to negotiate and respect the views of parliament,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Incumbent stadium supporter David O’Byrne was returned.Rockliff on Sunday noted Labor’s support for the stadium and the fact the two major parties would likely make up 24 or 25 seats in the 35-seat lower house.“What the vote said is that two-thirds of Tasmanians voted for pro-Tassie Devils and pro-stadium candidates,” the premier said.The new parliament will be very similar to the previous one that included 14 Liberals, 10 Labor MPS, five Greens, five independents and one Jacqui Lambie Network member.Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their two sons, aged 11 and 12, and a 13-year-old passenger were also in the vehicle, sustaining minor injuries.Dozens of firefighters and ambulances, as well as two rescue helicopters, were among the emergency services deployed in response to the accident.Images from the scene showed rescuers cutting through the roof, and the wreckage of a playground that the car ran through. The vehicle had to be removed from the roof with a crane and was taken away by police. An investigation was under way.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The practice has been happening since at least 2022, according to aninvestigation last yearby Lighthouse Reports, Le Monde, the Observer and Der Spiegel.The incident, revealed to the Guardian in a log known as a situation report or Sitrep from the Gris-Nez maritime rescue coordination centre, happened overnight on 9/10 July just hours before the Starmer-Macron announcement.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in media interviews last week thatFrancewas reviewing tactics that might produce change based on the principle of intervening in French waters and that it would take forward the conclusions of that review.According to the log, the incident began at 11.21pm on the night of 9 July when the gendarmerie intervened in the departure of a dinghy from Cayeux-sur-Mer by puncturing it. Then they lost sight of the boat and at 11.22 the coastguard was asked to search with air and sea resources.The coastguard identified the dinghy in the early hours of 10 July. Despite having been slashed it picked up more passengers along the coast and arrived in the UK with 55 passengers the same day after it was rescued by an RNLI lifeboat.Home Office datashows that 10 boats arrived that day carrying 573 passengers.French coastguard sources said the incident was evidence that even when the gendarmarie had slashed a dinghy, if it remains afloat those on board would not be deterred from trying to reach the UK. It also highlights that the boat-slashing tactic requires extra sea rescue resources.In an open letter to its directorpublishedin French media on 25 June from the French coastguard union, Solidaires Douanes, concerns were raised about “increasing institutional mistreatment of people in exile” as part of stop-the-boats policies.Separately it has emerged that the Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport has been earmarked to detain people who arrive in small boats before their return to France.It is not known how the Home Office will select those for return, nor for how long they will be detained. Brook House was previously the subject of a public inquiry afterdamning undercover footage of mistreatmentof detainees obtained by BBC’s Panorama.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not when they have already fled war and persecution at home, and survived unimaginable dangers on their journey.“The fact people are willing to risk their lives to seek safety in the UK in the first place should be enough evidence that so-called deterrents, regardless of how brutal they are, do not work. They only make people take ever more dangerous journeys. The only way to stop crossings is to offer safe routes to claim asylum.”Home Office sources said the French government had not yet announced the outcome of their review, but that officials hoped maritime operational teams would soon be able to intervene to stop boats in the water.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, the UK governmenttold consumersto dispose of any products containing the ingredient.“I am shocked by it, and I think we have a duty to protect European consumers,” McGrath told the Guardian.National consumer protection authorities send out rapid alerts across the EU warning of unsafe non-food products as part of a service, Safety Gate, which is also open to consumer complaints.Last year, Safety Gate received a record high of 4,137 alerts with more than a third relating to cosmetics, ahead of toys, electrical appliances, auto and chemical products.While consumer groups are concerned about safety, McGrath is also worried that the platforms,which have exploded in popularity in the last two years, are damaging local businesses through unfair competition.“The growth is extraordinary, and it has placed enormous pressure on the systems at member state level,” he said.“I am determined that we step up our enforcement of our product safety laws and our consumer protection rules. It’s not only about protecting consumers, but there is a very serious level playing field issue here for European businesses, because they are expected to compete with sellers who are not complying with our rules,” he said.“They are incurring significant costs in Europe to comply with our requirements, and they should not be expected to compete with those who are not doing the same.”EU figures show 12m low-value items a day coming into the bloc, amounting to 4.6bn consignments under €150 for 2024 – double that of 2023 and three times as many as 2022.Among the moves the EU is considering is an abolition of the €150 duty-free threshold and the introduction of a handling fee for each package which may deter low-value purchases and help pay the cost of extra customs investigations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

American buyers have had to pay an additional 30% tax or a minimum of $50 an item after 1 June this year.Also possible is the creation of a EU-wide customs authority to cope with the systemic issues.McGrath said it “remains to be seen” if the subject will be raised at an EU-China summit in Beijing on 25 July but he plans to address it directly himself.“It will certainly be engaging directly with Chinese authorities and we will visiting later on this year,” he said.Shein said it was investing $15m this year in compliance and safety initiatives including 2.5m product and safety quality tests and has partnerships with 15 testing centres, including operations in the UK, Germany. It said it had removed 500 vendors since the launch of its marketplace.A spokesperson said: “Earning and maintaining the trust of our consumers is paramount, and we are fully committed to ensuring the products we offer are safe and compliant.“All of our vendors are required to comply with Shein’s code of conduct and stringent safety standards, and must also abide by the relevant laws and regulations of the markets where we operate.”A Temu spokesperson said: “Temu takes product safety and compliance very seriously. We have a system of seller vetting, proactive monitoring and responsive takedowns to prevent, detect and remove unsafe products.“We work closely with globally recognised testing and certification organisations – including TÜV SÜD, Eurofins, SGS, and Bureau Veritas – to help ensure that the products offered by third-party sellers meet safety and quality standards.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEuropean UnionSheinEuropeChinaE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

He could not say whether the dead had been killed by the Israeli army, armed gangs or both.Israel’s military said soldiers had shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who it claimed posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties. But it said the numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found. It did not immediately comment on the incident in the south.There was new alarm as Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for areas of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organisations attempting to distribute aid are located.In central Deir al-Balah, residents said Israeli planes struck three houses in the area and dozens of families began leaving their homes, carrying some of their belongings, Reuters reported.View image in fullscreenPalestinians are transported to hospitals after the incident in the Zikim area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBefore these reports emerged, the pope called for “an immediate end to the barbarity of the war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict” at the end of the Angelus prayer at Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence near Rome.The pope also spoke of his anguish overthe Israeli strike on Gaza’s only Catholic churchlast week, which killed three people and injured 10. Among the injured was the parish priest, who used to receive daily calls from the late Pope Francis.Israel has expressed “deep sorrow” and opened an investigation into the strike on the church, which was sheltering about 600 displaced people, most of them children and many with special needs.“This act, unfortunately, adds to the ongoing military attacks against the civilian population and places of worship in Gaza,” the pope said on Sunday.“I appeal to the international community to observe humanitarian law and respect the obligation to protect civilians, as well as the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force, and the forced displacement of populations.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian casualty of Israeli fire, who was seeking aid supplies, according to medics, is carried in the northern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersOn Sunday the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Unrwa, said Israeli authorities were “starving civilians in Gaza”, including 1 million children.“Unrwa has enough food for the entire population of Gaza for over three months stockpiled in warehouses,” it said in an earlier social media post that included photos of a warehouse in Arish, Egypt.“Open the gates, lift the siege, allow Unrwa to do its work and help people in need among them 1 million children,” the agency said.From Gaza to Ukraine, peace always seems just out of reach – and the reason isn’t only political | Simon TisdallRead moreUnrwa said last week that babies weredying from “severe acute malnutrition”.Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa in Gaza and the West Bank, accusing the agency of having been infiltrated by Hamas, although an independent review found Tel Aviv hadfailed to provide evidenceof its claims that Unrwa employees were members of terrorist organisations.The agency had been the main distributor of aid in Gaza and provider of basic services, including health and education, to Palestinians across the region.View image in fullscreenPalestinians fleeing Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APSince May aid has been largely distributed by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in place of the traditional UN-led system. Food has become scarce, and very expensive, since Israel imposed a blockade on 2 March.The UN has said that as of 13 July, 875 people had been killed in recent weeks trying to get food, including 674 in the vicinity of GHF sites. The remaining 201 victims were killed on the routes or close to aid convoys run by the UN or its partners.Children have been killed fetching waterfor their families.Meanwhile, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders on Sunday in areas of central Gaza packed with displaced Palestinians, a sign of an imminent attack on neighbourhoods in Deir al-Balah, which has alarmed the families of Israeli hostages, who fear their relatives are being held there.“Can anyone [promise] to us that this decision will not come at the cost of losing our loved ones?” the families said in a statement.The Israeli military dropped leaflets from the sky ordering people in several districts in south-west Deir al-Balah, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza have been sheltering, to leave their homes and head south.View image in fullscreenInjured Palestinians are transported to hospitals in the Zikim area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The [Israel] Defense Forces continues to operate with great force to destroy the enemy’s capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area,” the military said.Israel’s forces have not yet entered these districts during the current conflict because they suspect that Hamas may be holding hostages there. At least 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in captivity in Gaza are believed still to be alive.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage.At least 58,895 Palestinians have been killed and 140,980 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPope Leo XIVIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAidPalestinian territoriesGazanewsShareReuse this content"

The United Nations migration agency said the number of people displaced by the violence had risen to more than 128,000.One local resident, dentist Kenan Azzam, told Reuters on Sunday morning the situation was one of “a tense calm” but people were still struggling with a lack of water and electricity. “The hospitals are a disaster and out of service, and there are still so many dead and wounded,” he said.Agence France-Presse correspondents on the outskirts of Sweida city reported there were no sounds of fighting, adding humanitarian convoys were preparing to enter the Druze-majority town.Escalating unrest in Syria lays bare new regime’s momentous challengesRead moreThe Syrian Arab Red Crescent humanitarian organisation announced it was sending 32 trucks to Sweida loaded with food, medicine, water, fuel and other aid, after the fighting left the province with power cuts and shortages. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the health ministry was also sending a convoy of trucks.The violence was triggered by a dispute between a Bedouin tribesman and a member of the Druze, who are a minority in wider Syria, which prompted government forces to intervene. Druze fighters resisted their entry into the province and violence escalated, turning into days of terror for local people. In response, Israel, which has vowed to protect the Druze community,launched airstrikes on Syria’s defence ministryin Damascus and dozens of military targets in the south of the country.View image in fullscreenMembers of Syria’s Internal Security Forces stand guard at a checkpoint set up to prevent Bedouin fighters from advancing towards Sweida on Sunday.Photograph: Karam Almasri/ReutersA ceasefire agreement between Syria and Israel had been announced by the US early on Saturday to prevent further Israeli military intervention.Early on Sunday, the US stepped up calls for an end to the fighting. “All factions must immediately lay down their arms, cease hostilities, and abandon cycles of tribal vengeance,” the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, wrote on X. “Syria stands at a critical juncture – peace and dialogue must prevail – and prevail now.”A few hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a warning to Syria’s new government, whose forces have been accused by Druze factions of committing abuses, including summary executions, when they entered Sweida earlier in the week.Rubio wrote on X: “If authorities in Damascus want to preserve any chance of achieving a unified, inclusive and peaceful Syria free of Isis [Islamic State] and of Iranian control they must help end this calamity by using their security forces to prevent Isis and any other violent jihadists from entering the area and carrying out massacres. And they must hold accountable and bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks.”MapTwo members of the government forcesposted sectarian hate speech against Druze, according to private social media seen by the Guardian’s correspondent in Beirut.One posted a video of him and two other soldiers driving through Sweida laughing as he said: “We are on our way to distribute aid,” while brandishing a machete to the camera. He filmed himself inside a house in Sweida ripping a picture of Druze spiritual leaders off a wall and trampling it with his boots.The last week has been the worst outbreak of violence since March, when1,500 mostly Alawite citizens were massacredin revenge for a failed attack by supporters of the ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad, who came from the sect.The second round of sectarian violence has tempered international hopes for the new Syrian government, which came to power last December after thesudden fall of the Assad regime. Western governments, the US, the UK and the EU, lifted sanctions in an effort to aid Syria’s battered economy and economic reconstruction, after 13 years of civil war and repression by the Assad regime, which killed more than half a million people, leaving 90% of the population in poverty.The EU said on Saturday it was “appalled by the hundreds of victims” of the recent violence, including that “reportedly perpetrated by several armed groups against unarmed civilians”. In a statement, the EU foreign service urged “all parties to immediately stop all acts of violence, to protect all civilians without distinction, and to take immediate steps to prevent incitement and sectarian discourse”.The EU also called on “Israel and all other foreign actors to fully respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Saturday announced a ceasefire in Sweida and renewed his promise to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities.Sharaa, who was more sympathetic to the Bedouins, had tried to appeal to the Druze community while remaining critical of the militias. He later urged the Bedouins to leave the city, saying they “cannot replace the role of the state in handling the country’s affairs and restoring security”.The interior ministry said overnight that Sweida city was “evacuated of all tribal fighters, and clashes within the city’s neighbourhoods were halted”.A spokesperson for Syria’s tribal and clan council told Al Jazeera late on Saturday that fighters had left the city “in response to the call of the presidency and the terms of the agreement”.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He also said Israeli intervention “pushed the country into a dangerous phase”.Late on Saturday, the interior ministry said clashes in Sweida city had been halted and the area cleared of Bedouin tribal fighters following the deployment.The presidency added in a statement that any breaches of the ceasefire would be a “clear violation to sovereignty”, and urged all parties to “fully commit” to it and end hostilities in all areas immediately.Syria’s internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida “with the aim of protecting civilians and putting an end to the chaos”, the interior ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba said in a statement on Telegram.A statement on Saturday by one of the three religious leaders of the Syrian Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri,saidthe ceasefire would guarantee safe exit for community members and the opening of humanitarian corridors for besieged civilians to leave.Correspondents with Agence France-Presse, however, reported clashes in the west of the provincial capital as Druze fighters battled armed Bedouin supported by tribal gunmen from other parts of Syria. The Druze fighters said those who had arrived to support the Bedouin were mostly Islamists.One armed tribesman, who identified himself only as Abu Jassem, told AFP that “we will slaughter them [the Druze] in their homes”.France’s foreign ministry urged all sides to respect the ceasefire. “France welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire in the Sweida region. It urges all parties to strictly adhere to it,” the ministry said. “Fighting and violence must cease immediately.”The US special envoy, Thomas Barrack, had announced early on Saturday morning that Israel and Syria had agreed to a ceasefire, after Israel sided with the Druze factions and joined the conflict, including by bombing a government building in Damascus.Barrack, who is the US ambassador to Ankara, said the deal had the backing of Turkey, a key supporter of Sharaa, as well as neighbouring Jordan.“We call upon Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbours,” he wrote on X.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, later on Saturday called on the Syrian government’s security forces to prevent jihadists from entering and “carrying out massacres” in the conflict-stricken south. US-brokered negotiations sought to avert further Israeli military intervention.“The US has remained heavily involved over the last three days with Israel, Jordan and authorities in Damascus on the horrifying and dangerous developments in southern Syria,” Rubio said.He called for the Syrian government to “hold accountable and bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks”.“Furthermore the fighting between Druze and Bedouin groups inside the perimeter must also stop immediately,” Rubio added.Sharaa followed up on the US announcement by renewing his pledge to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities.“The Syrian state is committed to protecting all minorities and communities in the country … We condemn all crimes committed” in Sweida, he said in his televised speech.He also paid tribute to the “important role played by the United States, which again showed its support for Syria in these difficult circumstances and its concern for the country’s stability”.The EU welcomed the deal between Syria and Israel, saying it had been appalled by the deadly sectarian violence of recent days.But Israel expressed deep scepticism about Sharaa’s renewed pledge to protect minorities, pointing to deadly violence against Alawites as well as Druze since he led the overthrow of the country’s longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.In Sharaa’s Syria “it is very dangerous to be a member of a minority – Kurd, Druze, Alawite or Christian”, the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, posted on X.The UN had previously called for an end to the fighting and demanded an independent investigation of the violence, which has killed at least 940 people from both sides since Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).Map of Sweida provinceThe SOHRreported on Friday that the humanitarian situation in Sweida had “dramatically deteriorated” owing to an acute shortage of food and medical supplies. All hospitals were out of service because of the conflict and looting was widespread in the city.“The situation in the hospital is disastrous. The corpses have begun to rot, there’s a huge amount of bodies, among them women and children,” a surgeon at Sweida national hospital said over the phone.The renewed fighting raised questions about the authority of Sharaa, whose interim governmentfaces misgivings from the country’s minoritiesafter thekilling of 1,500 mostly Alawite civilianson the Syrian coast in March.‘Shot in the head, as if executed’: four days of violence end with hundreds dead in southern SyriaRead moreIt was Sharaa who ordered government forces to pull out of Sweida, saying that mediation by the US and others had helped to avert a “large-scale escalation” with Israel.A number of sources told Reuters that Sharaa had initially misread how Israel would respond to him deploying troops to the country’s south earlier this week, having been encouraged by Barrack saying Syria should be centrally governed as one country.When Israel targeted Syrian troops and Damascus on Wednesday,bombarding the Syrian defence ministry headquartersin the centre of the capital and striking near the presidential palace, it took the Syrian government by surprise, the sources said.1:10Israel launches strikes on Damascus as sectarian violence flares in southern Syria – videoDruze people are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes were a message to Syria’s president regarding the events in Sweida.But the Syrian government mistakenly believed it had a green light from the US and Israel to dispatch its forces south despite months of Israeli warnings not to do so, according to the Reuters sources, which included Syrian political and military officials, two diplomats and regional security sources.The violence erupted last Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, the SOHR said.The government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and the SOHR said the troops had sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters. The organisation reported that 19 civilians had been killed in an “horrific massacre” when Syrian defence ministry forces and general security forces entered the town of Sahwat al-Balatah.A truce was negotiated on Wednesday after the Israeli bombardment, allowing Druze factions and clerics to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out.Sharaa said in a speech on Thursday that Druze groups would be left to govern security affairs in the southern province in what he described as a choice to avoid war.“We sought to avoid dragging the country into a new, broader war that could derail it from its path to recovery from the devastating war,” he said. “We chose the interests of Syrians over chaos and destruction.”But clashes resumed on Thursday as Syrian state media reported that Druze groups had launched revenge attacks on Bedouin villages. Bedouin tribes had fought alongside government forces against Druze fighters earlier in the week.On Friday, about 200 tribal fighters clashed with armed Druze men from Sweida using machine guns and shells, an AFP correspondent said, while the SOHR reported fighting and “shelling on neighbourhoods in Sweida city”.Sweida has been heavily damaged in the fighting and its mainly Druze inhabitants have been deprived of water and electricity. Communication lines have also been cut.Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the local news outlet Suwayda 24, said the humanitarian situation was “catastrophic”. “We cannot find milk for children,” he told AFP.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, has demanded “independent, prompt and transparent investigations into all violations” adding that “those responsible must be held to account”.The International Committee for the Red Cross said “health facilities are overwhelmed, medical supplies are dwindling and power cuts are impeding the preservation of human remains in overflowing morgues”.“The humanitarian situation in Sweida is critical. People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.Syria’s minority groups have been given what many see as only token representation in the interim government since the former president fled the country, according to Bassam Alahmad, the executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a civil society organisation.“It’s a transitional period. We should have a dialogue, and they [the minorities] should feel that they’re a real part of the state,” Alahmad said. Instead, the incursion into Sweida sent a message that the new authorities would use military force to “control every part of Syria”.“Bashar Assad tried this way” and failed, he said.Government supporters, however, fear its decision to withdraw could signal to other minorities that it is acceptable to demand their own autonomous regions, which they say would fragment and weaken the country.If Damascus ceded security control of Sweida to the Druze, “of course everyone else is going to demand the same thing”, said Abdel Hakim al-Masri, a former official in the Turkish-backed regional government in north-west Syria before Assad’s fall.“This is what we are afraid of,” he told the Associated Press.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel is not a signatory to UNCLOS.Barron said recognition of Palestine, particularly by states with large oil firms registered in their jurisdiction, would effectively end the legal ambiguity, and provide the PA with not only a new secure source of income, but regular supplies of energy independent of Israel.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli pipeline running to Egypt has been called unlawful since it runs through Palestinian waters.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APSince the legal letter, ENI has told pressure groups in Italy that “licences have not yet been issued and no exploratory activities are in progress”.Another group, Global Witness,claims the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline that runs parallel to the Gaza coastline is unlawfulsince it runs through Palestinian waters, and is not providing any revenue to the PA.The 56-mile (90km) pipeline transports gas from Ashkelon in Israel to Arish in Egypt, where it is then processed into liquefied natural gas for export, including to Europe.“The Oslo Accords agreed in 1993 clearly give the Palestinian National Authority jurisdiction over territorial waters, the subsoil, power to legislate over oil and gas exploration and to award licences to do so,” Barron said. “Control over natural resources was an important element of [the] state-building agenda of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Israeli exploitation of Palestinian resources was and remains a central part of the conflict.”Gas was discovered in the Gaza Marine field in 2000 in a joint venture owned by the BG Gas group, a giant privatised off-shoot of British Gas and the Palestinian Consolidated Contractors Company. The plan was for the gas to be used by the sole power station on the Gaza strip to end the territory’s perennial energy shortages.Barron argues in his book – The Gaza Marine Story - that the fate of the project is a microcosm of how Israel worked to increase Palestinian dependence on Israel while at the same time trying to separate Palestinians from Israelis.The project was dogged by issues of commercial viability and an Israeli court ruling that the waters were a “no-man’s water”, partly because the PA was not a sovereign entity with unambiguous powers to award licences.The court also did not resolve whether the rights to Palestinian territorial waters clearly provided for in the Oslo Accords included a Palestinian “exclusive economic zone”, a zone that normally extends 200 miles off the coast. The accords were only intended to be an interim arrangement before full statehood and so did not delineate the full maritime border.Territorial waters are normally defined as only 12 or 20 miles off the coast and Israel always argued that any licence for Gaza Marine 20 miles off the Gaza coast should be seen as a gift to the PA by Israel, and not a right.After Hamas took control the Gaza strip in 2007, Israel did not want the revenue to fall into its hands, so it blocked the development, prompting the BG group to put the project on hold and then eventually to quit. In June 2023 Israel approved plans for an Egyptian firm EGAS to develop the field, only for the war in Gaza to start.Gaza Marine is estimated to contain only 30 billion cubic metres (BCM) of natural gas, which is a small fraction of the more than 1,000 BCM contained in Israel’s own territorial waters.Barron argued that Israel has its own gas supplies and so long as a Palestinian state with unified governance is recognised, Israel will have no motive or legal right to block Palestine exploiting its single greatest natural resource.The whole controversy around private sector investment in Israel’s acknowledged occupation of Palestine moved centre stage with a report published last week by the UN special rapporteur on Palestine, Francesca Albanese, warning corporations against sustaining what has been declared an unlawful occupation by the international court of justice (ICJ).She claims ICJ decisions place on corporate entities a prima facie responsibility “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings with Israel, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination”. Her claim has been rejected wholesale by Israel.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAccess to energynewsShareReuse this content"

Officials from the UK Foreign Office were allowed on an exceptional basis to visit the couple last Thursday to check on their welfare.The couple, who celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary this week, were held up until eight weeks ago at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison in the capital, Kabul, their children said.They were then transferred to the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), with the promise of release within two to three days, they said. Two further months have since passed.The children said their parents had better conditions at the GDI but still had no bed or furniture and slept on a mattress on the floor.Sarah Entwistle, one of the children, said: “For the past two months, we have maintained a media blackout, hoping to demonstrate our intention to show respect to the Taliban, and ‘trust the process’.“The UN will be making a statement on Monday calling for immediate release. In the light of this, we are also publicly appealing again to the Taliban for this.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

Get ‘the best of the Highlands’ for £9mRead moreProperty price rises are also being constrained by the amount of properties up for sale, which has reached the highest level in a decade, the website found, adding that homeowners who want to sell during the summer have to work harder to attract potential buyers’ attention than during the spring.“What’s most important to remember in this market is that the price is key to selling,” said Colleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove.“The decade-high level of buyer choice means that discerning buyers can quickly spot when a home looks overpriced compared to the many others that may be available in their area.”The highest number of falls in asking prices from new sellers was in London, where they dropped by 1.5% compared with a month earlier, and slid by 2.1% in inner London.Temporary cuts to stamp duty in England and Northern Irelandcame to an end at the start of April, after the announcement by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her October budget. Scotland and Wales set their own taxes on house purchases.The April stamp duty increase has had a greater impact in London, where property prices are higher, and the increase in stamp duty on second homes and properties bought as an investment is thought to be having an effect.In the past, monthly price drops could have been viewed as a sign of a slower housing market, but the number of property sales is still growing year on year, and lower asking prices are helping to make house purchases more affordable for buyers.Average asking prices from new sellers are only 0.1% higher than they were a year ago, at a time when lower mortgage rates are improving buyer affordability. Also helping is the fact that average wage rises are outstripping house prices and inflation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, four in 10, or nearly 15 million people, are not saving enough for their retirement, according to analysis by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).The revived Pensions Commission will examine the long-term future of the retirement system and make recommendations for change. Labour hopes its proposals, due to be reported in 2027, will gain cross-party support and be enacted beyond the current parliament.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said she was relaunching the commission to “tackle the barriers that stop too many saving in the first place”.The previous Pensions Commission, which produced its last report in late 2005, recommendedautomatically enrolling peopleinto workplace pensions.As a result of this, 88% of eligible employees now save for a pension, up from 55% in 2012. However, DWP analysis has found that saving levels have remained low among those automatically enrolled into a workplace pension scheme, with roughly half of private sector workers only saving around the minimum contribution level,which represents 8% or less of earnings.Torsten Bell, the pensions minister, said the original commission “helped get pension saving up and pensioner poverty down” and a revived commission would “finish the job and give today’s workers secure retirements to look forward to”.Bell appears to have changed his mind about the value of a commission, havingdismissed calls for a relaunchwhen speaking at an industry conference as recently as March, adding that a “technocratic” approach would not solve problems.The relaunched commission will include Jeannie Drake, who was a member of the original commission, along with the former chair of Barclays UK, Ian Cheshire, and Nick Pearce, a professor of public policy at the University of Bath.Analysis by the DWP has found that nearly half (45%) of working-age adults are not saving anything at all into their pension, with low earners, some ethnic minorities and the self-employed seen as particularly at risk.More than 3 million self-employed workers are not saving into a pension, it found, while this is also the case for a quarter of low earners in the private sector. Only one in four people from a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background are saving into a pension.There is also a stark gender gap of 48% in the private pension wealth of men compared with women. A typical woman who is now approaching retirement can expect a private pension income that is worth more than £5,000 less than that of a typical man.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dean Walters, 65 and from Harlow, had earlier been charged with affray and will appear at court in September.Far-right activists associated with groups including Britain First were among those in a crowd that gathered outside the Bell hotel on Thursday, where local people including women and children were protesting peacefully.Clashes with police broke out as groups of men, some of them masked, tried to reach a small anti-racism march that started at Epping station and went through the town before it was hemmed in.In an apparent response to allegations that the police had taken a “two-tier” approach that favoured the counter-demonstration, Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: “Unfortunately, across social media we are seeing inflammatory comments which suggest we were supporting and enabling certain protesters.“This is categorically not true. We police without fear or favour, remaining impartial at all times and have legal responsibilities to ensure peaceful protest is facilitated.”Tensions were high in Epping after the appearance in court on Thursday of an asylum seeker charged with three counts of sexual assault.Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denies the offences, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month at Chelmsford magistrates court.Neil Hudson, the local Conservative MP, has been calling on the Home Office to close the hotel and described the violence in the town on Thursday as “completely unacceptable”.“Police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe. People have the right to peacefully protest but these violent scenes are not us, not Epping, not what we stand for,” he said in a post on X.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts would be appointed to work inside water companies and ensure they are obeying the law and improving the environment.The new ombudsman, replacing the Consumer Council forWater, will have strengthened legal powers to help consumers who face problems from water companies, such as sewage floods in their gardens and taps running dry due to burst pipes.‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreWater customers currently find it difficult to get water companies to respond and properly compensate them when they are left without water for days. Signing up to the CCW is voluntary for water companies and it is often left to local MPs to solve complaints.During broadcast interviews on Sunday, Reed saidOfwat was “failing”and he would be “changing the whole system”. Critics say Ofwat has presided over a culture of underinvestment in water infrastructure and financial mismanagement by companies since its creation in 1989.Thames Water, the most troubling case for the government and the UK’s largest water company, is loaded with £20bn in debt and struggling to stave off financial collapse.Reed also vowed to halve sewage pollution by 2030, making rivers, lakes and seas “the cleanest since records began” after years of sewage dumping by water companies.He said he would resign from his role if the government failed to hit the target. “Politicians come and say we’re going to do things. Of course our job should be on the line if we don’t.”However, he came under fire from sewage campaigners for announcing targets which they say are no better than those in Ofwat’s plan to turn around water company performance, which came out in December.During the price review process, when the regulator and water companies negotiate how much bills need to go up by to invest in the water sector, Ofwat last year announced the investment from bills would cut sewage spills by 45% from 2021 levels.Reed announced he would cut sewage spills by 50% by 2030 against 2024 levels. However, Ofwat’s goal would reduce sewage spills to 204,893 by 2030, compared with Reed’s that would reduce them to 225,199 by that year.The £104bn to be invested in fixing England’s creaking sewage infrastructure is coming from a record increase in water bills. Reedsaid he was “furious”about an average 36% rise but was unable to rule out further above-inflation increases in future to fix the broken water sector.He added he expected to see a “small, steady increase in bills” rather than the shock hikes announced in the current price review period.Feargal Sharkey, the former Undertones frontman turned sewage campaigner, said the new targets were worse than those Ofwat announced during the price review process.He said: “How on earth can anybody conjure up a sewage reduction plan that is worse than the one conjured up by the previous government a year and a half ago? The government has decided to axe Ofwat while announcing targets which are worse than theirs. Their plan is not worth the paper it’s written on.”In a speech after the Cunliffe report’s publication on Monday, Reed is expected to say: “Today’s final report from Sir Jon Cunliffe’s independent water commission offers solutions to fix our broken regulatory system so the failures of the past can never happen again.“The government will introduce root and branch reform in the biggest overhaul of water regulation in a generation.”Reed is under pressure from other political parties to go further in his overhaul of the water sector and change the current privatised for profit model. Nigel Farage told the BBC the water industry was in a “hell of a mess” before adding that the government should not bail out investors if water companies went bust, even though Reform UK’s policy is to bring 50% of the sector under state control.Reed argued that nationalisation would cost “upwards of £100bn”, diverting resources from the NHS and taking years during which pollution would get worse, although this isheavily disputedby academics and campaigners.Farage said it would cost “a lot less” than £50bn if the right deal was struck. “It’s public-sector thinking, we need private-sector innovation,” he added, although the industry is currently run by the private sector.Explore more on these topicsWater industryWaterWater billsSteve ReedHousehold billsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

No injuries were reported.About 50 firefighters took about an hour and a half to knock down the flames. Photosposted onlineby the fire department showed a charred car inside the heavily damaged building.According to NBC Bay Area, the suspect told officers on the scene he is Pat Tillman’s brother.

He became an even greater hero in death when he was killed in Afghanistan two years later – until it came out that the Pentagon had lied to cover up that his death was from friendly fire.The Santa Clara county sheriff office’s inmate locator showed a Richard Tillman was booked on Sunday and is being held without bail.

And I’ve said it publicly before, I’m not a proponent of the masks,” Lyons said.“However, if that’s a tool that the men and women of Ice to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it.”Lyons has previously defended the practice of mask-wearing,tellingFox News last week that “while I’m not a fan of the masks, I think we could do better, but we need to protect our agents and officers”, claiming concerns about doxxing (the public revealing of personal information such as home addresses), and declaring that assaults of immigration officers haveincreasedby 830%.Whiledatafrom January 2024 to June 2024 does show 10 reported assaults on Ice officers compared to 79 during the same period last year, those six months have also seen Ice agents descend in record numbers on streets, businesses, farms and public spaces, rounding up and detaining mostly Latino people as part of a massive Trump administration push to rid the US of as many as 1 million immigrants every year.Videos have flooded social media showing Ice agents wearing masks over their faces, detaining people without immediately identifying themselves, refusing to answer questions or explaining why people are being detained, and pushing them into unmarked cars with tinted windows.“I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don’t identify themselves,” Lyonssaid. “Men and women of Ice, and our DoJ partners, and local law enforcement partners who do help us are identified on their vest.” The only identification many agents wear is body armor marked with the word “police”, despite not being police officers.The interview was described as the first major network sit-down at Ice headquarters in Washington.Lyons also confirmed in the interview that Ice obtained and is using Medicaid data to track down immigrants believed to be in the US unlawfully, despite undocumented peoplenot being eligibleto receive Medicaid.White people comprise the largest share of Medicaid recipients, at39.6%.A June report from the Pew Research Center found that84.2%of Medicaid recipients are born in the US, 6.6% are naturalized citizens and 9.2% are foreign-born non-citizens authorized to be in the US.As well as the tens of thousands of arrests, there have been several reported cases of masked criminals posing as Ice officers, such as a man in Raleigh, North Carolinaaccusedin January of kidnapping and raping a woman, threatening to deport her if she didn’t comply, or a man in Brooklynattemptingin February to rape a 51-year-old woman. In April 2025, a Florida womanposedas an immigration officer to briefly kidnap her ex-boyfriend’s wife from her job.Ice agents have also been reported to overstate assaults, such as in New York City mayor candidate Brad Lander’s arrest by immigration officers, where Lander wasaccusedof assaulting officers despitecharges being droppedlater that day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In California, state legislators last monthproposedthe No Vigilantes Act, which would require federal agents to provide identification, including their last name and badge or ID number.“We have a Los Angeles Police Department that has to deal with crime in this city every single day – and they’re not masked, and they stay here,” said the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, in a Sundayinterviewwith ABC News.“I don’t think you have a right to have a mask and snatch people off the street.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

So he and wife booked an appointment to get it replaced.When he arrived at the office on 20 June, however, he was handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, who led him away from his wife without explanation, she said. She herself was kept in the building for 10 hours until relatives picked her up.The family said they made efforts to find any information on his whereabouts but learned nothing.Then, sometime after Leon was detained, a woman purporting to be an immigration lawyer called the family, claiming she could help – but did not disclose how she knew about the case, or where Leon was.On 9 July, according to Leon’s granddaughter, the same woman called them again, claiming Leon had died.A week later, however, they discovered from a relative in Chile that Leon was alive after all – but now in a hospital in Guatemala, a country to which he has no connection.According to Morning Call, the relative said Leon had first been sent to an immigration detention center in Minnesota before being deported to Guatemala – despite not appearing on any Ice detention deportation lists.A recent supreme court decision ruled theTrump administrationcould deport immigrants to other countries beside their country of origin.In his nearly 40 years living in the US, Leon spent his career working in a leather manufacturing plant, and raised a family. He had since retired.His condition at the hospital in Guatemala is unknown. He suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition, according to his family, who said they are planning to fly to Guatemala to see him.An Ice official told the Morning Call it was investigating the matter.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

A line of people, mostly women, were waiting to get into the nightclub when the car – a Nissan Versa – struck them, also hitting a taco truck and a nearby valet stand.According to Cpt Adam VanGerpen, the public information officer for the LA fire department, people were quickly transported to local hospitals and trauma centers. Parademics also determined that one of the patients had a gunshot wound, VanGerpen said.Witnesses said Ramirez was immediately grabbed and pulled him out of the car. He was also shot during the struggle, the LA police department said.He then fled the scene on foot.Images from the scene from photographers and social media show debris, including shoes, strewn across the road, as surrounding areas were sealed off and emergency response teams arrived.“This is under police investigation,” VanGerpen added. “This will be a large investigation with the LAPD.”Partygoers in the club came out immediately to help the victims before the emergency crews arrived, he said.“They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in.

In the same parking lot, a 1950s-erasign advertised a motel that no longer exists. In the distance, only a few surviving businesses remained: a small community center, a veterans organization and a long-standing roadhouse bar popular with locals. A few miles to the north, an entire neighborhood was abandoned in the 1990s after mounds of blowing sandswallowed it whole; today, only rooftops and chimneys peek out from the towering sand dunes.Despite the general ghost town-like atmosphere, the cafe’s early-morning visitors were giddy.Neilson Lopes, a tourist from Brazil, happily perused a rack of neon T-shirts and snapped photos of the dimly lit cafe. He and his wifehad flown and driven, on the back of a motorcycle, thousands of miles to be there, in the middle of nowhere.“I’ve planned this trip for 10 years,” he said. “For decades, maybe.”View image in fullscreenThe Bagdad Cafe glows in the evening light along Route 66 in Newberry Springs, California.Photograph: Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesBecause while this Mojave Desert outpost – a tiny settlement of 2,000-some people called Newberry Springs– may look deserted to the uninitiated, it’s positioned on one of the most famous roads in the world:Route 66. The roughly 2,400-mile(3,900km) route stretches from theCaliforniacoast to Chicago, connecting both small towns and sprawling metropolises across the country. For many, the road embodies a sense of quintessential Americana, from its quirky roadside kitsch to its historic roots.And next year, Route 66 is turning 100 years old. Nationwide preparations for the big anniversary have been underway for years: caravans of people are planning to drive the entirety of the route, and Congress even created aRoute 66 Centennial Commissionin 2020 to commemorate the milestone.In small towns such as Newberry Springs, and an even tinier neighboring community 10 miles west called Daggett, residents are hoping the anniversary will bring in a flood of extra visitors. The Bagdad Cafe, where the1980s cult classic film by the same namewas shot, currently sees about 6,000 tourists each month. Locals anticipate that those numbers will double in 2026 – and they’re planning other ways to capitalize on the centennial, too.“We’re a teeny, weeny, little slice of Route 66,” said Renee Kaminski, a co-owner of Newberry Spring’s historic bar.“But we’re a mighty one.”map of Route 66Route 66, stretching from Chicago to Los AngelesA Route 66 town was dead. This man resurrected it into ‘a classic desert destination’Read moreA desert town ‘frozen in time’Out in remote Newberry Springs, an unincorporated community that lacks an official mayor or city council, a handful of residents have instead informally banded together to start sharing ideas for Route 66’s centennial.One of them, Karla Claus, has become a de facto ambassador for the town.Wearing a Route 66 crown atop an American flag cowboy hat, unbothered in a pair of jeans even as the thermostat topped 100F (38C), she described her grand plans for the centennial one recent summer afternoon.This anniversary, she said, is a chance for Newberry Springs to be reborn.“My vision is that we’re going to be one of the go-to destinations for those caravans [of Route 66 fans],” she said. “That we’re saying to those people: ‘Make sure you come here.’”To make that vision a reality, Claus, who is also the vice-presidentof the local chamber of commerce,recently received a micro-grantto start leading custom, history-focused Route 66 tours.View image in fullscreenResident Karla Claus has become a de facto ambassador for the town.Photograph: Amanda UlrichAnd there’s a lot of history to be shared.In 1926, as millions of Americans were buying their first car and taking to the open road, Route 66 was created as part of the nation’s first federal highway system. Car ownership had newly exploded; the Model T had only been introduced about two decades prior.The route was famously dubbed “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his classic 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. At the time, before the route became better known for itsflashing neon signs, old-school diners and eccentric roadside attractions, the road was a migration route for climate refugees fleeing the Dust Bowl.Hit hard by severe drought, dust storms and the Great Depression, hundreds of thousands of people funneled out of the Great Plains via the now-celebrated route and headed west.In Newberry Springs, Route 66 brought about a kind of heyday in the 1950s. Because of the constant flow of traffic, its main street was bustling: there were more businesses, a couple hotels and a popular rest stop with an expansive swimming pool.But when interstate I-40 came along in the 1970s, it spelled disaster for Newberry. The newer, faster freeway was laid parallel to that stretch of Route 66, meaning that drivers would now fly right by the small town without ever noticing it.The development was a death knell for other tiny towns across the state – and throughout the country. The animated movieCarseven spotlighted the issue by creating the fictionalRadiator Springs: a forgotten town on Route 66 that withered away after it was bypassed by the interstate.Rose Beardshear, the chamber of commerce’s treasurer, said the film is bringing the plight of Route 66 to life for the younger generation. Beardshear was driving through the nearby town of Daggett with her granddaughter when the nine-year-old suddenly said: “This is like the movie with the cars.”View image in fullscreenA motel along the old Route 66 in New Mexico. The route runs from the California coast to Chicago.Photograph: Dukas/Universal/Getty ImagesBut the boom-and-bust cycle for Newberry didn’t end with the interstate.The indie film Bagdad Cafe, about a dilapidated desert cafe and a stranded German tourist who finds an unexpected community there, brought waves of international tourists to Newberry; the movie was a massive hit in France and Germany. When the pandemic halted tourism, especially from other countries, the real-life Bagdad Cafe shuttered. It only reopened again recently (without serving food), after the owner started a GoFundMe to make necessary repairs on the building.Part of Newberry’s appeal for visitors now is that it feels removed from the 21st century; the town looks “frozen in time”, Claus said. Still, there are lots of improvements to be made before the centennial.The road less travelled: don’t miss these quirky stops along the famed Route 66Read moreBeardshear, for one, is hoping to transform a short stretch of the route into a “musical highway”.If all goes according to plan with the county, grooves or markers would be added to the side of the road, creating vibrations that sound like a song when drivers pass over them.Kaminski, the owner of the town’s bar called The Barn, has plans to host monthly themed events in 2026, including car shows and live music, and to create a campground of vintage trailers for tourists who are passing through. The Barn is also a landmark in itself; it first opened in 1952 andis reportedly one of the oldest continually licensed bars on Route 66 inCalifornia.“I think Newberry really illustrates that whole mantra of ‘Mother Road’,” Kaminski said. “We will take you in and make sure you’re safe on Route 66.”Preserving a living museumWest of Newberry lies Daggett, the minuscule villagethatBeardshear’s granddaughter thought could be the set of Cars. Daggett has another claim to fame for a different generation: Steinbeck briefly mentioned it in The Grapes of Wrath.Today, at first glance the community looks neglected. Only a few hundred people live in the area, and crumbling or forgotten homes abound. But one man named Daryl Schendel, whoowns an auto repair shop in nearby Barstow and spends his nights and weekends on historical preservation projects, sees far beyond that.“It may look junky when you go through it, like a little has-been town,” he said recently, driving through its small collection of streets. “But people don’t realize the history that was here.”The town itself is like a living museum: there’s a blacksmith shop that dates back to the 1890s on one corner, another pioneer-era hotel still standing a block away. For years, Schendel and others have collected thousands of historical artifacts related to Daggett, from old journals to glass bottles to the actual clothes that nearby miners wore in the 19th century.View image in fullscreenRoute 66 put the tiny town of Newberry Springs on the map. Locals are trying to preserve that history.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/The GuardianMuch of that history has been out of public view as Schendeland a small team work together to organize everything. But the Route 66 centennial has motivated him to move faster on at least one project: reopening a historic welcome center for the anniversary caravans passing by Daggett, where some of the artifacts he has stockpiled will be on display like a museum exhibit. Schendel received aRoute 66-themed grantfrom the National Park Service last year to help make the project happen.“I’m imagining this being a major new thing happening on Route 66,” he said. “And it’ll open up so many doors to the history of the area.”Both Schendel and the women from Newberry want their towns to become more of a destination for Route 66 fans – but they also don’t want things to change too much.Visiting somewhere that feels completely off the grid, they say, is part of the charm.“I can’t imagine anyone wanting Newberry to change into some city,” Beardshear said. “We want to maintain our rural character.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then there’s artificial intelligence, which is about todevastatethe jobs market – or is about to createnew jobs.Amid all this change, what do we really know about the jobs market?Just the other week the Department of Labor said the economy added147,000 new jobsto the economy. So that seems encouraging? But the official figures are subject to revision – and big ones too. The labor department has said its own numbers wereoverstatedby as much as 818,000 during the first eight months of 2024.Born into crisis, gen Z is saving for retirement like no other generation | Gene MarksRead moreThe payroll giant ADP ismore in line withthe some pessimists on Wall Street, saying that the private economy shrank by 33,000 in June. But their competitor, Paychex,reportedthat small business employment – which represents about half of the country’s workers – has continued to “hold steady” throughout this year. Job openings “jumped” to asix-month highlast month. Does anyone know how the labor market is actually doing?No economist, no government agency, no academic that I know has yet figured out how many Americans are working or not. Why? Because it’s not just about jobs anymore. It’s about income. The “jobs” data we read isn’t relevant.Last week a report inFortuneintroduced us the concept of the “over-employed”. These are workers – many in the tech industry – that are holding down more than one job at a time, with some making as much as $3,000 per day working for multiple employers. But the over-employed trend goes beyond this.That’s because in the same week, new data from theBureau of Labor Statisticsrevealed what we already knew: workers working remotely were logging two hours less hours per day than their counterparts coming into the office. So what are they doing with this extra time? Maybe they’re watching Netflix. Others were generating more income for themselves doing other things, like starting their own businesses.According to new data from theCensus Bureau: almost 460,000 applications were filed for new businesses in June alone, a level almost twice the amount of the monthly average before the pandemic.We all know these “workers”. Some have multiple full-time jobs. Others have multiple part-time jobs. Many have multiple sources of income. They drive Ubers. They have Etsy shops. They’re selling used sneakers on eBay and working late shifts under the table at the local bar. They write programs. They work with data. They do it all! Are we taking all of these people into consideration when analyzing the “job market?”Some of the “over-employed” and really just underpaid and need the extra work to make ends meet, unfortunately. According to a newNerdWallet data, nearly two in five Americans are aiming to make more money this year and 10% have started a side business or second job just to cover basic necessities.Small business owners aren’t jumping for joy about the US economy – but they still aren’t jumping shipRead moreIn this increasingly complicated “jobs” market perhaps it is time for economists to stop evaluating the labor market in terms of jobs. This is quickly becoming obsolete. We need to measure income.How many people over the age of 18 in the US are earning more than, say $50,000 per year, taking into consideration all sources of income and inflation-adjusted? What percentage is that compared to the working-age population? How has that increased or decreased over time?Isn’t this more relevant than the numbers we’re getting now? And shouldn’t the numbers come from actual, real data and not from an unreliable Department of Labor survey that’s revised 10 times after it is initially published? Can’t we get this information from tax returns, social security and private sources such as Etsy, Amazon, eBay, ADP and Paychex? Can’t this be calculated and updated monthly and annually? Of course it can.Major economic policy decisions still hinge on the unemployment rate and jobs growth. Politicians get re-elected or ejected on this data. But in a job market that’s being shaken by AI, immigration and the rapid rise of side gigs, it’s time we rethought how we measure the health of the labor market.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Last year, the UK governmenttold consumersto dispose of any products containing the ingredient.“I am shocked by it, and I think we have a duty to protect European consumers,” McGrath told the Guardian.National consumer protection authorities send out rapid alerts across the EU warning of unsafe non-food products as part of a service, Safety Gate, which is also open to consumer complaints.Last year, Safety Gate received a record high of 4,137 alerts with more than a third relating to cosmetics, ahead of toys, electrical appliances, auto and chemical products.While consumer groups are concerned about safety, McGrath is also worried that the platforms,which have exploded in popularity in the last two years, are damaging local businesses through unfair competition.“The growth is extraordinary, and it has placed enormous pressure on the systems at member state level,” he said.“I am determined that we step up our enforcement of our product safety laws and our consumer protection rules. It’s not only about protecting consumers, but there is a very serious level playing field issue here for European businesses, because they are expected to compete with sellers who are not complying with our rules,” he said.“They are incurring significant costs in Europe to comply with our requirements, and they should not be expected to compete with those who are not doing the same.”EU figures show 12m low-value items a day coming into the bloc, amounting to 4.6bn consignments under €150 for 2024 – double that of 2023 and three times as many as 2022.Among the moves the EU is considering is an abolition of the €150 duty-free threshold and the introduction of a handling fee for each package which may deter low-value purchases and help pay the cost of extra customs investigations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

American buyers have had to pay an additional 30% tax or a minimum of $50 an item after 1 June this year.Also possible is the creation of a EU-wide customs authority to cope with the systemic issues.McGrath said it “remains to be seen” if the subject will be raised at an EU-China summit in Beijing on 25 July but he plans to address it directly himself.“It will certainly be engaging directly with Chinese authorities and we will visiting later on this year,” he said.Shein said it was investing $15m this year in compliance and safety initiatives including 2.5m product and safety quality tests and has partnerships with 15 testing centres, including operations in the UK, Germany. It said it had removed 500 vendors since the launch of its marketplace.A spokesperson said: “Earning and maintaining the trust of our consumers is paramount, and we are fully committed to ensuring the products we offer are safe and compliant.“All of our vendors are required to comply with Shein’s code of conduct and stringent safety standards, and must also abide by the relevant laws and regulations of the markets where we operate.”A Temu spokesperson said: “Temu takes product safety and compliance very seriously. We have a system of seller vetting, proactive monitoring and responsive takedowns to prevent, detect and remove unsafe products.“We work closely with globally recognised testing and certification organisations – including TÜV SÜD, Eurofins, SGS, and Bureau Veritas – to help ensure that the products offered by third-party sellers meet safety and quality standards.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEuropean UnionSheinEuropeChinaE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

Never remotely in doubt. It was Scottie Scheffler: why on earth would it be?Anybody hoping for a keenly contested Open Sunday was to be sorely disappointed. Make that 10 times Scheffler has held a 54-hole lead and 10 times he has converted.‘I don’t think I’m special’: Scheffler plays down latest major win after Open cruiseRead moreScheffler tugged his opening tee shot into the rough, triggering some sharp intakes of breath. The new champion’s next act was to fire an iron to within a foot of the cup. ­Scheffler enjoyed a sun‑kissed procession on the Dunluce Links. Had the R&A been so minded, it could have broken with tradition and handed over the Claret Jug on the 5th tee. By that point, he was seven strokes clear.Scheffler does not bother with major jousting. Direct combat? No thanks. He four-putted the 72nd green at Augusta National in 2022 andstill won by three. The 2024 Masters wasclaimed by four, the 2025 US PGA Championshipby five.This triumph was by a quartet of shots when in reality it felt like so much more. Late on Sunday afternoon, the Old Tom Morris record from 1862 – he saw off a distraught Willie Park by 13 shots at Prestwick – appeared to be under threat. Scheffler missed back-nine chance after back-nine chance when it barely mattered.A 68, Scheffler’s joint-highest score of the competition, meant 17 under par as an aggregate. His family surrounded him on the 18th green, in the latest reminder that the world No 1 does not particularly prioritise golf.His understated brilliance and shunning of the spotlight is intriguing. Scheffler recognises he is excellent at golf but he is unwilling to be defined by that.View image in fullscreenHarris English finished second overall but was unable to offer a real challenge to Scottie Scheffler for the Open title.Photograph: Pedro Salado/Getty ImagesThe record books will show Harris English finished second and he is due high praise. It is just that Scheffler’s imperious frontrunning distorted the tournament. English never had any prospect of winning. Chris Gotterup was not in the Open when arriving in North Berwick for its Scottish equivalent. Gotterupduly won therelast Sunday and reached 12 under par to secure third in Northern Ireland. What a wonderful sporting fairytale.Scheffler does not need help. He received some courtesy of the fact this was another benign Portrush occasion. With that, the capacity for huge errors was limited. Scoring was noticeably low across the field. ­Scheffler played his first five in three under. He whacked a bunker shot at the 8th into the face of the sand trap; a double bogey there was partly repaired with a straightforward birdie at the 9th. Those beneath him were scaling an ice wall in slippers. The R&A’s engraver could get to work long before Scheffler reached his 72nd hole. There was an inevitability about the outcome which could only raise parallels with peak Tiger Woods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It began with Oakmont Country Club informing members thatClark had been bannedfrom the premises after he inflicted grievous bodily harm on some lockersat the US Openlast month. ­Presumably others were ducking for cover as Clark shot a 76 on Thursday. His response, however, was admirable; Clark signed off with a 65 for 11 under and a fourth‑placed finish. He had Matt ­Fitzpatrick and Li Haotong for scoreboard company.Li made a fourth‑round 70 as ­Scheffler’s partner. “I asked if there is any time I can practise with him on thePGA Tour,” Li said. “He said yes. I said: ‘When I text you, you­better reply to me.’ He goes: ‘­Haotong who?’”Clark does sound genuinely remorseful about events at Oakmont. If he has a lingering gripe, it relates to his sanction from the club entering the public domain. “We were hoping it was going to be private,” Clark said. “I did something awful and I’m really sorry for it. Hopefully they have it in their heart to forgive me and maybe in the future I’ll be able to play there.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy received vocal backing from the crowd at Royal Portrush but said: ‘None of us could live with what Scottie [Scheffler] had this week.”Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianRory McIlroy had reached 10 under before a double bogey at the 10th. It seems incredible to think that his next round in a major will be the start of his Masters defence in April. The esteem he was held in by vast ­galleries over four competitive days in ­Portrush really was quite the sight and sound.McIlroy’s focus will now turn towards the Ryder Cup and hopes of a rare European win on American soil. He shared ­seventh in Northern Ireland with Xander ­Schauffele and Bob ­MacIntyre. “None of us could live with what Scottie had this week,” McIlroy said. “But for me to be in front of everyone here at home and to get that reception up the last, absolutely incredible. I’ll remember that for a long time.”Bryson DeChambeau blasted through the field to post a 64 and a nine-under aggregate. DeChambeau opened this major with a 78 and ended up finishing tied 10th. Insert joke about LIV golfers and 54-hole tournaments. Sergio García broke his driver on the 2nd hole in a fit of pique, rendering a 68 somewhat decent. He was asked post-round for his thoughts on the Ryder Cup in September, an event in which he is at present about as likely to feature as the aforementioned Old Tom.Scheffler will be there, ­having swept up half the year’s major crowns. Next year’s US Open – which concludes on Scheffler’s 30th ­birthday – will feature him ­attempting to complete a career grand slam.

Julian Alaphilippe, the former world road race champion, raised his arms in triumph in Carcassonne, thinking he had won, only to be told seconds later that he had in fact ­finished third behind two Belgians.Ahead of the crestfallen Alaphilippe, Tadej ­Pogacar’s Emirates-XRG teammate Tim Wellens took a solo win on stage 15 of the Tour, well ahead of compatriot Victor Campanaerts, a teammate to Jonas Vingegaard.“Julian’s radio wasn’t working,” Alaphilippe’s Tudor Pro team mana­ger, Raphael Meyer, said in an effort to explain his rider’s ecstatic but misplaced fist pump. A win from the French rider would have been all the more remarkable, given he had crashed earlier in the stage and popped back a dislocated shoulder, all on his own.View image in fullscreenJulian Alaphilippe’s radio had been damaged in a crash earlier on stage 15.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Vingegaard it was another stressful day on which his Visma-Lease a Bike team showed questionable strategy. They have one day good, the next bad, while Pogacar and his team remain a model of consistency.If Vingegaard’s team increasingly resemble a house on fire, Pogacar’s remains an impregnable fortress. In the shadow of Carcassonne’s citadel the 34-year-old Wellens, already a stage winner in the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España, took his first Tour de France stage win.The Dane had been caught up in the same early crash in which Alaphilippe came down. Inexpli­cably, as ­Vingegaard, second ­overall to Pogacar, chased to rejoin the peloton, some of his teammates, ­including Campanaerts, were at the front, forcing the pace and distancing their team leader.It took a radio intervention from Pogacar’s own team car to return the goodwill shown to the Slovenian in Toulouse, after his own crash on stage 11. Finally, with 128km to race, Vingegaard and Florian Lipowitz rejoined the main group.Even the defending champion seemed bemused by what was going on around him. “There were three Visma guys, all trying to go in the break again and they had Jonas ­chasing at the back,” Pogacar said. “It was just a weird situation.”While Pogacar was eventually able to repay the sportsmanship shown to him four days ago, Wellens was not in the mood to hang around and made his decisive solo move with 43km to race, on the Col de Fontbruno.The Belgian champion never looked back and pushed on into the final kilometres on the rolling roads of the Languedoc, to win by almost a minute and a half from Campanaerts.As the Tour began, Vingegaard’s wife and personal manager had criticised the Visma-Lease a Bike team for failing to commit wholeheartedly to her husband’s cause. On the road to Carcassonne, her fears seemed well-founded, with both Campanaerts and Wout van Aert apparently racing for the stage win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a big day for Belgium, with Belgians coming first and second.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/AP“I hope he gets the full support of the team, rather than there being all sorts of different goals,” Trine ­Vingegaard Hansen said this month. “If you’re also aiming for stage wins with other riders, then those resources can’t be used for Jonas. You can only respect how Tadej ­Pogacar’s team handles it. When he starts a race, there’s no doubt about who the leader is. Everyone knows their role. I think that’s super important.”Pogacar, meanwhile, despite ­saying after the stage he had a slight summer cold because of the fluctuating temperatures and too much time spent in air-conditioning, never looked in trouble.As Vingegaard was pondering his teammate’s motivations, Pogacar was becoming Wellens’s ­cheerleader-in-chief. “How is he looking?” he radioed his team car as Wellens progressed. “How does Tim look? You should reply: ‘He looks fabulous!’”Monday is a rest day, while the 16th stage on Tuesday takes the peloton from Montpellier to the daunting Mont Ventoux, where Pogacar will almost certainly seek to increase his lead with a prestigious stage win.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

I really do some crazy stuff. I’m aggressive. I’m hard. You can’t make me bow down. Somebody is going to have to surrender when I’m on the field. I don’t fear nobody, and that’s how it’s going to stay.”A statement on the Edna Karr Facebook page remembered Adams as “a friend, brother, son, student, and all around great young man.”Adams started attending Ole Miss in January as an early enrollee to gain experience before the college football season starts next month.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsMississippiUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them. Times are different now than they were three or four years ago.”Hours later, Trumpsaid in a separate postthat he would move to block the Commanders’plans to build a new stadiumat the old RFK Stadium site in Washington DC unless they changed their name. It is unclear if Trump would be able to do so. Although the RFK Stadium site was once on federal land, Joe Bidensigned a bill earlier this year– one of his final acts in office – transferring control to the DC city government for a 99-year term.Trump also posted that the call to change names applied to Cleveland’s baseball team, which he called “One of the six original baseball teams, with a storied past.”‘It’s a public health issue’: inside the fight to change Native American mascotsRead moreThe concept of an “original six” does not exist in baseball, though it does in ice hockey. The ClevelandMLBteam currently known as the Guardians began play in the late 1800s in a league with eight teams, before becoming one of the eight charter members of the modern American League in 1901. Like most baseball teams, the franchise has undergone numerous moves and moniker changes. Since arriving in Cleveland in 1900, the team was known as the Lakeshores (for one year), Bluebirds (in 1901), Broncos (in 1902), Naps (from 1903-1914), and Indians (from 1915-2021).The last of those names was one of several across the world of US sports to draw criticism from Native Americans and others, with Cleveland attracting additional attention forits use of the “Chief Wahoo” mascot. These critiques persisted for decades until a broader national reckoning over the role of race in US culture spurned changes: Clevelandwent from the Indians to the Guardians(named after art deco figures on a bridge near the team’s stadium), whileWashington changedfirst to the generic Washington Football team in 2020 and then to the Commanders in 2022.Washington’sNFLteam, under previous owner Daniel Snyder, refused to change their name for many years despite the criticism. The team was sold to billionaire Josh Harris in 2023. The Guardians were owned by Larry Dolan from 2000 until his death in 2025, when control passed to his son Paul.In his Truth Social post, Trump called on the team’s owners to “GET IT DONE!!!”That seems unlikely. Since taking control of the Commanders, Harris has said he has no intention of changing the team’s name again. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the Guardians’ president of baseball operations, Chris Antonetti, said his team will retain its current name.“We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago but obviously it’s a decision we made,” Antonetti said. “We’ve got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that’s in front of us.”Explore more on these topicsUS sportsNFLMLBCleveland GuardiansWashington CommandersBaseballTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The league’s players opted out of their last CBA in October, and are looking for a better revenue-sharing model, increased salaries, improved benefits and a softer salary cap.“I’m just so inspired by the amount of players that showed up, the engagement that was there,” WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said. “That’s really what it’s all about. Because the more that happens, the more that we’re going to be able to get things done. I think today we’re going to be able to use this conversation to start rolling the ball on things.”After the failed negotiations, many players said there was a large discrepancy between what they wanted and what the league was offering.

Loud screaming at inanimate items of electrical equipment.But as we approach the final week of this operatic Women’s European Championship, this tournament has a fair claim to be one of the most thrilling in recent memory. And not just on the more intangible metrics: noise, penalty drama, side-eye, flying saves, players singing unprompted into pitch-side microphones, quality of fan walks. With three matches remaining, Euro 2025 has surpassed Euro 2022 in terms of goals, averaging a staggering half a goal more (3.57 against 3.06).Berger stars in shootout as Germany overcome early red card to fell France at Euro 2025Read moreThis is on course to be the highest‑scoring European Championship in history, excluding the limited four-team mini-competitions that were held before 1997. Only two tournaments ago, Euro 2017 averaged just 2.19 goals per game. A 63% rise in goals constitutes a seismic and really quite sudden development in the sport, one that raises a few supplementary questions. Have attacks got better? Have defences got worse? And, you know, what if some of these players actually learned to take a penalty?Perhaps the key finding here is that possession is no guarantee of control. If you exclude blowouts such as England 6 Wales 1 and include only matches between teams of roughly comparable strength (say, within 10 places of each other in the Fifa world rankings) then the side enjoying more possession has won just six games out of 17. The Netherlands had more of the ball against France andwere demolished 5-2.Norway’s 2-1 win against Finlandwas secured with 41% of possession.Winning games without possession generally requires one of a few to be true: a preponderance of set-piece goals, a reliance on fast direct attacks or a knack of being able to burgle the ball in the final third. None of which appears to be a disproportionate factor here. Set-piece goals are down compared with three years ago. The number of “direct attacks”, as defined by Opta, is at a similar level.Pressing, meanwhile, remains a potent weapon in the women’s game, perhaps even more so than in the men’s, where elite teams are now much more adept at playing through pressure, perhaps even baiting the press to create space. But at this tournament the number of successful tackles in the final third is actually down 23%. There were 708 high turnovers at Euro 2022 and just 495 so far at Euro 2025. Mis-controls per game are down from 38.1 to 35.2, which suggests an overall rise in technical quality. So where, exactly, are all these extra goals coming from?View image in fullscreenThe Netherlands lost 5-2 against France despite having more possession.Photograph: Marcel ter Bals/MTB-Photo/ShutterstockDig a little deeper into the data, however, and a more revealing picture emerges. The number of high turnovers may have dropped sharply, but they have become vastly more efficient in generating goals (one in 33, compared with one in 54). The number of errors leading to a shot has more than doubled. All of which indicates that teams are becoming far more surgical, sophisticated and ruthless in their attacking tactics, targeting them in areas of the pitch, phases of the game and perhaps even particular opponents where they will have maximum value.Underpinning all this is perhaps the biggest shift in the past three years: the quality of finishing. The 87 non-penalty goals at Euro 2022 were scored from 98.4 expected goals (xG); the 92 non-penalty goals at Euro 2025 have been scored from an xG of just 84.4. Simply put, teams are getting better at converting from virtually all situations, and arguably better at identifying the situations best suited to their style.View image in fullscreenElla Toone follows up to score England’s second goal against Wales after her first shot was repelled.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockDirect one-on-one dribbling has been a particular speciality of France and Sweden, the only teams to generate more than 10% of their shots through this method. Italy have created more shots from dead balls than anyone else. And England remain the undisputed queens of penalty-area chaos, generating almost three shots per game from following up on shots that have just been taken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps the key lesson is that – heroic German rearguards aside – keeping it tight at the back is less important than being able to generate shots. England, Italy and Germany are only the sixth, seventh and eighth-best defences in this tournament. Italy have the fifth-lowest average possession, but compensate with their lightning speed of attack. Crossing remains an important tactic, with the eight quarter-finalists all in the tournament top 10 on this measure.In many ways, though, Spain are the unicorn team at this tournament, perhaps even the unicorn team in women’s football, the only side reliably able to pass their way out of trouble anywhere on the pitch. Spain aside, the teams who have gone far in this tournament are those who have been prepared to abandon the ground game, and go long or direct when necessary.And so increasingly this tournament is boiling down to a battle between two models: the passing game pioneered by Spain, and the more pragmatic style practised by everyone else. There may be many ways to entertain. But ultimately, there will only be one way to win.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamItaly women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

She struggled again ­during Thursday’s quarter-final­victory against Swedenand has now revealed the unacceptable ­vitriol she has been a victim of while on ­international duty.‘We’re never beaten’: Esme Morgan talks up England’s mental toughness at EurosRead more“From the start of the tournament I have experienced a lot of racial abuse,” the 27-year-old defender wrote on Instagram. “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race. As a result of this I will be taking a step back from social media and leaving it to a team to deal with.”Carter has received widespread support, most emphatically from her teammates. In a collective statement, the Lionesses said: “Representing our country is the greatest honour. It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated ­differently ­simply because of the colour of our skin. Until now, we have chosen to take the knee before matches. It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism. We have agreed as a squad to remain standing before kick‑off on Tuesday.”The statement added: “Those behind this online poison must be held accountable.”Lotte Wubben-Moy went further by announcing she was also ­coming off social media. In a statement, the Arsenal defender said: “Another tournament goes by where we see the same disgusting racist abuse. It is unacceptable for any person to be subject to this or any kind of abuse. The issue goes beyond sport. But what is being done about it? On the very platforms we post on? I will not continue to feed the very ­platform that enables abuse with no consequence.”Speaking about the Lionesses’ decision to stop taking the knee, Lucy Bronze said: “It was driven by the group – obviously certain individuals more than others. I think it was just the fact that we feel as a ­collective, is the message as strong as it used to be? Is the message really hitting hard? Because to us it feels like it’s not if these things are still ­happening to our players in the ­biggest ­tournaments of their lives.“It’s about putting another statement out there to say, you know, it’s something that still is a problem, it’s something that still needs to be put right. More needs to be done in football, more needs to be done in society, what that is right now as an individual, I don’t exactly know. But it’s something that we collectively as a team and as a federation want to work towards, we want to make changes. This is a small step trying to create another change.”View image in fullscreenJess Carter (front row, second right) lines up with her England teammates before their Euro 2025 quarter-final against Sweden.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe Football Association is ­working with authorities to track down those responsible for tar­geting Carter. The chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “As soon as we were made aware of the racist abuse Jess received, we immediately contacted UK police. They are in touch with the relevant social media platform, and we are working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice.“Regrettably, this is not the first time this has ­happened to an England player, so we had measures in place to allow us to respond quickly and where possible provide information to support any potential police action. We will continue to discuss with the rele­vant authorities and social media companies about what more can and should be done to prevent this abhorrent abuse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Gotham, we believe in a culture of mutual respect and remain committed to building a game – and a community – where everyone feels safe, respected and celebrated. There is no place for racism in our sport.”Carter, who was excellent in ­England’s4-0 group stage victoryagainst the Netherlands, went on to thank “genuine” England fans for their support, making clear her “focus is on helping the team any way I can” before their semi-final against Italy on Tuesday. “Hopefully, speaking out will make the people writing this abuse think twice so that others won’t have to deal with it,” she said.“We have made some historic changes with this Lionesses squad that I am so proud to be a part of and my hope is that by speaking out about this it will make another positive change for all.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballRaceOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

Sources at the Premier League champions say reports in Germany of a deal being agreed for a £69m fee are premature, although it is believed that the France Under-21s forward does favour a move to Anfield.In the crazed transfer trolley dash, the next glossy off-the-shelf solution is all the rage | Jonathan WilsonRead moreEkitike is expected to eventually join Liverpool as they look to overhaul their striking department, a situation further necessitated by thedeath of Diogo Jota this month.Luis Díaz could well depart from Merseyside, with Bayern Munich an interested party in the Colombia international, and Darwin Núñez is still very much for sale despite a move to Napoli the Uruguayan wanted having gone cold. Neither departure will be at a cut price.A deal for the 23-year-old Ekitike, who has an £86m release clause in his contract with Frankfurt, continues to be negotiated despite reports of Alexander Isak, in whom Liverpool are known to be interested, being unsettled at Newcastle. Eddie Howe left the Swede out of the squad that lost 4‑0 at Celtic in a pre‑season friendly on Saturday, with the manager admitting later it wasbecause of recent transfer speculation. Howe did go on to say, however, that he was “confident [Isak] will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window”.Liverpool are prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make Isak their new No 9 but the chances of them signing – or indeed being able to afford – the 25-year-old forward remain remote, hence the stepping up of their interest in Ekitike.Isak has also been linked with Arsenal, as previously was Ekitike, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions for Frankfurt last season.Liverpool have already signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez this summer, with Giorgi Mamardashvili linking up with the club after agreeing a move last August.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEintracht FrankfurtTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The former Tottenham full-back joins Graham Potter to continue the Hammers’ summer business, which has been slow going so far.“He was a big, big part of me making the decision,” Walker-Peters said of Potter. “I’ve always liked his style as a coach and I think it’s going to suit me best. He spoke about trying to make the club like a real family feel and that’s what I’m all about and I’d like to think I’m a good fit.”Liverpool continue talks over signing Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht FrankfurtRead moreWalker-Peters, who won two caps for England in 2022, spent five years at Southampton, enduring two relegations, and now joins a club whose other summer signings have been El Hadji Malick Diouf, a left-wing back from Slavia Prague, and the youngster Daniel Cummings from Celtic. Walker-Peters is likely to play on the right.Potter said: “He is a player I’ve always thought highly of and been impressed by whenever he has faced one of my teams. He has a really good pedigree, a top professional who has established himself as a respected Premier League player and still has his best years in front of him.”Meanwhile, Evan Ferguson, the Republic of Ireland striker, has travelled to Italy to complete a loan move from Brighton toRoma. On Sunday evening footage emerged of Ferguson being greeted by around a hundred fans at the airport after flying over in a private plane.Speaking from Las Palmas, where Brighton are preparing for a pre-season friendly with the Spanish club, the Albion manager, Fabian Hürzeler, said Ferguson still remains part of Brighton’s future plans. The aim of the season-long loan is to reboot a career affected by injuries and loss of form under Hürzeler and his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi.“For us it is always important the individual players have an environment where they can develop, we decided the loan was the best option for us,” said Hürzeler. “He is still a player of us, he still brings quality with him, he is a target player and I am sure when he gets more game time he will one day be back and be an important player for us.”In Italy, there had been reports a deal has been agreed for an initial loan with a €40m (£34.5m) option to buy. Ferguson spent half of last season on loan at West Ham, a disappointing spell during which he started just one match and failed to score for Potter, the manager who first blooded him at Brighton.

That finally arrived last month when theFrenchman took over at Loftus Roadfrom Martí Cifuentes, who hassince joined Leicester. But the chance to take a breather after six years as a manager during which he guided Rennes to the Champions League for the first time and led Strasbourg to sixth in Ligue 1 – their highest position since 1980 – was most welcome.‘Proud and excited’: QPR appoint Julien Stéphan as head coach after Cifuentes exitRead more“You need to take time for you and your family,” Stéphan says. “It’s important. But also you need to take time to watch different things, to analyse the game and different games in different leagues and analyse also what you did before and what you want to do after. It’s important to start to imagine how you can see the future.”QPR supporters will be hoping that, after a decade largely marooned in the bottom half of theChampionship, the club can bring back some glory days under Stéphan. The 44-year-old has heard the stories about QPR being London’s best team during the first Premier League season, when a side with Les Ferdinand as their star striker finished fifth in 1993. But Stéphan insists they must live in the present to have a chance of escaping what he describes as “probably the most difficult league in the world”.“I know the history ofQPR, but now we are in a different period,” he says. “It’s important to remember and to know the history, but it’s also important to live in the present and to build for the future. There is work to do with everybody, with the players, of course, with the management, with the CEO, with the owners, and also with the legends of the club. It’s the responsibility of everybody.”View image in fullscreenJulien Stéphan with Steve Cook in a pre-season match against Stevenage. ‘It’s important to live in the present and build for the future,’ he says.Photograph: Andrew Fosker/ShutterstockStéphan adds: “We know the expectations from the fans – we need to give everything on the pitch, and we need also to create a strong identity. It’s very important, and after that it’s football. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but you need to give everything.”Stéphan has been so busy since being appointed that he has not had time to move into his new flat near QPR’s home ground, let alone explore Shepherd’s Bush and the surrounding area. “Only work, work, work and work,” he says. “Just hotel and training ground and training sessions …”Stéphan is speaking from a pre-season camp in Girona that has allowed him and his staff, who include the former West Ham, Charlton and France midfielder Alou Diarra as an assistant, to get to know their players before their gruelling Championship season kicks off on 9 August. “It’s the beginning of the process and we need to build step by step all the ideas, the collective ideas and also the relationship between the players and the staff,” he says.Stéphan spent time as a player in Paris Saint-Germain’s academy but never made a top-flight appearance for his various clubs before he retired at 27 to concentrate on coaching. By then he had taken charge of Rennes’ under-19s for three years and been to university to studyStaps(Sciences et Techniques des Activités Physiques et Sportives), the route usually taken by French people who want to become sports teachers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And to be honest, at the beginning, I thought that I could do that all my career with the young players. And it was just after 12 or 15 years that I imagined the future differently. Of course, we speak together and he can give me some advice sometimes, but I also need to live my own experience.”The Rennes academy’s fabled production line in recent years includes Ousmane Dembélé, Eduardo Camavinga, Jérémy Doku and Desiré Doué – all of whom played under Stéphan, either for the youth sides or the first team, with whom he had two spells as manager, initially as an interim in 2018. He led Rennes to their first trophy for almost 50 years when theybeat PSG in the French Cup finala few months later. He knows QPR will find it hard to replicate that kind of production line given that they are competing with so many London clubs for the best talent, but Stéphan thinks there is one advantage they may have.“A strong point that we can say to families [of young players] is that it’s probably easier at 18 or 19 years old to play in the Championship than in the Premier League,” he says. “And the development of the player can also pass this way. So, yes, play in the Championship. After that, for the best of them, perhaps play in the Premier League. So we can develop this kind of thinking with the family.“But it’s difficult to compare the young players of the academy at QPR with these kinds of players: Ousmane Dembélé, Eduardo Camavinga, Desiré Doué. They’re top, top, top, top, top players. Most important is to create the opportunity for the best of them in the academy to have the possibility to train with the professionals and for the best of them also to play in the first team.”Explore more on these topicsQPRChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Gupta, who joined the ICC this month from the Indian broadcaster JioStar, will chair the working party, which also features the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, Richard Gould, and the Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive, Todd Greenberg.The Guardian view on Test cricket: slow-burning intensity can deliver the finest sporting pleasures | EditorialRead moreThe two-division concept first emerged from meetings between CA and the ECB during the women’s Ashes last January. CA, in particular, is a major advocate and has pushed a model that would involve Australia, England and India playing against each other twice every three years rather than the current setup of two series in four years. Although this would appeal to broadcasters and be hugely lucrative, the ECB is understood to have reservations about scheduling more Test series between the so-called big three, as it would further entrench their huge financial advantage over other international sides.The presence of Gupta, Gould and Greenberg on the working group suggests there is a strong possibility the two-division model will be adopted, although the devil will be in the detail of their findings.With such a significant change requiring the support of a two-thirds majority of the ICC’s 12 full members, the biggest challenge will be to agree on a system of promotion and relegation between the two divisions to prevent the smaller nations being cut adrift. An increased package of financial support for countries starting in division two may also be required. Under the current ICC Test rankings, the world Test champions, South Africa, plus New Zealand and Sri Lanka would join the big three in division one, with Ireland, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh in line to be admitted to the World Test Championship for the first time to join Pakistan, West Indies and Zimbabwe in division two.This development came as the ICC announced in Singapore that England will stage the next three World Test Championship finals. The first three showpieces have been held in England, most recently last month at Lord’s, as South Africa were crowned champions for the first time by defeating the holders, Australia.The ICC also discussed creating a new Twenty20 Champions League or World Club Championship that would feature franchises from the Indian Premier League, the Hundred and the Big Bash, but no formal proposal was tabled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ICC has expressed interest in running its own version, but it would be a complex undertaking, not least as many of the IPL owners have bought franchises in other countries including South Africa’s SA20, Major League Cricket in the and ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates. The owners of Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad are also in the process of buying into four Hundred franchises.Some of the world’s top T20 players represent as many as four or five franchises each year, so determining whom they would represent would not be straightforward, with 2027 seen as the most likely start date for a new global tournament as that coincides with the end of the ICC’s $3bn (£2.25bn) Indian TV deal with Disney Star.Explore more on these topicsInternational Cricket CouncilWorld Test ChampionshipCricketSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Andy Farrell has called up Scotland’s Gregor Brown to bolster his second‑row ranks as a result, taking an already bloated squad to 45 players.McCarthy was taken off after 43 minutes of theLions’ 27-19 victory against Australiain Brisbane on Saturday and Farrell confirmed his early withdrawal was enforced. “It’s plantar fasciitis,” the head coach said. “It was niggling away at him there. We got him off. Hopefully we got him off in time.”Brown becomes the latest addition to the squad after Scotland’s victory against Samoa in Auckland on Friday and was due to arrive in Melbourne on Sunday along with his compatriots Ewan Ashman and Rory Sutherland. With Darcy Graham having already arrived in camp, there are now 12 Scots in the squad. Owen Farrell, Jamie George, Thomas Clarkson and Jamie Osborne have previously been called up. Farrell is determined to rest his frontline stars for the game against the First Nations & Pasifika XV on Tuesday.In the first Test win, Farrell’s pack set the tone for the touring side, overpowering the Wallabies in a first-half onslaught. But he may be forced into a reshuffle in Melbourne. “I thought we got the start really right, especially the forward pack,” Lions inside-centre Sione Tuipulotu said. “The way they were knocking them back in the first 10 minutes sucked the life out of the Wallabies. Credit mainly to the forward pack, the way they started that game and really nipped them in the bud.”Farrell was quick to warn his players to beware of wounded Wallabies this week, referring to the 2013 tour when the Lions won the opener in Brisbane before Australia levelled the series in Melbourne. Joe Schmidt is confident that his side will be bolstered by the ball-carrying power of Rob Valetini, who is fit again after a calf problem.View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell practises his kicking before the first Test against the Wallabies.Photograph: Patrick Hamilton/AFP/Getty ImagesTuipulotu is only too aware of the threats he poses. “I grew up with Rob Valetini, I know what he brings to the team,” he said. “Guys like Will Skelton, if they come off the injury list they’ll definitely add. But they’re all things that we need to prepare for. I thought we were pretty dominant but the good thing for us is that it was nowhere near our best performance. We’ve still got a lot to work on.“They have to be [desperate], don’t they? Of course we expect that but I think the most important thing is we expect them to be desperate but not more desperate than us because we’re trying to close out a series next Saturday.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With every word and exaltation there was also a sense that golf’s Overton window had shifted, with his peers daring to voice opinions previously beyond the pale.It was Xander Schauffele who perhaps said it best, as Scheffler was slow‑walking up the 18th, as if trying to savour every second ofa first Open Championship victory.“I don’t think we thought the golfing world would see someone as dominant as Tiger [Woods] come through so soon, and here’s Scottie sort of taking that throne of dominance,” said Schauffele, the 2024 champion, having finished seven shots back. “You can’t even say he’s on a run. He’s just been killing it for over two years now. He’s a tough man to beat, and when you see his name up on the leaderboard it sucks for us.”This Open belonged to Rory McIlroy, even if he wasn’t the winner this time | Andy BullRead moreScheffler is making a habit of this. This was his fourth major title in three years. For good measure, he has 17PGA Tourwins over the same period. The majority of them have been like this, a four‑shot victory margin from Harris English that rarely looked in doubt.Rory McIlroy was another player who had hoped for a miracle on Sunday only to see golf’s ultimate dementor had sucked his hopes with three early birdies. After that the result was not in doubt, with Scheffler easing to victory at 17 under par.“In a historical context, you could argue that there’s only maybe two or three players in the history of the game that have been on a run like the one that Scottie’s been on for the last 24 to 36 months,” said McIlroy, who finished tied for seventh on 10 under.“It’s incredibly impressive. He just goes about his business. Doesn’t do anything overly flamboyant, but he’s the best at executing in the game. All you can do is tip your cap and watch in admiration.”We are clearly in Scheffler’s imperial phase, where the victories appear preordained and no superlative seems outlandish. The only question now is how many majors he may win. Double figures does not seem outlandish. Which would put him behind only Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Walter Hagen.Tommy Fleetwood certainly believes he can do it. “If he keeps going the way he is, we’re all going to look back and talk about him in the same breath as some of the all-time greats,” he said. “And he’s played in our generation.”View image in fullscreenShane Lowry (right) partnered Scottie Scheffler on the first two days and said he thought the world No 1 was ‘going to birdie every hole’.Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesNot so long ago, such comments would have seemed premature. Now they are accepted wisdom. Scheffler’s temperament is something special. Little seems to faze him. He plays golf like someone who has had their adrenal glands removed. Not that he sounded that way afterwards.“Every day is a battle, it is a battle with yourself all the time,” Scheffler said. It certainly didn’t look that way as he decimated a quality field.Shane Lowry, who won at Portrush in 2019, was another player to evoke comparisons with Woods. But in his view the ungainliness of Scheffler’s drive, which often results in him losing his balance as his ball flies 300 yards down the fairway, has taken people off the scent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think he’s just incredible to watch, and his bad shots are really good. That’s when you know he’s really good.”If Scheffler had not been in Portrush, this would have been a thrilling final day. On Sunday morning, there were 11 players within four shots of China’s Li Haotong in second place on 10 under. The problem? Scheffler was on 14 under.Any hopes of a Devon Loch-style shock were soon extinguished. On the first hole, Li hit his approach to within six feet. Scheffler’s response? To play it within three feet and record a birdie.In truth, it was the most sedate Open final day in nearly a generation. Scheffler had won his last nine tournaments after having led after 54 holes. He wasn’t going to lose from here.At the 4th hole someone shouted: “What’s the point, Scottie?” – a reference to his press conference from earlier in the week. A few minutes later he had made his point with a birdie and followed it up with another on the 5th. True, there was a minor wobble at the next three holes – with two long par saves followed by a double-bogey six at the 8th. But the result was never in doubt.As Bryson DeChambeau put it: “Scottie’s in a league of his own right now. I played with him a lot in college, and he was not that good, so he’s figured out a lot of stuff since then. It’s really impressive to see and something we can all learn from for sure.”The bad news for the rest? Scheffler is only 29. He knows how to play links golf now and he clearly wants titles. As gave his victory speech, his 14‑month‑old son, Bennett, was swinging a plastic golf club just off the 18th green before the Claret Jug. He looked a natural. Just like his father.Explore more on these topicsScottie SchefflerThe OpenEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Do I enjoy it? Oh my gosh yes, this is a cool feeling. I can’t wait to get home and celebrate this championship with the people that have helped me along the way. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t fulfil the deepest desires of my heart. I don’t know why I’m so lucky that I get to live out my dreams, but it’s something I’m very grateful for.“If somebody was going to listen to the comments I had this week, I would encourage them to listen to all of it, and I hope I did a good job communicating that this is amazing to win the Open Championship. But at the end of the day, having success in life, whether it be in golf, work, whatever it is, that’s not what fulfils the deepest desires of your heart.”Pressed by reporters, Scheffler said: “Just because you win a golf tournament or accomplish something, it doesn’t make you happy. It doesn’t – maybe for a few moments, maybe for a few days, but at the end of the day, there’s more to life than playing golf. I’m pretty excited to go home and celebrate this one.”Scheffler also played down comparisons with Tiger Woods. “I still think they’re a bit silly. Tiger won, what, 15 majors? This is my fourth. I just got one-fourth of the way there. I think Tiger stands alone in the game of golf. He was inspirational for me growing up. He was a very, very talented guy, and he was a special person to be able to be as good as he was at the game of golf.”Scheffler, who lifted the Claret Jug with one arm while holding his 14‑month‑old son Bennett, also revealed that his love of golf was already being passed down to his offspring. “It’s very cool to have him here,” Scheffler said. “He obviously has no clue what’s going on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The R&A did its best to funnel the paying spectators in the other direction as they walked off the course, but there were still plenty of bewildered golf fans who got caught up in it all. I was one of them myself. While I wouldn’t want to contradict the organisers’ description of it as a “cultural extravaganza”, if I had one note to pass on it may be that these sorts of local folk traditions go over better with the tourists when they don’t have sectarian overtones and a heavy police presence.On the links, there was a different side of Ireland on show. Northern Irish or from the Republic, Nationalist or Unionist, Catholic or Protestant, whatever else divides the 300,000-odd people who attended in the past week, they were all united in collective yearning to seeRory McIlroymake that next birdie.Scottie Scheffler claims Open Championship with majestic four-shot winRead moreThey were packed four, five, six deep when McIlroy walked out for his final round at two in the afternoon, the crowd stretched all down the fairway and around the green. There must have been 10,000 people at that one hole, every one of them joined in a silent communion as he lined up his opening drive. You’ve heard how much people here love McIlroy, you’ve read how much people here love McIlroy, and you’ve seen how much people here love McIlroy, but in all honesty you can’t really understand the strength of their feeling until you’ve walked the course with him. Just ask his playing partner, Matt Fitzpatrick. “I’ve heard enough ‘Rorys’ to last me a lifetime.”And the rest. “I love you, Rory,” screamed a girl on the 2nd. “I named my eldest child after you, Rory,” shouted a man on the 5th. There were a hundred or so people up top on the great big dune that backs on to the beach by the 7th tee, waiting all day to get a free peek at him as he came past.This has been McIlroy’s Open and he didn’t even win the thing. The two were tied inextricably in the minds of everyone in the country who was following the tournament, so the first thing anyone wants to know whenever you mention you’re at the Open is whether or not you saw Rory, and the next thing anyone says whenever the competition comes up in conversation is whether he’s in contention. He was playing in the penultimate group, but you would never have guessed it from the way the crowd swelled around him. They surged from one hole to the next to keep up with him, so that behind him Scottie Scheffler often arrived at the green in time to find everyone turning away.View image in fullscreenMatt Fitzpatrick, Rory McIlroy’s playing partner, said he heard enough shouts of ‘Rory’ to ‘last a lifetime’.Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/R&A/Getty ImagesAll those hours in the gym mean McIlroy’s got broad shoulders, but it’s a hell of a weight he’s carrying. It was too much for him the first time he played in an Open at Portrush, in 2019, but it has been a joy to see him revel in it in the past week. He seems to have enjoyed every minute of playing here. “I think I feel a lot of gratitude and a lot of pride,” he said. “A lot of pride that I am from these shores, and with the way I’ve played and advocated for this little country.”It was clear as early as the 1st green that it wasn’t going to be his day. You could even say it was obvious as early as Friday evening, when Scheffler shot to the top of the leaderboard. The man has a way of making the game inevitable once he’s in that position. Death, taxes and Scheffler making the most of a winning position. It would have taken something magical to catch the world No 1 and, well as he was playing, McIlroy just didn’t have his conjuring touch. It was a round of nearlys and not quites, from the 40ft birdie putt that just stayed up on the 1st, to the 34ft birdie putt that passed only a millimetre wide on the 7th.He was honest enough to admit that he was never going to get to the 17 under he would have needed to catch Scheffler. He wound up in seventh, 10 under and seven shots back: “8, 9, and 10 were the ones that killed me. I could have maybe finished second, which would have been better, but only making par off those tee shots on 8 and 9 and then the double bogey at 10 did me in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He out-threw, out-landed and out-hustled a champion 16 years his junior for long stretches on Saturday night in Las Vegas, but the scorecards told a different story.Pacquiao’s spirited return to the ring after a four-year layoff ended in a majority draw against Mario Barrios when the WBC welterweight titleholder won the final three rounds on all three scorecards. One ringside judge handed down a 115–113 verdict for Barrios, while the other two had it 114–114, allowing the 30-year-old Texan to retain his belt by the narrowest of margins. (The Guardian scored it115-113 for Pacquiao.)“I thought I won the fight,” Pacquiao said afterward. “It was a close fight. My opponent was very tough. It was a wonderful fight.”The result was met with lusty boos from a pro-Pacquiao crowd of 13,107 inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena, which had spent much of the evening roaring their support for the 46-year-old from the Philippines. And for much of the bout, it looked like they were about to witness boxing’s only eight-division world champion make history yet again.View image in fullscreenMario Barrios, left, fights Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in Las Vegas.Photograph: John Locher/APFrom the opening round Pacquiao fought with surprising urgency, using angles and volume punching and his signature hand speed to offset Barrios’ height, youth and four-inch reach advantage. He won the first frame behind a flurry of jabs and straight lefts, sparking loud cheers with every landed punch.Manny Pacquiao v Mario Barrios: WBC welterweight championship – live reactionRead moreThough Barrios began to find a home for his jab and counter right hands in the second, Pacquiao resumed control in the third with a sharper rhythm and faster hands, dictating the pace of the action. He buzzed Barrios in the sixth with a snapping left hand, then again moments later with another lead shot that caught the champion square. “His stamina, he could still crack,” Barrios said. “He’s still strong as hell. His timing, his rhythm, everything. He was still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.”Pacquiao’s performance, particularly in rounds six through nine, had the feeling of a time warp. He zipped in and out of range with fluid footwork and mixed in combination like a man half his age. By the end of the 10th, Pacquiao appeared to be well ahead on the scorecards. Even Barrios seemed to acknowledge he had to dig deep to close the gap. “Not necessarily that it was getting away from me,” Barrios said. “I just knew I had to try to step it up to really solidify a win.”To his credit, Barrios did just that. He clearly won the 11th, landing his best combination of the night and forcing Pacquiao into a rare sequence of retreat. In the 12th, he kept the tempo high, trading shots and finishing strong – just enough to sweep the final three rounds on all three official cards and retain the WBC’s version of the title at 147lb. “I thought I still pulled it out,” Barrios said. “But I still tip my hat to Manny. It was an absolute honor to share the ring with him, somebody with so much experience who has accomplished so much in this sport. We left everything in the ring. Nothing but love and respect.”The fight marked Pacquiao’s first sincehis unanimous-decision loss to Yordenis Ugásin 2021. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame last month, and few expected him to compete again at this level, much less push a reigning titleholder to the brink. “I’m more experienced,” Pacquiao said. “I’m a more tactical fighter than before. I’m not as careless as I was when I was young. Now I’m more careful.”View image in fullscreenMario Barrios, right, lands a shot to Manny Pacquiao’s body on Saturday night.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesThat maturity showed in his measured footwork, selective bursts and veteran nous, including moments where he appeared to be refereeing the fight himself. But even Pacquiao admitted his comeback camp had been rushed. “I only had two months training,” he said. “What I need to do is continue my training. In a championship fight like this, I should train four months, [or at least] three months and a half. But because of the election in the Philippines, I started late. But it’s OK. I love the Filipino people, and I love to give honor to my country.”Pacquiao, whose professional record now stands at 62–9–3 with 39 knockouts, said he would “absolutely” consider fighting again and made it clear he wants a rematch. “Yes, of course,” he said. “That’s the only legacy that I can leave behind. To give inspiration to the Filipino people and to be proud wherever you are.”Barrios, whose ledger moves to 29–2–2 after a second straight draw, seemed open to the idea. “Absolutely. This was huge for boxing,” he said. “What me and him were able to bring here today, I would love to do it again.”Four decades on from his professional debut, Pacquiao once again proved that age is just a number and that greatness, even in a draw, still carries the power to inspire. “It’s an inspiration to old boxers,” Pacquiao said. “If you have discipline and hard work, you can still fight. I’m so thankful to God, because without God, Manny Pacquiao is not here. God is the source of all the strength and good health that I have right now.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingManny PacquiaoUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, in Tehran a solitary woman feeds stray cats amid rubble from recent Israeli airstrikes.To the uninitiated viewer, this could be a cinematic retelling of a geopolitical crisis that unfolded barely weeks ago – hastily shot on location, somewhere in the Middle East.However, despite its polished production look, it wasn’t shot anywhere, there is no location, and the woman feeding stray cats is no actor – she doesn’t exist.LiveMidnight Drop, an AI film depicting US-Israeli bombings in IranThe engrossing footage is the “rough cut” of a 12-minute short film about last month’s US attack on Iranian nuclear sites, made by the directors Samir Mallal and Bouha Kazmi. It is also made entirely by artificial intelligence.The clip is based on a detail the film-makers read in news coverage of the US bombings – a woman who walked the empty streets of Tehran feeding stray cats. Armed with the information, they have been able to make a sequence that looks as if it could have been created by a Hollywood director.The impressive speed and, for some, worrying ease with which films of this kind can be made has not been lost on broadcasting experts.Last week Richard Osman, the TV producer and bestselling author, said that an era of entertainment industry history had ended and a new one had begun – all because Google has released a new AI video making tool used by Mallal and others.View image in fullscreenA still from Midnight Drop, showing the woman who feeds stray cats in Tehran in the dead of night.Photograph: Oneday Studios“So I saw this thing and I thought, ‘well, OK that’s the end of one part of entertainment history and the beginning of another’,” he said on The Rest is Entertainment podcast.Osman added: “TikTok, ads, trailers – anything like that – I will say will be majority AI-assisted by 2027.”For Mallal, an award-winning London-based documentary maker who has made adverts for Samsung and Coca-Cola, AI has provided him with a new format – “cinematic news”.The Tehran film, called Midnight Drop, is a follow-up to Spiders in the Sky, a recreation of a Ukrainian drone attack onRussian bombers in June.Within two weeks, Mallal, who directed Spiders in the Sky on his own, was able to make a film about the Ukraine attack that would have cost millions – and would have taken at least two years including development – to make pre-AI.“Using AI, it should be possible to make things that we’ve never seen before,” he said. “We’ve never seen a cinematic news piece before turned around in two weeks. We’ve never seen a thriller based on the news made in two weeks.”Spiders in the Sky was largely made with Veo3, an AI video generation model developed by Google, and other AI tools. The voiceover, script and music were not created by AI, although ChatGPT helped Mallal edit a lengthy interview with a drone operator that formed the film’s narrative spine.LiveFilm-maker recreates Ukrainian drone attack on Russia using AI in Spiders in the SkyGoogle’s film-making tool, Flow,is powered by Veo3. It also creates speech, sound effects and background noise. Since its release in May, the impact of the tool on YouTube – also owned by Google – and social media in generalhas been marked. As Marina Hyde, Osman’s podcast partner, said last week: “The proliferation is extraordinary.”Quite a lot of it is “slop” – the term for AI-generated nonsense – although theOlympic diving dogs have a compelling quality.Mallal and Kazmi aim to complete the film, which will intercut the Iranian’s story with the stealth bomber mission and will be six times the length of Spider’s two minutes, in August. It is being made by a mix of models including Veo3,OpenAI’s Soraand Midjourney.“I’m trying to prove a point,” says Mallal. “Which is that you can make really good stuff at a high level – but fast, at the speed of culture. Hollywood, especially, moves incredibly slowly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have the best bad ideas faster. But the process is accelerated with AI.”Mallal and Kazmi also recently madeAtlas, Interrupted, a short film about the3I/Atlas comet, another recent news event, that has appeared on the BBC.David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI – the term for tools such as chatbots and video generators – to create marketing campaigns, says the advertising world is about to undergo a revolution due to models such as Veo3.“Today, less than 1% of all brand content is created using gen AI. It will be 100% that is fully or partly created using gen AI,” he says.Netflix also revealed last week thatit used AI in one of its TV showsfor the first time.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian drone homes in on its target in Spiders in the Sky.Photograph: Oneday StudiosHowever, in the background of this latest surge in AI-spurred creativity lies the issue of copyright. In the UK, the creative industries are furious about government proposals to let models be trained on copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless the owner opts out of the process.Mallal says he wants to see a “broadly accessible and easy-to-use programme where artists are compensated for their work”.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer andleading campaigner against the government proposals, says AI film-making tools are “fantastic” but “at what point are they going to realise that these tools are literally built on the work of creators?” She adds: “Creators need equity in the new system or we lose something precious.”YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models – and denies that all of YouTube’s inventory has been used to train its models.Mallal calls his use of AI to make films “prompt craft”, a phrase that uses the term for giving instructions to AI systems. When making the Ukraine film, he says he was amazed at how quickly a camera angle or lighting tone could be adjusted with a few taps on a keyboard.“I’m deep into AI. I’ve learned how to prompt engineer. I’ve learned how to translate my skills as a director into prompting. But I’ve never produced anything creative from that. Then Veo3 comes out, and I said, ‘OK, finally, we’re here.’”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

But his story was crafted to cushion uneaseSun 20 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.01 EDTShareWe’ve entered the era of the superhero movie as sermon. No longer content with saving the world, spandex saviors are now being used to explain, moralize and therapize it. And a being from Krypton has shown up once again in a debate about real life; about borders, race and who gets to belong.Superman. Of all symbols.I’ve read reactionary thinkpieces, rage-filled quote tweets and screeds about the legal status of a fictional alien – enough to lose count. This particular episode of American Fragility kicked off because James Gunn had the audacity to call Superman “the story of America”. An immigrant, by definition, as he was always meant to be.What set things off wasn’t just the sentiment – it was who said it, and how plainly. Gunn, now headlining DC’s cinematic future, told the Sunday Times that Superman was “an immigrant who came from other places and populated the country”. He spoke of Superman’s inherent kindness as a political statement in itself, noting that the film would play differently in some parts of America before adding, bluntly, that “there are some jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness”. “But screw them,” he added. It was that line – less the immigrant metaphor, more the unapologetic framing – that sent the usual outrage machine into motion.Enter Dean Cain, a former TV Superman. Cain accused Gunn of politicizing the character, which is remarkably foolish, considering Superman’s been swatting at fascism since 1941. Meanwhile, over at Fox News, it’sbeen a full meltdownover the idea that Superman, canonically not of this Earth, might be played as … not of this Earth. Liberal brainwashing, they suggested. Identity politics in a cape.Superman: identity crises, fascist space holograms and a super furry animal – discuss with spoilersRead moreBut have they actually looked at David Corenswet? The man looks like he was made to sell oat milk in a Ralph Lauren ad. All cheekbones and cleft chin. If this is the foreign body in question, no wonder middle America has historically shrugged over Supes being an immigrant by definition.Even still, there’s something telling about any collective gasp over a white, blue-eyed man with an immigrant backstory. The scramble to defend him says more than intended. For all the hand-wringing over Superman’s alienness, what rarely gets named is how meticulously his story was crafted to cushion the unease of the topic at hand: otherness itself – the very thing people pretend was always central to his character.There are plenty of ways to frame the ridiculousness of this argument, clever ways to connect the dots, but the real fracture in Superman’s myth hits, oddly enough, during a quiet scene in Tarantino’s meditation on vengeance, Kill Bill: Vol. 2.In the scene, the villain, Bill (David Carradine) unpacks what makes Superman different from every other hero.“What Kent wears – the glasses, the business suit – that’s the costume,” Bill says. “That’s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us.”It’s one hell of a tell – the kind of observation that pulls back the curtain on how Superman was engineered to understand the world, and how the world, in turn, reinforced how he should fit within it.From the start, Superman was never meant to be an outsider. His creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster – sons of Jewish immigrants – didn’t craft him as a symbol of difference but as a projection of pure Americanness. They gave him a midwestern upbringing, an Anglo name in Clark Kent, and that square-jawed charm.Siegel and Shuster were working against the backdrop of unchecked antisemitism, at a time when Jewish immigrants faced hostility. But instead of exploring immigrant “otherness”, the artists imagined a version of America where that alienness could be easily discarded via an outfit change. Superman wasn’t an outsider – he was the ideal immigrant, effortlessly slipping into a world that required no resistance. His story wasn’t about struggling to belong, but about the fantasy of belonging, with the privilege of choosing whether or not to fight for it.That projection of safe, silent Americanness hasn’t remained confined to the pages of comic books. Today’s immigration politics run on the same fantasy. The myth of the “good” immigrant – quiet, grateful, easy to assimilate – still runs wild. It’s the same story that fuels the strange spectacle of politicians praising white South African farmers as victims of racial persecution, all while demonizing migrants from Latin America, the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa.The notion of who deserves to stay has always been racialized, selective and violent. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said that aperson’s physical appearancecould be a factor in the decision to question them. He later said it could not be“the sole reason”. But in April, Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a US-born citizen from Georgia, wasdetained in Floridaeven after his mother showed authorities his birth certificate. In New York, Elzon Lemus, an electrician, was stopped because he “looked like someone” agents were after. Maybe he didn’t wear his suit and glasses that day.Superman, the immigrant who makes people comfortable, has never been just a comic book character. He’s been a metaphor and living testament to the kind of “other” that wealthy nations have always preferred: those who blend in, assimilate and rarely challenge the systems that demand their silence.If you’re still not convinced that Superman’s assimilationist fantasy is alive and well, just look at a White House meme from 10 July 2025: Trump dressed as Superman, with the words ‘Truth. Justice. The American Way.’ It’s a glaring example of how cultural symbols are repurposed – hijacked, really – to serve a narrow and self-congratulatory vision of America. That’s the trick of Superman: he’s been a blank canvas of a both-sides heroism, which makes everyone feel seen.You don’t even need to like or dislike Superman for the Maga debate to pull you in, as it was always meant to. The culture war still appointed a celebrity to govern the most powerful nation on Earth. It still turned a corporate diversity initiative into a national crisis. And it took a serious conversation about immigration and made a polished, all-American character its face. The culture war distorts, and it continues, relentless as ever.Noel Ransome is a Toronto-based freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSupermanOpinionMigrationUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

And then there’s artificial intelligence, which is about todevastatethe jobs market – or is about to createnew jobs.Amid all this change, what do we really know about the jobs market?Just the other week the Department of Labor said the economy added147,000 new jobsto the economy. So that seems encouraging? But the official figures are subject to revision – and big ones too. The labor department has said its own numbers wereoverstatedby as much as 818,000 during the first eight months of 2024.Born into crisis, gen Z is saving for retirement like no other generation | Gene MarksRead moreThe payroll giant ADP ismore in line withthe some pessimists on Wall Street, saying that the private economy shrank by 33,000 in June. But their competitor, Paychex,reportedthat small business employment – which represents about half of the country’s workers – has continued to “hold steady” throughout this year. Job openings “jumped” to asix-month highlast month. Does anyone know how the labor market is actually doing?No economist, no government agency, no academic that I know has yet figured out how many Americans are working or not. Why? Because it’s not just about jobs anymore. It’s about income. The “jobs” data we read isn’t relevant.Last week a report inFortuneintroduced us the concept of the “over-employed”. These are workers – many in the tech industry – that are holding down more than one job at a time, with some making as much as $3,000 per day working for multiple employers. But the over-employed trend goes beyond this.That’s because in the same week, new data from theBureau of Labor Statisticsrevealed what we already knew: workers working remotely were logging two hours less hours per day than their counterparts coming into the office. So what are they doing with this extra time? Maybe they’re watching Netflix. Others were generating more income for themselves doing other things, like starting their own businesses.According to new data from theCensus Bureau: almost 460,000 applications were filed for new businesses in June alone, a level almost twice the amount of the monthly average before the pandemic.We all know these “workers”. Some have multiple full-time jobs. Others have multiple part-time jobs. Many have multiple sources of income. They drive Ubers. They have Etsy shops. They’re selling used sneakers on eBay and working late shifts under the table at the local bar. They write programs. They work with data. They do it all! Are we taking all of these people into consideration when analyzing the “job market?”Some of the “over-employed” and really just underpaid and need the extra work to make ends meet, unfortunately. According to a newNerdWallet data, nearly two in five Americans are aiming to make more money this year and 10% have started a side business or second job just to cover basic necessities.Small business owners aren’t jumping for joy about the US economy – but they still aren’t jumping shipRead moreIn this increasingly complicated “jobs” market perhaps it is time for economists to stop evaluating the labor market in terms of jobs. This is quickly becoming obsolete. We need to measure income.How many people over the age of 18 in the US are earning more than, say $50,000 per year, taking into consideration all sources of income and inflation-adjusted? What percentage is that compared to the working-age population? How has that increased or decreased over time?Isn’t this more relevant than the numbers we’re getting now? And shouldn’t the numbers come from actual, real data and not from an unreliable Department of Labor survey that’s revised 10 times after it is initially published? Can’t we get this information from tax returns, social security and private sources such as Etsy, Amazon, eBay, ADP and Paychex? Can’t this be calculated and updated monthly and annually? Of course it can.Major economic policy decisions still hinge on the unemployment rate and jobs growth. Politicians get re-elected or ejected on this data. But in a job market that’s being shaken by AI, immigration and the rapid rise of side gigs, it’s time we rethought how we measure the health of the labor market.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

They (and I) have spent too much time simply denouncing or pathologizing him and far too little time learning from him.And there is a lot to learn.Not since the middle of the twentieth century, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt led a constitutional revolution,has any president achieved so much of his agenda in so short a time. But to recognize Trump’s political genius is not to say that it has been put to good use or that he has been a good president.Like others whosee“connections and possibilities in circumstances that even people who are smart in conventional ways do not see,” the president has shown himself to be adept at reading the temper of the times, exploiting weaknesses in others, and assembling a coalition of the faithful that others would have never thought possible. What PittNews’Grace Longworthwrote last September has been confirmed since he returned to the Oval Office.“Trump is not as crazy or dumb as his opposition would like to believe he is,” Longsworth said.Trump’s genius is demonstrated by his ability to transform “calamitous errors into political gold”. In the past six months, he has continued to do what he has done since he first appeared on the national political scene. From then until now, hehas convinced millions of Americans to buy into his version of eventsand not to believe what they see with their eyes.Insurrectionists become patriots. Law-abiding immigrants become threats to America’s way of life. Journalists become “enemies of the people”.It’s magic.Of course, the last six months have not been all smooth sailing for the president, whois now embroiledin a controversy about releasing material about the child sexual offenderJeffrey Epstein.But Trump succeeds because he is undaunted by critics and unfazed by the kinds of barriers that would throw any ordinary politician off their game. When necessary, hemakesthings up and repeats them until what he says seems to be real.None of this is good for democracy.Trump has done what millions of Americanswantdone: transform the political system. He has not been afraid to call into question constitutional verities. The greatest, and most dangerous, achievement of the president’s first six months has been reshaping the balance of power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.The president has activated a political movement that has produced what Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackermandescribesas “constitutional moments.” In those moments, fundamental political change happens without any formal change in the language of the Constitution itself.“Normal politics is temporarily suspended in favor of a ‘constitutional politics,’ focused on fundamental principles.” Since January, the Trump administration’s actions have indeed focused the attention of the nation on such principles.Like it or not, Donald Trump isturningthe constitution on its head, changing it from a Republican to an authoritarian document. And with every passing day, we see that transformation happening.The Republican majority in Congressseems eagerto let the president reshape the constitution and take on functions that it clearly assigns to the legislature. Tariffs, Congress is supposed to decide. Dissolving executive departments, Congress is supposed to decide. War powers, they belong to Congress.But you’d never know any of that from the way the president has behaved since 20 January.The supreme courthas followed suit, giving its blessing to his aggressive assertions of executive authority even when they violate the clear meaning of the constitution. The court even severely limited the role of the lower courts bydenyingthem the right to issue nationwide injunctions to stop the president from acting illegally.Beyond Congress and the court, it seems clear that pro-democracy forces did not do all they could have to prepare for this moment. Trump’s opponents have not learned from Trump how to effectively counter his “constitutional moment”.So what can we do?We can learn from Trump the importance of telling a simple, understandable story and sticking to it. Pro-democracy forcesneed to pick a message and repeat it again and again to drive it home. There is surely no one in America who has not heard the phrase Make America Great Again and does not associate Maga with Trump. We can learn to appeal to national pride and drive home that national greatness requires addressing the daily experiences of ordinary Americans in language of the kind they use.Make America Affordable Again. Make America Work Again for Everyone. Think X, Instagram, and what works on a podcast.Pro-democracy forces can learn to be as determined and undaunted in defense of democracy as the president has been in his assault on it.Take off the gloves. Show your teeth, take no prisoners. Trump has shown that it matters to voters not just what you stand for but alsohowyou go about standing for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Remember Trump has gotten to where he is not by being an acolyte of Republican orthodoxy but by being a heretic.Inthe age of loneliness, pro-democracy forces need to give people the sense that theyare caught up in a great cause.We can learn from the president that if the pro-democracy movement is to succeed, it needs to offer its own version of constitutional reform. Stop talking about preserving the system and start talking about changing it in ways that will make government responsive and connect it to the lives that people live.The six-month mark in his second term is a good moment to dedicate or rededicate ourselves to that work.What’s giving me hope nowEvery Friday since April, I have organized a Stand Up for Democracy protest in the town where I live. People show up.They hold signs and cometo bear witness, even if what they do will not convert anyone to democracy’s cause. They want to affirm their belief that democracy matters, and they want to do so publicly.Some are fearful, worried that they will somehow be punished for participating, but they show up.In addition, Harvard University’s willingnessto resistthe Trump administration’s demands that threatened academic freedom and institutional independence set a powerful example. Whether or not the university reaches an agreement with the administration, Harvard’s examplewill still matter.It is also true, as Axiosreports, that protests against Trump administrationpolicies and allies “have attracted millions in the last few months: Tesla Takedown in March, Hands Off! and 50501 in April, May Day, No Kings Day in June, and Free America on Independence Day”. Another mass event, “Good Trouble Lives On,” occurred on 17 July, “commemorating the fifth anniversary of the death of civil rights leader and former Rep John Lewis”.Those events need to happen more frequently than once a month. But they are a start.Axios cites Professor Gloria J Browne-Marshall, who reminds us that “effective protesting often starts with an emotional response to policy or an event, swiftly followed by strategy … The current movement is reaching that second stage”. In that stage, it has a chance to “‘actually make change in the government’.”I think that the seeds of that kind of opposition have been planted. But there is no time to waste if we are to prevent Trump’s political ingenuity from succeeding in permanently reshaping the institutions and practices of our constitutional republic towards authoritarianism.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFighting BackTrump administrationProtestActivismUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

So why on earth is it allowed to continue? The answer is moral relativismSun 20 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 13.08 EDTShareThe quest for peace in major conflicts has rarely been so desperate and so seemingly futile. In Gaza, talk of ceasefires, truces and pauses typically ends in tears. In Ukraine, the war is now well into its fourth year withno end in sight, despite Donald Trump’s new 50-day deadline. Syriaburns anew. Sudan’s horrors never cease. Last year, state-based conflicts reached a peak –61 across 36 countries. It was the highest recorded total since 1946. This year could be worse.The sheer scale and depravity of war crimes and other conflict-zone atrocities is extraordinary. The deliberate, illegal targeting and terrorising of civilians, the killing, maiming and abduction of children, and the use of starvation, sexual violence, torture and forced displacement as weapons of war have grown almost routine. Israel’skilling last weekof children queueing for water in Gaza was shocking, made doubly so by the fact that scenes like this have become so commonplace.“Blessed are the peacemakers,” said Saint Matthew, but today, impartial mediators are in wickedly short supply. Surely everyone agrees: murdering and massacring innocents is morally indefensible. So why on earth is it allowed to continue? This same question is shouted out loud by grief-stricken parents in Rafah, Kyiv and Darfur, by UN relief workers, in pulpits, pubs and parliaments, in street protestsand at Glastonbury. Why? WHY?The curse of moral relativism provides a clue. The fact is, not everyone does agree. What is absolutely morally indefensible to one group of people is relatively permissible or justifiable to another. This has held true throughout human history. Yet today’s geopolitically and economically divided world is also ethically and morally fractured to a possibly unparalleled degree. Agreed, observed standards – what the American writer David Brooks terms a “permanent moral order” – are lacking.The collapse of the international rules-based order is mirrored by this crisis of the moral order. Without accepted universal principles, the peaceful settlement of conflicts, foreign or domestic, becomes highly problematic. “We have no objective standard by which to determine that one view is right and another view is wrong. So public arguments just go on indefinitely, at greater levels of indignation and polarisation,” Brooks argues. What’s left is coercion and manipulation.No individual better personifies the moral-relativist confusion permeating contemporary life than Trump, the master coercer and manipulator. He believes, for example, that he deserves the 2025 Nobel peace prize. Yet Trump, in collusion with Israel, did bomb Iran recently, andkilled numerous civilians. In his morally muddled view, that illegal act of aggression was justified because it restored the peace he had just broken.In a world wedded to war, Alfred Nobel’s venerable peace prize looksincreasingly anachronistic– and politicised. Barack Obama won it in 2009 for doing nothing. If only Trump would do nothing for the next four years. Worse, he has been nominatedby Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, arch foe to peace and morality. It might be preferable to replace the prize with a Warlord of the Year award – and put a bounty on the winner’s head.Making a moral case for peace can be confusing, even controversial; ask any church or mosque leader. For many people, it seems, morality is a dirty word these days. It’s fungible, negotiable and emotive – a matter primarily of individual choice and cultural belonging, not of duty, obligation or fidelity to a higher law. How else to explain why so many Americans turn a blind eye to Trump’s astounding moral turpitude, illustrated againby the Jeffrey Epstein affair? Social identity trumps social conscience.Much of the Russian public suffers from a similarlychronic moral deficiencywhen contemplating Vladimir Putin’s devastation of Ukraine. Intimidated dissenters avoid the subject. Others believe the disinformation fairytales spun by regime-controlled media. The majority inhabits astate of profound ignoranceabout the crimes committed in their name. When it’s over, Russians may claim, like Germans in 1945, that they didn’t know. Amorality is mitigated by mendacity.Israel’s denial of peace in Palestine also comes at a high moral cost. Its reputation is in shreds, its prime minister has an arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes. Antisemitism is surging internationally as a direct result. How can so many Israelis live with their army’s Gaza rampage, with thespectre of 58,000 corpses? Some say it would all stop if only the last hostages were freed; others that all Palestinians are Hamas. Some on the far right, forgetting their country’s history, suggest theidea of a Palestinian nation is fiction. They want all 2 million of Gaza’s residents caged inone huge concentration camp.Many Israelis passionately disagree. They desire peace. Their failure to force a change in government policy is moral as well as political. Also at fault are Americans, Russians and all in Britain and Europe, politicians and the public, who fail to speak out, who look the other way, who excuse the inexcusable for reasons of state or personal comfort – or who claim that murder and mayhem, wherever they occur, are relatively morally tolerable if committed, as argued by Saint Thomas Aquinas, in the prosecution of a “just war”.This very modern failure, this retreat into subjective, made-to-measure morality, this renunciation of shared responsibility, is reversible. Universal ethical standards still apply. They are defined by the Geneva conventions, by other secular instruments of international law, through religious faith and through the social contract. They should be respected and strengthened. They are necessary, sometimes inconvenient truths.Ordinary people in ordinary times may pick and choose their moral battles. But ending major conflicts, and easing the suffering of millions, is a moral imperative that demands a determined collective response from all concerned. That way lies peace. That way lies salvation.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What value do I have?”The transition from a life of structured achievement to one of open-ended possibility is profound. For those accustomed to influence and achievement, finding new meaning requires more than just financial planning. When work has defined who you are for decades, retirement can trigger surprising emotional and cognitive challenges.Despite living on opposite sides of the globe and working in different industries and roles, Martin’s experiences were echoed by John, who recently stepped away from corporate life and a highly successful leadership career. “I have no regrets, I’ve succeeded, travelled and performed. But now, I feel quite lost.”The retirement identity gapFor both men, the feeling of being lost has been unpleasant, unsettling and isolating. They have found themselves “in between” identities, neither fully in their previous life nor settled into the next chapter.We know from psychological research that the space between work and retirement can be a profound challenge to one’s self-concept. It is particularly difficult for people who have succeeded in knowledge-based professions where cognitive performance and expertise are fundamental to professional identity: what do you do when you stop thinking for a living?“I went from having a demanding schedule with people depending on my expertise to suddenly having endless free time. It sounds like a luxury, but it felt more like falling off a cliff.” Martin was coping with the lost and “falling-off” feeling by taking on an ever-increasing list of projects, and John was grappling with a strong urge to “do one more business”. “I still have plenty of gas in the tank, maybe I’m not ready for a slower life.”The assumption prior to retirement that more time will automatically translate to greater fulfilment is common, but as Martin and John are finding, not necessarily true – especially when that time lacks the structure, purpose and community that a previous work life provided.Researchers havefound thathaving a lot of free time doesn’t necessarily equate to happiness. People derive a certain sense of joy from being productive and accomplishing things and might lose this sense of joy with a lot of unstructured time.Otherresearchers have shownthat retirees who maintain a strong social network – for example volunteering or joining clubs – are happier and healthier, while thelongitudinal Harvard studyon happiness has identified the loss of work relationships and connections as the biggest challenge to retirement wellbeing.Finding structure, purpose and community in new waysThe American writer William Bridges describes this in-between time as “the messy middle”. For John and Martin, navigating a meaningful life in this time of transition has involved purposeful experimentations and an acceptance of not knowing yet what all the components of retirement identity and purpose may look like. Martin in particular has found the messy middle metaphor helpful.In his messy middle, John has taken on some charity work to create purpose, various physical labour projects for some tangible sense of accomplishment, a consulting project to see if this provides an outlet for his entrepreneurial drive, and a travel adventure to develop new social connections. Martin is testing out a slower pace, intentionally dialling down scheduled commitments and staying with the uncomfortable experience of less “achievement”. “It’s a struggle, but I’m starting to see that there’s value in who I am, not just what I produce.”Martin has also been deliberately seeking out time with male friends, some of whom are also transitioning into retirement. He notes that these conversations are fragile, as men of his generation rarely venture on the thin ice of personal vulnerability.“We skate around the issue and often back off, but we all sense we are in the same boat. And in any case, hanging out and obliquely touching on meaning and purpose has been heartwarming in a black humour sort of way.”Processing a mixed bag of emotionsBoth men share the experience as a mixed bag of seemingly contradictory emotions. They both describe gratitude for being in a position to make choices, for opportunities and relationships, alongside the anxiety, frustration and (sometimes) sadness of a life in flux.'Life keeps evolving': six ways to have a happy retirementRead morePsychological researchsuggests that mixed emotions – like sadness and gratitude – are not contradictory but coexistent and neurologically integrated. This paradox validates John and Martin’s experience. Many retirees have similar experiences but struggle to put it into words.John has discovered sharing his writing about his experiences has helped him make sense of his own mixed bag. He has appreciated positive feedback from others that his reflections are encouraging in their transitions towards retirement.Retirement has come to be seen as an event, but perhaps it’s more like a passage – a crossing from the scaffolded certainties of working life to unmapped terrain that must be navigated. The real work of this next chapter is to embrace the messy middle not as a void, but as a creative space, where purpose and tasks no longer arrive by calendar invite.Martin and John remind us that meaning doesn’t retire when we do; it simply migrates and must be rediscovered. The messy middle requires testing new identities, trying new activities and practising patience. Just like work, really.This piece was inspired by aGuardian Modern Mindreader who replied to a previous post about time affluence and suggested a follow-upMartin and John are amalgams of a few different people, all of whom have given permission for their experiences to be shared here.

Yet we never learn from the pastJohn HarrisA landmark book exposes the history of loathing that underpins such scandals as Winterbourne View. It has received next to no attentionSun 20 Jul 2025 07.42 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTShareBBC Radio 4 has just aired a short series about the writer Virginia Woolf, tocelebrate the centenaryof her novel Mrs Dalloway. According to the publicity blurb, the aim of Three Transformations of Virginia Woolf was to explore what she “has to say to us today”, and how she “captured and critiqued a modern world that was transforming around her, treated mental health as a human experience rather than a medical condition, and challenged gender norms”.Because the three episodes immediately followed the Today programme, I distractedly caught two minutes of the first, before flinching, and turning it off. The reason? Only a few days before, I had read a diary entry Woolf wrote in 1915, presented alongside the acknowledgment that she was “suffering deep trauma at the time”, but still so shocking that it made me catch my breath.It was a recollection of encountering a group of learning-disabled people, who were probably residents of a famous institution called Normansfield hospital. “We met and had to pass a long line of imbeciles,” Woolf wrote. “The first was a very tall man, just queer enough to look at twice, but no more; the second shuffled, and looked aside; and then one realised that everyone in that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature … It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly be killed.”That passage arrives a third of the way through a brilliant new book titledBeautiful Lives, straplined How We Got Learning Disabilities So Wrong. Written by the playwright and drama director Stephen Unwin, its story goes from the Greeks and Romans to the 21st century. Much of it is a history of the misunderstanding, hatred and appalling mistreatment experienced by endless millions of people. But partly because Unwin has a learning-disabled son – 28-year-old Joey, who he says has “challenged everything I was brought up to believe in and turned it on its head” – it is also a very topical demand for all of us “to celebrate the fact that such people exist and have so much to offer”.A sign of the ignorance Unwin spends some of the book railing against is the fact that this superbly original work, published in early June, has not been reviewed in a single mainstream publication. In the context of the attitudes he writes about, that is probably not much of a surprise – but there again, the book is so timely that its passing-over still feels shocking. After all, it follows the same unquestionable logic as all those high-profile discussions and debates about institutional racism and empire, and demands a very similar process of reckoning.On this subject, there is a mountain of questions to ask. Some are about language that still endures: “imbeciles”, “morons”, “cretins”, “idiots”. How many of us know about the first official Asylum for Idiots – later the Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives – founded in Surrey in 1847, and infamous for what Unwin describes as “widespread cruelty … and soaring mortality rates”? However much young people study history, do their syllabuses ever cover theMental Deficiency Act of 1913, which formalised the idea that people categorised as “idiots” and “imbeciles” (and all disabled children and young people) should be institutionalised, let alone the fact that it granted local councils powers to remove such people from their families by force? Why is the US’s record oninstitutional cruelty and cod-psychologyeven worse than the UK’s?There is another part of the same story, centred on aslew of 20th-century politicians and cultural figureswho believed that learning-disabled people – and disabled people in general – were not just pitiful and wretched, but a threat to humanity’s future, an idea expressed in the absurd non-science of eugenics. They included that towering bruteWinston Churchill, DH Lawrence (who had visions ofherding disabled peopleinto “a lethal chamber as big as the Crystal Palace”), and lots of people thought of as progressives: Bertrand Russell, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, the one-time Labour party chair Harold Laski, and the trailblazing intellectuals Sidney and Beatrice Webb.Their credo of pure and strong genes may have been discredited by the defeat of the Nazis, but we should not kid ourselves that everyday manifestations of loathing and condescension that underlay those ideas do not linger on. Ours is the age of such scandals as the one that erupted in 2011 atWinterbourne View, the “assessment and treatment unit” in Gloucestershire, where people with learning disabilities were left out in freezing weather, had mouthwash poured into their eyes and were given cold showers as a punishment.The year 2013 saw the death in an NHS unit ofConnor Sparrowhawk, the autistic and learning-disabled young man whose life was dramatised by Unwin in a profoundly political play titledLaughing Boy, based on a brilliantly powerful book written by Sparrowhawk’s mother, Sara Ryan. As well as its principal character’s life and death, it highlighted the fact that the health trust that ran the unit in question was eventually found to havenot properly investigatedthe “unexpected” deaths of more than 1,000 people with learning disabilities or mental-health issues.Right now, about 2,000 learning-disabled and autistic people arelocked awayin completely inappropriate and often inhumane facilities, usually under the terms of mental health legislation. Only5% of learning-disabled peopleare reckoned to have a job. Six out of 10 currentlydie before the age of 65, compared with one out of 10 for people from the general population.Shut away and ignored: thousands of disabled adults are at the frontier of the human rights struggle | John HarrisRead moreBut this is also a time of growing learning-disabled self-advocacy, which will hopefully begin to make change unavoidable. One small example: at this year’s Glastonbury, I chaired a discussion about the cuts to disability benefits threatened by the political heirs of Laski and the Webbs. The speakers onstage included Ady Roy, a learning-disabled activist who is involved inMy Life My Choice, a brilliant organisation that aims at a world “where people with a learning disability are treated without prejudice and are able to have choice and control over their own lives”. He was inspirational, but it would be good to arrive at a point where what he did was completely unremarkable.It may sound a little melodramatic, but it is also true: such people, and allies like Unwin, are at the cutting-edge of human liberation. Far too many others may not have the same grim ideas as Woolf, Lawrence, Keynes and all the rest, but their unawareness and neglect sit somewhere on the same awful continuum. That only highlights an obvious political fact that all of us ought to appreciate as a matter of instinct: that the present and future will only be different if we finally understand the past.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLearning disabilityOpinionVirginia WoolfDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

Now Liadan Ní Chuinn is shunning publicity in an industry that demands ever more exposureSun 20 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhat’s in a pen name? Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn’s debut short story collection, Every One Still Here, is receivingrave reviewsandrapturous praise, but hardly anyone seems to know who they are. A cursory Google turns up no photos or biographical information. All we know is that the writer is Northern Irish and was born in 1998, the year of the Good Friday agreement.A statement from Irish publisher The Stinging Fly reads: “The Stinging Fly has been working with Liadan on these stories for the past four years. From early on in the process, they expressed a desire to publish their work under a pseudonym and to protect their privacy throughout the publication process. No photographs of the author are available and Liadan will not be participating in any in-person interviews or public events.”Writing anonymously or under a pseudonym is along-establishedcustom in publishing. Jane Austen’s novels were attributed to “a Lady”, Mary Ann Evans went by George Eliot, and the Brontë sisters were Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Although women no longer need to disguise themselves as men, and “the low trade of writing novels” is less stigmatised, the tradition of the pen name has continued throughout the 20th century into the present day: John Le Carré was really David Cornwell; Eric Blair became George Orwell; and no one has heard of Erika Leonard, but everyone has heard of EL James. When questions regardingthe veracity of nature memoir The Salt Pathcaused outrage among the nation’s book groups, the fact that the author had changed her and her husband’s names was the least remarkable revelation. If anything, it can feel more unusual to meet an author whose books have the name they were born with on the cover.In the world of modern publishing, the spectrum encompasses everything from “uses a pen name but has an author photo and gives interviews” to “has an opposite gender or gender-neutral author persona”; “uses different pseudonyms for different genres”; “uses a different name for political reasons, eg to escape persecution in their home country, or personal or professional reasons”; and even “secret anonymity” (is anonymous but tries to make it so that no one actually knows they are). Nepotist offspring will often use a less famous parent’s surname to stave off accusations that they owe their success to their connections or, as in the case of AS Byatt, an author may use their married name to distance themselves from a novelist sibling (Margaret Drabble).Envy, ego, pride and pain: what I learned from publishing my first book | Hamilton NolanRead moreTotal anonymity, however, is a different business. The most famous modern example we have is of course Elena Ferrante (or it was, until she was possibly and, to my mind, veryrudely unmaskedby an Italian journalist). Yet even Ferrante did some press through correspondence, including writingfor the Guardian. To not give interviews at all, especially as a young debut author, is unusual indeed, and especially in a publishing landscape where “personal brand” is key, and short stories remain such a hard sell. You could say that Liadan Ní Chuinn’s collection being published at all is something of a miracle.Literary quality is not always prioritised above profile. I cannot tell you how many proofs I am sent by writers who are big on Instagram but can’t string a grammatical sentence together. With publicity budgets not what they used to be and many authors needing to do much of the work themselves, a debut writer who won’t give interviews or attend events represents a challenge to any acquiring publishing house and their publicity department.I admire Ní Chuinn. As an author myself – in the next six months I have two books coming out – I know that the stress of exposure and the risk of burnout can be very real. Ní Chuinn could be forgiven for looking at Sally Rooney, another writer in the same literary ecosystem who started young, and thinking that level of exposure looks unappealing. The way a young woman – because it’s usually a young woman – who creates something great becomes a sort of shorthand for everything that is wrong/right about her chosen art form is hardly an incentive to put yourself out there. Rooney’s writing shows adeep ambivalenceabout fame, and her decision to now largely only put herself forward in the media when it serves her impassionedpolitical beliefsis to be admired. Yet newspapers are still terribly prone to what I call “Rooney-itis”. Look, I’m doing it now.When you’re an author, public exposure doesn’t just affect you, but the people in your life whose stories often overlap with yours. When you are writing about sensitive topics that have a lasting, painful legacy on real people’s lives – as Ní Chuinn does in their excavation of the murderous legacy of English colonialism in Ireland – it can be an act of care and protection to remove yourself from the spotlight.Most of all, it makes the interaction between author and reader purely about the quality of the work. For a publisher to agree to publish an anonymous author, as so many did Ferrante, and publishers in Ireland, the UK and the US have Ní Chuinn, that writer has to be extraordinary. And Ní Chuinn is.It should give any avid reader of fiction – and any author who cares about sentences but is rubbish at TikTok – hope. The work can still be the thing, at least sometimes.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionShort storiesPublishingFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

But the solution is not to vilify people like meDavid KellyChildren deserve the best educators, regardless of gender. And the men who choose to work in this field deserve to do so without being seen as threatsSat 19 Jul 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 21.58 EDTShareMy name is David, and I am a kindergarten teacher. Every time I read another headline about Joshua Dale Brown, my stomach drops. It’s not just the horror of the allegations themselves – though that’s devastating enough. It’s knowing that the parents of the children I teach are reading these same articles. It’s imagining the quiet alarm they must feel, the questions they might not voice, the shadows of doubt that may now creep into what used to be trust.It’s deeply personal. I know that as a man working in early childhood education, I already carry a weight of suspicion that my female colleagues never have to shoulder. I see the difference when I’m introduced at enrolment interviews. I am acutely aware of it when I approach a child crying in the yard. I feel the hesitation, however slight, before a parent leaves their child with me for the first time – not always, but often enough. And I get it – I do. We live in a world that has given them reason to be cautious. But it doesn’t make it any less painful to live beneath that constant cloud of implication.What’s unbearable is watching that cloud darken whenallegations like those Brown is accused of surface. Suddenly, my choice to devote my professional life to the education and wellbeing of young children is subject to renewed scrutiny. Not for the quality of my care, my experience, or my qualifications – but because of my gender.Australia’s current childcare funding model risks failing our most precious people | Zoe DanielRead moreThen along comes commentary suggesting my mere presence in this field is “an uncomfortable truth”. That somehow, simply by being male, my motivations must be questioned, that perhaps there is something unnatural or dangerous in my desire to work with children.But it is worth considering the human impact of such claims. There are thousands of male educators like me, already battling systemic underrepresentation, isolation and the persistent pressure to prove we are safe, kind and worthy of trust.I have a seven-year-old son. He still believes the world is mostly good. Thankfully, he’s not reading the news or some of the commentary around this case yet. But if he did – if he saw articles implying that men like his dad might only work with children because of deviant desires, what would that teach him about masculinity, about care, about empathy?And what are we teaching society when we double down on suspicion rather than taking a wider, structural view? The issue is not that men work in early childhood education. The issue is that predators can exist in every profession and our systems of oversight, training and reporting need to be stronger – not more discriminatory.I agree much more needs to be done to protect children. That’s the very reason I do this work. But the solution is not to vilify or pathologise men who choose to care for and educate young children. The solution is to overhaul a fractured system – starting with the ridiculous patchwork of state-based regulations governing early childhood education and care in Australia.We need a unified, national approach that ensures consistency, accountability and support – for children and educators alike. We need robust, mandatory training in child protection foralleducators, regardless of gender. We need professional standards that uphold child safetyandthe dignity of workers. We need appropriate reward and remuneration to encourage the very best to answer the call of early childhood education. And we need to acknowledge that good men in this field are not the problem – they are part of the solution.The toll of being a male early childhood educator is growing heavier. Not because I’m not proud of what I do – I am. Every day I see the positive impact I have in the lives of the children I teach. I see the bonds we build, the confidence they gain, the joy we share. But I’m tired of having to explain myself. I’m tired of the quiet stigma. And I’m angry that sensational headlines and speculative thinkpieces chip away at the fragile progress we’ve made.Children deserve the best educators – regardless of gender. And the men who choose to work in this field deserve to do so without being seen as threats. Until we address this cultural bias and build a system that truly values care and education, we will keep failing both the children and the educators who care for them.David Kelly is a kindergarten teacher in VictoriaExplore more on these topicsChildcare AustraliaOpinionChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Ahead of her new album, she talks fame, gossip and Trump’s America – and doesn’t hold backSun 20 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShare“Ilooove to lie,” sighs Reneé Rapp happily, sounding like a kid who has just discovered a new favourite toy. She’s talking about using creative licence in her songs, and how she realised, while working on her second album, that she didn’t have to stick to the truth of her own experience 100% of the time. But for a journalist, the admission – and her apparent glee about it – demands a follow-up: has she lied at all in the last 40 minutes?I expect Rapp, 25, to wave away the question. Instead she pauses, seeming to give it real thought. “Have I lied? You know, I don’t think so,” she eventually concludes.I’m still not sure if I believe her, but that’s part of the joy of Reneé Rapp. Whether you’re in her company or merely count yourself a fan, she gives the impression of being authentic, outspoken and honest, sometimes to her own detriment. But then, there’s a moment – a glint in her eye, or an edge to her tone that tips it into deadpan – when you have to wonder: is she being for real?We’re meeting at a cafe in King’s Cross on one of the first hot days in June. Even at the discreet corner table, Rapp radiates star power – jewel-tone shirt dress, sweater draped around her shoulders just so, heeled black boots despite the sweltering heat – and that kind of implacable confidence that’s both sexy and a bit scary. I don’t think the waiting staff recognise her, but they nevertheless seem flustered, bungling her coffee order.In fact, Rapp is more friendly and approachable than suggested by her glamorous, pull-no-punches image and on-screen association with preppy queen bees. Her breakout role was Regina George in the Broadway musical Mean Girls, followed by a turn as initially closeted, privileged daddy’s girl Leighton Murray in Mindy Kaling’s sitcomThe Sex Lives of College Girls. (Queen bee Regina George would never labour to reassure a waiter, as Rapp does, that she was happy – nay,thrilled– with a hot coffee after having ordered a cold one.) Since then, Rapp has also made her name as a pop star. Her debut album, Snow Angel, released in 2023, received positive reviews for its assured, R&B-infused pop.View image in fullscreenClique bait … Rapp in Mean Girls.Photograph: Jojo WhildenBut Rapp’s star really began to rise early last year with her press tour for the film adaptation of the Mean Girls musical. Fromblastingthe “asshole” owner of a tour bus company, topraisingrapper (and collaborator) Megan Thee Stallion’s ass as “the best” she’s ever seen, toadmittingto being ageist against millennial women, Rapp’s interviews were candid to the point of chaotic. Instead of opprobrium, her apparently off-the-cuff comments were met with widespread approval online, boosting her profile and sparking a running joke about her apparent lack of a filter: when guest-starring on Saturday Night Live during that time, Rapp was jokingly sentenced to “40 hours of court-ordered media training”.Rapp’s reputation for being refreshingly unfiltered, compared with the carefully crafted statements commonly made by celebrities today, initially took her by surprise. “It’s very weird, honestly, to be perceived that way, because I don’t really think about it,” she says.It’s true that Rapp does seem less guarded than many celebrities of her age and experience, but at the same time, she doesn’t court controversy or spout uninformed views.When she set out to become a singer, Rapp continues, “I never thought about how people would dissect even the way you speak”. It’s confusing that she’s become known for her media appearances, she says. “Like, wait, what would a normal response be? A fluffy, nonsense answer?” I’m afraid so, I say; but she’s not awaiting confirmation – she’s already off, her intensity rising as she speaks. “To me, that would make me crazy – if I was a journalist, that would drive me fucking up the wall!” (Yes, Reneé.) “Because I would be like, ‘Hang on, we’re not even like having a conversation’.” Her eyes behind her blue-tinted aviators flash. “That would make me insane.”But the expectation that Rapp will always speak her mind has raised the stakes ahead of her second album Bite Me, out next month. The six tracks made available before our conversation were mostly heartfelt love songs, showing off Rapp’s powerful voice and confessional lyrics. But the tone was set by the Joan Jett-referencing lead singleLeave Me Alone, building on the public image of Rapp as a party-girl pop star who refuses to be tamed. “Sign a hundred NDAs, but I still say something,” she drawls.View image in fullscreenFull English … Rapp performing at Wembley Stadium in June.Photograph: David Fisher/Shutterstock for GlobalIn the first major media appearance of her album promo campaign, with comedian Ziwe, Rapp confirmed she’d still not received any media training before going on to discuss her 4.5-star rating on celebrity foot rating site WikiFeet (“I’m so angry, my friends have five!)”,whether her great-grandparents owned slaves(she suspects they did) and which she “gave less of a fuck about: women’s rights or gay rights”. (Gay rights, for the record.) But I wonder if – refreshing though it may be – this no-holds-barred persona might sometimes work against Rapp, preventing her from being taken in earnest while seeding the idea that, in her company, anything goes. The day before our interview, Rapp held a Q&A for fans in London that wasreportedlyderailed by a small group who appeared to have had too many of the Reneé-themed cocktails.Rapp says now that she doesn’t feel pressure to be consistently “iconic” or chill in her press appearances – but she doesn’t deny that this Q&A didn’t go to plan. Rapp had been looking forward to getting into her new album with fans who cared about the nerdy detail. Instead, she struggled to hear their questions over the disorderly minority. “Honestly, it just made me sad.”The real sour note came afterwards, when she and Towa Bird – her British musician girlfriend – were rushed by fans while trying to get in a lift. I try to clarify exactly what happened, but Rapp seems unsure of the details herself. “To be honest, I kept my head down.”But she has no doubt about how it made her feel. “People running after you, into a fucking elevator bank – it’s such weird behaviour,” Rapp says, outraged. “I was so pissed, I was so upset. I was like: ‘You don’t get to chase my girlfriend and me – that’s not fine’.”At the same time, she sees it as part of the deal of being famous. “I don’t like to be disrespected, but I also understand that I’ve signed up for this shit, to an extent.”Indeed Rapp’s truest ambition was to be a pop star; she got into acting, she’s said, as a means to an end. As a child growing up outside Charlotte, North Carolina, she wanted to be Beyoncé – and to get out of her small, now Maga-voting town, Huntersville. “I just didn’t feel very comfortable there,” she says, pointing to her showbusiness aspirations and her emerging sexual identity.Well before she first came out (as bisexual, in 2022; she now identifies as a lesbian), Rapp was the only white girl within her friend group, she says. Her mother would tell her to never turn right out of their neighbourhood – it wasn’t safe for her and her friends. “Everybody has rifles, and if you look at them the wrong way, they will shoot you,” Rapp recalls. Today, she says, “there’re people who live in the neighbourhood that I grew up in, who don’t speak to my parents because I’m out.” It doesn’t bother Rapp or her family, she says with forceful disdain. “I’ve never asked for the approval of conservative white bigots – I’m certainly not going to start now.”She is equally outspoken about Palestine: speaking at the GLAAD Media awards in April 2024, she called for an “immediate ceasefire and permanent ceasefire”, and today has no qualms about denouncing “the genocide” under way. When I ask if she’s ever been advised not to comment, or to use different phrasing, Rapp doesn’t say she hasn’t. “It’s interesting, people would often mask it as ‘That verbiage may make people uncomfortable.’ I would argue that people being slaughtered makes me uncomfortable and should in fact make you uncomfortable.”Rapp feels obliged to speak out not just because it’s the right thing to do but, she says, because it’s so much harder for non-white women. She admits she was shocked when she first moved to New York in 2019, to joinMean Girlson Broadway and discovered “that people are still conservative bigots there”. Rapp starred in the show for about seven months before Covid brought it to a premature close.View image in fullscreenSchool’s out … The Sex Lives of College Girls.Photograph: ITVNow living with Bird in a “seemingly white-liberal-ass neighbourhood” of Los Angeles, Rapp says there are “extremists” a few doors down, with signs in the windows warning “We’re armed”.“Especially with our current administration, it’s just so in your face – the hate for people who could be considered ‘other’,” she says. “There’s just direct hate, and it’s so loud.”‘Trust me, I have not been out-girlbossed’: pop star Reneé Rapp on Mean Girls, mean girls and mental healthRead moreWhen I ask Rapp where she got the confidence to speak her mind, she answers simply: “I have phenomenal parents.” Her father, Charles, and mother, Denise, instilled in Rapp and her brother the importance of hard work and personal accountability.“They were just always like: ‘Be accountable to yourself, to your friends, to people you don’t know,’” she says. What Rapp took away was that “there’s no shame in being wrong, necessarily”; what mattered was being able to “look in the mirror” and hold your head up high.Though she is grateful for that foundation, it wasn’t always easy: even when Rapp was very young, her parents didn’t hold back in their feedback on her performances. Rapprecently claimedthat Denise even gave her daughter an alliterative name, “just in case” she wanted to become a pop star.View image in fullscreenPower couple … Rapp with partner Towa Bird.Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/Variety/Getty ImagesToday her parents are among only a handful of people who she can count on to be brutally honest with her, along with Bird – and maybe “two people” on her team.“I don’t trust anyone,” she says, “and I don’t say that in a ‘Oh, no, I feel lonely!’ way – I know that there are so many people who are never going to be honest with me. I think everyone is lying to me, all the time.”It perhaps explains her own premium on public-facing authenticity. Even when she says she loves to lie, it seems it’s only about the things that don’t matter.I put it to Rapp that, where other pop stars might be blandly noncommittal, her own strategy for getting around difficult questions she doesn’t want to answer is to deploy humour. “Exactly,” she says, like I’m her pupil giving her a correct answer.Of course, a veneer of authenticity can also be a way of obfuscating what someone really thinks. Her single Leave Me Alone is a prime example: the line where Rapp crows “I took my sex life with me, now the show ain’t fuckin’!” went viral for seeming to allude to her departure from The Sex Lives of College Girls (there were rumours that cast members had questioned her sexuality). Online, the show’s fans decried the line as tacky and disrespectful of the role that made her famous; Rapp’s fans said she was only being “iconic” again.Rapp only stirred the pot further in her interview with Ziwe, describing Sex Lives as being “such a good experience” in a way that played equally as sarcastic or sincere. “I wish I could go back,” she said, deadpan. Even whip-smart Ziwe seemed to fall for it, inquiring: “Really?” “Nope!” Rapp shot back.When I tell her about the online debate raging over her intentions, Rapp gives a Cheshire cat grin. “It’s like Beyoncé said: ‘You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.’”Having previously approached songwriting as an exercise in truth-telling, Rapp discovered with this album that she could embellish her experiences and even make things up without sacrificing emotional truth. She doesn’t feel the need to respond to speculation about what her songs are about.I ask Rapp if she gave her former Sex Lives co-stars a heads-up about the “show ain’t fuckin’” line. “I didn’t write it,” she says instantly. I’m momentarily flummoxed. Rapp spies her chance and runs with it. “I’ve not heard of that show, is it good?” she continues, cocking her head as though earnestly engaged.It takes me a beat too long to realise – she’s messing with me, right? “Yep.”Reneé Rapp’s new album, Bite Me, is released on 1 August.Explore more on these topicsMusicMean GirlsPop and rockMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

What bracingly confident televisionRebecca NicholsonSun 20 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere is an overwhelming darkness to The Narrow Road to the Deep North, Justin Kurzel’s adaptation of Richard Flanagan’s Booker prize-winning novel. Thematically, this is to be expected: it is about a group of Australian prisoners of war constructing the Burma railway in the mid-1940s, at the tail end of the second world war. It is about the lasting trauma of conflict and imprisonment. It spans half a century, and though it tempers its darkness with a rich love story, it is largely violent, fatalistic and sorrowful. But visually, too, you may find yourself fiddling with the contrast and brightness settings. This very much matches its mood to its palette.Jacob Elordi is perfectly handsome and haunted as the younger Dorrigo, a poetry-loving doctor who is about to be married to the well-to-do and socially connected Ella (Olivia DeJonge). The show covers three timelines, two of which follow closely on from one another. Elordi takes the main shift, Dorrigo as a young man. It opens in the thick heat of battle, going straight into the action. Young soldiers trade barbs with gallows humour, as they joke and tease, and place bets on how long they think they are going to live. Their banter is interrupted by exploding mines, the casualties already considerable, just a few moments in. The survivors are captured and put to work on the railway. It is hellish from the off, a vivid nightmare of torture and a tale of impossible endurance.Forty-nine years later, towards the end of the 1980s, Ciarán Hinds is the older Dorrigo, a successful, wealthy and celebrated surgeon, still married to Ella (now played by Heather Mitchell). Dorrigo is brooding, even more haunted and undergoing a reckoning with his own history. He is also celebrated as a war hero, but he is combative, arrogant, even reckless, in his professional and personal life. He gives a furious television interview, ostensibly about his experiences of war, to promote a book, the nature of which is deliberately abstruse. This enforced reflection causes him to remember what he has tried so hard to forget and, as a drama, flipping between timelines, it builds up a picture of what made him the unhappy, unfaithful man he has become. It does this slowly, convincingly and in great, awful detail.The 1980s storyline, in which Dorrigo’s philandering ways are laid bare, provides some respite from the relentless violence. This is visceral, in its truest sense. Kurzel captures the bodily horror of war in an almost confrontationally frank manner. As they hack away at rock and trees, the men are emaciated, filthy, full of malaria and dysentery. The camera nestles in among them, and hovers above, conveying a real sense of their closeness and suffering. At one point, a leg must be amputated. This is a gory and drawn-out ordeal. At least, in the darkness, it is partially obscured, though the audio alone is gruesome enough.For all of its bodily horrors, this is a passionate, full-bodied love story too, a strand that is delicately balanced but just as impactful. Before he is called up, Dorrigo visits his uncle Keith (a small, mighty performance from Simon Baker) and is immediately drawn to Keith’s young wife, Amy (Odessa Young). She is intrigued, if not impressed, but when they meet again at a poetry reading in a bookshop, after Dorrigo has become engaged to Ella, that initial spark ignites into a forest fire. It takes time for their mutual attraction to become more than yearning and longing, lingering looks and touches, but the pacing of it is moving and affecting. Compared to the grinding chaos of the jungle, their affair is sad and beautiful, as romantic as it is doomed.This is a literary drama and it makes no apologies for that. Dorrigo loves Catullus and Aeschylus. The men perform Romeo and Juliet for each other in the jungle. Amy cements her attraction to Dorrigo with a fragment of Sappho, which reads, simply, “you burn me”. At times, its novelistic roots are more obviously on show; some of the dialogue is writerly and elevated, as the characters reflect poetically upon human nature and cruelty.And there is much cruelty to consider. There are so many killings, so many deaths, and one particular execution, in the jungle, is one of the most distressing scenes I have watched on television in a long time. The Narrow Road to the Deep North, then, is not an easy prospect, but it is an immensely powerful one, driven by strong performances and a bracing confidence in its ability to tell this story, at its own pace, in its own way. My only complaint is that I would have liked to have been able to see just a little more of it.The Narrow Road to the Deep North aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer in the UK. It is available on Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJacob ElordiDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

But which record healed his broken teenage heart?As told toRich PelleySun 20 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe first single I boughtOne of the first albums I bought was Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones; the first single was The Last Time. I was about 11 when my dad bought me my first record player, and I wore it out by listening to it so much.The first song I fell in love withMy first love was an unrequited crush. I heard Let’s Stay Together by Al Green on the radio, went out and bought it, and played it over and over to heal the pain of teenage rejection.The song that changed my lifeI Want to Hold Your Hand by the Beatles was the first song I remember performing. It was when I was about six, with a band at a wedding. I’ve since been told that I was singing even younger than that. A friend of ours was a landlady in a pub, and she used to stand me up on the bar when I was about three and have me sing to customers. Those Beatles double LPs, the red and the blue, 1962-66 and 1967-70, were among the first albums I bought when I was a kid.The song that is my karaoke go-toPapa Don’t Take No Mess by James Brown, who is probably the most influential figure in the history of recorded music. The first gig we did as Simply Red, right after we signed our contract, was opening for him at Hammersmith Odeon. I remember him watching from the side of the stage with curlers in.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toDaisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two) by British songwriter Harry Dacre from 1892. I’m enamoured with some of the old songs. The melody just glues in your head and the lyric is beautifully visual.The song I can no longer listen toMother by John Lennon. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is a stark masterpiece. This song is a little too close to the mark.The song that I secretly like, but tell everyone I hate24 hours from Tulsa by Gene Pitney.

But his story was crafted to cushion uneaseSun 20 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.01 EDTShareWe’ve entered the era of the superhero movie as sermon. No longer content with saving the world, spandex saviors are now being used to explain, moralize and therapize it. And a being from Krypton has shown up once again in a debate about real life; about borders, race and who gets to belong.Superman. Of all symbols.I’ve read reactionary thinkpieces, rage-filled quote tweets and screeds about the legal status of a fictional alien – enough to lose count. This particular episode of American Fragility kicked off because James Gunn had the audacity to call Superman “the story of America”. An immigrant, by definition, as he was always meant to be.What set things off wasn’t just the sentiment – it was who said it, and how plainly. Gunn, now headlining DC’s cinematic future, told the Sunday Times that Superman was “an immigrant who came from other places and populated the country”. He spoke of Superman’s inherent kindness as a political statement in itself, noting that the film would play differently in some parts of America before adding, bluntly, that “there are some jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness”. “But screw them,” he added. It was that line – less the immigrant metaphor, more the unapologetic framing – that sent the usual outrage machine into motion.Enter Dean Cain, a former TV Superman. Cain accused Gunn of politicizing the character, which is remarkably foolish, considering Superman’s been swatting at fascism since 1941. Meanwhile, over at Fox News, it’sbeen a full meltdownover the idea that Superman, canonically not of this Earth, might be played as … not of this Earth. Liberal brainwashing, they suggested. Identity politics in a cape.Superman: identity crises, fascist space holograms and a super furry animal – discuss with spoilersRead moreBut have they actually looked at David Corenswet? The man looks like he was made to sell oat milk in a Ralph Lauren ad. All cheekbones and cleft chin. If this is the foreign body in question, no wonder middle America has historically shrugged over Supes being an immigrant by definition.Even still, there’s something telling about any collective gasp over a white, blue-eyed man with an immigrant backstory. The scramble to defend him says more than intended. For all the hand-wringing over Superman’s alienness, what rarely gets named is how meticulously his story was crafted to cushion the unease of the topic at hand: otherness itself – the very thing people pretend was always central to his character.There are plenty of ways to frame the ridiculousness of this argument, clever ways to connect the dots, but the real fracture in Superman’s myth hits, oddly enough, during a quiet scene in Tarantino’s meditation on vengeance, Kill Bill: Vol. 2.In the scene, the villain, Bill (David Carradine) unpacks what makes Superman different from every other hero.“What Kent wears – the glasses, the business suit – that’s the costume,” Bill says. “That’s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us.”It’s one hell of a tell – the kind of observation that pulls back the curtain on how Superman was engineered to understand the world, and how the world, in turn, reinforced how he should fit within it.From the start, Superman was never meant to be an outsider. His creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster – sons of Jewish immigrants – didn’t craft him as a symbol of difference but as a projection of pure Americanness. They gave him a midwestern upbringing, an Anglo name in Clark Kent, and that square-jawed charm.Siegel and Shuster were working against the backdrop of unchecked antisemitism, at a time when Jewish immigrants faced hostility. But instead of exploring immigrant “otherness”, the artists imagined a version of America where that alienness could be easily discarded via an outfit change. Superman wasn’t an outsider – he was the ideal immigrant, effortlessly slipping into a world that required no resistance. His story wasn’t about struggling to belong, but about the fantasy of belonging, with the privilege of choosing whether or not to fight for it.That projection of safe, silent Americanness hasn’t remained confined to the pages of comic books. Today’s immigration politics run on the same fantasy. The myth of the “good” immigrant – quiet, grateful, easy to assimilate – still runs wild. It’s the same story that fuels the strange spectacle of politicians praising white South African farmers as victims of racial persecution, all while demonizing migrants from Latin America, the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa.The notion of who deserves to stay has always been racialized, selective and violent. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said that aperson’s physical appearancecould be a factor in the decision to question them. He later said it could not be“the sole reason”. But in April, Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a US-born citizen from Georgia, wasdetained in Floridaeven after his mother showed authorities his birth certificate. In New York, Elzon Lemus, an electrician, was stopped because he “looked like someone” agents were after. Maybe he didn’t wear his suit and glasses that day.Superman, the immigrant who makes people comfortable, has never been just a comic book character. He’s been a metaphor and living testament to the kind of “other” that wealthy nations have always preferred: those who blend in, assimilate and rarely challenge the systems that demand their silence.If you’re still not convinced that Superman’s assimilationist fantasy is alive and well, just look at a White House meme from 10 July 2025: Trump dressed as Superman, with the words ‘Truth. Justice. The American Way.’ It’s a glaring example of how cultural symbols are repurposed – hijacked, really – to serve a narrow and self-congratulatory vision of America. That’s the trick of Superman: he’s been a blank canvas of a both-sides heroism, which makes everyone feel seen.You don’t even need to like or dislike Superman for the Maga debate to pull you in, as it was always meant to. The culture war still appointed a celebrity to govern the most powerful nation on Earth. It still turned a corporate diversity initiative into a national crisis. And it took a serious conversation about immigration and made a polished, all-American character its face. The culture war distorts, and it continues, relentless as ever.Noel Ransome is a Toronto-based freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSupermanOpinionMigrationUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Someone from the opera house/company then came on stage from the wings to try to remove the flag from the cast member who wrestled it back and refused to give it up during Il Trovatore,” a member of the audiencetold the Telegraph.Another operagoer posted on X on Saturday: “Extraordinary scenes at the RoyalOperaHouse tonight.“During the curtain call for Il Trovatore one of the background artists came on stage waving a Palestine flag. Just stood there, no bowing or shouting. Someone off stage kept trying to take it off him. Incredible.”Another post on X from Stephen Ratcliffe, who was also watching the production, added: “Controversy at end of Trovatore @rbo_org tonight when an extra/chorus member unfurled a Palestinian flag. Off stage manager tried to grapple with him but he held his ground. Bet he won’t be working there again.”A spokesperson for the Royal Ballet and Opera said: “The display of the flag was an unauthorised action by the artist. It was not approved by the Royal Ballet and Opera and is a wholly inappropriate act.”A video of the incident, posted on social media, shows a man, thought to be a Royal Opera House staff member, appearing from the wings and attempting to forcibly wrest the flag off the protesting cast member.But the cast member managed to yank the flag back, and continued to display it as the other cast members in front bowed to the audience. During the tussle, two other performers who are stood alongside the protester can be seen lurching to their side.Cast members further forward on the stage appeared oblivious what was happening behind them.Other officials standing in the wings can be seen shouting messages to the protesting cast member, who looks ahead and appears to ignore them.The protest came on the closing night of Il Trovatore, a four-act opera by Giuseppe Verdi, after an 11-night run at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.Il Trovatore (“The Troubadour” in English) is a tale of doomed love, the destructive nature of revenge, and the inescapable influence of the past. The plot, which has many twists and secrets, revolves around four main characters: Manrico, Azucena, Leonora and Count di Luna, each caught up in misunderstandings and dramatic confrontations.Explore more on these topicsRoyal Opera HouseOperaPalestinian territoriesLondonIsrael-Gaza warEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s fascinating about this film is that, had the lead been any other actor, it would have devolved into generic pulp. But Malek, in the hands of director James Hawes, really leans into the character’s psychopathy. He has a dead-eyed stare throughout, the sort you’d usually expect to find on a film’s antagonist.

That gives me hopeRhiannon Lucy CosslettPen names have a long history. Now Liadan Ní Chuinn is shunning publicity in an industry that demands ever more exposureSun 20 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 12.51 EDTShareWhat’s in a pen name? Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn’s debut short story collection, Every One Still Here, is receivingrave reviewsandrapturous praise, but hardly anyone seems to know who they are. A cursory Google turns up no photos or biographical information. All we know is that the writer is Northern Irish and was born in 1998, the year of the Good Friday agreement.A statement from Irish publisher The Stinging Fly reads: “The Stinging Fly has been working with Liadan on these stories for the past four years. From early on in the process, they expressed a desire to publish their work under a pseudonym and to protect their privacy throughout the publication process. No photographs of the author are available and Liadan will not be participating in any in-person interviews or public events.”Writing anonymously or under a pseudonym is along-establishedcustom in publishing. Jane Austen’s novels were attributed to “a Lady”, Mary Ann Evans went by George Eliot, and the Brontë sisters were Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Although women no longer need to disguise themselves as men, and “the low trade of writing novels” is less stigmatised, the tradition of the pen name has continued throughout the 20th century into the present day: John Le Carré was really David Cornwell; Eric Blair became George Orwell; and no one has heard of Erika Leonard, but everyone has heard of EL James. When questions regardingthe veracity of nature memoir The Salt Pathcaused outrage among the nation’s book groups, the fact that the author had changed her and her husband’s names was the least remarkable revelation. If anything, it can feel more unusual to meet an author whose books have the name they were born with on the cover.In the world of modern publishing, the spectrum encompasses everything from “uses a pen name but has an author photo and gives interviews” to “has an opposite gender or gender-neutral author persona”; “uses different pseudonyms for different genres”; “uses a different name for political reasons, eg to escape persecution in their home country, or personal or professional reasons”; and even “secret anonymity” (is anonymous but tries to make it so that no one actually knows they are). Nepotist offspring will often use a less famous parent’s surname to stave off accusations that they owe their success to their connections or, as in the case of AS Byatt, an author may use their married name to distance themselves from a novelist sibling (Margaret Drabble).Envy, ego, pride and pain: what I learned from publishing my first book | Hamilton NolanRead moreTotal anonymity, however, is a different business. The most famous modern example we have is of course Elena Ferrante (or it was, until she was possibly and, to my mind, veryrudely unmaskedby an Italian journalist). Yet even Ferrante did some press through correspondence, including writingfor the Guardian. To not give interviews at all, especially as a young debut author, is unusual indeed, and especially in a publishing landscape where “personal brand” is key, and short stories remain such a hard sell. You could say that Liadan Ní Chuinn’s collection being published at all is something of a miracle.Literary quality is not always prioritised above profile. I cannot tell you how many proofs I am sent by writers who are big on Instagram but can’t string a grammatical sentence together. With publicity budgets not what they used to be and many authors needing to do much of the work themselves, a debut writer who won’t give interviews or attend events represents a challenge to any acquiring publishing house and their publicity department.I admire Ní Chuinn. As an author myself – in the next six months I have two books coming out – I know that the stress of exposure and the risk of burnout can be very real. Ní Chuinn could be forgiven for looking at Sally Rooney, another writer in the same literary ecosystem who started young, and thinking that level of exposure looks unappealing. The way a young woman – because it’s usually a young woman – who creates something great becomes a sort of shorthand for everything that is wrong/right about her chosen art form is hardly an incentive to put yourself out there. Rooney’s writing shows adeep ambivalenceabout fame, and her decision to now largely only put herself forward in the media when it serves her impassionedpolitical beliefsis to be admired. Yet newspapers are still terribly prone to what I call “Rooney-itis”. Look, I’m doing it now.When you’re an author, public exposure doesn’t just affect you, but the people in your life whose stories often overlap with yours. When you are writing about sensitive topics that have a lasting, painful legacy on real people’s lives – as Ní Chuinn does in their excavation of the murderous legacy of English colonialism in Ireland – it can be an act of care and protection to remove yourself from the spotlight.Most of all, it makes the interaction between author and reader purely about the quality of the work. For a publisher to agree to publish an anonymous author, as so many did Ferrante, and publishers in Ireland, the UK and the US have Ní Chuinn, that writer has to be extraordinary. And Ní Chuinn is.It should give any avid reader of fiction – and any author who cares about sentences but is rubbish at TikTok – hope. The work can still be the thing, at least sometimes.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionShort storiesPublishingFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, in Tehran a solitary woman feeds stray cats amid rubble from recent Israeli airstrikes.To the uninitiated viewer, this could be a cinematic retelling of a geopolitical crisis that unfolded barely weeks ago – hastily shot on location, somewhere in the Middle East.However, despite its polished production look, it wasn’t shot anywhere, there is no location, and the woman feeding stray cats is no actor – she doesn’t exist.LiveMidnight Drop, an AI film depicting US-Israeli bombings in IranThe engrossing footage is the “rough cut” of a 12-minute short film about last month’s US attack on Iranian nuclear sites, made by the directors Samir Mallal and Bouha Kazmi. It is also made entirely by artificial intelligence.The clip is based on a detail the film-makers read in news coverage of the US bombings – a woman who walked the empty streets of Tehran feeding stray cats. Armed with the information, they have been able to make a sequence that looks as if it could have been created by a Hollywood director.The impressive speed and, for some, worrying ease with which films of this kind can be made has not been lost on broadcasting experts.Last week Richard Osman, the TV producer and bestselling author, said that an era of entertainment industry history had ended and a new one had begun – all because Google has released a new AI video making tool used by Mallal and others.View image in fullscreenA still from Midnight Drop, showing the woman who feeds stray cats in Tehran in the dead of night.Photograph: Oneday Studios“So I saw this thing and I thought, ‘well, OK that’s the end of one part of entertainment history and the beginning of another’,” he said on The Rest is Entertainment podcast.Osman added: “TikTok, ads, trailers – anything like that – I will say will be majority AI-assisted by 2027.”For Mallal, an award-winning London-based documentary maker who has made adverts for Samsung and Coca-Cola, AI has provided him with a new format – “cinematic news”.The Tehran film, called Midnight Drop, is a follow-up to Spiders in the Sky, a recreation of a Ukrainian drone attack onRussian bombers in June.Within two weeks, Mallal, who directed Spiders in the Sky on his own, was able to make a film about the Ukraine attack that would have cost millions – and would have taken at least two years including development – to make pre-AI.“Using AI, it should be possible to make things that we’ve never seen before,” he said. “We’ve never seen a cinematic news piece before turned around in two weeks. We’ve never seen a thriller based on the news made in two weeks.”Spiders in the Sky was largely made with Veo3, an AI video generation model developed by Google, and other AI tools. The voiceover, script and music were not created by AI, although ChatGPT helped Mallal edit a lengthy interview with a drone operator that formed the film’s narrative spine.LiveFilm-maker recreates Ukrainian drone attack on Russia using AI in Spiders in the SkyGoogle’s film-making tool, Flow,is powered by Veo3. It also creates speech, sound effects and background noise. Since its release in May, the impact of the tool on YouTube – also owned by Google – and social media in generalhas been marked. As Marina Hyde, Osman’s podcast partner, said last week: “The proliferation is extraordinary.”Quite a lot of it is “slop” – the term for AI-generated nonsense – although theOlympic diving dogs have a compelling quality.Mallal and Kazmi aim to complete the film, which will intercut the Iranian’s story with the stealth bomber mission and will be six times the length of Spider’s two minutes, in August. It is being made by a mix of models including Veo3,OpenAI’s Soraand Midjourney.“I’m trying to prove a point,” says Mallal. “Which is that you can make really good stuff at a high level – but fast, at the speed of culture. Hollywood, especially, moves incredibly slowly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the process is accelerated with AI.”Mallal and Kazmi also recently madeAtlas, Interrupted, a short film about the3I/Atlas comet, another recent news event, that has appeared on the BBC.David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI – the term for tools such as chatbots and video generators – to create marketing campaigns, says the advertising world is about to undergo a revolution due to models such as Veo3.“Today, less than 1% of all brand content is created using gen AI.

In the UK, the creative industries are furious about government proposals to let models be trained on copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless the owner opts out of the process.Mallal says he wants to see a “broadly accessible and easy-to-use programme where artists are compensated for their work”.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer andleading campaigner against the government proposals, says AI film-making tools are “fantastic” but “at what point are they going to realise that these tools are literally built on the work of creators?” She adds: “Creators need equity in the new system or we lose something precious.”YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models – and denies that all of YouTube’s inventory has been used to train its models.Mallal calls his use of AI to make films “prompt craft”, a phrase that uses the term for giving instructions to AI systems. When making the Ukraine film, he says he was amazed at how quickly a camera angle or lighting tone could be adjusted with a few taps on a keyboard.“I’m deep into AI. I’ve learned how to prompt engineer. I’ve learned how to translate my skills as a director into prompting. But I’ve never produced anything creative from that. Then Veo3 comes out, and I said, ‘OK, finally, we’re here.’”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Set in 1980s Dublin in the doldrums amid a fractious family and a classroom pop band, it seems at pains to stay bright-eyed, heartwarming, no matter the darker turns of its story.This is its undoing, in some ways. Set with a throwback Top of the Pops soundtrack of new romantic and pop hits (Duran Duran, Blondie, A-ha, and more), it features a group of song-writing teens led by 16-year-old Conor (Sheridan Townsley), whose family’s fortunes are as low as those of recession-hit Dublin. There are his perpetually arguing parents in the background along with his depressed yet wise older brother, Brendan (Adam Hunter), and sister, Anne (Tateyana Arutura), who is under pressure to be the success of the siblings. In the foreground is the band, formed in a council-estate living room, with a motley crew of boys who want to make music to attract girls.Premiering in London following runs in Boston and New York, and directed by Rebecca Taichman, the production is staged in an exuberant if strange in-between register which mixes the naturalism of the coming-of-age film with break-outs into musical expressionism and kinetic projections that fizz around the stage.View image in fullscreenAll mesh and eyeliner … Grace Collender and Sheridan Townsley in Sing Street.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThis melange is certainly theatrical but takes away the nuance and grit of the story, which includes poverty, economic migration, bullying and incest. Spoken scenes are brisk and explanatory. There are a few very peculiar interludes with Brendan moving languorously across the sofa to music. It works better in the second half, which opens with a full-on gig in which we become a stadium-style audience.But Enda Walsh’s script remains spare and thuddingly simplistic in its story; Conor meets love interest, Raphina (Grace Collender), all fish-nets, mesh and eyeliner, propped against a phone-box, and seems to become an instant pop lyricist, with a few helpful platitudes from his brother.There is comedy as the band figures out its look – from Adam Ant-esque dress-up to Cure-style gothicism, but there are not enough adjoining scenes to the songs to give the drama, and its characters, much depth.It seems to aspire to be like The Commitments but feels like a paler reflection. What saves it is the score – the original by Carney and Gary Clark – and the singing. There are high-quality performances and strong voices particularly from Collender and Townsley. Emotion is eked out by the end, although the show drags its feet to get there. Ultimately, it is gig theatre, with a vacuum in-between its uplifting songs.At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 23 AugustThis article was amended on 20 July 2025. Conor’s older brother is Brendan, played by Adam Hunter, not Larry (Harry Curley) as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreLyric HammersmithMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With a wealth of past productions to choose from, Hynes has paired JM Synge’s stark one-act tragedy, Riders to the Sea, with Macbeth.While Synge’s distilled miniature is almost eclipsed by what follows, the plays are linked by a focus on the elemental forces of nature and the shadow of death, with small, telling moments of visual continuity between them. In Synge’s play, a grieving mother (Marie Mullen) has a premonition of the death at sea of her last surviving son (Marty Rea). The keening women and black-cloaked villagers’ laments are later echoed in the guttural cries of the weird sisters, hooded figures from folk horror, who accost Macbeth (Rea) and Banquo (Rory Nolan) on the blasted heath.In both plays the veneer of Christianity is flimsy, while older, primal beliefs and fears hold sway. A statue of the crucified Christ is suspended on the back wall, not high enough to be safe from the predations of Rea’s electrifying Macbeth, while a banquet becomes a twisted Last Supper where glasses are filled with blood-tainted water rather than wine.View image in fullscreenKeening … Marie Mullen in Riders to the Sea.Photograph: Ros KavanaghMullen’s compelling Lady Macbeth is transformed from her husband’s goading, bullying accomplice into a wreck, terrified of his rampaging. While the age-gap between the two actors adds another layer to this relationship, at times closer to mother and son like Volumnia and Coriolanus, it is also completely credible.With the superb cast of 11 making darting entrances through hidden flaps in the walls of designer Francis O’Connor’s stripped wooden set, the pace is unflagging, the menace unrelenting. For the audience seated on three sides, intensity is heightened by proximity to the performers.“O full of scorpions is my mind,” Rea spits out, as Macbeth’s mind and spirit curdle into something monstrous: bloodthirsty and unhinged. This is a medieval world, with shadowy forces and omens, candlelight and mud-covered floors, yet its portrayal of tyranny and the speed with which all civility falls away feels anything but remote.AtGalway international arts festivaluntil 26 July; then at Gaiety theatre, Dublin, forDublin theatre festival, 25 September to 5 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreFestivalsIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Guess!” Twyla Tharp imploredWayne McGregor, in a post-show interview at the Venice Dance Biennale. McGregor, the festival’s artistic director, didn’t dare venture a figure. “Two-hundred and twenty-seven pounds!” she told us all, delightedly.Never underestimate Twyla. The slight, white-haired 84-year-old is as sharp as ever, and a force in the dance world. She’s been choreographing for 60 years, for ballet companies and Broadway, dance both experimental and accessible, art and pop. And she is honoured this year with the biennale’s Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.Tharp is a smart, no-nonsense woman with a dry sense of humour, and her work is much the same. Only two pieces from her vast repertoire are staged inVenicethis year, but one especially, Diabelli (from 1998), set to Beethoven’s 33 Diabelli Variations, has the same precise, self-certain manner as the woman herself. It takes one idea – the rigorous exploration of music and form – and drills into it determinedly. The dance is non-stop, a showcase for the tremendous dancers of her company, all quite different bodies but brilliant technicians, rooted in classicism with Tharp’s easy synthesis of jazz, contemporary and vernacular dance forms. It is absolutely chock-full of steps. That might seem obvious, but a lot of contemporary dance now hinges on vibe, mood and repetitive riffs, whereas Tharp is just step after step, finely and deliberately wrought phrases in constant motion with absolute clarity. With its fairly unwavering tone, from the audience there’s perhaps not as much light and shade as Tharp herself sees – but she has no time for dawdling (there’s a similarity with McGregor’s own work here: the constant fast-paced flying mind, expecting you to keep up).The second piece is the European premiere of Slacktide, set to Philip Glass. It’s new, but interestingly, uses material from Tharp’s back catalogue, reversioned. Compared with Diabelli, the look is certainly more “now”, diffused light, dancers in black shorts and vests, and rather than the front-facing performance mode of the earlier work, the dancers are on their own trajectories, moving between solos and groups. It has a greater sense of freedom, dynamic and edge, but the same very serious conversation with choreography.View image in fullscreenProvocative … Carolina Bianchi’s The Brotherhood.Photograph: Mayra AzziThe winner of the Silver Lion, for an outstanding upcoming choreographer, was the Brazilian Carolina Bianchi. Bianchi has the same absolute commitment to her art as Tharp, but is a completely different proposition. She’s best known for the first part of her Cadela Força trilogy, The Bride and the Goodnight Cinderella, in which Bianchi takes a date rape drug live on stage and then attempts to continue the show while the audience watch its effects take over, made in response to her own experience of sexual assault.The second chapter of the trilogy, The Brotherhood, gets its Italian premiere in Venice and it goes deeper (very much deeper, at almost four hours in length) into Bianchi’s own attempts to process what happened to her: the injustice, the omnipresent patriarchy, the bewilderment over what gives men seeming licence to abuse women, from the rape of Lucretia to Gisèle Pelicot. She does this through film, performance, a faux interview with a famous theatre director, set-pieces with the male performers from company Cara de Cavalo, and addressing the audience directly. She considers hazing initiations, the myth of the troubled genius in art, the politics of the rehearsal room, the subtle undermining of women in professional life. There’s so much here, a bit of editing wouldn’t go amiss (although it doesn’t feel like 220 minutes) but then this is the ever-circling mind after trauma, always returning to the wound, never finding the answer.Fearless Bianchi is sometimes provocatively shocking, she is also constantly questioning herself, getting in her criticisms before anyone else can. Her subjects are theatre, art, violence and anger. And the real question may be, why aren’t we all angrier, all the time, about how commonplace this abuse is? Bianchi introduces herself on stage as predominantly a writer, and this is a text-based show within the realm of performance art, an interesting choice for a dance prize. But the body is absolutely at the centre of her work. Her central question, as she puts it, is what do we do with this body? How to live in a body that survives rape?View image in fullscreenHuman-machine hybrid hexapods … Chunky Move at the Venice Dance Biennale.Photograph: Andrea AvezzuElsewhere at the biennale, the opening show comes from Australia’s Chunky Move, a company established in 1995, now led by Antony Hamilton, who has choreographed U>N>I>T>E>D. The stage is dominated by a large mechanical contraption, a piece of rigging that holds what looks like a giant insect with flashing and glowing lights. The dancers have mechanical limbs too, multijointed insect-y legs attached to them, turning them into human-machine hybrid hexapods.It immediately brought to mind a piece McGregor made for his company in 2002, Nemesis, where the dancers wore mechanical limbs extending their arms. In fact the whole look is very millennium-bug-throwback, like a guerrilla army of hackers who’ve jumped the fence at Glastonbury, in baggy parachute pants with all sorts of straps and layers and clashing patterns and camo and reflective neon. It’s a crusty-cyberpunk look – if you ever went near Brighton in the 1990s, you’d recognise it. Except that in the 90s we barely had mobile phones or email addresses and this kind of tech felt like pure sci-fi, whereas now, the idea of humans getting tech implants or machines becoming sentient is basically the world we live in. So that’s unnerving. But what does Hamilton have to say about it? Not so much. The thing about all the cumbersome props is that they extend the body’s possibilities, but also reduce their ability to move. There’s a vague sense of struggle between embracing or fighting the machines but, just like in the real world, having the technology is one thing, deciding what to use it for, or what you want to say with it, is entirely another. It’s neither stirringly hopeful nor apocalyptic enough to be terrifying. Twyla would have those mechanical critters for breakfast.TheVenice Dance Biennalecontinues until 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsDanceVenice BiennaleVeniceTwyla TharpWayne McGregorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Portrush Surf School, run by pro surfer Martin “TK” Kelly, has availability on a four-day VIP Surf Camp for nine- to 16-year-olds (£140) throughout the summer holidays, or you can book a three-hour family surf or paddleboard lesson (£160 for four; over-nines only).Visitors can get a little further off-the-beaten-track withFree Dive Northern Ireland, which takes groups from Portrush to coastal locations on half-day paddleboard and cave-snorkelling adventures (from £50pp) throughout July and August.Dive into a quarry in SurreyView image in fullscreenDivers Cove, Godstone, SurreyAs water temperatures creep above 20C, it’s a great time to take older kids to try more serious wild swimming. In Godstone, Surrey, a sand-extraction site has been converted into a natural swimming lake known asDivers Cove. Circuits of up to 650 metres are marked out around the lake, and all sessions are overseen by lifeguards (£10.99; over-sevens only).Younger kids might prefer the nearby green flag-awardedFrensham Great Pond, which has a roped-off swimming area and gentle shelving beach. And at Box Hill, visitors can experience one ofNature Calling’s six new art projects.Dawn After Night, Spring After Winteris a free digital adventure game designed to help more people connect with their local landscapes.Wildcamping on DartmoorView image in fullscreenDartmoor offers a great opportunity to learn the responsibilities of wild camping.Photograph: Lee Pengelly/AlamyThe Supreme Court recently upheld the legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor, providing an excellent opportunity to educate the next generation about the joys and responsibilities of wild camping. Before embarking on an adventure, read up on the code of conduct – which includes rules on travelling light, leaving no trace and staying out of sight – and find out where you’re allowed to camp using the national park’sbackpack camping map. The Dartmoor Preservation Association has also created a handy guide tothe 3Ps(pees, poos and periods) when wild camping. If the idea of pitching up alone is too much, try booking a spot atBeardown Farm, which has two wild campsites on a 450-hectare working farm on the high moor. Pitches (from £5 per adult; £2.50 per child) include communal tap and fire pits, plus a composting toilet in summer.‘Farmtivities’ in SomersetView image in fullscreenHigher Farm near Castle Cary.Photograph: Dave WattsIn just two years, brothers Giacomo and Matteo have transformedHigher Farmnear Castle Cary from a traditional dairy farm into a biodynamic hub. In May this year, the 20-hectare site – with 2,000 newly planted trees, a swimming lake, orchards, and two friendly pigs named Clover and Pumpkin – opened for the summer season. Day visitors can join in “farmtivities” throughout the summer, including self-guided farm tours, pick-your-own and feeding the animals. A pizza van is open on Saturdays, and there’s a play area for kids. Guests can also spend the night in a secluded spot, tucked into two heated yurt cabins, each sleeping three people (£130 a night, two nights minimum).Own a pony for a dayinLancashireView image in fullscreenHorse bonding includes mucking out, grooming and riding.Photograph: Photo_Concepts/Getty Images/Image SourceThe Horse and Pony Protection Association (Happa) is offering children the chance toown a pony for a day(£35) at its site overlooking Thursden Valley near Burnley this summer, helping six to 16-year-olds understand what it takes to look after a horse, including mucking out, grooming, walking with the ponies and riding. There’s also a cafe, education trail and outdoor park.Meanwhile, near Preston,Alpaca Foldis running an alpaca walking experience (£20 per adult; £15 for 16s and under) on its 14-hectare site close to Samlesbury village, this summer.

So whose version gets it just right?Felicity CloakeSun 20 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 20 Jul 2025 08.02 EDTShareFritto misto(the term for “mixed fry” sounds so much better in Italian, somehow) is, in the words ofKatie Caldesi, “an assortment of deep-fried vegetables, fish or meats … all bite-size, intended to be eaten with fingers and a wedge of lemon”. And she should know, because she loves the stuff so much that she served fritto misto at her wedding to chef Giancarlo. It’s pure crisp, relaxed holiday pleasure – a simple crowdpleaser that everyone can dig into together, with, as Caldesi observes, a winning element of surprise: “You don’t know what is hidden beneath the batter until you’ve bitten into it.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘Mixed small fish” of River Cafe’s fritto misto. Thumbnails: Felicity.On that note, and because my memories of the dish involve rustling salty piles washed down with well-chilledcarafes ofvino della casaat seaside restaurants, I always think of the fishy version (properlyfritto misto di mare), but I’ve given suggestions below for a vegetable alternative so everyone can enjoy the feast. After all, as the Tuscans say,fritta è buona anche una suola di scarpa(even the sole of a shoe tastes good fried).The fishAlan Davidson’s magisterial 1972 work Mediterranean Seafoodexplains that, while fritto misto is “one of the most common fish dishes in restaurants on the Italian coast … the composition varies according to what is available, and there are scores of possible combinations. In Venice,” he adds, “a typical mixture would be from the following range: inkfish or squid; soft-shell crabs; prawns or shrimp; eel; sardines. In Naples, the list would be shorter.” Quoting one signora Jeanne Caròla, he writes: “Ourfritto di pesce, the ultra-classical one, is not too varied: red mullet and squid only.”View image in fullscreenCesare Casella and Stephanie Lyness’s fritto misto demands fish fillets be used.With such a simple recipe, you should be guided by what’s freshest, or what looks best, at the fishmonger – that’s the Italian way. However, my job here is to test recipes as written, so obediently I went out to find large raw prawns, which most recipes call for, along with baby squid. Cesare Casella and Stephanie Lyness’s The Fundamental Techniques of Classic Italian Cuisinedemands fish fillets; Tessa Kiros’ Twelvespecifies red mullet, so, happening upon a fine Cornish example at my local fishmonger, I use that in both.Sasha Marx’s recipe for Serious Eats, meanwhile, substitutes the usual sardines and anchovies for the North American smelt, which I swap back to anchovies. Caldesi, too, goes for anchovies, though she sandwiches tinned ones in fresh sage leaves, thereby adding a pop of salty perfume that proves irresistible; in fact, one of my testers asks why I can’t just make a whole plate of those instead.The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbooksimply calls for “mixed small fish” (though its authors note that the day they went to the market, they were lucky enough to find “langoustines, soles, mullets, eels, prawns andmoscardini[baby octopus]”), which, in my case, means the anchovies and the whitebait I’ve already bought for Russell Norman’s version. These are soaked in milk for 15 minutes before cooking – though Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray don’t say why, it’s said to reduce the “fishy” flavour. Fresh fish ought not to need this treatment, so I’ve thrown caution to the wind and skipped this step.View image in fullscreenKatie Caldesi sandwiches tinned anchovies in fresh sage leaves, adding ‘a pop of salty perfume that proves irresistible’.Whatever you go for (do play about with my suggested selection below), it’s very easy to overcook seafood – to my mind, the prawns stand up best to the fierce heat of the hot oil, even more so if, like Marx, you leave the shells on. But if crunching through them isn’t your idea of fun, you might prefer to remove them first. If you fancy using fish (and the more textures and flavours here, the merrier, as far as I’m concerned), I find that small whole ones work better than fillets or cubes of mullet, which are difficult to cook perfectly and have a tendency to stick or fall apart. You could also use soft-shell crabs, scallops, mussels, even oysters; anything that appeals, really.The vegetablesVegetables are very much an optional extra, but I like the freshness that they bring to the dish – or as much as anything that’s been deep-fried can be said to be “fresh”. Caldesi suggests cauliflower and artichokes, Kiros artichokes, asparagus, courgettes and tomatoes, and Casella and Lynness courgettes and aubergine, plus sprigs of sage, parsley and basil. The artichokes, to my and my testers’ surprise, prove the favourites; they don’t seem to give off much water (courgettes and aubergines, on the other hand, are prone to turning soggy) and their shape provides lots of interesting ridges for the batter to cling to. But they’re so seasonal that I’ve substituted the more easily sourced fennel bulb, whose aniseed flavour I think pairs better with fish. If you’d prefer to keep things vegetarian, use a mixture of vegetables that take your fancy, but avoid anything with a high water content such as mushrooms and ripe tomatoes.The batterView image in fullscreenSasha Marx’s fritto misto: the mixture of semolina and cornflour helps to keep it crisper for longer.Where the recipes really differ is in the batter they use, which varies fromchef Pasquale Torrente’s mere dusting of semolina flour to the enriched, beer-spiked batter inthe Caldesis’ The Italian Cookery Course. Being a sucker for carbs, I admit to a fatal weakness for the more robust and shatteringly crisp batter shell – somewhere between tempura and a fish supper – produced by Caldesi, Kiros andAngela Hartnett’s recipes.As with so much here, however, it’s a matter of personal preference; if you like your seafood plain and simple, just dip it in seasoned semolina, or in the mixture of semolina and cornflour used by Marx, which does indeed help to keep it crisper for longer, or in the River Cafe’s flour before frying. (Semolina gives a grittier consistency; Casella and Lynness mix cornmeal and flour for a similar, but even craggier result.)Flour, according toHarold McGee’s seminal On Food & Cooking, is the ingredient that has the “largest influence on batter quality … the gluten proteins in ordinary wheat flour are valuable for the clinginess they provide, but they form elastic gluten and absorb moisture and fat, and so are responsible for chewiness and oiliness in the fried crust. For these reasons, moderate-protein flours make better batters than bread flour.” Though I don’t find any recipes that call for bread flour, several mention the finely milled 00 flour traditionally used in pasta making, possibly because it’s one that’s often found in Italian kitchens. The example I buy, however, proves higher in protein than my standard plain variety, so I’ve stuck with the latter, cut with cornflour, which, as McGee explains, “improves crispness because its relatively large particles are less absorbent, and its proteins dilute wheat gluten and reduce the chewiness of the crust”.View image in fullscreenThe dredge of Russell Norman’s fritto misto has ‘an ethereal, tempura-like effect’.Much as I appreciate an excuse to crack open a bottle while cooking, I favour the plainer, water-based batters to those made with beer and wine, or indeed eggs and milk (with a special mention to the whisked egg whites inNorman’s book Polpo, which give his dredge an ethereal, tempura-like effect). Cold sparkling water, in particular, produces a deliciously light, crisp result. If you’re a real perfectionist, you might take Hartnett’s advice and stir the batter over a bowl of iced water, because the colder the batter, the slower the gluten formation. I find simply using fridge-cold water and being careful not to overmix (chopsticks are, as she says, ideal for the purpose) work well enough for me.I don’t think Marx’s baking powder is necessary, given the sparkling water, nor Caldesi’s pinch of sugar, which I suspect is, like the milk in many recipes, more there to encourage the batter to brown than to add an overt sweetness. Fritto misto tends to be rather paler than, say, an onion ring; more a ghostly tentacle than a bronzed rubber band.The cookingView image in fullscreenLocal produce: Tessa Kiros’s fritto misto.This is one recipe that you must, I’m afraid, get out the oil for: the clue is in the name. A high heat is best – Casella and Lynness’s 165C feels too cool, and the seafood takes ages to brown, leaving some of it overcooked. Better to go in hot and fast, as Hartnett and several others recommend – though, unless you have a huge fryer, I’d also urge you to cook the different elements separately, to prevent the squid overcooking while the prawns are still floppy and wan. It’s also best, if doing both vegetables and seafood, to cook the former first, or everything will end up tasting of fish.Serve hot, with plenty of salt and wedges of lemon to squeeze over the top.Perfect fritto mistoThe ingredients list is just a guide, so feel free to swap in seafood and vegetables as desired.Prep25 minCook10 min(depending on the size of your pan)Serves42 fennel bulbs300g squid, baby or large, cleaned if necessary8 large raw shell-on prawns, or 12 medium ones200g small whole fish(ie, whitebait)16 sage leaves8 anchovy fillets in oil, drained125g plain flour, plus extra for dusting25g cornflourSaltNeutral oil, for frying250ml very cold sparkling waterLemon wedges, to serveTrim the fennel and cut it into chunky wedges.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Robert Billington/The Guardian.

Wash the small fish. Pat everything dry.View image in fullscreenPair up the sage leaves with ones of fairly equal size, then sandwich an anchovy fillet between each pair (you may need to trim one end off some of the anchovies for neatness).View image in fullscreenPut the flours in a large bowl and season with salt. Put a little more plain flour on a plate.Pour enough neutral oil into a large, heavy saucepan to fill it by no more than a third and heat to 190C (alternatively, set a deep-fat fryer to heat to 190C). Turn on the oven to low and line a baking tray with kitchen paper.View image in fullscreenWhen the oil is almost up to temperature, quickly stir the cold sparkling water into the bowl of seasoned flours, mixing as little as possible; don’t worry if there are lumps.As soon as the oil is ready, toss the fennel in the plate of flour to coat, shake off the excess, then dip it in the batter. Shake the excess back into the bowl and carefully drop the fennel into the hot oil (don’t overcrowd the pan or the oil will cool down too far and its contents will go soggy, so if necessary fry everything in batches), stirring once so it doesn’t stick or clump. Fry for a couple of minutes, until pale golden brown, then scoop out with a slotted spoon on to the kitchen paper, blot off any excess oil and put in the low oven to keep warm.View image in fullscreenRepeat with the prawns, followed by the squid, then the little fish, and finally the sage and anchovy sandwiches, making sure the oil comes back up to temperature each time, and bearing in mind that the prawns will probably take a little longer (three or so minutes if they’re large specimens) than the squid. Go by eye: the batter should be crisp and pale gold, rather than bronzed.View image in fullscreenOnce everything is fried and ready, tip on to a serving plate, season with salt and serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over the top (and with a bowl for the prawn heads and shells).Fritto misto: the capo of all fried foods, or does someone else fry seafood better?

If the lofty scofferati could have found a way to scupper Big Mamma’s growth, they probably would have, because these restaurants are unashamedly focused on big, sexy, silly and Italian-inspired fun. The dining rooms are styled with the chaotic yet elegant detail of a big-budget movie set; no two are remotely the same, but each branch is connected by dependably over-the-top Italian serving staff, usually male and every one of them determined to be your best friend all the way from the antipasti to thedolci, even if your stiff British mentality fights their displays of chumminess.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’smillefoglie di patate con tartare di manzo e tartufo: ‘Not remotely delicious.’The latest Big Mamma opening,Barbarella in Canary Wharf, east London, is no different, and features all of those elements with which we’ve become so familiar: the tall, wobbly lemon meringue pie, the camp banquettes, the huge flappy menu with 100-plus items all written in Italian and in a teensy-tiny red font. At Barbarella, there are also oversized sculptures, vintageFiorucciin glass display cases and, vibe-wise, a large scoop of Gaga does House of Gucci.Why are clever food people so sniffy about Big Mamma, despite its restaurants being full to the brim every night? Well, there are two reasons: first, Barbarella and her sisters are determinedly fun; almost forced fun, if we’re completely honest. Just try telling your server that you’re not here to have a laugh, but instead have come for a sparse, sensible, calorie-counting meal, so there’s no need for a double martini or to be spooned tiramisu from a huge bowl by a winking man from Sicily called Gianluca. They just won’t understand you. The second, and possibly more logical reason for the raised eyebrows is because – let’s cut to the chase – the food inallof these restaurants isn’t always terribly good and is sometimes actively awful.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’s £36 linguine alla lobster: ‘Fine, if nothing earth-shattering.’Not that you’ll ever cajole any of the staff into admitting that: “This tiramisu is my favourite tiramisu in the world, even better than my own nonna’s,” is just one line directed at me at Barbarella. The staff simply cannot break character, so all the pasta is, according to them at least, “freshly made this hour” and “better than they serve in the village I come from in Italy”. Every T-bone steak is the juiciest and every brunello on the extensive wine-list is the most thoughtfully sourced. You’ve more chance of seeing Mickey Mouse at the front of a Disney parade with his headpiece off and smoking a Marlboro than hear a Barbarella server admit that this food is just OK – and hugely overpriced, too.Not that you’d really want that, either. Barbarella, like all of these places, is about escapism, boisterous group dining and being swept up in the moment, with someone else – a lover, a boss, a father-in-law – hopefully picking up the hefty bill afterwards. Lunching here stone-cold sober is a real eye-opener. I’ve only ever been to a Big Mamma restaurant while a bit tipsy, but here I’m being served a £24 plate of “millefoglie di patate con tartaredi manzo e tartufo”, or a sort of cold fried potato rösti with a spoon of unseasoned beef tartare that’s not remotely delicious. A courgette and cheeseinsalatalimps on to my table hoping for love, but it’s another hopeless state of affairs. This is not good courgette, these are not pleasant croutons.View image in fullscreenBarbarella’s tiramisu: ‘Rich, thick and cocoa-covered’ with optional seconds.Next up, lobster linguine for £36 in a thick, one-note bisque sauce and with half a lobster on top – fine, but nothing earth-shattering. A £38 fillet steak with green peppercorn sauce is by some distance the most delicious thing we eat, and comes with a side of actually great rosemary potatoes. Then again, it’s also probably the least Italian thing on the menu. But the tiramisu is, as ever, rich, thick, cocoa-covered and comes with that timeworn trick of offering a second scoop to denote largesse.Upstairs is the place to sit, it being the room with all the movie-star glamour; downstairs is, dare I say, a little less exciting. But, from my seat by the till (not somewhere I wanted to linger) and having to move plates about to make them fit on a tiny table that’s about as big as one of the pizzas, there’s just something about Barbarella that left me a little cold. Perhaps glamour isn’t supposed to be practical. The wild Italian party continues in Canary Wharf regardless, but I don’t think I’ll be running back for a scoop of gelato any time soon.BarbarellaUnit 3, YY London, 30 South Colonnade, London E14 (no phone).
