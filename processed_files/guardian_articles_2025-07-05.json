It has not been an epic show – just War Pigs, NIB, Iron Man and Paranoid – but is the farewell this extraordinary band deserve, with an undercard of stadium-fillers and festival headliners come to pay tribute.The returning Bill Ward adds the swing other Sabbath drummers have never managed, Tony Iommi churns out those monstrous riffs, Geezer Butler flits around them on bass, andOzzy Osbourne… is Ozzy Osbourne, a baffled and discomfited force of nature.At a packed Villa Park, 40,000 metalheads – plus a peak of 5.8m more on the accompanying livestream – have seen their dreams come true in what is basically metal’s Live Aid, right down to the revolving stage. They have been, as many from the stage remind us, part of history.All of Birmingham has draped itself in black for the final appearance of its prodigal sons. The four members of Sabbath were granted the freedom of the city this week, and the tourist board has declared this the “Summer of Sabbath”, with events not just this weekend, but right through the season. And, of course, there have been the other genuflections towards the group: the renaming of a bridge in their honour, the dedication of a bench, theBlack Sabbath ballet(which returns to the city this autumn), and the giant “tifo” of Ozzy Osbourne that the Holte End of Villa Park unveiled last football season.‘I don’t want to die in a hotel room somewhere’: Black Sabbath on reconciling for their final gig – and how Ozzy is living through hellRead moreSabbath are so indistinguishable from Birmingham at this point (the “home of metal”, as the city likes to remind us) that it was inevitable their final show should happen in the city, just as their previous last-ever shows did, in 1999 and 2017. This time, though, with Osbourne’s health a matter of public concern, this surely will be the last time. Certainly, Ozzy dominates proceedings before even stepping on to the stage, in a way that leaves a slightly sour aftertaste: Ticketmaster sends punters reminders before the gig about the Ozzy Osbourne show, not the Black Sabbath show. Even the Test Match Special team, across at Edgbaston, are talking about it: there’s an Ozzy standup cutout surrounded by black balloons in his hotel lobby, notes former England skipper Michael Vaughan.In truth, Sabbath’s relationship with Birmingham has not been so close as both sides would like to pretend. One fan site lists all known gigs, and there were plenty of tours during which the band didn’t visit their home town. During their 1970s heyday, especially, they were too busy touring America incessantly to pay more than cursory attention to the UK. It’s entirely possible that more people from Cleveland or Detroit or Pittsburgh than actual Brummies have seen Sabbath live.Perhaps those years across the Atlantic also account for the composition of the bill, which is heavily weighted in favour of the US – it might have been nice to see some of their West Midlands descendants on the bill, and while KK Downing is there, his presence perhaps precludes the attendance of his former band Judas Priest, with whom relations are fraught. Nevertheless, the bill comprises a list of hard rock superstars, some of which raise questions all of their own: will Guns N’ Roses, even this new, professional iteration, be able to manage a seven-minute changeover and stick to a 15-minute set?After a greeting from master of ceremonies, Hollywood actor Jason Momoa – a fitful and baffling presence through the day – Mastodon begin proceedings, in front of a stadium already nearly full by 1pm. Giant beach balls in Villa’s claret and blue and Ozzy emblazoned on them bounce around the front of the crowd, as the breeze flicks the sound back and forth. To be fair, though, you wouldn’t realise they had recently shed their lead singer/guitarist and replaced him with an expert YouTube shredder. And like the bands that follow them, they offer up a Sabbath cover in homage.Rival Sons’ cleaner, bluesier riffs are better suited to the booming stadium sound than Mastodon’s technical grinding. How Anthrax were must remain a mystery to me: sets are so short (around 15 minutes), turnarounds so quick and bar queues so immense that those who try to get a drink at the end of one set are sure to miss the whole of the next.View image in fullscreenHuge response … Yungblud sings with one of the concert’s superstar lineups.Photograph: Kazuyo HorieFronting Halestorm – who don’t cut through – Lzzy Hale asks where all her “women of heavy metal are”, and maybe a twentieth of the crowd raise their hands, but for all the drinking and the testosterone, there is no lairiness or aggression in the air. Even if plastic bottles had been allowed in, no one would be bottled off today.Much of the afternoon, though, passes in a blur of growled vocals and downtuned guitars. Sets are too short to build momentum, though the inverse of that is that even the most metal-agnostic get no chance to be bored: no one has the time to be self-indulgent. And as the beer kicks in, the crowd liven up: the first circle pits appear during Lamb of God’s set, 90 minutes in, and they get the first true roar for covering Children of the Grave, Sabbath’s 1971 classic, though it doesn’t benefit from Bill Ward’s shuffles being replaced with double kick-drums.The first of the day’s two all-star bands is fronted by Hale but the day is so focused on Ozzy that the big shout-out goes to his former guitarist Jake E Lee. It’s a set of covers, with rotating singers and players, and A Shot in the Dark is the first sighting of the hair metal side of Osbourne’s career, before a thrillingly brutal Sweet Leaf.Yungblud is a change of pace and generation, opening with Changes, the piano waltz from the fourth Sabbath record. He’s sincere, passionate and wins a huge response from a crowd who might not be familiar with him, compelling a whole-stadium singalong. One song and he’s gone, having stolen the first third of the show.As the day passes, Alice in Chains are sluggish, but Gojira impressively pulverising, playing with clarity and directness. Their intricate lead guitar lines somehow serve the PA and the breeze, and for Mea Culpa – accompanied by a soprano – the circle pits reopen. They seem charmingly nervous about introducing their Sabbath cover, Under the Sun, but they shouldn’t be. They kill it.View image in fullscreenMusical director Tom Morello and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler at Back to the Beginning.Photograph: Ross HalfinThey’re followed by a three-drummer superstar drum-off, inserted into a cursory cover of the mighty Symptom of the Universe, rearranged for multiple drum solos. No matter that Momoa insists drums are the heartbeat of heavy metal – drum solos are actually its blocked U-bend. That’s followed by Billy Corgan singing Breaking the Law accompanied by local hero KK Downing and Tom Morello, at which point it’s starting to feel like the metal Royal Variety show: only here would Corgan give way to Sammy Hagar, who kills the momentum stone dead. The variety show air is not quelled by Steven Tyler and Ronnie Wood assembling for Train Kept a Rollin’, before Walk This Way gets the biggest cheer of the day so far, immediately surpassed when the ensemble launch into Whole Lotta Love.The wholly tribal nature of the event is illustrated when Pantera take the stage and Cowboys From Hell gets tens of thousands singing along. Thankfully, Phil Anselmo chooses not to offer any of his favourite white power slogans as accompaniment. Tool, too, are greeted like heroes, though their prog-metal is baffling to the uninitiated.One can see the stadium-readiness when the very biggest turns arrive. After Slayer – which is like listening to road works, take that as compliment or not – Guns N’ Roses patrol the stage as if they own it, opening with Sabbath’s Never Say Die, with Axl Rose on surprisingly good voice. They play Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, too, and only throw in a couple of their own big hits, Paradise City and Welcome to the Jungle. Metallica are fantastic – taut and aggressive from their opening cover of Hole in the Sky. It helps, too, that in For Whom the Bell Tolls they have half a dozen of metal’s greatest riffs in one song.And then, at last it’s Ozzy. He arrived on stage in a black throne, from which he does not stir. During Coming Home, his struggle with pitch is both painful and moving: he seems on the brink of tears as the crowd carry him home, but brings everything back with a triumphant Crazy Train.There’s a clear distinction between Ozzy’s set and Sabbath’s set. Ozzy’s, of course, is based largely on his 80s solo hits. Mr Crowley, which opens with ominous organ, is ludicrous in its cod-satanism, but equally marvellous. It is perhaps daring for Ozzy to play Suicide Solution – the song that was seen as promoting death among young metalheads – but in this crowd it’s a celebration rather than a commiseration.View image in fullscreenThe prince on his throne … Ozzy Osbourne.Photograph: Ross Halfin/Black SabbathSabbath, by contrast, draw solely on their first two albums. Fortunately, for those who wish to hear more, throughout the show the assembled artists visit the Sabbath catalogue with great frequency and ardour.Nevertheless, none of them have the unique bludgeoning force that the forefathers of heavy music still possess. On the big screens you can see Tony Iommi’s false fingertips, employed to enable him to play those downtuned chords for the decades since he lost those digits in a factory accident. And the band pay tribute to their surroundings: to close their set, Geezer Butler plays a bass in Villa’s claret and blue colours with the club motto printed on the body. It’s a very Birmingham way of doing things on what has been a very international day.It’s affecting to see how united the crowd are behind Ozzy, with plenty of wiped tears during his solo set. But in the end, the night, rightly, belongs not just to him, but to four Brummies who changed rock music for ever.Explore more on these topicsMusicBlack SabbathOzzy OsbourneMetalPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

He’s a naturally charismatic guy and, while I wasn’t immune to his charms, I didn’t think of him again until nearly a year later when I saw him on a dating app.I swiped to say hello and he invited me to go rock climbing. I chickened out at the last minute but a few months later Moe joined the same gym as me. We became fast friends, regularly training and trail running together.I was at university at the time, living with my parents and dating someone else. I loved spending time with Moe but didn’t register an inkling of romance between us. We slipped easily into a close friendship and were soon having dinner together a few nights a week.View image in fullscreenMariah and Moe in 2017As my trust in our friendship deepened, I opened up to Moe about the problems in my relationship. At a dimly lit Indian restaurant in Liverpool on a cool autumn night I poured my heart out. My unhappiness felt like a shameful secret I’d been keeping from everyone, even myself, but I felt no judgment from Moe.I have always had a tendency to get stuck in tricky feelings, becoming frozen by all the ways I could handle a situation. I hate the idea of getting things wrong. That evening Moe was so sage and understanding, all my misguided shame melted away. I could suddenly see a way forward. His ability to help me untangle myself is still one of the things I appreciate most about him.That relationship ended not long afterwards and, while I was adamant Moe and I were strictly platonic, we were training and eating dinner together every day and bought puppies from the same litter. There were raised eyebrows among our friends and family, who assumed we were an item. I was in full-blown denial. I didn’t know what anyone was talking about – we were just mates!In early October 2017 we wrapped up training as usual but, when Moe asked me to join him for dinner, his tone was different. The intensity of his voice and the look in his eyes ignited such nervousness in me that I turned his request down. But something had clicked, I knew I was on the precipice of a life-altering moment. I had to sleep on it.View image in fullscreenMariah and Moe on their wedding day at Uluru in 2020The next night, in our sweaty gym clothes, we headed to a local Vietnamese spot. I was twitching with nerves and, as the meal ended, the whole scene started to feel like a romance novel.

It was incredible.In a way nothing had changed but at the same time everything had. It was humbling to realise that everything we were was already there, I had just been oblivious to what it could become.By Halloween I knew I’d marry him and our son was born a year later. As I battled through pre- and postnatal depression my default was to disappear into myself. That old shame came knocking again. But as usual Moe was the calming, reassuring presence I needed.

But a series of shocking incidents – from drivers trapped in burning vehicles to dramatic stops on the highway – have led to questions about the safety of the brand. Why won’t Tesla give any answers?Sönke Iwersen and Michael VerfürdenSat 5 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt was a Monday afternoon in June 2023 when Rita Meier, 45, joined us for a video call. Meier told us about the last time she said goodbye to her husband, Stefan, five years earlier. He had been leaving their home near Lake Constance, Germany, heading for a trade fair in Milan.Meier recalled how he hesitated between taking hisTeslaModel S or her BMW. He had never driven the Tesla that far before. He checked the route for charging stations along the way and ultimately decided to try it. Rita had a bad feeling. She stayed home with their three children, the youngest less than a year old.At 3.18pm on 10 May 2018, Stefan Meier lost control of his Model S on the A2 highway near the Monte Ceneri tunnel. Travelling at about 100kmh (62mph), he ploughed through several warning markers and traffic signs before crashing into a slanted guardrail. “The collision with the guardrail launches the vehicle into the air, where it flips several times before landing,” investigators would write later.The car came to rest more than 70 metres away, on the opposite side of the road, leaving a trail of wreckage. According to witnesses, the Model S burst into flames while still airborne. Several passersby tried to open the doors and rescue the driver, but they couldn’t unlock the car. When they heard explosions and saw flames through the windows, they retreated. Even the firefighters, who arrived 20 minutes later, could do nothing but watch the Tesla burn.At that moment, Rita Meier was unaware of the crash. She tried calling her husband, but he didn’t pick up. When he still hadn’t returned her call hours later – highly unusual for this devoted father – she attempted to track his car using Tesla’s app. It no longer worked. By the time police officers rang her doorbell late that night, Meier was already bracing for the worst.Customers described their cars suddenly accelerating or braking hard. Some escaped with a scare; others ended up in ditchesThe crash made headlines the next morning as one of the first fatal Tesla accidents in Europe. Tesla released a statement to the press saying the company was “deeply saddened” by the incident, adding, “We are working to gather all the facts in this case and are fully cooperating with local authorities.”To this day, Meier still doesn’t know why her husband died. She has kept everything the police gave her after their inconclusive investigation. The charred wreck of the Model S sits in a garage Meier rents specifically for that purpose. The scorched phone – which she had forensically analysed at her own expense, to no avail – sits in a drawer at home. Maybe someday all this will be needed again, she says. She hasn’t given up hope of uncovering the truth.Rita Meier was one of many people who reached out to us after we began reporting on theTesla Files– a cache of 23,000 leaked documents and 100 gigabytes of confidential data shared by an anonymous whistleblower. The first report we published looked at problems with Tesla’s autopilot system, which allows the cars to temporarily drive on their own, taking over steering, braking and acceleration.Though touted by the company as “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), it is designed to assist, not replace, the driver, who should keep their eyes on the road and be ready to intervene at any time.Autonomous driving is the core promise around whichElon Muskhas built his company. Tesla has never delivered a truly self-driving vehicle, yet the richest person in the world keeps repeating the claim that his cars will soon drive entirely without human help. Is Tesla’s autopilot really as advanced as he says?The Tesla Files suggest otherwise. They contain more than 2,400 customer complaints about unintended acceleration and more than 1,500 braking issues – 139 involving emergency braking without cause, and 383 phantom braking events triggered by false collision warnings. More than 1,000 crashes are documented. A separate spreadsheet on driver-assistance incidents where customers raised safety concerns lists more than 3,000 entries. The oldest date from 2015, the most recent from March 2022. In that time, Tesla delivered roughly 2.6m vehicles with autopilot software. Most incidents occurred in the US, but there have also been complaints from Europe and Asia. Customers described their cars suddenly accelerating or braking hard. Some escaped with a scare; others ended up in ditches, crashing into walls or colliding with oncoming vehicles. “After dropping my son off in his school parking lot, as I go to make a right-hand exit it lurches forward suddenly,” one complaint read. Another said, “My autopilot failed/malfunctioned this morning (car didn’t brake) and I almost rear-ended somebody at 65mph.” A third reported, “Today, while my wife was driving with our baby in the car, it suddenly accelerated out of nowhere.”Braking for no reason caused just as much distress. “Our car just stopped on the highway. That was terrifying,” a Tesla driver wrote. Another complained, “Frequent phantom braking on two-lane highways. Makes the autopilot almost unusable.” Some report their car “jumped lanes unexpectedly”, causing them to hit a concrete barrier, or veered into oncoming traffic.Musk has given the world many reasons to criticise him since he teamed up with Donald Trump. Many people do – mostly by boycotting his products. But while it is one thing to disagree with the political views of a business leader, it is another to be mortally afraid of his products. In the Tesla Files, we found thousands of examples of why such fear may be justified.View image in fullscreen‘My husband died in an unexplained accident. And no one cared.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianWe set out to match some of these incidents of autopilot errors with customers’ names. Like hundreds of other Tesla customers, Rita Meier entered the vehicle identification number of her husband’s Model S into the response form we published on the website of the German business newspaper Handelsblatt, for which we carried out our investigation. She quickly discovered that the Tesla Files contained data related to the car. In her first email to us, she wrote, “You can probably imagine what it felt like to read that.”There isn’t much information – just an Excel spreadsheet titled “Incident Review”. A Tesla employee noted that the mileage counter on Stefan Meier’s car stood at 4,765 miles at the time of the crash. The entry was catalogued just one day after the fatal accident. In the comment field was written, “Vehicle involved in an accident.” The cause of the crash remains unknown to this day. In Tesla’s internal system, a company employee had marked the case as “resolved”, but for five years, Rita Meier had been searching for answers. After Stefan’s death, she took over the family business – a timber company with 200 employees based in Tettnang, Baden-Württemberg. As journalists, we are used to tough interviews, but this one was different. We had to strike a careful balance – between empathy and the persistent questioning good reporting demands. “Why are you convinced the Tesla was responsible for your husband’s death?” we asked her. “Isn’t it possible he was distracted – maybe looking at his phone?”No one knows for sure. But Meier was well aware that Musk has previously claimed Tesla “releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately and always will”; that he has bragged many times about how its superior handling of data sets the company apart from its competitors. In the case of her husband, why was she expected to believe there was no data?Meier’s account was structured and precise. Only once did the toll become visible – when she described how her husband’s body burned in full view of the firefighters. Her eyes filled with tears and her voice cracked. She apologised, turning away. After she collected herself, she told us she has nothing left to gain – but also nothing to lose. That was why she had reached out to us. We promised to look into the case.Rita Meier wasn’t the only widow to approach us. Disappointed customers, current and former employees, analysts and lawyers were sharing links to our reporting. Many of them contacted us. More than once, someone wrote that it was about time someone stood up to Tesla – and to Elon Musk.Meier, too, shared our articles and the callout form with others in her network – including people who, like her, lost loved ones in Tesla crashes. One of them was Anke Schuster. Like Meier, she had lost her husband in a Tesla crash that defies explanation and had spent years chasing answers. And, like Meier, she had found her husband’s Model X listed in the Tesla Files. Once again, the incident was marked as resolved – with no indication of what that actually meant.“My husband died in an unexplained and inexplicable accident,” Schuster wrote in her first email. Her dealings with police, prosecutors and insurance companies, she said, had been “hell”. No one seemed to understand how a Tesla works. “I lost my husband. His four daughters lost their father. And no one ever cared.”Her husband, Oliver, was a tech enthusiast, fascinated by Musk. A hotelier by trade, he owned no fewer than four Teslas. He loved the cars. She hated them – especially the autopilot. The way the software seemed to make decisions on its own never sat right with her. Now, she felt as if her instincts had been confirmed in the worst way.We uncovered an ominous black box in which every byte of  customer data was collected – and sealed off from public scrutinyOliver Schuster was returning from a business meeting on 13 April 2021 when his black Model X veered off highway B194 between Loitz and Schönbeck in north-east Germany. It was 12.50pm when the car left the road and crashed into a tree. Schuster started to worry when her husband missed a scheduled bank appointment. She tried to track the vehicle but found no way to locate it. Even calling Tesla led nowhere. That evening, the police broke the news: after the crash her husband’s car had burst into flames. He had burned to death – with the fire brigade watching helplessly.The crashes that killed Meier’s and Schuster’s husbands were almost three years apart but the parallels were chilling. We examined accident reports, eyewitness accounts, crash-site photos and correspondence with Tesla. In both cases, investigators had requested vehicle data from Tesla, and the company hadn’t provided it. In Meier’s case, Tesla staff claimed no data was available. In Schuster’s, they said there was no relevant data.Over the next two years, we spoke with crash victims, grieving families and experts around the world. What we uncovered was an ominous black box – a system designed not only to collect and control every byte of customer data, but to safeguard Musk’s vision of autonomous driving. Critical information was sealed off from public scrutiny.Elon Musk is a perfectionist with a tendency towards micromanagement. At Tesla, his whims seem to override every argument – even in matters of life and death. During our reporting, we came across the issue of door handles. On Teslas, they retract into the doors while the cars are being driven. The system depends on battery power. If an airbag deploys, the doors are supposed to unlock automatically and the handles extend – at least, that’s what the Model S manual says.The idea for the sleek, futuristic design stems from Musk himself. He insisted on retractable handles, despite repeated warnings from engineers. Since 2018, they have been linked to at least four fatal accidents in Europe and the US, in which five people died.In February 2024, we reported on a particularly tragic case: a fatal crash on a country road near Dobbrikow, in Brandenburg, Germany. Two 18-year-olds were killed when the Tesla they were in slammed into a tree and caught fire. First responders couldn’t open the doors because the handles were retracted. The teenagers burned to death in the back seat.A court-appointed expert from Dekra, one of Germany’s leading testing authorities, later concluded that, given the retracted handles, the incident “qualifies as a malfunction”. According to the report, “the failure of the rear door handles to extend automatically must be considered a decisive factor” in the deaths. Had the system worked as intended, “it is assumed that rescuers might have been able to extract the two backseat passengers before the fire developed further”. Without what the report calls a “failure of this safety function”, the teens might have survived.1:14'I feel like I'm in the movies': malfunctioning robotaxi traps passenger in car – videoOur investigation made waves. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, Germany’s federal motor transport authority, got involved and announced plans to coordinate with other regulatory bodies to revise international safety standards. Germany’s largest automobile club, ADAC, issued a public recommendation that Tesla drivers should carry emergency window hammers. In a statement, ADAC warned that retractable door handles could seriously hinder rescue efforts. Even trained emergency responders, it said, may struggle to reach trapped passengers. Tesla shows no intention of changing the design.That’s Musk. He prefers the sleek look of Teslas without handles, so he accepts the risk to his customers. His thinking, it seems, goes something like this: at some point, the engineers will figure out a technical fix. The same logic applies to his grander vision of autonomous driving: because Musk wants to be first, he lets customers test his unfinished Autopilot system on public roads. It’s a principle borrowed from the software world, where releasing apps in beta has long been standard practice. The more users, the more feedback and, over time – often years – something stable emerges. Revenue and market share arrive much earlier. The motto: if you wait, you lose.Musk has taken that mindset to the road. The world is his lab. Everyone else is part of the experiment.By the end of 2023, we knew a lot about how Musk’s cars worked – but the way they handle data still felt like a black box. How is that data stored? At what moment does the onboard computer send it to Tesla’s servers? We talked to independent experts at the Technical University Berlin. Three PhD candidates – Christian Werling, Niclas Kühnapfel and Hans Niklas Jacob – made headlines for hacking Tesla’s autopilot hardware. A brief voltage drop on a circuit board turned out to be just enough to trick the system into opening up.The security researchers uncovered what they called “Elon Mode” – a hidden setting in which the car drives fully autonomously, without requiring the driver to keep his hands on the wheel. They also managed to recover deleted data, including video footage recorded by a Tesla driver. And they traced exactly what data Tesla sends to its servers – and what it doesn’t.The hackers explained that Tesla stores data in three places. First, on a memory card inside the onboard computer – essentially a running log of the vehicle’s digital brain. Second, on the event data recorder – a black box that captures a few seconds before and after a crash. And third, on Tesla’s servers, assuming the vehicle uploads them.The researchers told us they had found an internal database embedded in the system – one built around so-called trigger events. If, for example, the airbag deploys or the car hits an obstacle, the system is designed to save a defined set of data to the black box – and transmit it to Tesla’s servers. Unless the vehicles were in a complete network dead zone, in both the Meier and Schuster cases, the cars should have recorded and transmitted that data.View image in fullscreen‘Is the car driving erratically by itself normal? Yeah, that happens every now and then.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianWho in the company actually works with that data? We examined testimony from Tesla employees in court cases related to fatal crashes. They described how their departments operate. We cross-referenced their statements with entries in the Tesla Files. A pattern took shape: one team screens all crashes at a high level, forwarding them to specialists – some focused on autopilot, others on vehicle dynamics or road grip. There’s also a group that steps in whenever authorities request crash data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Some we tried to reach by email or phone. For others, we showed up at their homes. If they weren’t there, we left handwritten notes. No one wanted to talk.We searched for other crashes. One involved Hans von Ohain, a 33-year-old Tesla employee from Evergreen, Colorado. On 16 May 2022, he crashed into a tree on his way home from a golf outing and the car burst into flames. Von Ohain died at the scene. His passenger survived and told police that von Ohain, who had been drinking, had activated Full Self-Driving. Tesla, however, said it couldn’t confirm whether the system was engaged – because no vehicle data was transmitted for the incident.Then, in February 2024, Musk himself stepped in. The Tesla CEO claimed von Ohain had never downloaded the latest version of the software – so it couldn’t have caused the crash. Friends of von Ohain, however, told US media he had shown them the system. His passenger that day, who barely escaped with his life, told reporters that hours earlier the car had already driven erratically by itself. “The first time it happened, I was like, ‘Is that normal?’” he recalled asking von Ohain. “And he was like, ‘Yeah, that happens every now and then.’”His account was bolstered by von Ohain’s widow, who explained to the media how overjoyed her husband had been at working for Tesla. Reportedly, von Ohain received the Full Self-Driving system as a perk. His widow explained how he would use the system almost every time he got behind the wheel: “It was jerky, but we were like, that comes with the territory of new technology. We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that.”The Colorado State Patrol investigated but closed the case without blaming Tesla. It reported that no usable data was recovered.For a company that markets its cars as computers on wheels, Tesla’s claim that it had no data available in all these cases is surprising. Musk has long described Tesla vehicles as part of a collective neural network – machines that continuously learn from one another. Think of the Borg aliens from the Star Trek franchise. Musk envisions his cars, like the Borg, as a collective – operating as a hive mind, each vehicle linked to a unified consciousness.When a journalist asked him in October 2015 what made Tesla’s driver-assistance system different, he replied, “The whole Tesla fleet operates as a network. When one car learns something, they all learn it. That is beyond what other car companies are doing.” Every Tesla driver, he explained, becomes a kind of “expert trainer for how the autopilot should work”.According to Musk, the eight cameras in every Tesla transmit more than 160bn video frames a day to the company’s servers. In its owner’s manual, Tesla states that its cars may collect even more: “analytics, road segment, diagnostic and vehicle usage data”, all sent to headquarters to improve product quality and features such as autopilot. The company claims it learns “from the experience of billions of miles that Tesla vehicles have driven”.‘Lidar is lame’: why Elon Musk’s vision for a self-driving Tesla taxi falteredRead moreIt is a powerful promise: a fleet of millions of cars, constantly feeding raw information into a gargantuan processing centre. Billions – trillions – of data points, all in service of one goal: making cars drive better and keeping drivers safe. At the start of this year, Musk got a chance to show the world what he meant.On 1 January 2025, at 8.39am, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. The man behind the incident – US special forces veteran Matthew Livelsberger – had rented the vehicle, packed it with fireworks, gas canisters and grenades, and parked it in front of the building. Just before the explosion, he shot himself in the head with a .50 calibre Desert Eagle pistol. “This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wakeup call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,” Livelsberger wrote in a letter later found by authorities. “What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives.”The soldier miscalculated. Seven bystanders suffered minor injuries. The Cybertruck was destroyed, but not even the windows of the hotel shattered. Instead, with his final act, Livelsberger revealed something else entirely: just how far the arm of Tesla’s data machinery can reach. “The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,” Musk wrote on X just hours after the blast. “Will post more information as soon as we learn anything. We’ve never seen anything like this.”Later that day, Musk posted again. Tesla had already analysed all relevant data – and was ready to offer conclusions. “We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,” he wrote. “All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.”Suddenly, Musk wasn’t just a CEO; he was an investigator. He instructed Tesla technicians to remotely unlock the scorched vehicle. He handed over internal footage captured up to the moment of detonation.The Tesla CEO had turned a suicide attack into a showcase of his superior technology.Yet there were critics even in the moment of glory. “It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,” warned David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, when contacted by a reporter. “When something bad happens, it’s helpful, but it’s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.”View image in fullscreen‘In many crashes, investigators weren’t even aware that requesting data from Tesla was an option.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThere are other examples of what Tesla’s data collection makes possible. We found the case of David and Sheila Brown, who died in August 2020 when their Model 3 ran a red light at 114mph in Saratoga, California. Investigators managed to reconstruct every detail, thanks to Tesla’s vehicle data. It shows exactly when the Browns opened a door, unfastened a seatbelt, and how hard the driver pressed the accelerator – down to the millisecond, right up to the moment of impact. Over time, we found more cases, more detailed accident reports. The data definitely is there – until it isn’t.In many crashes when Teslas inexplicably veered off the road or hit stationary objects, investigators didn’t actually request data from the company. When we asked authorities why, there was often silence. Our impression was that many prosecutors and police officers weren’t even aware that asking was an option. In other cases, they acted only when pushed by victims’ families.In the Meier case, Tesla told authorities, in a letter dated 25 June 2018, that the last complete set of vehicle data was transmitted nearly two weeks before the crash. The only data from the day of the accident was a “limited snapshot of vehicle parameters” – taken “approximately 50 minutes before the incident”. However, this snapshot “doesn’t show anything in relation to the incident”. As for the black box, Tesla warned that the storage modules were likely destroyed, given the condition of the burned-out vehicle. Data transmission after a crash is possible, the company said – but in this case, it didn’t happen. In the end, investigators couldn’t even determine whether driver-assist systems were active at the time of the crash.The Schuster case played out similarly. Prosecutors in Stralsund, Germany, were baffled. The road where the crash happened is straight, the asphalt was dry and the weather at the time of the accident was clear. Anke Schuster kept urging the authorities to examine Tesla’s telemetry data.Every road user trusts the cars around them not to be a threat. Does that trust still stand when a car is driving itself?When prosecutors did formally request the data recorded by Schuster’s car on the day of the crash, it took Tesla more than two weeks to respond – and when it did, the answer was both brief and bold. The company didn’t say there was no data. It said that there was “no relevant data”. The authorities’ reaction left us stunned. We expected prosecutors to push back – to tell Tesla that deciding what’s relevant is their job, not the company’s. But they didn’t. Instead, they closed the case.The hackers from TU Berlin pointed us to a study by the Netherlands Forensic Institute, an independent division of the ministry of justice and security. In October 2021, the NFI published findings showing it had successfully accessed the onboard memories of all major Tesla models. The researchers compared their results with accident cases in which police had requested data from Tesla. Their conclusion was that while Tesla formally complied with those requests, it omitted large volumes of data that might have proved useful.Tesla’s credibility took a further hit in a report released by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in April 2024. The agency concluded that Tesla failed to adequately monitor whether drivers remain alert and ready to intervene while using its driver-assist systems. It reviewed 956 crashes, field data and customer communications, and pointed to “gaps in Tesla’s telematic data” that made it impossible to determine how often autopilot was active during crashes. If a vehicle’s antenna was damaged or it crashed in an area without network coverage, even serious accidents sometimes went unreported. Tesla’s internal statistics include only those crashes in which an airbag or other pyrotechnic system deployed – something that occurs in just 18% of police-reported cases. This means that the actual accident rate is significantly higher than Tesla discloses to customers and investors.There’s more. Two years prior, the NHTSA had flagged something strange – something suspicious. In a separate report, it documented 16 cases in which Tesla vehicles crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. In each, autopilot disengaged “less than one second before impact” – far too little time for the driver to react. Critics warn that this behaviour could allow Tesla to argue in court that autopilot was not active at the moment of impact, potentially dodging responsibility.The YouTuber Mark Rober, a former engineer at Nasa, replicated this behaviour in an experiment on 15 March 2025. He simulated a range of hazardous situations, in which the Model Y performed significantly worse than a competing vehicle. The Tesla repeatedly ran over a crash-test dummy without braking. The video went viral, amassing more than 14m views within a few days.Mark Rober’s Tesa test driveThe real surprise came after the experiment. Fred Lambert, who writes for the blog Electrek, pointed out the sameautopilot disengagementthat the NHTSA had documented. “Autopilot appears to automatically disengage a fraction of a second before the impact as the crash becomes inevitable,” Lambert noted.And so the doubts about Tesla’s integrity pile up. In the Tesla Files, we found emails and reports from a UK-based engineer who led Tesla’s Safety Incident Investigation programme, overseeing the company’s most sensitive crash cases. His internal memos reveal that Tesla deliberately limited documentation of particular issues to avoid the risk of this information being requested under subpoena. Although he pushed for clearer protocols and better internal processes, US leadership resisted – explicitly driven by fears of legal exposure.We contacted Tesla multiple times with questions about the company’s data practices. We asked about the Meier and Schuster cases – and what it means when fatal crashes are marked “resolved” in Tesla’s internal system. We asked the company to respond to criticism from the US traffic authority and to the findings of Dutch forensic investigators. We also asked why Tesla doesn’t simply publish crash data, as Musk once promised to do, and whether the company considers it appropriate to withhold information from potential US court orders. Tesla has not responded to any of our questions.Elon Musk boasts about the vast amount of data his cars generate – data that, he claims, will not only improve Tesla’s entire fleet but also revolutionise road traffic. But, as we have witnessed again and again in the most critical of cases, Tesla refuses to share it.Tesla’s handling of crash data affects even those who never wanted anything to do with the company. Every road user trusts the car in front, behind or beside them not to be a threat. Does that trust still stand when the car is driving itself?Internally, we called our investigation into Tesla’s crash data Black Box. At first, because it dealt with the physical data units built into the vehicles – so-called black boxes. But the devices Tesla installs hardly deserve the name. Unlike the flight recorders used in aviation, they’re not fireproof – and in many of the cases we examined, they proved useless.Over time, we came to see that the name held a second meaning. A black box, in common parlance, is something closed to the outside. Something opaque. Unknowable. And while we’ve gained some insight into Tesla as a company, its handling of crash data remains just that: a black box. Only Tesla knows how Elon Musk’s vehicles truly work. Yet today, more than 5m of them share our roads.Some names have been changed.This is an edited extract from The Tesla Files by Sönke Iwersen and Michael Verfürden, published on 24 July by Penguin Michael Joseph at £22.

Assistant: Kaya OatleyRape and sexual assaultI was sexually assaulted by a celebrity after starring in a cult film at 19. My quest for justice changed the course of my lifeNot long after Jenny Evans was brutally attacked by a high-profile figure, all the details appeared in the press. Her mission to find out what happened would reveal tabloid spying, phone hacking, police misconduct – and lead to a dramatic change of careerSimon HattenstoneSat 5 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareJenny Evans had just starred in her first film when everything came crashing down. Twin Town was a riot of drugs, fast cars and bad behaviour labelled the “Welsh Trainspotting”. She had a wonderful time making the movie, which was released in 1997. There was a feelgood atmosphere on set, and she got on brilliantly with her fellow actors (Twin Town launched the careers of Rhys Ifans and Dougray Scott). “Friends of the cast and crew were coming down from London to Swansea because the vibe was so good,” she says. “It was a great group of people doing something fun. It was a blast.” Twin Town became a cult success, and the 19-year-old from Abergavenny found herself hanging out with celebrities and looking forward to a career in the movies. Then she was sexually assaulted by a high-profile figure and his friend.Almost 30 years on, she has written a powerful memoir. The assault is just the starting point. Don’t Let It Break You, Honey is the astonishing story of her fight for justice and how it led to a career in journalism, exposed corruption in the British press and theMetropolitan police, and played a role in the phone-hacking scandal that resulted in the closure of the News of the World.We’re sitting outside a London bar and she is nursing a Diet Coke. Evans is a girlish 47, the Welsh accent has long gone, and she’s casually dressed in jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt. Her gold name necklace glints in the sun, and I’m squinting to read it. Surprisingly, it begins with an F rather than a J. I look more closely. “Fuck it,” it says. She grins – a lovely, toothy grin. “It’s just to remind me that things matter less when you give a bit of time and space to them, and to not get so caught up in the moment.”Despite the reminder, it’s obvious that things matter hugely to her. It’s what’s driven her on when she has seemed beaten. And, despite the many times she has been terrified, she has tackled those fears head on.Evans, who now lives in Bristol, grew up in a family she adored. Her mother, a therapist, was active in the women’s movement and a regular at Greenham Common; her father, an English teacher and Labour councillor, took her and her older brother Will on long walks, spotting kingfishers, skimming stones and reciting poetry. Life was idyllic. Then, when she was 13, her father died after an operation went wrong.View image in fullscreenJenny Evans with her Twin Town co-stars, brothers Llyr (left) and Rhys Ifans, 1997.Photograph: Figment Films/AllstarEvans was devastated and disrupted by his death. She started to struggle at school and dropped out of A-levels twice. But she pulled herself together, found her tribe in youth theatre and was cast in Twin Town. Soon after the film came out, she met up with the team in London for a reunion. At the end of the evening, she tagged along with another woman to the house of a well-known man, unconnected to the film. When the woman left suddenly, she found herself alone with him and his friend, referred to in the book as The Famous Man and The Wolf. She asked them to call her a taxi, and that’s when they assaulted her.After the men got bored with her, they let her leave. The Wolf eventually did call a cab for her. The driver, a caring man called Ken, said he thought she had been raped and asked if he could take her to a police station. Evans told him she needed to sleep. She was unsure exactly what had happened, but she knows it was a brutal sexual assault. “Assault by penetration is what it was. The truth is, I don’t know what the penetrating thing was.” Evans says she thought The Famous Man might kill her accidentally because of the pressure he applied to her throat. “It was so violent. I couldn’t breathe.”Instead of reporting the attack, she withdrew into a web of self-loathing. Evans had always regarded herself as strong and independent, but not any more. “The assault revealed to me that I was not the adult I thought I was. I didn’t know when I was safe. I couldn’t read rooms. I couldn’t trust my instincts. I was totally out of my depth and I retreated entirely.” She left her mother’s house in Wales for London, but it was more of an escape than a move forward. She faxed her agent and told her she didn’t want to be in films any more. “Within a year I’d completely changed. I put a lot of weight on and I’d changed temperamentally. I was depressed. I felt my body had worked against me, so I wanted to change it. I began to dress drably. It was subconscious, but I felt I needed to be different because something about me made me unsafe.”She worked in a bar for a few years. A year after the assault, she was raped by a manager when she was sleeping on a sofa following a night shift. He stopped when she woke up and pushed him off, and this time there were no injuries. But it confirmed to her that there was something weak about her; abusers could sense she was prey. Again, she didn’t go to the police because her self-worth was so low and she wanted to keep her job.One assault is bad luck, two is careless – no matter the context – three, or more, you are now an undefendable, fantasist, lunatic slutIn 2001, when Evans was 23, Will was killed in a house fire at the age of 24. She was distraught at the loss of her brother, but decided she had to make something of her life for his sake. She applied to do a degree at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Evans no longer wanted to act, but she thought she would make a good teacher and fancied trying her hand at writing. She did well at Central, made many friends, moved in with a boyfriend, and recovered her equilibrium. It was seven years since the assault, and she finally felt her life had a sense of purpose.Shortly before graduating, she came across an article in the Evening Standard saying that The Famous Man had been accused of rape. In her naivety, she had assumed the attack on her was an opportunistic one-off. For the first time, it struck her that he could be a serial offender and “other women might have been hurt while I was hiding”. She decided it was her duty to go to the police. They listened carefully and sympathetically. Although she found it stressful, she felt believed.Four days later, her story appeared in the Sun. She wasn’t named (victims of a sexual crime are granted the right to lifelong anonymity in the UK), but The Famous Man was. The painfully personal details she had told the police in confidence were there for everyone to read. Evans became paranoid. She started to distrust those around her. Could her closest friends have betrayed her to the press? Had her house been bugged? Could her boyfriend, Neil, be responsible? But even he didn’t know some of the details that appeared in the paper. “I hadn’t told him there was more than one person involved, for instance. You downplay these things for people you love. I felt frightened, embarrassed, humiliated, violated. I felt shame.”It was the early 2000s, a time when women who alleged sexual assault were often said to have been asking for it or simply making it up. The Famous Man’s PR team set to work. Interviews appeared in which he was portrayed sympathetically and he suggested that the allegations were false and had only been made because he was well known. Evans knew she faced an uphill battle. It was hard enough to get a sexual assault conviction when the media weren’t spinning for the defendant.After a second interview, the police told Evans that the Crown Prosecution Service had ruled that her evidence was strong enough for The Famous Man to be charged. She asked about the other women who had also come forward, and was told that, although they were credible, their evidence hadn’t met the charging threshold. Evans was alone. She subsequently discovered that more than 40 women had made allegations against him.One day, her friend Rachel discovered a letter Evans had sent her years before in which she wrote about the assault, named The Famous Man and talked about other occasions when she had been sexually assaulted. Evans was delighted, believing it was vital evidence, and proof that she wasn’t jumping on a celebrity bandwagon.She handed it to the lead detective expecting his face to light up. But it didn’t. The letter was problematic, and would have to be disclosed to the defence. “The letter discredited me,” she writes in the book. “One assault is bad luck, two is careless – no matter the context – three, or more, you are now an undefendable, fantasist, lunatic slut.”The more I found out about the tabloids, the more fearful I became, because of their reach, their power, the corruption, the misogynyThe police told her that she would have to tell them about the other assaults and that she would be cross-examined about them in court. Defence barristers would happily humiliate her to save their client. Shame, she says, is at the heart of her story. Ultimately, the prospect of being shamed publicly led to her refusing to talk about the other incidents. The CPS said it had no option but to “offer no evidence” against The Famous Man and a statement was released saying that the charges against him had been dropped. Today, Evans says, she wishes she had sought legal advice before disclosing the letter.That Sunday, the News of the World devoted a double-page spread to her story. Again, she wasn’t named, but the details from her meeting with the police about the letter were all there. The article said she had kept secrets from the police, which was untrue, and implied that she had accused The Famous Man of assault simply because he was famous. The same questions kept circling in her head. How did the News of the World get this information? Did they pay for it? Was it legal to do so? And were the police involved?Despite writing the book, she still finds it hard to tell her story. Her knees are tucked up to her tummy and her arms are wrapped around them. “My body language! It’s very guarded,” she says, laughing. “I just wanted to know what the fuck happened. This ball of fear in my gut turned into anger. I just went, this is not OK. I’m done. This isnotOK.”That day she applied for a place to do a postgraduate diploma in journalism at City, University of London.After the case against The Famous Man collapsed, the lead detective told her she still might qualify for criminal injury compensation, paid to victims of a violent crime who have suffered mental or physical injuries. He offered to apply on her behalf, but she declined. When she discovered the journalism course cost £5,000, she changed her mind. That money helped pay her way through City University.Why did she want to become a journalist when the press had tried to destroy her? “I wanted to understand what this beast was that had so violated me. I sensed something illegal had happened and I wanted to expose that on some level.”A few weeks into her course, she attended a masterclass in investigative journalism by then Guardian reporterNick Davies, who was about to start an investigation into the state of British journalism. She decided that could be her route to getting an answer about how her story had appeared in the Sun and the News of the World. Evans suggested they go for a cup of tea, and got straight to the point. Did Davies take on researchers, and, if so, would he give her a job?She started working with him on his bookFlat Earth News, which was published in 2008 and exposed some of the murky practices of British journalism. After graduating, she continued working with him on an ad-hoc basis but spent most of her time developing documentaries for television.In July 2009, Davies wrote a Guardian news story headlined “Murdoch papers paid £1m to gag phone-hacking victims”. Evans had not been in touch with Davies for a while, because she had been abroad working on TV documentaries. She’d never heard of phone hacking, but it was a lightbulb moment – so this was how the tabloids stole secrets. Two years earlier, in January 2007, the News of the World’s royal correspondent Clive Goodman had been jailed for four months after pleading guilty to illegally intercepting mobile phone messages involving members of the royal household; his co-conspirator, private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, was sentenced to six months. At the time, News International (now News UK), which published the News of the World, claimed that Goodman was a solitary rogue operator. Davies did not believe this, and was convinced there was plenty more to come out.Evans’s documentary work had come to an end, and she asked Davies if he had anything to tide her over. He said he needed someone “good at calling up strangers and persuading them to talk” – namely “current and former News of the World employees about the use of private investigators and any other dark arts”, such as “blagging” information from confidential databases and tapping live phone calls. Evans jumped at it. Davies did not know she had a vested interest.Gradually people began to talk, and what she discovered horrified her. She was told stories about reporters sent on “punishment” missions to chase fictitious stories set up by editors to humiliate them. There was the reporter who was five months pregnant being ordered to get in a dinghy to look for a whale’s family, and another being left at the side of a road dressed as a “hooker” in the dead of night. One source alleged that he had seen editors pay police for stories, and that this had once led to the suicide of someone accused of a crime. Although News of the World editor Andy Coulson professed ignorance about phone hacking, “he was in it up to his earlobes”, according to another source.View image in fullscreenPrivate investigator Glenn Mulcaire arriving at court in London, August 2006.Photograph: Rex Features“The more I found out about the tabloids,” Evans says, “the more fearful I became, because of their reach, their power, the corruption, the ruthlessness, the depth of the misogyny.”She was not having much luck getting potential victims of hacking to talk to her. So Davies suggested that she should encourage them to ask the Met directly if they were on the database of names obtained from private investigator Mulcaire’s material. Few people knew the Met was obliged to give them this information, and that those who found evidence they may have been hacked could then sue the News of the World and Mulcaire. Davies put together a list of names of likely victims – largely people who had been exposed by the paper. At the bottom of the list was The Famous Man. Davies still had no idea of Evans’s connection to him.There was no way she was going to approach him, but it gave her an idea. She emailed New Scotland Yard and explained that she thoughtshemay have been hacked by Mulcaire. Three months later, the Met responded, saying: “There is some documentation in our possession to suggest that you may have been a person of interest to Glenn Mulcaire.” In the book, Evans describes her response to receiving the email with typical scatological brio. “Holy shitting fuck,” she writes.Evans obtained photocopies of the relevant bits of Mulcaire’s notebooks. Alongside her name he had written “Fragile”, and had got her date of birth wrong. Next to her name was that of her friend Rachel, with the correct address and date of birth. This was even more alarming. After all, she was the friend to whom she had written a letter about the assault, the disclosure of which had resulted in the breakdown of her case and the double-page spread in the News of the World.She went into meltdown. Although this was the proof she had long been looking for, she was petrified, not least because she hadn’t told Davies of her vested interest and now believed that it could undermine the integrity of his investigation. She couldn’t focus on work because she was in pieces, and she was penniless. She invoiced Davies for a number of shifts, and he got back to her asking why nothing seemed to have come from the work she’d done in that time. That’s when it all came out. She told him everything. Evans says she expected a bollocking. When she had finished, Davies said that he had experienced violence as a child from somebody who should have protected him, and it had given him a lifelong hatred of bullies. “We must stand up to the bullies, if we can, Jen,” he told her. “We can stand up to them together. If you still feel you can.” Not only was she relieved, she believed she had finally found her answer: she must have been one of many people who had been hacked by Mulcaire, although she could not remember discussing the details of her case on the phone. But even here, she was disappointed. She had not recognised the phone number Mulcaire had jotted beside her name, but thought that was because she’d changed it so many times. She rang the number to check it out. It turned out to be a different Jenny Evans; Mulcaire was looking for her but found the wrong number.She finally realised that there could only be one answer to her original question. Apart from her and Rachel, only the Metropolitan police knew about the existence of the letter in which she discussed the assault. If Mulcaire had attempted to hack into her phone, he had clearly fallen at the first hurdle. The Murdoch press could have only got hold of her story from the police.People cover their arses: they change department names, they lose files, they scapegoat someone else, and suddenly it’s undiscoverableThe more she found out about the Murdoch press, the more she had come to think that they were in cahoots with the Met, if not controlling them. In the investigation into the hacking scandal, it emerged that officers were paid for information (which is unlawful), and that senior officers frequently partied with and were treated to freebies by News International journalists.After Davies’s 2009 story about the payouts to hacking victims, the Met initially promised to review all the material that the police had seized from Mulcaire when he was arrested in 2006 – six bin bags containing 11,000 pages of notes from his home. “We were all expecting that to take a long time, but 24 hours later they came back and said, ‘We’ve reviewed it all and there’s nothing to see here,’” an incredulous Evans says.Why does she think the Met appeared so eager to cover up News International’s criminal activity? Evans says there isn’t a simple answer, but she points out that a number of senior police officers were having affairs that went on to be exposed by rivals of the Sun and the News of the World. It’s hard to believe that Murdoch’s newspapers, so skilled in exposing the secret sex lives of the rich and powerful, were unaware of these relationships.Evans feels the true significance of the phone-hacking scandal has been downplayed because it involved celebrities. “It has landed in people’s consciousness as something to do with Hugh Grant’s voicemail. The breaches of privacy are terrible, but it’s actually a police corruption story. They tried to cover it up, to stay in the good books of the Murdoch press. When this was happening, we were talking about the power of Murdoch and the other tabloids, and now we’ve got the social media oligarchs who wield a similar amount of power. That’s why it’s still relevant.”It took the hacking of missing schoolgirlMilly Dowler’s voicemail to transform a marginal story into a national scandal. The case was reported in the Guardian in July 2011, a month afterserial killer Levi Bellfield had been convicted of her murder. Ironically, on this occasion, the News of the World may well have been hacking Dowler’s phone for noble reasons – to try to track her down.The fallout from the phone-hacking scandal was huge. In 2011, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson resigned from his new job as spin doctor to prime minister David Cameron, and six months later the 168-year-old newspaper, known to many as News of the Screws, was closed down. The head of the Met,Paul Stephenson, resignedafter it was revealed he had accepted a complimentary 20-nightstay at luxury health spa Champneys over a five-week period when recuperating from a knee operation. Champneys’ publicist was Neil Wallis, former deputy editor of the News of the World, with whom Stephenson had dined eight times between 2006 and 2010. Hisdeputy John Yates also resigned. He blamed News International for failing to tell him how widespread phone hacking was. In 2014,Coulson was jailed for 18 monthsafter being found guilty of a charge of conspiracy to intercept voicemails.As for The Famous Man, he also got his comeuppance. Although he never was put on trial, his reputation was well and truly trashed after it was revealed that there had been multiple allegations against him.Did Evans feel vindicated? “Yes, when the News of the World closed I felt very emotional. I felt like the bullies had been taken down. But even then, it was complicated. I had also met so many reporters who had worked for these newspapers and I liked them, so I was aware they were being demonised. I felt for them.”She now knew at lot about the way the tabloids operated. But she still didn’t know how they had got her story. Evans wrote to the Met police’s directorate of professional standards (DPS), saying: “I have come to the conclusion that someone in the Met police either gave or – worse – sold my private information to the tabloids. And I would like to know the truth, please. So that I can move on.”The DPS produced its final report in November 2013, two years later. The directorate upheld her complaint, but effectively cleared the Met in the process. It concluded that there had been one leak by a press officer to “journalist sources” about the police station that The Famous Man had been taken to, but there was no evidence that Evans’s letter to Rachel had been leaked by the police. The report said that the press officer had been suspended, that he had since died and that his files had been lost. It suggested that the fact that the News of the World article did not mention the letter was evidence that the letter had not been leaked, and did not attempt to explain how the paper had got hold of her information.Evans Googled the dead press officer. He had been suspended months before the News of the World article about her was published.She wasn’t done yet. Evans then took her case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (now rebranded as the Independent Office for Police Conduct), whose remit was to evaluate whether the Met had carried out a sufficient investigation into itself. The IPCC, which was largely staffed by former officers, concluded it had.And still she wasn’t done. Evans was determined to get an apology. So she approached thelawyer Tamsin Allen, and asked if she could see a way forward. “I went to Tamsin and said, ‘Surely this is wrong, surely this isnotOK?’” Allen agreed with her and said she thought Evans could make a claim for damages against the Met for giving away or selling her secrets to the Murdoch press. Evans was impressed by Allen’s desire to fight for justice. Allen told her: “It is hugely satisfying to represent an individual against a monolith.” This struck a chord.View image in fullscreenJenny Evans at her home in Bristol with her dog, Woody, June 2025. Portrait: Josh Adam Jones/The Guardian. Assistant: Kaya OatleyWhen Evans opened the letter she received from the Met in 2014, she found herself “crying and laughing simultaneously”. She had finally got an apology for “the passing of information to the media” and “for the distress caused”, but again the Met blamed the dead press officer.In the end, she never did get a satisfactory answer to the question that took her into journalism – how did the details she had revealed to the police find their way into the News of the World? But along the way she had helped Davies expose the dark arts of the Murdoch press, and bring down leading figures in News International and the Metropolitan police. She also received a life-changing settlement from the Met alongside the apology. It paid for IVF treatment, and after five rounds and eight embryo transfers, she gave birth to her son, Leo, who is now six. Allen then took on the newspapers on Evans’s behalf, a number of which paid her damages, although none admitted liability.After working successfully as a documentary maker for 20 years (directing and producing films about refugees and asylum seekers, homelessness and, of course, phone hacking), she decided it was time for a career change in 2020. Inspired by Allen, she used part of her payout from the newspapers to retrain as a lawyer. Now she has qualified and is looking for her first job.I ask if she has reached closure. Not through her dealings with the police, she says. “I was aware by the end that I wouldn’t get the name of the person responsible because that’s how corruption works. People just cover their arses: they change department names, they lose files, they scapegoat someone else, and suddenly it’s undiscoverable. But on one level the book is my closure. It’s pulling together all the research, everything I discovered, and saying, ‘Look at this, it’snotOK, is it?’”That seems to be your motto, I say. Evans nods and grins. She glances down at her “Fuck it” necklace. “I think I’m going to change my necklace to ‘This isnotOK’.”Don’t Let It Break You: A Memoir About Saving Yourself by Jenny Evans is published by Robinson (£22).

Two recent studies have different takes on this decades-long controversy. The answer might be more complicated, and more interesting, than either study suggests.One study, led by Ivan Kroupin at the London School of Economics,asked howpeople from different cultures perceived a visual illusion known as the Coffer illusion. They discovered that people in the UK and US saw it mainly in one way, as comprising rectangles – while people from rural communities in Namibia typically saw it another way: as containing circles.To explain these differences, Kroupin and colleagues appeal to a hypothesis raised more than 60 years ago and argued about ever since. The idea is that people in western industrialised countries (these days known by the acronym “weird” – forwestern, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic– a summary that is increasingly questionable) see things in a specific way because they are generally exposed to highly “carpentered” environments, with lots of straight lines, right angles – visual features common in western architecture. By contrast, people from non-“weird” societies – like those in rural Namibia – inhabit environments with fewer sharp lines and angular geometric forms, so their visual abilities will be tuned differently.The Weirdest People in the World review – a theory-of-everything studyRead moreThe study argues that the tendency of rural Namibians to see circles rather than rectangles in the Coffer illusion is due to their environments being dominated by structures such as round huts instead of angular environments. They back up this conclusion with similar results from several other visual illusions, all supposedly tapping into basic brain mechanisms involved in visual perception. So far, so good for the cross-cultural perceptual psychologists, and for the “carpentered world” hypothesis.The second study, by Dorsa Amir and Chaz Firestone, takes a sledgehammer to this hypothesis, but for the much better-known illusion: theMüller-Lyer illusion. Two lines of equal length seem to be different lengths because of the context provided by inward-pointing, compared with outward-pointing, arrowheads. It’s a very powerful illusion. I’ve seen it on thousands of occasions and it works every time for me.View image in fullscreenThe Müller-Lyer illusion: contradicting the ‘carpentered world’ hypothesis of the Coffer illusion.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyThere are many explanations for why the Müller-Lyer illusion is so effective. One of the more popular is that the arrowheads are interpreted by the brain as cues about three-dimensional depth, so our brains implicitly interpret the illusion as representing an object of some kind, with right angles and straight lines. This explanation fits neatly with the “carpentered world” hypothesis – and indeed a lot of early support for this hypothesis relied on apparent cultural variability in how the Müller-Lyer illusion is perceived.In their study, Amir and Firestone carefully and convincingly dismantle this explanation. They point out that non-human animals experience the illusion, as shown in a range of studies in which animals (including guppies, pigeons and bearded dragons) are trained to prefer the longer of two lines, and then presented with the Müller-Lyer image. They show that it works without straight lines, and for touch as well as vision. They note that it even works for people who until recently have been blind, referencingan astonishing experimentin which nine children, blind from birth because of dense cataracts, were shown the illusion immediately after the cataracts were surgically removed. Not only had these children not seen highly carpentered environments – they hadn’t seen anything at all. After you absorb their analysis, it’s pretty clear that the Müller-Lyer illusion is not due to culturally specific exposure to carpentry.Why the discrepancy? There are several possibilities. Perhaps there are reasons why cross-cultural variability should be expected for the Coffer but not the Müller-Lyer illusion (one possibility here is that the Coffer illusion is based on how people pay attention to things, rather than on some more basic aspect of perception). It could also be that there are systematic differences in perception between cultures, but that the “carpentered world” hypothesis is not the correct explanation. It’s also worth noting that the Kroupin study has some potential weaknesses. For example, the UK/US and Namibian participants were exposed to the illusions using very different methods. All in all, the jury remains out and – favourite scientist punt coming up – “more research is needed”.View image in fullscreenA ‘highly ‘carpentered’ environment with lots of straight lines, right angles and so forth’: the financial district in the City of London.Photograph: William Barton/AlamyThe notion that people from different cultures vary in how they experience things is certainly plausible. There’s a wealth of evidence that as we grow up our brains are shaped, at least to some extent, by features of our environments. And just as we all differ in our externally visible characteristics – height, body shape and so on – we will all differ on the inside too. As the author Anaïs Nin put it in quoting the Talmud: “We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.”For me, an important implication of this line of thought is that there are likely to be substantial differences in perceptionwithin“groups” as well asbetweenthem. This will probably hold however these “groups” are defined, whether as different cultures or as a contrast between “neurotypical” and “neurodivergent” people. I believe that paying more attention to within-group perceptual diversity will help us to better interpret the differences we do find between groups, and equip us with the tools needed to resist relying on simple cultural stereotypes as explanations.More research is needed here too. But it’s on the way. In thePerception Census, a project led by my research group at the University of Sussex together with professor Fiona Macpherson at the University of Glasgow, we are studying how perception differs in a large sample of about 40,000 people from more than 100 countries.Our experiment includes not just one or two visual illusions but more than 50 different experiments probing many different aspects of perception. When we’re done analysing the data, we hope to deliver a uniquely detailed picture of how people experience their world, both within and between cultures. We’ll also make the data openly available for other researchers to explore new ideas in this important area.One critical insight lies behind all these questions.How things seem is not how they are.Neuroscientist Anil Seth: ‘We risk not understanding the central mystery of life’Read moreFor each of us, it might seem as though we see the world exactly as it is; as if our senses are transparent windows through with the world pours itself directly into our mind. But how things are is very different. The objective world no doubt exists, but the world we experience is always an active construction, a kind of “controlled hallucination” in which the brain uses sensory signals to update and calibrate its best interpretation of what’s going on. What we experience is this interpretation, not a “readout” of the sensory information.For me, this is the key insight that underlies any claim about perceptual diversity. When we take it fully on board, it encourages a much-needed humility about our own ways of seeing. We live in perceptual echo chambers, just as we do in those of social media, and the first step to escaping any echo chamber is to realise that you’re in one.Anil Seth is a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, and author of the Sunday Times bestsellerBeing You: A New Science of ConsciousnessExplore more on these topicsNeuroscienceOpinionConsciousnessPsychologyHuman biologycommentShareReuse this content"

Along the Las Piedras River, people in Monte Salvado, a Yine Indigenous village, described how every summer, “aislados” – those who avoid sustained contact with outsiders – would appear across the river.“They were coming into the fields and taking bananas,” says Huertas.Huertas followed the trail north to the Tahuamanu River, where fishers also reported sightings. Crossing into Brazil’s Acre state, she collected more evidence – footprints, tools and local testimonies.Her findings, compiled in a 2001 report for the Native Federation of the Madre de Dios River and Tributaries (Fenamad), recommended protecting 2m hectares (4.95m acres) for the wide-ranging Mashco Piro people.Twenty-five years later, the Mashco Piro, the world’s largest uncontacted Indigenous group, face growing threats from logging, drug trafficking and the climate crisis in the Brazil-Peru borderlands. Recent raids in Brazil highlight their struggle for territory and resources, worsened by environmental changes and criminal activity. Despite legal protection and international agreements, cooperation betweenBrazilandPeruremains inadequate, putting the Mashco Piro at risk.Quick GuideWhat are ‘uncontacted peoples’?ShowUncontacted peoples, or “peoples in voluntary isolation”, avoid contact with modern society to protect their way of life and stay safe from violence or exploitation. They live in remote areas such as rainforests and deserts, maintaining traditional cultures free from outside influence. Governments and organisations aim to protect their rights and territories to prevent disease, cultural disruption and exploitation, safeguarding their autonomy and lands.What constitutes contact?In anthropology, “contact” means interactions between cultural or social groups. “Contacted” individuals have continuing relations with society. Contact can be direct, for example trade or conflict, or indirect, such as disease transmission. It involves cultural exchange and economic interactions. Colonial contact often imposed systems that disrupted Indigenous cultures. Brief or accidental interactions don’t count as contact.Where are their territories?Most uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon basin, especially in Brazil and Peru, often within protected areas. Others are in the Gran Chaco, Andaman Islands, North Sentinel Island and West Papua. The Amazon basin, a vast region spanning several countries in South America, including Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, is home to the largest number of uncontacted communities, with estimates suggesting there could be dozens of such groups living in isolation. Western Brazil and eastern Peru are known for having some of the last uncontacted groups, including some that live in voluntary isolation within protected Indigenous territories and national parks.Is it essential to protect uncontacted peoples?Some oppose protection, citing a lack of modern benefits, concerns about land use or safety issues. Advocates argue that they survive using natural resources, contact harms health and evangelisation weakens cultures. They emphasise these peoples’ rights to their territories and the inability of governments to ensure their safety. Even after contact, Indigenous peoples have rights to their full traditional territories according to some national and international norms.Why is the idea controversial?Governments and NGOs work to protect uncontacted peoples’ territories from logging, mining and agriculture as they threaten their survival. Demarcating protected zones reduces human activity and preserves the way of life within them. In some countries, such as Brazil, legislation requires the government to demarcate Indigenous territories in the event of identifying uncontacted peoples – a measure that often conflicts with economic interests linked to land rights and use.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After Huertas’s report,Peruapproved 800,000 hectares (1.98m acres) for protection, bounded by a straight north-south line. But on the other side of that line, 38 logging concessions were granted over the next two years, covering 694,584 hectares (1.73m acres) – including areas used by the Mashco Piro.View image in fullscreenMashco Piro Indigenous tribespeople emerge from the rainforest to gather on the banks of the Las Piedras River in Monte Salvado.Photograph: Survival InternationalIn 2006, Peru passed a law protecting isolated and recently contacted peoples,creating six Indigenous reserveswith stronger legal standing than earlier “territorial reserves”, including Madre de Dios, says Carlos Soria, an environmental lawyer and former head of protected areas. In 2016, a government commission approved expanding the Madre de Dios reserve by 240,471 hectares (593,000 acres), as many Mashco Piro nomads lived in logging concessions. But the expansion has never been implemented and logging concessions still remainin more than 176,000 hectares(435,000 acres).Locator map of Mashco Piro reserveThis uneasy cohabitation has resulted in a long-term conflict in the wilds of Madre de Dios.Ojo Público’s investigation, using Ministry of Culture data, found 81 instances of evidence of the Mashco Piro in and around the Madre de Dios reserve from 2016 to 2024, with 19 in the expansion area; four involved violent encounters.Wherever land isn’t protected, there are miners, drug traffickers, loggers, illegal fishers and huntersLucas Manchineri, Indigenous leaderIsrrail Aquise, coordinator of Fenamad’s defence of isolated peoples, says violence has changed community behaviour. “The women are not coming out, and the old men and children who used to come out are not appearing,” he says, adding that only able-bodied Mashco Piro men and boys are seen on the riverside. “They are protecting their vulnerable members probably because of the confrontations with loggers, whether legal or illegal.”Lucas Manchineri, president of the local Indigenous association across the border in Brazil, says the climate crisis – bringing more extreme rain and drought – also disrupts seasonal routines. Headwater creeks dry up early, forcing the Mashco Piro downstream, closer to villages.“Wherever land isn’t protected, there are miners, drug traffickers, loggers, illegal fishers and hunters and those people are pushing the Mashco Piro closer to our community,” he says. “We are fighting to protect our uncontacted relatives, but to do that, we need to protect our territory.”View image in fullscreenRomel Ponciano, a Yine man from Monte Salvado, left, with members of the Mashco Piro tribe.Photograph: Ronald Reategui for The GuardianTo avoid confrontations, Peru’s Ministry of Culture maintains 19 control posts nationally for the eight Indigenous and territorial reserves. Most staff members are local people, such as Romel Ponciano, a Yine man from Monte Salvado. But, he says, the government “keeps cutting the budget. Each post needs six staff members because … it’s a territorial reserve with isolated people. Often we have only two people on duty – or none at all.”Ponciano says the Mashco Piro population is increasing, making state presence more urgent. The exact population is unknown, but experts agree it is in the thousands. “I’ve seen their numbers grow between 2000 and today. They have increased a lot. Sometimes we see 200 at a time,” he says.Photographs reveal first glimpse of uncontacted Amazon communityRead moreTheInter-American commission on human rightsfound that Peru has violated the rights of the Mashco Piro, Yor and Amahuaca peoples. After years of inaction,the case was referred to the Inter-American court of human rights, which in March 2025demanded upgradesin protection for aislados in a similar case in Ecuador.Yet, supporters of extractive industries often dispute the existence of isolated peoples. In 2007, Peru’s then-president, Alan García claimed: “To stop oil, they have created the ‘uncontacted’ native.” Recently,Loreto’s development business group launched a campaigndenying the existence of isolated peoples in north-east Peru, despite clear evidence gathered by experts.For two decades, the timber industry has operated under 40-year leases in Mashco Piro territory. Now, some officials support a special zone where loggers and uncontacted people would officially coexist. “This sets a terrible precedent that could justify opening all of the isolated people’s territories for logging,” says Huertas, now a consultant for theRainforest Foundation of Norway.Indigenous organisations in Peru’s north-eastsuccessfully sued the Loreto regional government, forcing it to revoke 72 logging concessions in areas designated for isolated communities. If legal timber operations are allowed in uncontacted lands, Huertas fears such suits would fail, exposing isolated peoples to logging across millions of hectares.View image in fullscreenLogs ready for cutting at a sawmill near Puerto Maldonado, Madre de Dios region.Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty ImagesAt a December meeting, Carmen Inés Vegas Guerrero, Peru’s deputy minister of agriculture, argued that“without the concession, there would be more deaths”due to chaos and drug trafficking she claims would ensue without legal loggers. Her office did not respond to requests for comment.Uncontacted tribe seen in Peruvian Amazon where loggers are activeRead moreThe conflict persists even with some logging companies in Madre de Dios considered among Peru’s most responsible. The region was closely monitored after the 2005-2011 construction of the Interoceanic Highway, funded by the Inter-American Development Bank. Some logging firms haveForest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.In March 2025, Madre de Dios had five FSC-certified operationscovering 573,680 hectares(1.4m acres). About half is held byMaderera Rio AcreSAC (Maderacre), with two concessions totalling 93,470 hectares (231,000 acres) overlapping the proposed reserve expansion, Ojo Publico’s investigation found.Despite certifications, violent incidents continue. Maderera Canales Tahuamanu, a logging firm with 52,869 hectares, had its FSC certificate suspended after a confrontation in whichMashco Piro arrows killed two loggers and two more workers disappeared.Julio Cusurichi, a Madre de Dios Indigenous leader, says: “We don’t know how many isolated people have died in these conflicts, but we believe that some have because in these kinds of conflicts it’s not only the loggers who are killed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indigenous people are increasingly seeing their territories threatened by illegal logging.Photograph: Paolo Aguilar/EPACarla Cárdenas, an Ecuadorian environmental lawyer and longtime FSC member, says the certification rules are flawed, with no mention of isolated peoples. FSC requires local consultation about logging plans, which is impossible with uncontacted groups.Cárdenas drafted a motion to bar certification “in the case of any indication of the presence of Indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation”. She says the language will be decided at the council’s October assembly in Panama, but she is unsure whether she can secure votes from FSC member companies.“They will feel there are fewer territories for them to continue working under the FSC system,” she says. “The FSC needs to show that those companies are respecting human rights.”FSC’s representatives did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, butreleased a statementindicating thatthe Maderacre certificationswere being reviewed.Local authorities often support logging. At aDecember 2024 meeting, Tahuamanu mayor Rubén Darío, on the land categorisation committee, called for a new study to verify if the Mashco Piro truly need the land, citing the forest’s timber value for his municipality. His office sent a report to the Ministry of Culture questioning the validity of the 2016 study that recommended the reserve’s expansion. There is no indication that the ministry has responded.A government expert, speaking anonymously, says: “Evidence from recent years all extends beyond the expansion area of the Madre de Dios territorial reserve. If a new, objective study is done, I’m absolutely sure that it would be expanded substantially more.”For now, no decision has been made. As long as the committee does not convene, logging in Mashco Piro territory continues. No other reserve decisions can be made,including the long-delayed Yavarí-Mirim reserveon Peru’s northern border with Brazil. Ministry of Culture officials declined to comment.Logging is not just a Peruvian problem. Maria Luiza Pinedo Ochoa, executive coordinator of the Acre Pro-Indian Committee (CPI-Acre), a Brazilian advocacy group, highlights the threat from Peruvian logging but says pressure comes from both sides. “Road building on the Brazilian side is a factor that really worries us,” she says.The Peruvian government, instead of protecting the lives of these people, they are catering to extractive interestJulio Cusurichi, Indigenous leaderThe Acre government plans a road between Santa Rosa do Purus and Manoel Urbano. The federal public prosecutor has sided with environmental and Indigenous groups trying to stop the highway, but most state politicians support it. Without intervention, Mashco Piro territory could be swiftly and irreversibly fragmented.The one road between the two countries, the Interoceanic Highway, brought adevastating gold mining industry, permanent logging concessions, and side roads snaking into the forest.View image in fullscreenA road cuts through an area deforested by illegal gold mining in the Madre de Dios region, Peru.Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/APCusurichi, now leading efforts to protect isolated peoples at Peru’s national Indigenous organisation (Aidesep), criticises both governments: “With the Peruvian government, we are going through a very challenging situation. Instead of protecting lives, the lives of these people, they are catering to extractive interests,” such as oil, timber and road building.Of Brazil, he says: “We thought that with this new Brazilian leader [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva] things were going to get better, but the meetings we have had with Indigenous organisations indicate that it’s nothing but talk.”On 21 January, the Brazilian government took the first step toward creating theChandless River Mashco Indigenous territory, covering 538,338 hectares(1.33m acres).Still, Marco Aurélio Milken Tosta, head of Brazil’s general coordination for isolated and recently contacted Indigenous peoples, says binational coordination is needed. Peru and Brazil signed an agreement in 2014 and have worked well together in the past, but the two-year accord was never renewed. “We need a new agreement,” he says, “The isolated people don’t have a border.”With official cooperation lacking, Indigenous organisations have created a binational commission and championed two large “territorial corridors” for isolated peoples, spanning 25m hectares (61.7m acres).Volunteers among the Manchineru people in Brazil’s Acre state, who speak a language closely related to the Mashco Piro and call themparentes desconfiados(“wary relatives”), monitor the Mashco Piro to ensure no one gets too close. Recently, they have observed changes in behaviour. “They will appear soon, more of them, and probably before summer, which is an unusual dynamic,” says Lucas Manchineri.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Mashco Piro tribe at an undisclosed location near the Manu national park in south-eastern Peru.Photograph: D Cortijo/APAgents such as Ponciano occasionally shout conversations – which do not constitute contact – across the river to Mashco Piro, who speak a similar language. Sometimes, they talk at closer quarters. Ponciano says the Mashco Piro simply don’t understand logging. “‘Why do they cut down the big trees?’ they asked me. “I couldn’t explain,” he says. “For them, the trees are like monuments. They don’t want us to cut them down.”Ponciano has asked if they want to make contact. “They have always told me the same: ‘No, because you are bad,’” he says. “When I tell them I’m not bad, they say: ‘Yes, you are not bad. But the others are bad.’”This series on uncontacted peoples is a partnership between the Guardian and Brazilian newspaper O Globo and is supported by theOpen Society Foundations, theFord Foundationand thePulitzer Center.

Well, it’s a mess of our own making,” he said.“We could have avoided some of this by just listening to some of the people in the party who want to support Starmer, want to support Labour, but are finding it difficult because the mistakes are made and they could have been avoided.”View image in fullscreenSteve Rotheram.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRotheram, a former MP who was elected as firstLiverpoolcity region mayor in 2017, said the government appeared “disjointed” from the rest of Labour.He added: “I don’t think it’s necessarily about Keir or Keir’s team necessarily – although there are definitely some siren voices around all of that – but I do think it’s about the feeling that there’s a lack of connectivity between different bits of the party.”Tracy Brabin, the Labour mayor ofWest Yorkshire, urged Starmer to place the devolution of power at the heart of his premiership.She said “The devolution revolution has been all too quickly forgotten by some [government] departments” despite mayors “driving incredible change for our communities bringing growth, hope and optimism”.Brabin, a former shadow culture secretary who took office in West Yorkshire in 2021, said Labour had an opportunity to win back the trust of voters who had “lost confidence in politicians ability to improve their lives” by backing mayors with more powers.The call was repeated by Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor ofSouth Yorkshire, who urged government ministers to invest more in frontline policing in the region and in its cultural sector.But he said ministers appeared “genuinely interested” in what he was trying to achieve in South Yorkshire, describing dealings with them as “chalk and cheese” compared with the “absolute shambles” under the Conservatives.“The difference is I think this government listens and I hope this government learns. That certainly seems to be the case. I want things to go better, of course I do, because what’s good for South Yorkshire is good for this country and vice versa.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that other people who were in the area but not at the camp could also be unaccounted for. Torrential rain caused the river to rise 26ft (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn on Friday, washing away homes and vehicles.About 750 girls were camping along the river for the Independence Day weekend, according to Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr county, who said that “catastrophic” rains had devastated the area, located to the north of San Antonio.Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, with more than 1,700 people involved in the search-and-rescue operation.Of the bodies recovered so far, 12 adults and five children were still unidentified, officials said.One of the girls attending the camp, Renee Smajstrla, who was nine years old, was confirmed to be among the dead by her uncle.“Renee has been found and while not the outcome we prayed for, the social media outreach likely assisted the first responders in helping to identify her so quickly,” Shawn Saltawroteon Facebook. “We are thankful she was with her friends and having the time of her life.”LiveDrone footage shows extent of deadly Texas flooding – videoSearchers used helicopters and drones to look for victims and rescue people stranded by flood waters. The confirmed death toll is almost certain to rise, although hopes remain that some of those affected will be found alive. “They could be in a tree, they could be out of communication,” said Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor. “We are praying for all of those missing to be found alive.”The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday, with flash flood warnings issued for parts of central Texas. “This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION,” the National Weather Service (NWS) warned in abulletin. “SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!”Huge downpours like this are becoming more common around the world due to the climate crisis, with a warming atmosphere holding a greater amount of moisture. In eastern Texas, there hasalreadybeen a 20% increase in the number of days with heavy rain or snow since 1900, with the intensity of extreme rainset to riseby another 10% in the next decade.In the area affected by the floods in Texas, parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information. “The camp was completely destroyed,” said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers at Camp Mystic. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”A raging storm woke up her and her cabin mates just after midnight Friday – and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with flood waters whipping around their legs, she said.The flooding in the middle of the night on the Fourth of July holiday caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise. Officials defended their preparations for severe weather and their response but said they had not expected such an intense downpour that was, in effect, the equivalent of months’ worth of rain for the area.One NWS forecast this week had called for only 3-6in (76-152mm) of rain, said Kidd, of the Texas division of emergency management.“It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said.Saturday’s deaths renewed questions about whether it was wise for the Trump administration to implementdeep budget and job cutsat the NWS – among other federal government agencies – since his second presidency began in January.“After media reports & experts warned for months that drastic & sudden cuts at the [NWS] by Trump could impair their forecasting ability & endanger lives during the storm season, TX officials blame an inaccurate forecast by NWS for the deadly results of the flood,” Ron Filipkowski, editor in chief of the liberal news website MeidasTouch,wroteon X.However, Avery Tomasco, a meteorologist with CBS Austin, defended the forecasters after local officials claimed they had not been warned of the potential danger. “The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kerr County more than 12 hours ahead of the catastrophic flood,”Tomasco wrote. “A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt [and] Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb. They did their job and they did it well.”Trump addressed the deadly floods shortly before 11am eastern time on Saturday. On his Truth Social platform, he said that his administration was working with state and local officials – and that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, were “praying for all of the families” affected.The afternoon news conference began with a series of long, self-congratulatory statements and praise for Trump from Republican officials, including Abbott, the homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, the senator John Cornyn and the representative Chip Roy. It was only after reporters pressed them for details on the rescue and recovery effort that they provided an update on the missing and the dead.One river gauge near Camp Mystic recorded a 22ft (6.7-meter) rise in about two hours, said Bob Fogarty, meteorologist with the NWS’s Austin/San Antonio office. The gauge failed after recording a level of 29.5ft (9 meters).“The water’s moving so fast, you’re not going to recognize how bad it is until it’s on top of you,” Fogarty said.On the Facebook page of the Kerr county sheriff’s office, people posted pictures of loved ones and begged for help finding them.In Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night on Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home directly across from the river, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough to walk up the hill to a neighbor’s home.“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung on to it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away,” she said. “He was lost for a while, but we found them.”Of her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: “Thankfully he’s over 6ft tall. That’s the only thing that saved me – was hanging on to him.”Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone.“We got no emergency alert. There was nothing” until suddenly there was “a pitch-black wall of death”, Stone said.At a reunification center set up in Ingram, families cried and cheered as loved ones disembarked from vehicles loaded with evacuees. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not climb down a ladder. Behind her, a woman clutched a small white dog.Later, a girl in a white Camp Mystic T-shirt and white socks stood in a puddle, sobbing in her mother’s arms.Barry Adelman, 54, said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and nine-year-old grandson. The water started coming through the attic floor before finally receding.“I was horrified,” he said. “I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death.”The forecast had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight for at least 30,000 people.The lieutenant governor noted that the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.“Everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain, and we’re not exactly sure where it’s going to land,” Patrick said. “Obviously, as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, that’s when the storm started to zero in.”Asked about how people were notified in Kerr county so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county’s chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.”When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren’t taken, Kelly said: “Rest assured – no one knew this kind of flood was coming.”The area is known as “flash flood alley” because of the hills’ thin layer of soil, said Austin Dickson, chief executive officer of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations to help non-profits responding to the disaster.“When it rains, water doesn’t soak into the soil,” Dickson said. “It rushes down the hill.”River tourism is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Well-known, century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said.“It’s generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations,” Dickson said.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTexas Floods 2025TexasFloodingExtreme weatherUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Four others were killed in the town of Bani Suheila, and three people were killed in three different strikes in the town of Khan Younis.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made no immediate comment on the attacks.Separately, two US contractors with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in the south of the territory after unknown assailants threw grenades at them at a food distribution site, the organisation said.The GHF, a US-supported private organisation that began handing out food parcels in Gaza last month, has been mired in controversy, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying it was “inherently unsafe” and that it was “killing people”. The GHF denies this, saying it has delivered tens of millions of meals in “safety and security”.On Saturday night the US state department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, blamed “Hamas terrorists” for the attack, adding in a post on X: “This act of violence against the people actually bringing relief to Gazans lays bare the depravity of Hamas.”Hundreds of Palestinianshave been killedin recent weeks in shooting or shelling by the IDF while travelling to GHF sites or gathering in large crowds to get aid from convoys brought into Gaza by the UN that are often stopped and looted.Aid workers in Gaza have called again for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that fuel stocks for NGOs are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, much of the health system and communications across the territory. Power supplies in Gaza rely primarily on large quantities of diesel for generators.“We are pretty much down to about half a day’s worth. When that is gone, everything has to shut down,” said one humanitarian worker in Deir al-Balah.Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade on Gaza after the most recent ceasefire collapsed in March, which has only been partly lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. No fuel has been permitted to enter, and supplies that still exist in Gaza are often in Israeli-controlled areas or combat zones and so inaccessible.Netanyahu is to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with the US president, Donald Trump, who has said in a series of social media posts that he wants the Gaza war to stop.A ceasefire in Gaza appears to be close. Here’s why it could happen nowRead moreDrafts of the proposed deal seen by the Guardian include a provision specifying that Trump would personally announce any ceasefire – possibly in the coming days during Netanyahu’s visit.However, sources close to Hamas said the organisation wants greater clarity over guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a permanent end to the war and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.There is also disagreement over who would be allowed to deliver the “sufficient aid” described in the draft. Hamas want the GHF to be closed down. Israel wants to maintain a system of distribution independent from the UN or other countries.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday, Trump said he was optimistic and suggested there “could be a Gaza deal” next week. But Israeli media have described a series of steps involving separate Israeli delegations flying to Qatar and Egypt to complete negotiations, and the current draft specifies that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s personal envoy, will travel to the Middle East to finalise the deal.Analysts said this could mean lengthy delays before an agreement is reached.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise Hamas-led attack into Israel in October 2023, during which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Fifty remain in Gaza, less than half still alive.Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will build on the existing family hubs and start for life programme to provide a single point of access for services in health, education and wellbeing.Parents will also be able to register births, access midwifery and maternity services, and get help to stop smoking. There will also be activities for children under five and youth service provision.About 200 new nurseries to open at schools in England in SeptemberRead moreThe education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, said the hubs would provide a “lifeline of consistent support across the nation, ensuring health, social care and education work in unison to ensure all children get the very best start in life”.The policy forms part of the government’s push to replace services lost since 2010, which include the closure of more than 1,400 Sure Start centres.Research showed that children who lived near aSure Start centrefor their first five years were more likely to get five good GCSE grades at age 16.Family hubs were originally opened in 75 local authority areas at the start of 2024 by the then Conservative government.The announcement by theDepartment for Educationcomes ahead of the government unveiling its strategy on child development on Monday.The Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life plan will lay out how ministers hope to improve the development of children under five, and give support to parents and wider families.Phillipson said: “It’s the driving mission of this government to break the link between a child’s background and what they go on to achieve – our new Best Start Family Hubs will put the first building blocks of better life chances in place for more children.“I saw firsthand how initiatives like Sure Start helped level the playing field in my own community, transforming the lives of children by putting in place family support in the earliest years of life, and as part of our Plan for Change, we’re building on its legacy for the next generation of children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this year, as monks and devotees flooded into the mountainous Indian city before the Tibetan spiritual leader turns 90 on Sunday, the mood of anticipation has been palpable.For years, the Dalai Lama had promised that around his 90th birthday he would make a long-awaited announcement about his reincarnation. Finally, in a video broadcast to Tibetan monks and leaders on Wednesday,he laid out what the futurewould hold. It came amid fears ofa ruthless succession battlebetween the Tibetan community and the Chinese government, which for decades has sought to control the institution of the Dalai Lama, revered as the highest teacher in Tibetan Buddhism.2:09Dalai Lama outlines process for choosing his successor after he dies – videoTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, confirmed he would remain in the role until he died. Then, as per centuries of tradition, he would be reincarnated, and only his inner circle – a trust of closely allied monks – would have the “sole authority” to locate his successor; an often lengthy process to track down a child in which his spirit has been reborn.“No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,” the Dalai Lama told his monks.The announcement ended years of speculation that, in an attempt to prevent Chinese interference, the Dalai Lama might put forward an alternative mode of reincarnation, such as transferring his spiritual essence to a successor who could be found while he was still alive. To the great worry of many in the Tibetan diaspora, he had even hinted that he may not reincarnate at all.The Dalai Lama’s latest statement was a clear defiance of the Communist party inChina, which has long held the view that only it has the authority to decide the next Dalai Lama and has even enshrined the right into Chinese law.However, Tansen Sen, a scholar of Indo-Chinese relations andBuddhism, noted that the Dalai Lama’s message struck a more diplomatic tone than some of his previous statements. In earlier writings, he had said the 15th Dalai Lama would be born in the “free world” – taken to mean outside China – but this time he did not repeat that.Dalai Lama at 90: son of a buckwheat farmer who became a thorn in China’s side – in picturesRead more“I see this as a very strategically handled announcement which avoided ruffling China’s feathers too much,” said Sen. “The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, he is also a shrewd thinker and I think he realises that there are larger issues at play, particularly that he is caught geopolitically betweenIndiaand China.”However, China’s sensitivity over the issue was evident in the absence of the Dalai Lama’s statement from all Chinese or Tibetan media. “China’s propaganda managers seem very reticent for this news to reach Tibetans or even Chinese,” said Robert Barnett, a scholar of Tibetan history at Soas University of London. “Presumably that’s because Chinese leaders fear a popular outpouring of support for the Dalai Lama, or they are struggling to agree on how to respond.”China invaded and took control of the autonomous region of Tibet in 1950. After a failed uprising by Tibetans in 1959, China threatened to arrest the Dalai Lama – who acted as a religious and political leader – forcing him into exile in India.View image in fullscreenThe Dalai Lama in 1959.Photograph: Keystone Features/Getty ImagesAfter his perilous escape across the Himalayas, in April 1959 the Dalai Lama met the then-Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who declared – against much opposition within his own government – that the Tibetan spiritual leader “should be allowed to live in peace” in India.Since then, the Dalai Lama, along with other Tibetan religious leaders, civilians and parliamentarians in exile, have established their political and religious headquarters in Dharamshala, high in the Himalayan mountains.From his outpost, the Dalai Lama has been both a religious leader and a tireless and highly effective global advocate for the Tibetan cause and community over the past 66 years. He has vocally resisted calls by China for it to have any say over the institution of the Dalai Lama or to meddle in the succession process.Within greater Tibet, home to 6 million people, Chinese authorities have imposed increasingly draconian measures and censorship to try to crush the influence of the Dalai Lama, including banning images of him.Beijing has described the Dalai Lama as a “wolf in monk’s clothing” and views him as a dissident and separatist, even as he advocated for greater Tibetan autonomy within China, rather than full independence.Chinese efforts are widely seen to have failed, and as the Dalai Lama’s international profile has grown – he has a Nobel peace prize and millions of devotees, including some of the world’s biggest celebrities – he remains more revered than ever.His presence as a constant thorn in the side of Chinese efforts to impose complete homogeneity over Tibet means officials have become increasingly determined to control what happens when he dies. In a statement after the Dalai Lama’s announcement this week – which was only published in English – the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said his successor “must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn and approved by the central government”.View image in fullscreenThe Dalai Lama remains more revered than ever, in Dharamshala (above), Tibet and around the world.Photograph: Niharika Kulkarni/AFP/Getty ImagesAnalysts have widely agreed the most likely scenario after the death of the Dalai Lama is that two successors will be appointed; one located by Tibetan monks, as per tradition, probably outside China and recognised by the Tibetan community in exile, and another selected by the Chinese Communist party from within China.Over the decades, the Dalai Lama’s presence in Dharamshala and the free movement he is afforded by India has remained a source of tension in Indo-Chinese relations. Yet since 2020, when border tensions erupted into violent skirmishes, it appeared the Indian government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, began to see the Tibet issue as a direct form of leverage over China. China has emphasised that any country that interferes in the Dalai Lama reincarnation will be sanctioned – a message seen to be directed at India.In a notable break from convention, this week India’s minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, himself a Buddhist, said publicly that reincarnation of the Dalai Lama “is to be decided by the established convention and as per the wish of the Dalai Lama himself. Nobody else has the right to decide it except him.”China’s foreign ministry instantly called on India to “stop using Tibet issues to interfere in China’s domestic affairs”.View image in fullscreenDharamshala is preparting for the Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday celebrations.Photograph: Niharika Kulkarni/AFP/Getty ImagesAmitabh Mathur, a former adviser on Tibet to the Indian government, said it was highly likely that the Dalai Lama’s office would have pre-informed New Delhi of the reincarnation announcement, and that Rijiju’s statement would not have been made without consulting senior ministries. “It certainly goes above and beyond what has been said by India before,” said Mathur.Tibet and China clash over next reincarnation of the Dalai LamaRead moreHe suggested the geopolitical challenges over the Dalai Lama were likely to become more complicated after his death, particularly if the Tibetan officials located his reincarnation inside India, in defiance of China’s own possible selection.Tibetan officials have confirmed that unofficial back channels remained open with the Chinese and that the Dalai Lama was doing all he could to prevent the 600-year-old Tibetan Buddhist institution being hijacked by Chinese political interests. “He’s viewing these things from a very practical lens,” said Mathur. “Don’t forget, the Dalai Lama is as well versed in statecraft as he is in spiritual matters.”Nonetheless, as he led prayers on the eve of his birthday, the Tibetan leader – who appeared in good health – emphasised that he did not foresee his death coming any time soon. “I hope,” he said, “to live another 30 or 40 years.”Explore more on these topicsDalai LamaTibetChinaBuddhismReligionAsia PacificIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

As his plane approached the US, it felt as though the battle had hit home, as Sandberg worried that he would face reprisals over comments he had made during his travels to the French media on the future of research in the US.“It makes you think about what your status is as a researcher and the principle of academic freedom,” he said. “Things have really changed … The entire system of research and higher education in the United States is really under attack.”Soon after, he became one of the nearly 300 researchers to apply for a French university’sgroundbreaking offerof “scientific asylum”. Launched by Aix-Marseille University, the programme was amongthe firstin Europe to offer reprieve to researchers reeling from the US crackdown on academia, promising three years of funding for about 20 researchers.Last week, Sandberg was revealed as one of the 39 researchers shortlisted for the programme. “The American system is being destroyed at the moment,” he told the 80 reporters who turned up to meet the candidates. “I think a lot of people in the United States and as well as here inEuropehave not understood the level to which all of higher education is being targeted.”View image in fullscreenÉric Berton, the president of Aix-Marseille University, likened the programme to the US welcoming academics from France during the second world war.Photograph: Theo Giacometti/The GuardianAs reports began to emerge of funding freezes, cuts and executive orders targeting institutions across the Atlantic, institutions across Europesprang into action, announcing plans to lure US-based academics.At Aix-Marseille University,hundreds of applications came infrom researchers tied to institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, Nasa, Columbia, Yale and Stanford. Three months after they launched their programme – named Safe Place for Science – the university said it had received more than 500 inquiries.It was a glimpse of the “historic” moment the world was facing, said Éric Berton, the university’s president. “More than 80 years ago, asFrancewas under occupation and repression, America welcomed exiled researchers, offering them a helping hand and allowing them to keep science alive,” he said. “And now, in a sad reversal of history, some American scientists have arrived in France in search of a space for freedom, thought and research.”Last week, the university opened its doors, allowing reporters to meet a handful of the Americans who were in the final running to join the programme. As high-profile battles play out between universitiessuch as Harvardand the White House, all of them asked that their institutions not be named, citing concerns that their employers could face reprisals.Some declined to speak to the media, while others asked that their full names not be used, offering a hint of how the Trump administration’s actions are sowing anxiety among academics. “The worry is that we’ve already seen that scientists are being detained at the border. Granted they’re not US citizens, but they’re even saying now that if you speak out against the government, they will deport you,” said a biological anthropologist who asked to be identified only as Lisa. “And so I don’t need anything against me at the moment until I can officially move here with my family.”View image in fullscreenJames, a climate scientist, said he had mixed feelings about leaving the US for France.Photograph: Theo Giacometti/The GuardianTogether the researchers painted a picture of a profession that had beenplunged into uncertaintyas the US government slashes spending on research grants and dismantles the federal institutions that manage and hand out funding. Months into Trump’s second presidency, politics is increasingly blurring into academia as the government works to root out anything it deems as “wokeism” from the post-secondary world.“There’s a lot of censorship now, it’s crazy,” said Carol Lee, an evolutionary biologist, pointing to thelist of termsnow seen as off-limits in research grant applications. “There are a lot of words that we’re not allowed to use. We’re not allowed to use the words diversity, women, LGBTQ.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And China is laying out the red carpet. If people are getting an offer from Canada, people are moving to Canada.”For Lisa, the biological anthropologist, the reality of dismantling her life in the US and moving her husband, a schoolteacher, and their two kids across the Atlantic was starting to sink in. “It’s excitement, but it’s nerve-racking,” she said.She knew she had to get out when it became clear that Trump had won a second term. Months later, she has found a potential path to do so, but is still wrapping her head around all that taking part in Aix-Marseille University’s programme would entail.“It is a big pay cut,” she said. “My kids are super gung-ho. My husband is just worried that he won’t find a job. Which is my worry too, because I don’t think I’ll be able to afford four of us on my salary.”But for her, and several others on the shortlist, the view was that there were few other options. “It’s a very discouraging time to be a scientist,” said James, a climate researcher who asked that his full name not be used. “I feel America has always had a sort of anti-intellectual strain – it happens to be very ascendant right now. It’s a relatively small proportion that doesn’t trust scientists, but it’s unfortunately a very powerful segment.”His wife had also been shortlisted for the same programme in southern France, leaving the couple on the brink of uprooting the lives and careers they had spent decades building in the US. “I have very mixed feelings,” he said. “I’m very grateful that we’ll have the opportunity, but really quite sad that I need the opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsAcademicsDonald TrumpFranceHigher educationEuropeResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

But what would James Definitely Not?All sorts of things. Skydiving. Morris dancing. Living as a monk. Agricultural work. Being a high court judge. Anything that involves dressing up. I’m not too fussy about food. I can’t think of anything I wouldn’t eat, although I have a strange ambivalence about broccoli. I can’t make my mind up about it and it infuriates people. People say: you’re not doing it properly. I think: how do you know how I’m doing it? I’ve heard you can roast it with bits of bacon, garlic and olive oil. In which case, it’s not only broccoli any more, is it?Why does the water flow anticlockwise down the plug hole in Australia but clockwise in the UK?Because of the rotation of the Earth. If you go to the equator – and I’ve done this – you can do an experiment with a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom. If you stand exactly on the equator and drop in a matchstick, it will stay stationary. If you walk north of the equator 100 paces, it starts going around one way. If you walk south, it starts going the other way. It’s quite a boring experiment and you have to have absolutely nothing else left to do in your life.If you could have a sandwich named after you, what would you call it?I think sandwiches are crap. I’m making a series on YouTube called Sarnies of the 70s, where we dig up these terrible old fillings like Spam and Branston pickle. It’s fascinating to remember what we ate when I was a child. But I describe sandwiches – and I’m afraid I also think this about pizza – as crisis food. Nobody ever says: I can’t be bothered to cook tonight. Should we go out for a sandwich? No one wants a sandwich. You are reduced to having a sandwich.Both you and Clarkson own pubs. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, which pub would you rather be stuck at?Oh, mine. It’s in Wiltshire. We’re heavily armed down here. People queue up at Clarkson’s. There’s queueing protocol going on, which I don’t like. We’ve had this argument many times. The whole point of the bar in a pub is that it’s wide and shallow. It’s not a hatch. Why would you queue at it? Good bar people know the order in which to serve.View image in fullscreenJeremy Clarkson behind the bar at his pub in an episode of Clarkson’s Farm.Photograph: Prime VideoAlan Davies told usin this very columnthat he gets mistaken for you.

I’ve been told I look like King Théoden from Lord of the Rings. Robert Plant is very flattering. Billy Connolly is flattering. Unfortunately, quite a few times when I’ve been out walking or riding my bike around London, I’ve been mistaken forJeremy Clarkson. I have to go home, examine myself very deeply and think: what have I done?The small print on your new tour, Explorers, warns of “occasional scent, fog and other immersive theatrical elements”. What is your favourite occasional scent?Good question. I like all the obvious nature scents like flowers, freshly mown grass and rain falling on a hot pavement. I like the smell of bicycle shops because I like that smell of rubber and rubber solution. It’s not a pervy or fetish thing. I like the smell of freshly pumped petrol, which smells exactly like what it isn’t – which is delicious. If you get petrol in your mouth because you’re siphoning it from the lawnmower, it tastes absolutely foul. But when it’s coming out of the pump into your car, it’s got almost a mango juice smell to it.What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?I haven’t had any, really. I’ve never run up to Alan Davies and said: “I loveTop Gear. Can I have your autograph?”Would you rather die at the bottom of the ocean or deep out into space?I’ve wondered about dying in space. The Apollo 11 lunar module was too fragile to test on Earth, so what if it hadn’t worked? They’d have been stuck on the moon for eternity. How do you end it? Do you just sit there and gradually suffocate? Or do you take off your space helmet, take a deep breath, open the door and effectively boil? Dying at the bottom of the ocean feels particularly dark and lonely. I’m going to go for space because the view in the last few seconds would be better.If you could change the size of any animal and keep it as a pet, what would you choose?A miniature elephant. I was going to say a tiger. But then you can just have a domestic cat, can’t you? A miniature great white shark in a pond in your garden would be pretty cool. If you had miniature blue whales in an aquarium, they’d come up to the surface and blow off in miniature.

I’ve always preferred proper butcher’s sausages, featuring hog casings filled with well-seasoned pork shoulder, then linked and set (I used to love making them with butcherRay SmithonRiver Cottage’s regular Pig in a Day courses). Farmer’s markets and butchers are the best places to find them, but supermarkets now have a wide range, too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Texture is key: a good sausage should have bite and a bit of snap, with a juicy, meaty interior, rather than pasty from too much rusk (a crumb typically made with flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda) in the filling. Then there’s flavour: a decent sausage should be rich in umami, well-seasoned but not overpowering, so you can actually taste the meat, and not be too sweet or packed with preservatives.Sourcing matters, too, both from the perspective of taste and personal and planetary health. TheRSPCA has several welfare concernsabout pork production in the UK, but better options do exist, and not always at a premium. Supermarkets do respond to customer feedback, so call or email if your local one doesn’t stock good-value, high-welfare meat.Riverford,Pipers Farmand my local farmers’ market are my go-to suppliers, but I also buy from supermarkets when I need to. If free-range or organic sausages are too expensive for your budget or not available to you locally, look for ones labelled RSPCA Assured or outdoor-bred or -reared, and check the excellent pork labelling guide atFarms Not Factories.Let’s not forget the casings, either, because they’re also important. Natural pork casings brown and crisp up beautifully, which helps give the banger that all-important snap; alginate casings (derived from seaweed) are ultra-processed but use renewable resources, and also offer a decent pop. Collagen casings, however, which are made from beef hide or bone, can be rubbery and don’t caramelise as well.The ingredient lists varied widely across brands, but all the sausages I tested contained sulphites (used to preserve colour and extend shelf life, though they can cause adverse reactions in people who are sensitive to them); some were also full of ultra-processed additives such as stabilisers, emulsifiers and preservatives. If you’re curious or concerned about what’s in your sausage,the Yuka appis a useful tool – it scans product barcodes and gives easy-to-understand scores based on ingredients, additives, saturated fat, salt and sugar levels.As for the cooking, the best approach, in my book, is low and slow with a little oil and, essentially, some butter as well, because that helps them caramelise and go sticky. A high heat will split them, leaking precious fat and leaving them dry, which is a travesty.This was a fascinating tasting, and proof that you can still get a decent sausage at a fair price – and feel good about eating it, too.Bestoverall:Waitrose No 1 British free-range pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 400g at Waitrose (£1.19/100g)★★★★☆Made with 98% pork, these had the highest meat content of the whole test group. They had a juicy, coarse texture and well-balanced flavour, seasoned with mace, sage and onion. The aroma is fresh and inviting, and the flavour holds its own without being overpowering. The vegetable-based casings mean they don’t brown as readily, but that can be rectified by adding a little butter to the pan. Free-range outdoor-raised pork andstrong animal welfare credentials, too, alongside a fully recyclable tray and sleeve – only the film tray cover is not. While not the most striking in appearance, they’re a classic, high-welfare banger with strong provenance.Best bargain:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference British pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (75p/100g)★★★☆☆A high-quality banger for the price. A distinct, herby aroma with a hint of nutmeg, while the coarse texture is true to the traditional British banger. Made with 93% pork and using alginate casings, they didn’t colour well, but kept their shape. Contains sodium metabisulphite and vitamin C, but otherwise free from ultra-processed additives. Outdoor-bred and RSPCA Assured, this is a decent supermarket option.And the rest …Farmison & Co the Nidderdale sausageView image in fullscreen£6.95 for 400g at Farmison & Co (£1.74/100g)£6.95 for 400g at Ocado (£1.74/100g)★★★★☆A well-crafted sausage made with native-breed pork and a mix of fine and coarse textures that delivers on both flavour and provenance. It has a classic linked shape and caramelises nicely, although it did lose some shape during cooking, which means it may have been overfilled. The aroma is nostalgic and inviting, with balanced seasoning and super umami. Although made with only 78% meat (79% if bought directly from Farmison), these have wonderful flavour and texture. Farmison stands out for its commitment to traditional methods and transparent sourcing, with full details on breed and origin clearly laid out on itswebsite. Free-range pork, recyclable packaging apart from the film,and a focus on heritage make this sausage feel worth the premium. A strong contender with a clear mission to support British smallholdings and culinary heritage.The Black Farmer premium pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Ocado (75p/100g)£3.50 for 400g at Tesco (88p/100g)★★★☆☆These sausages brown nicely with a good caramelised colour and a classic butcher’s shape. The coarse texture gives them a satisfying bite, while the aroma is pleasantly mild, with hints of nutmeg and sage. Well balanced with good seasoning. They’re made with 90% pork and natural pork casings, but contain sodium sulphites and stabiliser triphosphates. While there’s no transparent animal welfare standard, the packaging is mostly recyclable. The meat is British but likely to be intensively reared. Overall, a solid all-rounder with decent credentials and fair value for money.The Jolly Hog outdoor-bred proper porkersView image in fullscreen£4 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (£1/100g)£4.25 for 400g at Waitrose (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆Brown beautifully with great caramelisation and a classic banger shape. The texture is juicy, combining both fine and coarse meat for a satisfying mouthfeel. The aroma is sweet with hints of white pepper and mace. Well seasoned, with a balanced depth of flavour. Made with 84% pork and encased in natural pork casings, but they’re highly processed and contain sodium metabisulphite, emulsifiers (mono- and di-glycerides) and stabiliser diphosphates. Outdoor-bred (born outdoors, fattened in sheds) and RSPCA Assured, and packed in a recyclable card sleeve and plastic tray, this is a traditional British banger of OK provenance and quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Not cheap, but a solid supermarket option with good flavour and the RSPCA’s stamp of approval.(For just 50p more, you can get certifiedfree-range sausages from the M&S Collectionrange, which is a great investment in quality.)Daylesford organic outdoor-reared pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£7.50 for 400g at Ocado (£1.88/100g)£7.50 for 400g at Daylesford (£1.88/100g)★★★☆☆A premium sausage with high welfare credentials and good flavour. These have a classic shape and colour, but did lose some structure when cooked, probably due to the natural casings or air pockets in the filling. The fine texture and light, peppery seasoning give a clean, subtle taste. Certified organic and made with outdoor-reared native breed pork sourced from Gloucestershire, these are packed in a recyclable tray and sleeve. Contain sulphites and fortified wheat flour (gluten), but are otherwise minimally processed. A strongsustainability storyand provenance make this a standout choice for ethical shoppers, albeit at a price.Tesco Finest pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Tesco (75p/100g)★★☆☆☆These sausages have a coarse texture and a fresh aroma with a strong hint of sage. They’re on the saltier end and quite plain in taste, with a touch of white pepper. Made from 90% pork shoulder and belly, encased in vegetable casings, they didn’t colour too well. They’re more processed than some brands and contain sodium metabisulphite, calcium lactate and diphosphate stabilisers. The packaging is recyclable, except for the film. Overall, a basic supermarket sausage with modest provenance and processing credentials.Heck 97% pork gluten-free sausagesView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (81p/100g)£3.25 for 400g at Ocado (81p/100g)★★☆☆☆With a medium coarse texture, these are quite plain in taste. They’re less processed than some, and made with 97% pork shoulder, but with beef collagen casings. Lacks transparent animal welfare standards, though most of the packaging is recyclable and the brand discloses a carbon footprint of 2.4kg CO₂, which does add some kudos. Better than some budget options, but a rather middling product with few redeeming qualities beyond their pork content.Richmond thick pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£2.18 for 410g at Asda (53p/100g)£2.30 for 410g at Tesco (56p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Less sausage and more processed meat-like substance wrapped in a reconstituted casing. These shrank and wrinkled in the pan, and have a pasty, floury texture typical of an emulsified product with very low meat content. The aroma is faint and sterile, while the taste is sweet and lacks depth. Made with just 42% pork and encased in beef collagen casings, they also contain soya protein, stabilisers such as guar gum, diphosphates and sulphites, firmly placing them in the ultra-processed category. The packaging aims for full recyclability by 2025, but the provenance is unclear, with no traceability or UK meat assurance. Contains gluten. The cheapest option, but hard even to call this a “sausage”.Explore more on these topicsSausagesThe FilterFoodPorkMeatSupermarketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The well-paid endorsement deals, the online followers and proximity to the celebrity establishment are all perks of the industry.But one hidden cost will be familiar to anyone coping with the 21st-century economy: burnout. The Guardian has spoken to five creators with a combined audience of millions who have all experienced degrees of workplace stress or fatigue.“There’s no off button in this job,” says Melanie Murphy, 35, who has been a social media creator since 2013. “The algorithms never stop. You can’t pause the internet because you get sick. If you vanish for two or three months completely you know the algorithms will bring your followers to new accounts who are being active.”Dublin-based Murphy says her symptoms of burnout were “complete fatigue” and a “nerve sensation of tingling and brain fog.” A dose of Covid was then “the straw that broke the camel’s back”, she adds.View image in fullscreenMelanie Murphy says she had a ‘complete burnout breakdown’.There is also a self-consciousness that comes with struggling in a nascent industry some people may not take seriously – or cannot conceive of as being hard work, given its association with glamour or the ephemeral nature of social media fame.“It’s really hard to talk about my job impacting how bad I felt without people being like ‘shut up you’re so privileged’,” Murphy admits.She is not alone. Five out of ten creators say they have experienced burnout as a direct result of their career as a social media creator, according to a survey of 1,000 creators in the US and the UK by Billion Dollar Boy, a London-based advertising agency that works with creators. Nearly four out of 10 (37%) have considered quitting their career due to burnout as well, according to the research.The WorldHealthOrganization defines burnout as the consequence of “chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”, with symptoms including exhaustion, reduced effectiveness at your job and a feeling of mental distance from your work.Others spoken to by the Guardian talk of creative block and their own lack of engagement with the material that, by necessity, they have to churn out on a regular basis.View image in fullscreenAllison Chen icing cakes.Photograph: PR handout“There’s no HR department, there’s no union,” says Murphy. “If my husband got burned out, like I did, and literally couldn’t stand up off the couch, he would have someone to call. The only people I could really call were creators.”Shortly after the birth of her second child in 2023, Murphy had what she called a “complete burnout breakdown”.“My body was, like, ‘I’m done’.”Perhaps ironically, Murphy says, YouTube videos were a help in her recovery. She also sought out therapy and “pulled back a bit” from work, having saved up enough money to cover a few months off. Now, after “a lot of brain retraining stuff”, she only posts two YouTube videos a month – having run at one or two a week before. She used to be “very, very active” on Instagram but now posts only “if I feel inspired to post”.Now, Murphy and her husband, an airline pilot, “kind of match” each other in earnings which “does mentally take a bit of weight off”. Murphy’s company makes “a bit over” €100,000 (£86,000) a year. She says she has cut down heavily on unpaid work and changes to her work-life balance have probably reduced her earnings by about €20,000.Murphy has 800,000 followers across YouTube and Instagram – her main sources of income are brand sponsorship – including from the Trainwell personal training app and online therapy company BetterHelp – and advertising revenue from YouTube, which shares a substantial cut of ad spend with creators.Creators – people who make a living from making online content, often via brand sponsorships – lead a professional life that reflects the digital culture they are embedded in. It is fast, demanding and vulnerable to sudden changes of taste.View image in fullscreenHannah Witton took three months of maternity leave, the longest she knows of among content creators.Photograph: YouTubeBecky Owen, the global chief marketing officer at Billion Dollar Boy, says the average full-time creator has to carry out a number of tasks to be successful, from planning, filming and editing content to managing relationships with brands; and, of course, engaging with followers.Owen says the “wheels are coming off” for many creators.“It’s prevalent. It’s not just a few,” she says, adding that there can also be an emotional toll because a lot of creators “monetise themselves” and turn their lives into content.“Beyond getting new commercial deals, the greatest challenge creators face is managing the business side of what they do. They’re juggling countless responsibilities, trying to excel at all of them, often before they even have a chance to focus on the content itself. That’s where they really need support,” says Owen.Allison Chen, 22, a New York-based creator who specialises inbaking, cooking and lifestyle contentand has a combined audience of 1.3 million across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, says the pursuit of views and engagement can be wearying. It can leave you feeling “regardless of how many views you get, there is always a higher peak to achieve”.“Social media creators also have the same comparison and self-esteem issues that regular social media users have,” she says.Chen says deleting social media apps has helped. Her routine involves downloading Instagram and TikTok whenever she needs to upload content – and then deleting them. “I repeat it every day,” she says.London-based Hannah Witton, 33, suffered in a similar way. She restructured her professional life to avoid burning out completely, having been a full-time creator since 2015. Witton took three months of maternity leave after giving birth to her son in 2022. Three months, she says, is the longest amount of time she has seen any creator take off after having children.View image in fullscreenHannah Witton restructured her professional life to avoid burning out completely.“The shortest amount of time I’ve seen someone take off [for maternity leave] is three days. I wish I could have taken longer off but I just knew it wasn’t possible.”When she returned, Witton found she was trying to produce the same amount of YouTube and podcast content – on sex and relationship advice – within half the time, with the added financial burden of paying for a producer to help make her content.“Something had to suffer. And the thing that was suffering was me and the content – and my relationship with the content,” she adds. “Audiences are smart, and I think they can pick up on those kinds of things.This week Google-owned YouTube called on the UK government to take creators more seriously as a profession, in recognition of the “profound economic and cultural contributions they bring to the UK’s creative industries”.Meanwhile, creators used to broadcasting advice to others are having to rally themselves through the hard times.“It is possible to get through this and still earn good money while not spreading yourself too thin, which many creators do,” says Murphy.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaDigital mediaHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Activists say it’s a sign of a wider assault on the LGBTQ+ communityRobin Bullerin San FranciscoSat 5 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTShareAsSan Francisco’s pride festivities came to a close last week, a cloud hung over the otherwise joyful celebrations as the city’sLGBTQ+ communitylearned that the US government hadstripped a naval shipof its name honoring the gay rights pioneer Harvey Milk.Donald Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, claimed the action showed the administration’s commitment to “taking the politics” out of military naming conventions. San Francisco’s queer community saw things differently.For many, the move was yet another example of Trump taking a swipe at progressive values. To others, the decision to remove Milk’s name from the frigate represented something more sinister: an intention, on the part of an emboldened administration, to take the LGBTQ+ community out of public view and to strike their accomplishments from the historical record.It’s blatant malice. They want to erase us and eradicate our history like we don’t existEric Berchtold“On its own, it is not the most significant offense that we’ve witnessed in the past six months,” said Marc Stein, a professor of history atSan FranciscoState University who researches sexuality and politics. “But when combined with so many other things, it sends a powerful message.”Hegseth’s announcement is the latest attack on Milk’s legacy from conservatives in California and on the national stage. In 2023, the southern California city of Temecula made news when its school boardattempted to remove references to Milkfrom elementary school textbooks. Before that, it was revealed that Tucker Carlson, while a college student, had apparently beenconnected to a society celebrating Milk’s murderer.‘Accelerated censorship’: advocates criticize US supreme court ruling on LGBTQ+ booksRead moreSince Trump took office, the rollback of LGBTQ+ rights and visibility has only accelerated, from a directive topurge the military of transgender service members, to a supreme court decision allowing K-12 students toopt out of reading materials with LGBTQ+ themes.Taken together, LGBTQ+ advocates and community members fear that much of the progress made to secure their rights since Milk’s assassination in 1978 is in peril.“The renaming of the ship is part of a broader pattern wherein theTrump administrationand its allies are trying to roll back the advances of the last several decades,” said Stein.At the Cinch Saloon, a historic gay bar in San Francisco’s Castro district, June’s Pride month celebrations were held against a backdrop of conversations about the fate of the community. Bartender Eric Berchtold expressed fear that the administration is working up to rescind the right to same-sex marriage. “It’s blatant malice,” Berchtold said. “They want to erase us and eradicate our history like we don’t exist.”Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride, said that fears of rolling back progress have been felt most acutely by older members of the community who were part of the gay liberation movement in the 1960s and 70s.View image in fullscreenCleve Jones speaks in Palm Springs, California, in 2017.Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty ImagesAmong those affected people are Cleve Jones, an activist and friend of Milk’s who worked in Milk’s office when he was city supervisor. “I can remember when we were criminalized, when we were routinely beaten and fired, when you could not have a job if you were known to be gay,” said Jones.When Milk was elected as city supervisor in 1977, he was the country’s first openly gay politician. Two decades prior, he had been forced to resign from the navy due to his sexuality.That’s why publicly displaying Milk’s name on a military vessel represents much more than a public gesture, explained Craig Loftin, professor of American studies atCaliforniaState University, Fullerton and a scholar of LGBTQ+ history. “In the big-picture history of LGBTQ people, the quest for public visibility and recognition is at the core and center of that narrative,” he said.“[Milk] was a leader in this idea of not hiding in the shadows.”A swinging pendulumThat isn’t to say that the quest for gay liberation has been linear.While the gay liberation movement made enormous strides on the fronts of decriminalization and visibility in the 1960s and 70s, the rise of the religious right as a powerful political bloc in the 80s paused progress. That coincided with the onset of the Aids pandemic, which devastated gay communities across the country – nowhere more acutely than in San Francisco. In response to silence on the part of the federal government and the Reagan administration, a new wave of activism was spurred that demanded research into treatment and condemned homophobic discrimination.“It’s waxed and waned,” said Loftin. “It took several years before we had activist groups like Aact Up channeling their rage in a strategic, focused way that yielded significant results and moved gay culture further than where it had been,” Loftin said. In the decades that followed, the community saw same-sex marriage legalized, the military’s “Don’t ask don’t tell” policy repealed, and, most recently, a surge of visibility for trans Americans. “There is a pendulum quality to a lot of history, but especially LGBT history.”Knowing this, Loftin is hopeful that the community will come together and fight back with vigor. “My optimistic thought is that because they’re hitting us so hard and so fast, the pendulum will swing back the other direction, hopefully harder and faster,” he said. “[Trump] is awakening a dragon.”View image in fullscreenThe Pride parade in San Francisco on 29 June 2025.Photograph: Terry Schmitt/UPI/ShutterstockBerchtold, the Cinch Saloon bartender, said he saw a lot more activism among patrons today than he did when he started working at the bar 22 years ago.Jones is more fearful. To him, there is a gulf between an older generation that remembers the traumas of past decades, and a younger cohort that takes the advances for granted.“Younger ones never watched everyone they knew die,” said Jones. “I carry those memories with me as I interact daily with young people who are completely oblivious to that reality.”‘Everything feels very fragile’To Stein and others, what is most jarring about the renaming of USNS Harvey Milk is that it lifts the veil on which groups the administration plans to target. Until now, policy decisions have primarily focused on restricting the rights of trans Americans – which advocates say has had the effect of making cisgender members of the LGBTQ+ community complacent.“It is a lie that the administration is only going after trans people,” said Stein. “They are especially targeting trans people … but [cis] gay and lesbian people should not feel like they are going to be safe from what’s happening.”Jones echoed: “There is a significant number of gay and lesbian men and women who may think this is going to stop with trans people. That’s just foolishness.”View image in fullscreenHarvey Milk speaks during a police community relations meeting in San Francisco in September 1974.Photograph: Janet Fries/Getty ImagesAdvocates and scholars also see attacks on the LGBTQ+ community as connected to the administration’s larger ambitions to curb civil liberties, including those of women and immigrants.“There is going to be great variation depending on … where you live,” said Stein, drawing a thread between disparities in access to gender-affirming care, abortion rights and immigrant protections. “Those of us who are in San Francisco and California are protected in some respects from the worst of what’s going on, but we also live in a nation with a powerful federal government.“Everything is very fragile at this moment,” added Ford. “You can’t take for granted that they’re not going to try to take your rights.”Jones says that if he were alive today, Harvey Milk would agree. A Jewish American who came of age during the second world war, he would have seen the government’s actions as indicative of an unhealthy democracy and sounded the alarm.“He would say, ‘Watch out. We are on the brink. It is happening again. It is unfolding all around us.’”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsSan FranciscoCaliforniaWest CoastTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thirty years later it became established as the papal summer bolthole after undergoing renovations commissioned by Pope Urbano VIII, the first pontiff to holiday in the town in a quest to flee the stifling heat of Rome.The tradition continued almost uninterrupted until Francis, who tended to shun the Vatican’s pomp and privilege. He visited Castel Gandolfo on only three occasions, and all during the first months of his papacy – twice to preside over mass and once to see his predecessor, Benedict.View image in fullscreenThe Apostolic Palace in Castel Gandolfo.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Archivio Marco Piraccini/Marco Piraccini/Mondadori/GettyFrancis spent his summers in his humble Vatican abode. But he did help to transform Castel Gandolfo from a pilgrim site into more of a tourist destination after the papal palace became a museum in 2015. Visitors can wander through its Renaissance-era gardens and vast rooms, which contain garments worn by popes dating back to the 16th century, and marvel at the views over Lake Albano from the windows of the papal bedroom.“We did feel abandoned by Francis and the first few years were difficult,” said Maurizio Carosi, who with his son owns a bar and gift shop opposite the palace. “But now we’ve moved on from a pilgrim town to a tourist one – so even if Francis didn’t come, he gave us a spiritual charge.”The palace will remain a museum while Leo and his accompanying Swiss Guards reside in another newly renovated property within its grounds.View image in fullscreenThe Apostolic Palace gardens in Castel Gandolfo.Photograph: Sandro Barbagallo/Musei VaticaniThe excitement in the town is palpable as it prepares for the American pontiff’s arrival. Gardeners were preening the lawns within the palace on Friday morning while workers were putting the finishing touches to the pope’s holiday home and tidying up its tennis court so that Leo can indulge his passion for the game.As with pontiffs over history, the break will not only be about resting. Leo is expected to host audiences and rosaries for the local residents and carry out Vatican duties.View image in fullscreenPope John Paul II and George W Bush looking out over Lake Albano from Castel Gandolfo in 2001.Photograph: Arturo Mari/AP“Just because they’re on holiday, they don’t necessarily stop working,” said Tadeusz Rozmus, the parish priest of San Tommoso dal Villanova church. “Pope John Paul II wrote encyclicals here and others have hosted heads of state. Castel Gandolfo is a much more pleasant place for them to reside in summer as they can escape the heat of Rome, and with the way things are going, summers are only going to get hotter.”Alberto De Angelis, the mayor of Castel Gandolfo, has readily embraced the papal return, especially as it is expected to help fill the town’s coffers. “Knowing that Pope Leo has listened to the wishes of our community, which for years has been waiting to see a pope in its square, fills our hearts and souls with joy,” he wrote on social media.View image in fullscreenA view of the Pontiff's private apartments, now open to tourists as a museum.Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty ImagesThe town’s smattering of gift shops are yet to be filled with souvenirs featuring Leo’s image. “Everyone is asking for his image but I heard he doesn’t want to see his face on glasses, plates, candles or whatever,” Carosi said, claiming that whatever was being sold in Rome was bootleg. “Leo souvenirs have not been officially authorised.”Carosi was born in Castel Gandolfo and recalls popes of the past greeting people in the square and shaking hands.When it comes to Pope Leo, he said his character was “yet to be discovered”. “But I know he’ll be happy here,” he added. “He’ll have a view of the lake, will breathe the fresh air and will find himself among good people. Being an athletic pope, he will also have the possibility to enjoy long walks in the gardens.”Explore more on these topicsItalyPope Leo XIVThe papacyEuropePope FrancisCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

The Maga ruling class has a thirst for busty women in tight clothes, which fuses something new – what Mark Zuckerberg has called “masculine energy” – with nostalgia for 1950s America. (The “again” in Make America Great Again may not have a date stamp, but it comes with a white picket fence.) As a symbol of fertility, full breasts are catnip to a regime obsessed with breeding and keen to limit reproductive freedoms.“Breasts,” wrote Jess Cartner-Morley, “have always been political – and right now they’re front and centre again. Is it yet another way in which Trump’s worldview is reshaping the culture?”Read more2.‘People pay to be told lies’: the rise and fall of the world’s first ayahuasca multinationalView image in fullscreenAlberto Varela, the founder of Inner MasteryComposite: Guardian Design / Getty Images / Crónica / El Mundo“His staff were underpaid and overworked, his manner overbearing. He built a hierarchical organisation that made him rich, while many of his employees went into debt with the company. He promoted ayahuasca as a panacea for all suffering, and despite having no training, practised a confrontational and sometimes cruel form of therapy on vulnerable people with serious trauma.Traditional practitioners and healers protested he was bringing their practice into disrepute. Ayahuasca was not something you could roll out on an industrial scale with minimal oversight, they said. Accidents would happen.”Alberto Varela claimed he wanted to use sacred plant medicine to free people’s minds. But as the organisation grew, wrote Sam Edwards, his followers discovered a darker reality.Read more3.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionView image in fullscreenIllustration: Xiao Mei/The GuardianThe Guardian reproductive health and justice reporter Carter Sherman has spent the past few years travelling the country and interviewing more than 100 teenagers and twentysomethings about their sex lives: “It is true that they are having even less sex, less than millennials, but they are not uninterested in sex. Instead, many have understood, from an early age, something that eluded past generations: that sex, its consequences, and control over both are political weapons.” Here, she explores how they’re resisting older definitions of sex and gender – in the face of the right’s bid for bodily control.Read more4.‘I was living in Doodle Land and didn’t know how to get back’: the million-dollar artist who drew himself crazyView image in fullscreenSam Cox in his studio in KentPhotograph: Julian Anderson/The Guardian“From the road, it’s barely visible; glimpsed, maybe, if peered at with cheeks pressed against the property’s imposing iron gates.

But at the end of a snaking, hedge-lined driveway is an incongruous home: a sprawling, six-bedroom neo-Georgian mansion, almost every inch, inside and out, covered in the trademark black-on-white line drawings of its owner, Mr Doodle, the 31-year-old artist Sam Cox.”Michael Segalov travelled to the Doodle House to meet Cox and his family and to talk about how, behind the scenes of creating this piece of giant liveable art, he was unravelling into psychosis.Read more5.‘I have a lot of sympathy for Elon Musk’: Succession creator Jesse Armstrong on his tech bros AI satire MountainheadView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesArmstrong is the master of ripped-from-the-headlines drama, a writer who skewers the billionaire class.

Tomorrow, back on it.”The Arsenal centre-back added to ITV: “[It was] cheap defending one-v-one, we learnt from those mistakes in fairness and grew in the game, but on the ball, [we were] not good enough, we couldn’t keep it in the areas that we needed to keep it, and we got better as they tired, we took advantage of that, but [it was] not enough in the end.“I think, everybody [has to] take responsibility for themselves today, have a look at ‘what areas could they have had an impact on the game more?’ - I will. But then tomorrow, we have a new gameplan [versus the Netherlands], different spaces available, a different type of opposition, but we’ll look at what we did today, and improve.”England were 2-0 at the break after a dominant spell of pressure from France in the latter part of the first half, but after the game, their head coach Sarina Wiegman defended their decision not to make any half-time substitutions. When asked why she did not make any changes at the break, she replied: “Because I had the conviction that having a short meeting at half-time [would mean] that we could do things better in the second half and I wanted to give them that opportunity. I think this team is capable so I didn’t want to swap straight away.”Wiegman also defended her decision to give Lauren James a first start since April, following a hamstring injury. The Chelsea forward had played just half an hour of football, against Jamaica last Sunday, before this tournament but Wiegman deemed her fit to face France. When asked if that had been a gamble or a mistake, Wiegman replied: “No, I don’t see it as a mistake, it was a choice. I think if she had scored in that first minute, and if the cross she made in the first half where we just couldn’t just get a head on it [had gone in], I think we’d be having a different conversation.”England defender Jess Carter said: “I think we played like we were a little bit scared today, maybe we weren’t aggressive enough, we maybe were worrying about their threats in behind and what they can do rather than doing what we can do. We didn’t do as well on the ball, or off the ball.“The only positive to take is that last 10 minutes, for me watching it from the side I really believed we would get a goal, I really felt like we could get a second goal. We have to focus on that 10 minutes that we did have at the end and take that over to the next game, the energy the subs brought on was incredible, really pressing and being aggressive. It’s something to take to the next game.”France, who reached the semi-finals in England three years ago, face Wales next, hoping to secure a place in the knockout stages. Their in-form winger Delphine Cascarino recognised that England had made a bright start but added: “Yes, we got scared initially at the beginning but we remained calm. We managed to get to our goal and our objective. We complied with our gameplan and we really controlled this match, I believe.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025France women's football teamEngland women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

When he skied one, Ollie Pope ended up blundering in from long-leg to try to catch it with his arms shrugged wide in apology to everyone else because he did not have the slightest idea where the ball had actually gone.It was the first chance Gill had given in this match, which might have been why Pope seemed so amazed to find it coming his way. When Gill hit another one up off Shoaib Bashir, the bowler had the good sense to call it for himself.Midway through the morning session, round about the time people were just reaching into their picnics for a first sandwich, Rishabh Pant conjured up an entirely new shot, a sort of standing sweep in which he whipped his bat down, around and under one of Josh Tongue’s 90mph inswingers with so much torque that he had to drop his body down into a crouch during his follow-through. He was on his knees as he turned to watch the ball disappear into the depths of the Raglan Stand.Pant plays strokes that are beyond the imagining of even England’s batsmen and they have hit a fair few too in the past four days, from Jamie Smith’s ramrod-backed hook shots off Prasidh Krishna, to Harry Brook’s step-and-fetch-it smack down the ground off Mohammed Siraj. There have been pick-ups over midwicket, flat-bats down the ground, slog-sweeps into the grandstands, scoops, uppercuts, switch-hits and reverses. You will be able to catch them all on the highlights reels.View image in fullscreenShubman Gill hits one of eight sixes in India’s second innings.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersBut not Gill’s forward defence. And that is the shot that has been the backbeat of this match. Pock, pock, pock, as insistent as the tick-tock of the clock. Each and every one felt like a rebuke to English cricket and all the fans in the Hollies Stand who spent the day chanting about how boring he was being by refusing to declare.They were a rebuke to everyone who ever said that Gill’s generation do not have the technique, or the temperament, needed to play Test cricket the old-fashioned way. He used it to break the back of the English attack, who were so thoroughly spent by the time it was done that it would be a surprise if this combination of bowlers played another game together.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 12 and a half hours of batting, spanning 549 balls, he has, single-handed, scored 42% of his side’s runs. All this from a man who had made one Test century outside Asia before this tour. There has not been anything like it from a new captain since South Africa’s Graeme Smith peeled off those back-to-back double hundreds in 2003.He did it despite coming into this match under all sorts of pressure. One-nil down in his first series as captain after conceding 373 in the fourth innings at Headingley, he found himself having to explain the baffling decision to leave Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav out of the team, which meant he had to do without his best fast bowler and his best slow bowler, as well as his team’s senior pro and de facto captain in the field, so they could fit in a couple of willing all-rounders to prop up the batting. If he had failed, they would have failed, and if they had failed, there would have been hell to pay.Sixes? They come by the dozen in this day and age, but a man who can defend himself like Gill has this week, that is something worth paying to see.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

And even that defeat, to the Czech player Tomas Berdych, was down to an elbow injury that forced him to retire.It is a staggering run, stretching over eight years and 45 matches. Yet rarely has Djokovic played as well as he did here against his fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic on Saturday night. Over the course of three destructive sets, Djokovic hit 60 winners to just 19 unforced errors as he put a masterclass of spin and subtlety, guile and laser-like power, to a wildly appreciative Centre Court.Wimbledon 2025: Djokovic races to victory; Sinner and Swiatek sail through – as it happenedRead moreCertainly Kecmanovic, the world No 49, had no answers. Then again, with the seven-time champion in this form, how many would? If anything the 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 score could have been even more emphatic.Victory left Djokovic beaming, especially when he was told that he had just become only the third player inWimbledonsingles’ history to enter the 100-win club, joining Martina Navratilova and Roger Federer. “It sounds very nice,” Djokovic said. “Particularly at this age, I am still going strong and still trying to compete with the younger players. I’m doing some slides and some splits on the court and am pushing myself to the limit.“Wimbledon is a dream tournament. And any history I make at my favourite tournament, I am blessed.”Initially we looked to be in for a contest of sorts. Djokovic started with an ace and won the first three points of the match. But Kecmanovic retaliated with a textbook drop shot and a forehand winner before forcing deuce.It set the early tone. Djokovic pressing, but with his opponent determined to resist. But, all of a sudden, the dam broke at 4-3. It came after one of the rallies of the tournament, a 14-shot thriller that twirled into life with an immaculate Djokovic drop shot.View image in fullscreen‘It is never easy playing a friend.’ Novak Djokovic and compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic embrace at the end.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAIt led to the players exchanging diving volleys at the net, before a lob volley by Djokovic had his opponent scrambling backwards. Somehow Kecmanovic got to the ball, and the subsequent smash, and even looked to be winning the point with a pass. But while Djokovic turned 38 in May, he is as spry as he ever was. Somehow he was able to launch his body towards the ball, Boris Becker-style, and hit a winning backhand volley.As the Centre Crowd crowd rose to applaud, Kecmanovic stood at the net smiling before playfully hitting a ball at Djokovic, his good friend and Davis Cup teammate. But it also seemed to implant a thought in his head: how the hell am I going to beat this guy?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came at a really important moment, as well. 4-3, deuce, long point. We were both running around each other, around the whole court. Then just that diving backhand volley down the line passing shot. Can’t wait to see the highlights!“I was pumped for that one,” he added. “Obviously I’m not diving as much on the courts. Obviously the only surface where you would dive is grass. But I’m not used to it as much. So these unique, rare moments are really something you cherish. Of course, if you win a point like this in an important moment, it is even better.”It had been a startlingly impressive opening, but it turned out Djokovic was just getting started. He raced through the second set in just 24 minutes, hitting 13 winners and just two unforced errors.When Kecmanovic finally stemmed the bleeding by holding his serve at the start of the third set, he felt compelled to raise his arms in triumph. But Djokovic continued to play God-mode tennis, and when a lob volley put him 5-1 up it looked like nothing could interrupt his flow.That wasn’t quite the case as a rowdy Centre Court crowd briefly distracted him. After losing three games in a row, he recovered his composure to book a last-16 match against Alex de Minaur, who beat August Holmgren in straight sets.“I enjoyed myself very much, except the last couple of games,” said Djokovic. “A bit of tension at the end, things got a bit complicated. It is never easy playing a friend and compatriot.”True. But over one hour and 48 minutes of engrossing tennis, Djokovic showed he means business. And while the bookies might think this year’s tournament is a near coin-toss between Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, write him off at your peril.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Novak DjokovicWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead of arriving for the grass court season exhausted from her efforts, for once she had additional time to train, work and adapt her game to the one surface she has yet to conquer.Swiatek’s growing comfort was reflected in an efficient performance as she dismantled the dangerous Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth round.Emma Raducanu grows stronger and smarter after tough Wimbledon exitRead moreSwiatek will face Clara Tauson. The 23rd seed upset the2022 Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, the 11th seed, 7-6 (6), 6-3.“I was just in the zone,” said Swiatek. “I knew what I wanted to play and I knew I needed to be brave and just let my hand do the job. Play fast and grab it from the beginning. You can’t let Danielle play her winners. I’m really happy with the performance because there were no ups and downs.”After winningfive grand slams, establishing herself as the most successful player of her generation and spending most of the past few years as the world No 1, the No 8 seeding next to Swiatek’s name, reflective of her recent difficulties, looks very strange.The 24-year-old has not won a title sincethe 2024 French Openand has been open about how her perfectionism, one of her biggest strengths, has been her biggest weakness in recent months, often leading to her becoming overwhelmed by negative thoughts.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek (right) and Danielle Collins meet at the net.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersEven though she was unable to win a fourth consecutive French Open title last month, it appeared to mark a turning point for Swiatek as she stopped overthinking and began to play with greater freedom again.

I’m just looking for that feeling for the matches as well and today was a good day. In Bad Homburg, I played many good matches so I’m getting confidence. It’s a new experience feeling good on the grass.”There was plenty of subtext to this match. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, the pair had an extended conversation at the net after Collins’s retirement from their quarter-final. Collins revealed she had called Swiatek “insincere” during their handshake.Collins has made it clear she does not care for Swiatek. In May, Collins was responsible for one of Swiatek’s worst clay-court losses in recent years in the third round at the Italian Open.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek serves against Danielle Collins.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesThis time, however, the American had no response to an excellent performance. Swiatek served brilliantly, winning 86% of points behind her first serve. Despite holding on to only one break for most of the second set, she did not lose her serve all match.On her groundstrokes, Swiatek also struck her forehand brilliantly, constantly using it to dominate the baseline exchanges. She showed her increased comfort with her movement by effortlessly soaking up Collins’s and forcing errors with her defence.With her spinny forehand, her preference for slower surfaces that afford her more time on the ball, her serving struggles and the general challenge of moving well on grass, there are countless reasons why Swiatek has struggled to produce her best on the surface. Many different players and playing styles are capable of thriving on these more forgiving modern courts.

That incredible conclusion to an otherwise pedestrian match also included a late red card given to Real Madrid’s Dean Huijsen, the impressive new arrival in central defence, who will miss the semi-final as a result of bringing down Serhou Guirassy right after Mbappé’s stupendous volley for Real Madrid’s third.Real Madrid dominated most of the game, with Gonzalo García opening the scoring for his impressive fourth goal of the tournament and the left-back Fran García (no relation) adding the second – his first goal in 52 appearances this season.But while the final stages may be the most memorable period of this game for any of the 76,611 who filled MetLife stadium to 93% of its listed capacity, it was the Garcías’ contributions and Real Madrid’s general play through the preceding 90 minutes that most represented what the Spanish giants might look like in the coming season under Alonso.View image in fullscreenFran García celebrates after scoring Real Madrid’s second goal against Borussia Dortmund.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APWhen the former Bayer Leverkusen manager took over the club he used to play for after Carlo Ancelotti’s disappointing final season, theClub World Cupkicked off in just over two weeks. The start of a major standalone tournament coming so soon after a new manager appointment is far from the norm, but Alonso’s intentions were clear.“I see it as an opportunity for two reasons,” he said. “One, because it means that we can accelerate processes, get to know each other sooner, see things that we want to be. Then it’s a chance to fight for another trophy … If we can bring together those two things then it can be a very good start.”It has indeed been a very good start. On Saturday, as they had throughout the tournament so far, Alonso’s Real Madrid seamlessly integrated young players that seemed primed to make a leap into the elite, with their contributions helping Real to be one win away from a chance at that trophy in the Club World Cup final.The goals came from two players who represent the strong role youth development still can play in a Madrid team laden with stars. Both are academy products, and both caused danger throughout the match aside from their goals.View image in fullscreenThibaut Courtois denies Borussia Dortmund's Marcel Sabitzer an equaliser from the last shot of the game.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThe assists, meanwhile, seem to indicate that the Spanish giant’s succession planning for life after Luka Modric is working. Arda Guler, the 20-year old Turkey international, was brilliant once again, providing the assist for Gonzalo García’s opener and generally being a nuisance to a timid Dortmund backline throughout the 90 minutes. Along the backline, Huijsen effectively controlled proceedings just behind the brilliant Aurélien Tchouaméni in defensive midfield. The pair, along with Huijsen’s partner in central defence, Antonio Rüdiger, kept Dortmund from threatening much if at all – at least until Huijsen’s red card and the madness that surrounded it.These quietly efficient performances bring to mind the best of what Alonso was able to achieve in his time in charge of Bayer Leverkusen. But this is still Real Madrid, and there are still big stars capable of improvising extraordinary things. Vinícius Júnior, as usual, proved to be good for a few of those moments, at one point attempting an audacious chip from 30-plus yards that nonetheless went high and wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French superstar is still finding his feet after being in hospital with gastroenteritis, an illness that reportedly cost him 5kg of body weight and presumably days of training and getting in sync with his new manager and teammates. With the added lightness, though, Mbappé provided the game’s signature moment in that memorable stoppage time, hanging in the air to meet a cross with a sideways scissor kick from close range that flew past Dortmund’s goalkeeper, Gregor Kobel, and into the back of the net, delighting the near-capacity crowd.Now, Mbappé will hope to be fully fit and one can imagine he will be breaking down Alonso’s door begging to start a headline semi-final at this same venue on Wednesday, his first chance to face the team with whom he became a World Cup winner and a global superstar.Upon his introduction to his new charges, Alonso set out “to see the things we want to be” and “to win a trophy” as his goals. “If we can bring together those two things then it can be a very good start,” he said.That good start is now just one win from yet another major final forLos Merengues.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Real MadridBorussia DortmundClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A salvage operation of this scale had not been part of anyone’s masterplan, but at least Ella Toone and Chloe Kelly knew exactly how to move the dial at a European Championship. They were the history makers at Wembley in England’s most recent appearance on this stage; if it was going to be anyone, it surely had to be them.There were to beno heroics this time, even if Selma Bacha’s late clearance was ultimately all that came between Wiegman’s players and a draw. That statement is, in itself, illusory because the manager must face questions about her selection here. She had plumped for Lauren James’s explosive gifts in the No 10 position, sticking to the claim that the Chelsea forward was ready to ramp up her recovery from injury, but the call backfired badly. England were misshapen and leggy where it mattered; the game simply got away from them and so, with another ill-conceived step against the Netherlands, could their Euro 2025 campaign.France 2-1 England: Women’s Euro 2025 player ratingsRead moreAnother dreamy Swiss summer’s day found its culmination in Letzigrund, a low-slung bowl whose prominence as an athletics arena does not diminish its appeal. It felt like tournament football by numbers: a sunny exoticism in the air as England shirts mingled with French colours, along with a sprinkling of local representation, while the masted summit of Uetliberg gazed over to the south.Wiegman rubbed her hands together as England walked out for the anthems and who, at the point, could have felt anything but the same tingle of anticipation? Debate about her decisions and, particularly, treatment of absent senior players had hung over the buildup but the camp had felt positive and bright since their arrival on Monday. There are plenty in this squad who have the muscle memory of winners.James’s inclusion was by some distance the main talking point. The hamstring she injured in April was deemed up to the challenge posed by a physical France; few others on show this month can strike a ball like James, or provide the explosive moment of inspiration and incision that rips the tightest of encounters asunder. Wiegman felt the chance was worth taking; a full-tilt James could set the tone in the most obvious heavyweight clash of this group stage.Perhaps she would think twice next time. England started fiercely enough and should have led when James unleashed that right foot inside the box but fired over. In those early moments she was everywhere, drifting wide and helping overload the left-back Bacha. Had Alessia Russo’s 16th minute piece of opportunism not been overturned by the video assistant referee (VAR), perhaps they would have pulled clear. Instead they were swamped from thereon, rarely threatening until Keira Walsh injected a late urgency that had been painfully absent.England did not have the legs, nous or numbers to combat a French midfield three that seized control after those early wobbles. It is a time-honoured observation that France have historically underachieved by, consciously or not, prioritising individualism over the tenets of assembling a competent unit. This time they were admirably connected throughout. Meanwhile Walsh and Georgia Stanway were frequently left exposed by a wandering James, who perhaps lacked the match sharpness to get up and down and was guilty of overelaborating in deep positions.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway tussles with Grace Geyoro but looked low on rhythm having come back from knee surgery in January.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPAThey were outnumbered by their opponents, for whom the captain Sakina Karchaoui was superb. Stanway has endured well-documented injury problems of her own, winning her race to Switzerland afterknee surgery in Januarybut looking noticeably low on rhythm. In hindsight Wiegman’s bet on not one, but two players with fitness concerns in the engine room came to look foolhardy. A hungry, athletic, slick France were unlikely pass up on such a gift.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sandy Baltimore, one of the speed merchants who bothered England all night, finished off the move but they had been found wanting in a key duel. The trend continued until those dying moments when the kitchen sink came out: this was a curiously flat and sloppy display all round, their timing out of sync and intensity only surfacing in bursts. When Leah Williamson steamed in on Karchaoui midway through the second half, both players briefly left in a heap but unscathed, at least it suggested an awareness of what had been missing.They must discover it in time for what looks, in effect, to be an early knockout tie against the Netherlands on Wednesday. A positive reading might be that England were sharpened up here: given the jolt reigning champions sometimes need.A defeat on opening night can define a summer’s work positively. But if the watching Thomas Tuchel, the England men’s manager who has found himself under scrutiny, sought information here about the secret sauce that cooks up trophy parades in London he will have been frustrated.

Got the better of Georgia Stanway repeatedly.8Oriane Jean-FrançoisStruggled against Lauren James early on when the Lionesses were briefly on top but improved as the match went on.6Grace GeyoroShowed good energy to put pressure on Keira Walsh, especially in the first half, and thwarted England’s gameplan.7Delphine CascarinoShe has the most assists in the NWSL so far in 2025 and contributed another here, tormenting England at times.8CascarinoMarie-Antoinette KatotoGood movement in the box for her goal and linked up play nicely.

After a thoroughly enjoyable journey to their first major tournament, Wales collided with the 2017 European champions and were left dizzy and disorientated. During the course of an instructive 90 minutes in the shadow of Lucerne’s Mount Pilatus, Vivianne Miedema scored her 100th international goal. Perhaps even more significantly Andries Jonker’s side did enough to suggest it would be thoroughly unwise to assume England and France are destined to fill Group D’s top two places.After conceding three soft goals and regularly being saved by either the woodwork or their quietly impressive goalkeeper, Olivia Clark, Wales will almost certainly be watching the knockout phase on television. No matter; Rhian Wilkinson’s players should eventually come to look back on this chastening evening in central Switzerland with real pride at their part in a landmark piece of national football history.At least the Wales coach was still smiling as she faced the media. “It was a tough, painful, game,” she said. “But this is a tough group, the big event, it’s intimidating. It’s also what we want, we want to play the biggest teams.“We’ve got two more games and we’ve got to show up. We’ve got to cut out the defensive lapses and create more but my players have put in a massive shift, they’ve run their socks off.”View image in fullscreenWales fans turned out in their thousands to support the team against the Netherlands.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APWilkinson, one of the women’s game’s rising managerial talents, had asked her players to turn into latter day Princess Gwenllians and, on that level at least, they did not disappoint. As a 12th-century Welsh warrior princess, Gwenllian led an army into battle against the mighty Normans and the Wales head coach spied parallels in the scale of the challenge her team faced against the Netherlands here.Like Gwenllian they ultimately met a sticky end but for 45 minutes Angharad James and company put up a wonderfully defiant fight in front of the loudest of travelling Red Walls massed at one end of Allmend Stadion.Wales supporters have registered the second highest ticket sales of any country involved in Euro 2025’s group stage and almost 4,000 were here. Many had overcome delays and flight diversions prompted by a French air traffic controllers’ strike action but, by Saturday lunchtime, downtown Lucerne was a kaleidoscope of Welsh red and Dutch orange.About 3,000 Netherlands fans saw their side dominate possession from the off. With Barcelona’s excellent wingback Esmee Brugts worrying Josie Green down the Dutch left, Wilkinson was soon imploring her players to make the game more compact.Yet as much as the Welsh back five spent protracted periods resisting hostile fire, the 38-year-old Jess Fishlock’s deployment as a false 9 blending indomitable industry with superior touch and vision sporadically ruffled the Netherlands.Wilkinson appeared content to see her team deliberately slow things down, with Lily Woodham’s booking for time-wasting a prime example of the early disruption to Dutch momentum that featured Miedema being second-guessed well by Rhiannon Roberts, initially.Jill Roord proved rather harder to pin down and, when she ghosted in behind Hayley Ladd, the Twente attacking midfielder unleashed the most vituperative of half-volleys which, having beaten Clark, ricocheted away off the inside of a post.It was quite a reprieve for Wales but their luck could not last and it finally ran out in the psychologically debilitating dying moments of first-half stoppage time. Just as Wilkinson’s containment plan seemed to have worked, the Manchester City striker received the ball from Daniëlle van de Donk and proceeded to put Roberts firmly in her place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlarm spread across Wilkinson’s face as the much-decorated former Canada defender watched Miedema tease Sunderland’s new signing from Real Betis by twice dropping a shoulder and feinting to shoot before finally swivelling imperiously beyond her bewildered marker. As Miedema’s perfectly calibrated 20-yard shot curved into a top corner, Welsh hopes dipped even lower than the early evening Swiss sun.Jonker, who had taken the precaution of ordering every outfield player back when Wales earlier won a couple of corners, simply looked relieved. On the eve of the tournament the outgoing Netherlands coach had taken to the airwaves to express his surprise and disappointment regarding his impending replacement by Arjan Veurink, the assistant to the England coach, Sarina Wiegman. In a heated pre-match press conference Jonker was asked if he was treating his arguably unimpressed players like “puppets”.As if to emphasise her team is well capable of rising above such creative tensions, Arsenal’s Victoria Pelova opened the second half by meeting Van de Donk’s lay off, taking a steadying touch and shooting unerringly beyond Clark. Wales had paid the price for being caught cold by a long ball over the top towards the advancing Van de Donk.Suitably encouraged, Miedema once again turned Roberts inside and picked out Roord with the outside of a boot, but the latter hit the woodwork again.It was purely a temporary stay of execution. When Jackie Groenen’s shot rebounded off the bar, Wales failed to clear properly, permitting Brugts to volley beyond Clark, before Lineth Beerensteyn evaded Clark’s reach only to see that effort disallowed for a tight offside.“We suffered,” said Wilkinson. “But sometimes a gameplan works, sometimes it doesn’t. You could see how tense we were but I’m not worried; these women will turn this round.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Wales women's football teamNetherlands women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Yet Kipyegon was able to find an extra gear as she ran the last 300m in a staggering 44 seconds to break her previous world record by 0.36sec.Faith Kipyegon certain a woman will break four-minute mile barrier within a decadeRead moreEight days earlier she had faded sharply in Paris to run 4:06 for the mile. But here she looked far stronger and sharper as she came home in 3min 48.68sec. Ethiopia’s Diribe Welteji was second in 3:51.44, ahead of Australia’s Jessica Hull in 3:52.67. Britain’s Georgia Bell finished strongly to come fourth in a season’s best 3:54.76.Earlier the Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m champion, Beatrice Chebet, became the first woman in history to cover 5,000m inside 14 minutes, clocking a world record of 13:58.06. The Kenyan, returning to the track where she broke the world 10,000m record last year, was tracked for most of the race by the former world 5,000m record holder Gudaf Tsegay and Agnes Jebet Ngetich.View image in fullscreenBeatrice Chebet leads the 5,000m at the Prefontaine Classic en route to a world record.Photograph: Ali Gradischer/Getty ImagesBut she kicked hard with 200m remaining before taking 2.15sec off Tsegay’s best. Ngetich took second place in 14:01.29, the third-fastest time in history, and Tsegay placed third in 14:04.41.“When I was coming here to Eugene, I was coming to prepare to run a world record, and I said I have to try,” Chebet said. “I said: ‘If Faith is trying, why not me?’ And today, I’m so happy because I’ve achieved being the first woman to run under 14.”There was also a thrilling men’s mile race as the 20-year-old Dutch star Niels Laros came from 20 metres back in the final 100m to somehow beat Yarod Neguse by one-hundredth of a second in a time of 3:45.94.There was also a shock in the women’s 100m as Melissa Jefferson-Wooden beat the Olympic champion, Julien Alfred, in a thriller. The pair were locked together all the way down the straight before the American just got her head in front to win in 10.75, despite running into a -1.5m/s headwind, with Alfred 0.02 back.Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith was sixth in 11.14 with Sha’Carri Richardson last in 11.19.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsWorld recordsnewsShareReuse this content"

We were in the front all day, we were there in the split, and in the end, we could use our strength to finish it off.”View image in fullscreenThe peloton passes the Porte de Paris arch near the start of the first stage of the Tour de France.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a chaotic opening stage, raced at breakneck speeds through gusting crosswinds, there were soon crashes, punctures and dropped riders, with many left chasing back frantically through the race convoy.Eighteen kilometres from Lille, the crosswinds finally forced a decisive coup, and a select bunch moved ahead. In the front group were the race favourites Tadej Pogacar,the defending championof UAE Team Emirates XRG, and Jonas Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike, the 2022 and 2023 winner.“It was a stressful day, but a good day for us,” Vingegaard said. “It was our plan to try and go in the wind with 20 kms to go. The team kept me out of trouble and they made the split as well.”The Dane argued that an attack in the crosswinds was inevitable. “It’s either us, or somebody else trying. We knew it was windy enough. Either you go, or somebody else goes. But then, at least you know you’re on the front.”Pogacar was equally pleased with the outcome. “From kilometre zero, we were at the front,” Pogacar said. “It was hectic, just as we thought.”Behind the two favourites, the fallout was brutal, with frantic scrambling required by those who had lost contact with the wheel ahead of them. Among those cut adrift were the Olympic road race champion, Remco Evenepoel of Soudal Quick-Step, who was third overall last year, the five-time Grand Tour winner Primoz Roglic, of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, and Vingegaard’s teammate Simon Yates,the Giro d’Italia winner.Evenepoel and Roglic are now already on the back foot, as is Geraint Thomas, with all three having lost 39 seconds to Pogacar and Vingegaard. Yates, meanwhile, is a distant 164th overall, already more than six minutes behind the main favourites.“Thirty-nine seconds is a pain,” Evenepoel said. “It’s always annoying to start a Tour behind.”It was also a painful start to the Tour for Ineos Grenadiers, after Filippo Ganna, expected to be a key contender in stage five’s individual time trial around Caen, suffered the ignominy of being the first rider to abandon after an earlier crash, just 52km into the race.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 21-year-old finished dead last, a few metres ahead of the broom wagon, after losing more than nine minutes.The stage looped south-west and then headed north, through the Pas-de-Calais, before skirting the Belgian border and turning back towards Lille as the peloton sped towards the finish. The early breakaway, of five riders, survived for 70km before the peloton reeled them in near the first intermediate sprint, at La Motte-au-Bois, won by Jonathan Milan of Lidl-Trek.View image in fullscreenMattéo Vercher, of TotalEnergies, gets back on his bike after colliding with Cofidis’s Benjamin Thomas.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThe subsequent post-sprint lull was filled by the French duo Benjamin Thomas, a gold medallist on the track in last year’s Paris Olympics now riding for Cofidis, and TotalEnergies’ Mattéo Vercher.A breathless peloton was briefly content to give them their head on the approach to the climb of the Mont Cassel, as they built a lead nudging a minute. But in a moment that seemed to epitomise the home nation’s malaise, the pair self-sabotaged when sprinting for the climbing points at the fourth-category climb, Thomas’s rear wheel sliding across the dusty cobbles and taking a furious Vercher down, as they crested the top of the hill.Meanwhile, Dave Brailsfordmade a reclusive returnto the Tour’s start village. “We all love having him back and feel honoured that he’s here,” Ineos Grenadiers’ sports director, Zak Dempster, said. For now, however, Brailsford isn’t yet honouring the media with any public appearances.Stage two, heading north from Lauwin-Planque towards the Channel at Boulogne-sur-Mer, will surely offer more of the same, but with three short, sharp climbs in the closing 30km, the denouement may prove even more chaotic.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

In front of a partisan full house at the Estadio Uno in La Plata, an hour’s drive south of Buenos Aires, the century maker displayed his customary calm to steer the tourists through troubled waters early on.England were reduced to 13 when losing two players to the sin-bin before half-time, yet somehow made it to the interval ahead thanks to Ford’s drop goal. From there they were the only team in the contest. In a remarkable transformation Steve Borthwick’s team bagged four second-half tries, three in seven minutes between the 42nd and 49th minute.All Blacks hold off depleted France in thriller and Wales slump again in JapanRead moreTom Roebuck claimed two tries and Freddie Steward added a third, before Cadan Murley came off the bench to seal the deal late on.“It is all about the team, as always,” said Ford, deflecting praise away from his own milestone achievement. “We understand how difficult it is here in Argentina so it is a great win for us. We were under pressure in the first half; we gave away too many penalties and could not get out of our half. We had to make sure second half we got out of our half and create some try-scoring opportunities, which we did.“We have to back it up next week and we know Argentina will come back at us. Another challenge that we will look forward to.”Ford came into the game inspired by messages from Frank Lampard, John Terry and the former prime minister Tony Blair, a fly-half during his school days at Fettes College. The trio sent video tributes, along with adventurer Bear Grylls, and cricket stars Freddie Flintoff and Joe Root.He, himself, insisted it was “just another day at the office” but it did not feel that way as Alex Coles and Seb Atkinson were sent to the sin-bin repelling Argentina’s early charge.Quick GuideArgentina 12-35 England: first Test teams and scorersShowArgentinaElizalde (Roger 61); Isgro, Cinti, Piccardo, Cordero (Moroni 62); Carreras, Bertranou (Benítez Cruz 49); Vivas (Gallo 45), Montoya (capt; Bernasconi 72), Delgado (Coria Marchetti 45), Paulos (Grondona 54), Rubiolo, Matera, González, Isa (Moro 49).TriesMatera, Rubiolo.ConCarreras.EnglandSteward; Roebuck, Slade, Atkinson, Muir (Atkinson 71); Ford (co-capt), B Spencer (Van Poortvliet 57); Baxter (Rodd 57), George (co-capt; Dan 76), Heyes (Opoku-Fordjour 57), Ewels (Cunningham-South 49), Coles, B Curry, Underhill (Pepper 61); Willis (Dombrandt 61).Sin-binColes 16-26, Atkinson 21-31.Tries:Roebuck 2, Steward, Murley.ConsFord 3.PensFord 2.Drop goalFord.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The match could easily have got away from England at that stage given they were blooding three new caps in Atkinson, Will Muir and Guy Pepper.

It allowed them to lead at half-time, from where they took the game away from their hosts in hugely impressive fashion.Within two minutes Roebuck had his first, put over in the corner by Ford and Steward. Five minutes later Ford was at it again, zinging a pass to Steward for the second. Before the Pumas could get their head round what was happening, Roebuck helped himself to his second from a Heyes pass.Stung into a response, Argentina finally found a cutting edge. Pablo Matera pulled a try back, from SantiagoCarreras’s cross kick, and soon after Pedro Rubiolo added a second.A fortnight ago an England team very similar to this blew a 12-point lead to lose to France at Twickenham in the final five minutes of their non-cap international.For a moment it seemed the Pumas had the wind in their sails and could inflict further damage. But Ford stepped up, put a calm hand on the tiller and guided England away from danger.Two penalties, the conversion of Murley’s late try, and the match was won. It is only half-time in the series but given Borthwick had billed Argentina as “heavy favourites”, this was a statement win of which England can feel rightly proud.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionArgentina rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The touring side lacked rhythm and composure and are unlikely to be able to select the head coach’s son, Owen, for their game against the Brumbies in Canberra on Wednesday.The Lions have been told they are wrong to suggest the Waratahs deliberately watered the pitch to make life trickier for the visitors. Despite heavy rain having fallen in Sydney earlier in the week and some evening dew on the grass, Farrell suggested after the game that the Waratahs may have also played a part. “The pitch was very wet,” he said.Alex Mitchell helps error-prone Lions edge past gritty NSW WaratahsRead moreWhile the Lions did manage to hold on for their third successive win in Australia, they coughed up 20 turnovers and registered just one try in the second half against a side who finished eighth in this year’s Super Rugby. “There’s a bit of frustration,” said Farrell. “We’re disappointed enough given the amount of possession and territory we had and how we dealt with certain situations.“When you have 70% territory, 60% possession and 20 turnovers, that’s by far not clinical enough. We have to put our hands up and say that amount of turnover ball is credit to them but not good enough for us.”Farrell was also critical of the Lions’ relative lack of impact at the breakdown, a potential worry with the Test series against the Wallabies looming. “We know that all Australian sides put pressure on the ball. Not just this year but across the history of the game that’s what it’s always been about.“We need to be better than that. [And] when the ball is slow because of the pressure at the breakdown you can’t keep shovelling ball out wide and expecting to get on the front foot.”The Lions do not anticipateOwen Farrellbeing available for the final midweek fixture before the first Test on 19 July. The former England captain, who arrived in Australia on Friday, is recovering from jetlag and has not played for two months. “I don’t honestly know but I would think Wednesday’s too soon,” said Andy Farrell.View image in fullscreenAndy Farrell cuts a frustrated figure after the Lions’ underwhelming display against the Waratahs.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesIf that is the case, then Farrell Jr, jokingly booed by his teammates when his face appeared on the big screen during the match, will have one game – against a combined AUS/NZ Invitational side in Adelaide next Saturday – to stake any kind of claim for Brisbane.Of the state of the pitch, Farrell said: “I was asking [the Waratahs backs coach] Mike Catt after the game and he was laughing. We’ve seen that [watering the pitch] done plenty of times. I mean, that’s good tactics from them, isn’t it? The ball’s slippy, the breakdown’s ferocious and the line speed from them is high-octane stuff as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to play in that as well, but we also know they are the top side in the Australian division [of Super Rugby]. We also know what happened to the Lions in 2013 [the tourists lost 14-12].

So how about Lincoln Cathedral, the London Marathon … or wheelie bins?Sat 5 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 16.48 EDTShareFunctional and depressing at the same time – the meal dealAthena KugblenuComedian and writerAfter the £10 note with Jane Austen was issued in 2017, I joked that “patriarchy is putting Jane Austen on money after we’ve all switched to contactless”. The Bank of England’s decision to ask the public what they want on their cash stirs the same “too little, too late” sentiment in me. Still, it is nice to take a day off from the cynicism and tackle the question with sincerity: what item, idea or thing best represents Britain? So much comes to mind: aGreggs vegan sausage roll; a rail replacement bus; atraffic conestuck somewhere it’s not supposed to be. All things quintessentially British. However, there is nothing as irrefutably representative of our national character than themeal deal. An unsatisfying sandwich, a shrinkflation-hit packet of crisps and a flat fizzy drink. Functionally satiating and depressing at the same time. Stick that on your fiver and spend it (since that’s what a meal deal seems to cost these days).The ubiquitous robin redbreast is the democratic choiceDavid ReynoldsProfessor of international history at Cambridge UniversityDespite being a historian, I welcome the Bank of England’s decision to move away from historical and cultural figures. Icons touch too many nerves. I like theBermudian ideaof using flora and fauna to capture a country’s distinctive identity. A shift like this would show that we’re not trapped in tradition. It also plays to the passion for gardens even in thesmallest of spacesand gently reminds us of the climate crisis that is being pushed dangerously to the sidelines. Of course, the precise choice of plants and animals will also generate controversy but one on which everyone can, and will, have a view, ensuring it’s democratic rather than elitist. Personally, I would make a special plea to include therobin redbreast– colourful in voice and appearance all through the year.At a time of division, let’s laugh at ourselves and choose the seagullCoco KhanWriter and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UKSadly, the Bank of England has excluded “living people” from the criteria of what should adorn the new banknotes, which rules out my first choice: the “what a sad little life, Jane” guy. Hear me out. If you haven’t seen the iconic piece of British television to which this refers (it’s a line from an indignant concession speech by a contestant on Come Dine With Me), get thee to YouTube at once. It’s a television moment that has burrowed its way deep into the psyche of large swathes of the public. And at a time of enormous division, what could be amore unifying source of national pride than our irreverent sense of humour? Perhaps this tone applied to the allowed criteria could bear fruit. Native animals and landscapes? Got to be a seagull, chip in beak. Architecture and landmarks? Surely the wheelie bin. Admittedly none are as worthy as say, the suffragettes or the Windrush generation, or feel as emotional as the NHS or our precious rivers and lakes. But it would be a bold message to the world: here we are, a nation so resilient, thick-skinned and confident it can even gently laugh at itself.Lincoln Cathedral reminds us of the endurance of communityConnor MyersStudent at the University of Exeter and a Guardian internIt’s often London-based landmarks that occupy the nation’s imagination with these things. So, with an eye on representing Britain’s architectural heritage and the ingenuity of our early craftsmen outside of the capital, I proposeLincoln Cathedral. A perhaps radical but entirely worthy option, the structure overtook the Great Pyramid of Giza to become the world’s tallest building upon its completion in 1311. The majority of the cathedral still stands to this day, having withstood wars and periods of rapid social change. And, having housed one of onlyfour survivingcopies of Magna Carta, its importance to the British democratic tradition is hard to overstate. In a world moving away from cold, hard, physical cash, Lincoln Cathedral on the notes that remain in circulation would remind us of the ambition of those who came before us, and the endurance of the communities that kept it standing.Removing barriers of race, colour and creed: the London MarathonHenry BonsuBroadcaster and journalistNot so long ago, the Bank of England would have been on safe ground. Back when people and tastes were more monochrome, it was relatively easy to decide which historical figures had enough universal appeal to appear on our banknotes. But now that even a Labour prime minister can declare we’re becoming an “island of strangers”, how do we agree on a notable figure who can withstand the fury of today’s culture wars? Thankfully, the bank has widened the net to include suggestions from the worlds of architecture, popular culture, nature or great events. This means that as well asOlaudah Equiano, an enslaved African who bought his freedom and became a great 18th-century abolitionist and writer, I can suggest an annual occasion that truly speaks not just to who we are, but who we might become if only we listened to our better angels. It attractsmore active participantsthan any other event of its kind, it removes barriers of race, colour or creed rather than erecting them, and sends a healthy message around the world about Britain and the people who live here. I speak of course of the London Marathon.

Same with the court of public opinionSat 5 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTShareLaws are for the poorsWouldn’t it be nice if, just now and again, bad things happened to bad people? Wouldn’t it be refreshing if violence against women was taken seriously instead of being treated like one big joke?Yes, but alas, that is not the world we live in. Over here in reality, we’ve got an adjudicatedsexual predatoras president, a defense secretary who has been accused ofsexual assaultandaggressive behaviourtowards his second wife, and a supreme court where a third of the male justices who get a final say on legal issues have beenaccused of sexual misconduct.And we’ve gotSean “Diddy” Combs: the disgraced entertainer who escaped this week with what many people consider to be a slap on the wrist after a New York jury delivered a mixed verdict in hisseven-week federal sex-trafficking trial. The trial was focused on allegations that Combs had coerced two women, including his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, to take part in “freak offs”: drug-fueled sexual encounters involving hired male prostitutes and humiliating acts.I don’t want to downplay the Diddy verdict. While Combs was acquitted on the most serious federal charges, of racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking, he was still found guilty of the lesser charges of transporting the male prostitutes he allegedly forced women to have sex with across state lines. The disgraced musician was also denied bail and is facing a barrage of new civil casesalleging abuse and assault. While we still don’t know how much time (if any) Combs will be sentenced to, he did not get off scot-free.I also don’t want to boil the results of a complex trial down to “misogyny”. It would be overly simplistic to say that the jury of eight men and four women in the Diddy trial simply didn’t believe women. The fact is Diddy was not on trial for being an abuser, or a bad person, or for his highly publicized battery of Cassie, one horrifying instance of which was caught on camera and the subject of a previous civil case. He was on trial for a specific set of charges, the most serious of which the prosecution did not have enough evidence to prove.But this is not to say that justice was done. Far from it. The trial is yet another demonstration that the legal system is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of intimate partner violence, the ways in which survivors deal with trauma, and the uneven power dynamics weaponized by abusers. If we had better legal frameworks for domestic violence and coercive control, perhaps prosecutors would not have turned to trafficking charges to try to secure justice.“Trafficking cases come with longer statutes of limitations, more severe penalties and more public support,” notes the human-trafficking expert Kimberly Mehlman-Orozcoin USA Today. “And existing domestic violence statutes are often outdated or ill-equipped to address coercive control, especially when the abuser is wealthy, powerful and legally savvy.”It’s not just the law that is ill-equipped to address coercive control – this complex issue is still minimized by some factions of the media. AWashington Post piece(written by two women), for example, described Combs as a “music producer turned modern-day Gatsby”, a framing which casts the “freak offs” as hedonism rather than something more sinister. The writer Sarah Kendzior notes that allusions to F Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby have been used to soften the image of high-level sexual predators like Jeffrey Epsteinfor decades.In the courts of public opinion, men like Combs are also far too often seen as playboys rather than predators. After the verdict on Wednesday, CNN reported that several spectators could be seenpouring baby oil on themselves, along with wearing T-shirts reading: A Freako is not a RICO (RICO is a reference to the racketeering charges).Perhaps what is most depressing about the Diddy verdict is that it is all too easy to imagine a path in which Combs finds his way back to prominence in public life. Donald Trump hasn’t ruledout pardoning Diddyand it is not inconceivable that he might; birds of a feather stick together, after all. Chris Brown still has a music career despite being charged with felony assault following a domestic violence incident when he beat upRihannain 2009.Brett Ratneris directing the very expensive Prime Video documentary about Melania Trump despite being accused ofsexual misconduct by six women(he hasdenied the claims). With enough money, good lawyers and the right connections, you can get away with almost anything.If you can call Sean Combs ‘Diddy’, you can respect someone’s preferred pronounsThe indictment against Diddy is titledUnited States of America v Sean Combs, AKA ‘Puff Daddy’, AKA ‘P.Diddy’, AKA ‘Diddy’, AKA ‘PD’, AKA ‘Love’. And yet some people think that calling someone by their preferred pronouns is too complicated.Horrific sexual violence used against Tigray’s women“Tigray is often described as a forgotten war,”Tess McClure writesin an incredibly disturbing but essential read. “If it has been forgotten, it is not by those who endured it, but by the global powers that looked away from one of the most brutal conflicts of this century.” That brutality includes reported wartime sexual abuse by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers against tens of thousands of Tigrayan women.After Texas banned abortion, more women nearly bled to death during miscarriagesMorebrilliant reporting from ProPublicaon the devastating effects of abortion bans.Men don’t sleep through baby cries after allThere’s a longstanding idea that women are fine-tuned to hear babies crying in a way that men aren’t.

Until last weekend, sure, it might have been a tough sell to proclaim them as an avatar for Britain’s revolting youth: prominent though they might be on the UK’s punk scene, they had about about 220,000 monthly listeners on Spotify – a mere 1,000,000 away from a place inthe top 10,000. But then, at Glastonbury, they made the most powerful possible case for broad media attention: theysaid something controversialabout Israel’s assault on Gaza, and opened up a chance to have a go at the BBC.And so the following morning, on thefront page of the Mail on Sunday: “NOW ARREST PUNK BAND WHO LED ‘DEATH TO ISRAELIS’ CHANTS AT GLASTONBURY.” Pascal Robinson-Foster, aka Bobby Vylan, had started a round of “antisemitic chanting” that was broadcast live on the corporation’s coverage of the festival, the story explained. Keir Starmer called it “appalling hate speech”. The calls for the band members’ arrest werequickly picked up, and before long the Conservatives were suggesting thatthe BBC should be prosecutedas well. On Monday, the story splashed in the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express.In fact, Robinson-Foster hadn’t chanted “Death to Israelis”, but “Death to the IDF”, a sharply different proposition, and one focused on the military machine attacking Gaza, the Israeli Defense Forces, rather than Israeli civilians. Nonetheless, the Mail on Sunday’s headline elision stuck. In much of the coverage, the idea that the chant was inherently antisemitic wasn’t even a question.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mail on SundayThe assertion was barely explained in any of the front page stories;the BBCand evenGlastonbury’s Emily Eaviswent along with it too. If you were looking for a rationale, the closest you got came fromStephen Pollard in the Mail on Sunday: after comparing the scene to the Nuremberg rallies, he added that “what they meant – because the IDF is the army of the world’s only Jewish state – was ‘Death, death to the Jews’”. Later, Andrew Neilwent further: “I was going to say that they sometimes seem to have more in common with the Nuremberg rally,” he mused. “But even the Nazis didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’.”Meanwhile, Yvette Cooper has ordered that Palestine Action should be banned as a terrorist group for its targeting of buildings and businesses in opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza, even though it has no agenda for violence – and after a last-minutelegal challenge to the proscription failedon Friday, supporting them is now a criminal offence. In that environment, any uncertainty about the Bob Vylan story would plainly be treated as apologism for hate speech, or worse, and so there wasn’t a lot of it about.In truth, though, a lot of people might have been uncertain. The IDF as metonym for any Jew is not a typical trope in the extremist’s lexicon, and the circumstances of the Israeli military’s assault on Gaza are the obvious, and urgent, locus of the chant’s intended force. Nonetheless, Avon and Somerset police have nowopened a criminal investigation.There are, to be sure, cogent objections to raise. Robinson-Foster described a record label boss as a “Zionist”, and while he noted that the executive “would speak very strongly about his support for Israel”, it is reasonable to accuse him of playing into afamiliar antisemitic trope, particularly about the music industry.Meanwhile, some Jewish people already alert to arise in racist hostility towards themmay well have felt alarmed by the sight of a crowd chanting against the Israeli army. Sensible people will come to a range of conclusions about those points – but there has been no space for that discussion, because the IDF apparently represents Jewish people everywhere, and everything else gets lost in the shuffle.The death toll in Gaza nowstands at more than 57,000, according to figures from the Gaza ministry of health; a robust independent surveyrecently put the countat almost 84,000. Israeli ministers and officials have given weight to allegations that a genocide is under way with assertions that starving two million Palestinians to deathmight be “justified and moral”and descriptions of aforced “deportation plan”. The amount of aid going into the territory remains afraction of what is needed. At least400 Palestinians have been killedrecently in incidents involving the IDF while approaching food distribution centres;Haaretz reportedthat soldiers were ordered to fire on them deliberately, a claim denied by Israel as “vicious lies”.Meanwhile, in the UK, the only adjacent story deemed worthy of front page attention is the conduct of an obscure punk-rap group from Ipswich. On 17 June,at least 59 Palestinians were killedafter the IDF fired on a crowd waiting for flour trucks near Khan Younis. The next day’s Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Sun and Daily Express featured no coverage of that story at all. Perhaps they would have done if the BBC had broadcast it live.It would be understandable, then, to conclude that the obsession with Bob Vylan – and Kneecap, and Palestine Action – matters mainly for its diversionary force. But there is something more at work here. It isn’t just that people are angry that the catastrophe in Gaza isn’t being given due attention: it is that their encounters with observable reality are being flatly denied. The choice framed by these stories is between being an anti-racist, or even an anti-terrorist, and being horrified by the slaughter of thousands of brown civilians in a military siege. For anyone who routinely sees videos of the aftermath of Israeli violence against civilians in their social media feeds, this is enough to make you feel crazy.Across the UK and the US, there is increasing evidence that people who object to what we might call the Vylanising of the Gaza discourse are finding their voice. In the general election last year, Labourlost five seats to pro-Gaza candidates, andforfeited about a third of its votein some Muslim majority areas. In New York, Zohran Mamdani won an underdog victory in the Democratic mayoral primary despite attempts to caricature him asan advocate of “jihad”. Some 55% of the British publicopposes Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, and 45% view Israel’s actions as genocidal; less than half of Americans are now moresympathetic to Israel than to Palestinians, and almost 60% of Democrats are now more supportive of Palestinians. Among people under 40, those numbers only go up.Those people have been told that Gaza protests are hate marches; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that US campus protesters arelargely motivated by antisemitism; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that Palestine Action is a terrorist organisation because it spray painted military aircraft; they can seeit’s not true. They have been repeatedly told, by Benjamin Netanyahu, that opposition to Israel’s war is antisemitic; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that the British governmentfinds Israel’s actions “intolerable”; they can seeit’s not true.Now they are being told that opposing the IDF is antisemitic, that the Glastonbury crowd is more virulent than the one at Nuremberg, and that direct action is a form of terrorism. They can see all that’s not true, either, and however far their view is from the front pages, they know that they are far from alone.Archie Bland is the editor of the Guardian’sFirst EditionnewsletterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was born in 1988, a year before the Iran-Iraq war came to an end. For my generation, war was something that belonged to the past – an impossible event, until this summer.For 12 days, we lived in the capital under incessant Israeli attacks, and what we saw has changed us for good: dead neighbours, buildings gutted and worry – endless, deep-etched worry – on the faces of people.There is comfort in speaking of “the Iranian people” as though we are one unified bloc. But like most societies, Iranians hold divergent views. When fighting first broke out, there were people who were glad to see a foreign power targeting the widely disliked Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) top brass, at least in the beginning. But others – though dissidents themselves – deeply resented the idea of foreign invasion. Some hardliners saw this war as a messianic mission to be carried through to the bitter end; others were numb to what was happening.But as the news filled with footage of civilian casualties, and the attacks grew harsher and less targeted, different social factions began to unite around the notion ofwatan, homeland. Patriotism gained new currency, and national pride was on most lips. Scenes of solidarity – whether lasting remains to be seen – abounded: landlords cancelling rent in light of the crisis; people outside Tehran hosting those fleeing the capital; no rush to grocery stores, no chaos, no panicked evacuations.In my view, the way European countries responded to Israel’s onslaught played a key role in this shift. The E3, alongside other silent nations across the continent,supportedthe Israeli strikes, using all the usual justifications, from Iran’snuclear programmeto itssupport for terrorism, all while the US president painted a rosy image of Iran’s supposed greatness the “day after’”on his Truth Social. But those of us in the Middle East know better. Images of fresh devastation in Gaza appear daily, and we remember the chaos in Libya, civil war in Syria, two decades of occupation in Iraq and the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan. There was no promise in these conflicts – no seeds of democracy being planted.Surely, the naked reality of Israel’s aggression would register with the same powers that rightly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – so that yet another war would not crush the region once again. And surely, these attacks – brutal, unprovoked, deliberate – should have been met with a flood of condemnation and fury at the disregard for the UN charter. But none came.The silence was deafening. A reminder that Iranian lives, clearly, carry less worth than those of others. This, for many of us, was the main takeaway from the support western countries extended to Israel. The war was on Iran, but it was justified through the same old playbook: racism. The indifference and inaction of those with the power to intervene; the media’s passive tone when referring to non-white casualties; the habitual disregard for their suffering; and the blase attitude towards attacks on lands outside the western orbit – with the German chancellor evensaying: “This is dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us.”Don’t count on the Iran-Israel ceasefire lasting. What Netanyahu really wants is a forever war | Simon TisdallRead moreMany Iranians are angry at this injustice – so much so that the idea of building a nuclear weapon, once confined to the radical fringes of politics, is now gaining traction among ordinary people. As one user put it on X: “No one seems concerned about the state of human rights in North Korea,” implying that nuclear warheads remain the only reliable deterrent against aggression.It would be foolish to trust Israel with a ceasefire. The country has a track record of violating agreements with impunity. That means a Damoclean sword still hangs over Tehran, even as the sound of explosions fades. From afar, this city of over 10 million people may appear to have returned to its usual bustle. But uncertainty still hangs in the air, and what makes it worse is the absence of any credible broker capable of ending the war. For many here, the west’s tacit, explicit or even active participation in the conflict disqualifies it from any role as a good-faith negotiator.From where I stand, once again, feelings of mistrust towardsEuropeare bedding in. Buildings will be rebuilt, infrastructure repaired. But what may be damaged beyond repair – perhaps irredeemably so – is the moral fabric on which Europe stands to preach to others. The double standards. The hypocrisy. The injustice of it all. The imperial mindset – still visibly alive and well – now casts a long shadow over how Europe is perceived. Not just for Iranians, I suspect, but for many people across the global south.These are hard times to live through. Whether the Islamic republic survives this moment, strikes a deal, or continues down its current path of retaliation, I do not know. But what is sure is that whoever governs Iran in the future will not forget what happened here.Hossein Hamdieh holds a joint PhD in Geography and Anthropology from Humboldt University of Berlin and King’s College London.

It’s authoritarian theatreKarim ZidanMMA was once used to curry favor with Putin. Now, Trump is using the UFC to project a nationalist cult of masculinitySat 5 Jul 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 15.06 EDTShareTen years ago – before I became an investigative journalist – I found myself working as a color commentator for a Russian mixed martial arts organization bankrolled by an oligarch deep in Vladimir Putin’s orbit.The job took me around the Russian Federation and its neighboring states, allowing me to pursue unique stories that would otherwise have been out of my reach. I met a Latvian fighter who escaped a black magic cult run by his coach, attended anMMAshow with the president of Ingushetia (now Russia’s deputy minister of defence) and knocked back vodka shots with ex-KGB officers and Russian oligarchs.Donald Trump says he wants to stage UFC fight on White House groundsRead moreThen there was the time the organization attempted to host an event in Moscow’s famed Red Square, one of the most historically and politically significant landmarks in Russia. It also sits adjacent to the Kremlin, the seat of Russia’s political power. The event would have been a chance for the organization and its oligarch to ingratiate themselves to Putin, a known MMA fan who had previously attended their shows.Logistical issues, including security concerns and layers of bureaucratic red tape, rendered the event impossible at the time. But the incident stuck with me nonetheless as an example of the political undercurrent flowing through the sport. That memory became especially relevant as Donald Trumpannounced plansto host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at the White House to commemorate the nation’s 250th birthday next year.Speaking to a crowd of supporters during a Salute to America event in Iowa Thursday, Trump said: “Does anybody watchUFC? The great Dana White? We’re going to have a UFC fight. We’re going to have a UFC fight – think of this – on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the news during the press briefing, adding that the president was “dead serious” about hosting a UFC event at the official residence and workplace of the president.The announcement comes as no surprise given Trump’s longstanding relationship with the UFC, its current owner Ari Emanuel and its CEO Dana White.Over the past few years, Trumphas frequently attended UFC events, basking in the admiration of the young, predominantly male crowd. He has cultivated relationships with fighters, leveraging their support to portray himself as a symbolic strongman. He has embraced the UFC’s culture of defiance, machismo and spectacle to help buttress his image as a rebel against liberal norms. It has also hastened the replacement of America’s conventional political culture with an abrasive new blend of entertainment and confrontational politics, perfectly embodied by both Trump and White.The UFC CEO stumped for Trump at three Republican national conventions and a slew of campaign rallies over the past eight years. He traveled with the president on Air Force One and produced a propaganda documentary on Trump entitled Combatant-in-Chief. And when Trump won the 2024 presidential election, it was White who took the stage at his victory party – because, naturally, Trump needed his fight promoter to seal the deal.For the UFC, its association with Trump has granted the once-renegade promotion a new kind of political legitimacy and influence. It also set it apart from other sports leagues through its unapologetically conservative posture. The UFC is evensponsoring the United States semiquincentennial, dubbed America250, joining the likes of Amazon, the Coca-Cola Company, Oracle and Walmart.Since taking office in January, Trump has attended two UFC events. He most recently attended UFC 316 in June just hours after signing a memo ordering the deployment of 2,000 national guard troops to Los Angeles county after Ice immigration raids sparked mass protests. He nevertheless enjoyed a standing ovation from the fans in attendance, and glowing endorsements from the fighters, one of whom even kneeled before Trump. UFC champion Kayla Harrison embraced him, planted a kiss on his cheek and wrapped her championship belt around his waist as his family and supporters looked on in delight. It was a spectacle befitting the strongman Trump imagines himself to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the natural climax of a partnership in which the UFC has become the stage for Maga mythology. It carries shades of fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, particularly its obsession with masculinity, spectacle and nationalism – but with a modern, American twist.View image in fullscreenWhen Trump won the 2024 presidential election, UFC CEO Dana White took the stage at his victory party in West Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesFascist Italy used rallies, parades and sports events to project strength and unity. Sports, especially combat sports, were used as tools to cultivate Mussolini’s ideal masculinity and portray Italy as a strong and powerful nation. Similarly, Trump has relied on the UFC to project his tough-guy image, and to celebrate his brand of nationalistic masculinity. From name-dropping champions who endorse him to suggesting a tournament that wouldpit UFC fighters against illegal immigrants, Trump has repeatedly found ways to make UFC-style machismo a part of his political brand.Since Trump returned to office in January, his presidency has been marked by a purge of federal agencies, crackdowns on dissent and immigration, and hollowing out institutions once designed as guardrails against abuses in presidential power. Loyalty to Trump, rather than the constitution and the American people, has become the primary litmus test for political advancement. Meanwhile,sports have emerged as a central feature of his administration, advancing his policies while projecting a cult of personality and the celebration of violence. All of these are the hallmarks of authoritarianism.There was once a time when the US could point to the authoritarian pageantry of regimes like Mussolini’s Italy and claim at leastsomemoral distance. That line is no longer visible. What was once soft power borrowed from strongmen is now being proudly performed on America’s own front lawn.Karim Zidan writes aregular newsletteron the intersection of sports and authoritarian politics.Explore more on these topicsUFCDonald TrumpMMAUS sportsVladimir PutinUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

You are! And parents and guardians have got to step up.”Police said one minor had died at a hospital after the shooting.Mass shootings – defined as cases where four or more shooting victims are injured or killed – were reported in other cities, including Philadelphia andChicagoand Brockton, Massachusetts, where six people were hospitalized following an early morning fight Saturday.Violence and shootings often surge in the summer months, especially around the Fourth of July, historically one of the deadliest days of the year in the US.The shooting in Chicago, which left seven people in serious or critical condition, came on the heels of another mass shooting that happened late Wednesday in that city in a busy neighborhood known for its restaurants and nightlife. Four people were killed and 14 others injured.Four dead and 14 injured in shooting at Chicago party for rapper Mello BuckzzRead moreAs of Saturday, there had been more than 205 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the nonpartisanGun Violence Archive. Perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many to call for more meaningful gun control, though Congress has largely left such pleas unheeded over the years.In the New York City borough of Queens, police said one person was dead and three injured in a triple stabbing following fireworks celebrating the 249th anniversary of the US’s declaration of independence from the UK.Meanwhile, a Wareham, Massachusetts, man is dead after being hit by a firework. Police said they found 70-year-old Robert Spagnuolo with a “facial injury”. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Officials inGeorgiareported two boat explosions Friday on lakes.

Authorities had previously accused him and other suspects of being near the Bogotá park whereMiguel Uribe Turbay was shoton 7 June.Uribe was giving a political speech in the park when he was attacked from behind and wounded in the head, allegedly by a minor who was captured as he fled. Three other people have been arrested for participating in the logistics and execution of the crime. The motive is still being investigated.View image in fullscreenElder José Arteaga Hernandez (alias El Costeño) on Saturday after his arrest in Bogotá.Photograph: Colombian Police/AFP/Getty ImagesUribe, who in October announced his intention to run in the 2026 presidential election, remains in intensive care and has undergone several surgeries. From his senate seat, he had become one of president Gustavo Petro’s most vocal critics.The attack has been widely condemned in a country with a dark past in which drug cartels and insurgent groups murdered and kidnapped politicians.Charges against Arteaga include attempted aggravated homicide; manufacturing, trafficking and carrying firearms or ammunition; and using minors to commit crimes. Interpol issued a red notice against him on Friday.It was not immediately clear if Arteaga had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. Authorities said he would make his first court appearance over the weekend.Triana last month said Arteaga “has been involved in a life of crime for more than 20 years, performing hit jobs in all types of crimes in Bogotá”.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It means that, from Saturday, being a member of, or expressing support for, the organisation became a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison.The campaign group Defend Our Juries, which organised the demonstration, said “a priest, an emeritus professor and a number of health professionals” were among those arrested.More than two dozen people gathered close to the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament Square, holding signs that appeared to express support for the group.At about 1.40pm, Metropolitan police officers began arresting people who were holding the signs.In a statement on X, the Met said: “Officers have arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act 2000. They have been taken into custody. Palestine Action is a proscribed group and officers will act where criminal offences are committed.”The force posted another update on X on Saturday evening to say 29 arrests had been made and added that those arrested remain in custody.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: “We commend the counter-terrorism police for their decisive action in protecting the people of London from some cardboard signs opposing the genocide in Gaza and expressing support for those taking action to prevent it. It’s a relief to know that counter-terrorism police have nothing better to do.”On Friday, the group wrote to the Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, to give him advance warning of the demonstration.Before officers made arrests, the Guardian spoke to some of the demonstrators.Tim Crosland, of Defend Our Juries, said: “What we’re doing here as a group of priests, teachers, health workers, human rights lawyers [is] we’re refusing to be silenced. Because it goes to the core of what we believe in: that we oppose genocide – I didn’t think that was that controversial – and we support the people who resist genocide.“In theory we are now terrorist supporters and can go to prison for 14 years, which is kind of crazy. I think what we are here to do is just expose the craziness of that.”An environmental campaigner, Donnachadh McCarthy, said: “To proscribe an organisation of peaceful direct action as terrorists is a huge red line for our democracy. It means that all the rest of us, whether we’re climate activists, Greenpeace, women’s suffragettes, disabled activists, it means that the government can now declare any act of property damage to be terrorism, which gives you a sentence of 14 years.“This is worse than Putin’s Russia. I don’t say that lightly. It’s 10 years for doing what we’re doing today in Russia; it’s 14 years in the UK, because of Yvette Cooper’s outrageous betrayal of democracy, liberalism, and what is in my view a step towards fascism.”A retired priest, Sue Parfitt, 83, said the group’s ban was “a very dangerous move that has to be challenged”.“We are losing our civil liberties, we must stop that for everybody’s sake. Whatever you want to protest about,” she said.View image in fullscreenSue Parfitt being led away by police.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PACooper, the home secretary, announced plans to ban Palestine Action late last month, days after activists from the groupbroke into RAF Brize Nortonand defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.MPs voted in favour of proscribing the group on Wednesday. The House of Lords backed the move without a vote on Thursday.UN experts, civil liberties groups,cultural figuresandhundreds of lawyershave condemned the ban as draconian and said it sets a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.The ban means Palestine Action has become the first direct action protest group to be banned under the Terrorism Act, placing it in the same category as Islamic State, al-Qaida and the far-right group National Action.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He hasn’t disappointed me in how disappointing he’s been,” he said.Cooganspoke to the Guardian ahead of an address to the annual Co-op Congress in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, where he called for locally led grassroots movements to assemble across Britain and take back control from “multinational institutions and billionaires”.The Bafta-winning actor, best known for his Alan Partridge persona, has backedLabourin several recent general elections but switched his support last year to the Green party.Coogan, 59, said he “agreed wholeheartedly” with the statement released by former Labour MP Zarah Sultana on Thursday night, when she announced she was quitting the party toco-lead a left-wing alternativewith Jeremy Corbyn.SultanasaidBritain’s two-party system “offers nothing but managed decline and broken promises” and that Labour had “completely failed to improve people’s lives”.Coogan said: “Everything she said in her statement I agree wholeheartedly. I wish I’d said it myself.” However, he added that he was “reserving judgment” as to whether to support the new party at future elections if they field candidates.The Philomena star said he did not blame working people for voting for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.“The success of Reform, I lay squarely at the feet of the neoliberal consensus, which has let down working people for the last 40 years and they’re fed up,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who they vote for, nothing changes for them.“Keir Starmer and the Labour government have leant into supporting a broken system. Their modus operandi is to mitigate the worst excesses of a broken system and all that is is managed decline. What they’re doing is putting Band-Aids on the gash in the side of the Titanic.”In his most strongly worded attack on Labour yet, Coogan described the party’s priorities in the last year as “a derogation of all the principles they were supposed to represent”.“We have a Labour government and it’s no different from a Conservative government in neglecting ordinary people,” he added.“I think Labour governs for people inside the M25–that’s who they’re preoccupied with, and gesture politics. Every decision that comes from central government these days to me looks political and strategic and nothing to do with sincerity or any kind of firmly held ideological belief.”Without meaningful action to improve the lives of ordinary people, Coogan said, both Labour and the Conservatives would face electoral oblivion.“They’ll pave the way for the only alternative, which is a racist clown. Reform couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery but if there’s no alternative you understand why working people will make that choice,” he said.View image in fullscreenSteve Coogan at Rochdale’s Grade I-listed town hallPhotograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianCoogan spoke in Rochdale’s Grade I-listed town hall, which this weekend is hosting a congress of co-operative movements from across the world to mark this year’s UN-designated International Year of Co-operatives.The actor is a supporter of Middleton Co-operating, acommunity-led initiativebased in his home town, just outside Manchester, which aims to provide locally run energy, banking, social care, housing and other schemes.He said the government’s focus on attracting investment to major cities had created a “doughnut of neglect” with poorer communities “ethnically cleansed”.“You look at Manchester, you look at Liverpool, and you go: ‘Wow, look at these shiny new buildings’ and everything looks clean, there’s no crisp bags flying about in the street,” he said.“The disenfranchised people who lived there before are not there any more. They’ve been ethnically cleansed. They’ve been booted out to the next poor area. So who’s benefiting?”Coogan urged Labour to breathe life back into towns by empowering grassroots groups to take over neglected buildings, using compulsory purchase orders for example.“It’s not just the fact that people are disempowered and feel like they have no autonomy. It’s compounded by the fact that these people, these multinationals, are enabled and supported by the government to keep their foot on the neck of working people,” he said.It was “perfectly understandable” for working people to vote for Farage’s Reform in large parts of England, where many voters feel disenfranchised, Coogan said.“But if any government wants to address that extremism, what they have to do is tackle the root cause,” he added.“The root cause is poverty and economic decline in the post-industrial landscape, especially in the north. If Labour addressed that problem, Reform would go away – all their support would dissipate.”Explore more on these topicsSteve CooganLabourKeir StarmerReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Boam has reportedly dismissed the allegation as “fake news”.News of their appointments follow that ofGeorge Finch, 18, who has become the interim leaderof the neighbouring Warwickshire county council a year after completing his A-levels.View image in fullscreenReform UK’s George Finch, 18, interim leader of Warwickshire county council, with party leader, Nigel Farage.Photograph: Unpixs/XTheir relative lack of experience has caused unease across the political divide. Deborah Taylor, a Conservative councillor and leader of the opposition who was the previous cabinet member for children and families in Leicestershire, questioned their qualifications to hold roles overseeing services that account for more than70% of the council’s £616m budget.“I am a huge champion of young people and young councillors but what really concerns me is that new young councillors should be nurtured rather than being thrown in at the deep end to what can be a quite full-on role where there is exposure to some real trauma and difficult decisions,” she said.“Rather than age, it’s about political and life experience, whether that’s as someone who has worked or even as a parent with knowledge of household pressures.”The concerns were echoed by social workers at the council.“There is some confidence that much of what is being delivered can’t be changed because it is statutory and underpinned by legislation. But there are areas where resources are being allocated on a ‘spend to save’ basis, such as early interventions for families who may, for example, have had multiple removals of children,” said one.“It’s an area where that spending has really paid off and there would be great concern about that being tinkered with or even cut.”Julia Ross, the chair of the British Association of Social Workers, said: “Lead members for children’s and adults’ social services in local authorities are very important roles that carry the responsibility of handling hundreds of millions of pounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I say that’s exactly what this role needs. I understand the challenges young people face today because I’ve been there. Now I’m making sure young voices are heard,” Pugsleytweeted.But this was questioned. Naomi Bottomley, a Green councillor, said: “I know that Charles Pugsley has alluded to the idea that he knows more about what children need because he is young. But he also went to a private school and is a landlord, so I’m not sure he has quite the same experience as many vulnerable young people.”Pugsley, a computer science student at Nottingham University, is registered at Companies House as a director of two companies that list their business as the letting or operating of real estate.He and Boam, along with Finch in Warwickshire, also reflect a drive by Farage to leverage support among gen Z voters, with the party’s popularitysurging among 18- to 24-year-old men.Preet Gill, a Birmingham Labour MP who has voiced concern about Finch’s role as leader atWarwickshire, said the appointments indicated how Reform would approach government.“It’s a carbon copy of the way in which Farage operates. They have made a lot of noise from performance politics and from being disruptive, rather than actually saying or doing anything of substance when it comes to delivery, or knowing how to deliver adult social care or children’s services.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKLeicestershireWarwickshireNigel FarageLocal governmentLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If he starts the day any later, or without the shower, he’ll be “tired, depressed, and sweaty” all day. With a 12-hour shift of taxi driving ahead of him, he wanted to get on the road quickly.The temperature was already above 20C, and by the end of the day, Turkish firefighters across the country would have fought back multiple wildfires.View image in fullscreenA man sprays water from a tanker to extinguish burning olive trees in İzmir, Turkey.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesYıldırım is lucky – his car has functioning air conditioning, and many of his customers expect he’ll use it. But he knows from previous summers that weeks of extreme temperature changes throughout the day can make him sick.ItalyLorenzo TondoMap of European countries showing temperature of 34C in Sutera at 12pmIn the searing heart of inland Sicily, Luigi Randazzo, 47, a sous-chef at a restaurant was plating a dish of mussels.“I was working next to the kettle, where the thermometer read 60 degrees,” he said. “The fryer was on. So was the oven. It felt like working inside a volcano.”People cool off by washing themselves with water from a fountain in Rome, Italy.People cool off in a fountain in Rome, Italy.While diners waited in the cool comfort of air conditioning, Randazzo moved from burner to burner in the kitchen, clad in a chef’s uniform soaked with sweat. “It felt like someone had thrown a bucket of water in my face,” he said. “We have an air conditioner in the kitchen, but it’s completely useless when all the machines are running.”In 2021, temperatures in Sicily hit a record 48.8C (119.8F). Randazzo works in the part of the island where the desert is slowly advancing across the countryside, and where, in the last six months of 2023, just 150mm of rain fell.View image in fullscreenSous-chef Luigi Randazzo at work at a restaurant in Sutera, Sicily.Photograph: Lorenzo Tondo/The GuardianOn Tuesday, Randazzo said he was dreaming of going home and taking an ice-cold shower. But the lunch service had just begun.‘‘My legs were trembling with exhaustion. But you know at that moment you can’t stop – not even for a second,” he added. “That hour felt like an entire summer.”The NetherlandsSenay BoztasMap of European countries showing temperature of 32C in Amsterdam at 1.30pmIt was early afternoon in Amsterdam, and Karim Taif, 46, tried to escape the heat at a shelter for homeless people in the city.“It’s cool here and a good place,” said Taif. The well-known shelter, calledDe Kloof, is in the basement of a historic canal house and is openuntil 6pmto offer shade, showers, refreshments and sunscreen to the homeless community.View image in fullscreenConstruction workers repair railways for tramways as the Netherlands faces temperatures reaching 37C.Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesFor the first time, the city now has a “summer heat ruling” extending the opening hours of shelters.Taif, who was born in Morocco, grew up in Amsterdam and once worked as a barman in Switzerland. But he struggled to find housing in the Netherlands after returning in 2021 and in October, he said, he crept into a boat tied to a dock. He was found by the owner, but they agreed to let him stay.“In the winter, it is very cold and in the summer it is so hot, you have to get out of it very early,” said Taif.“Everything is getting hotter and hotter,” said Taif, smoking a cigarette in the garden of the shelter. “The south of Europe is drying up … and it feels like the Sahara is moving ever closer.”GermanyAjit NiranjanMap of European countries showing temperature of 33C in Berlin at 3pmSven, 58, had felt the heat creep up over the last two weeks as he rewired a telecommunications box. By Tuesday afternoon, it had hit 33C, and would rise to a sweltering 37C the following day.“I’ve set this up to meet my needs,” he said from under a bright green umbrella. “I’ve got a coolbox, I avoid working under the blazing sun, and I put a cap on when it hits. Otherwise, it’s a case of not moving too fast.”View image in fullscreenSven, 58, rewires a telecommunications box on a street in Berlin.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The GuardianGerman employees do not have a legal right to take time off work in the heat but bosses have a duty of care to their workers.

A steam bath. St Quentin is basically a greenhouse and there’s no way of ventilating or cooling it down. It was 42C in here by mid-afternoon. People really suffered. Stallholders who live nearby were going home for cold showers.”Cheese and heat do not mix; textures and flavours change irreversibly. Baadache did what she could to save her 150-odd varieties, bringing out only a small fraction of her stock and covering up her two refrigerated display cabinets to keep the cold in.Haze radiates from Paris landmarks during a heatwave in the city.Haze radiates from Paris landmarks during a heatwave in the city.“They survived, just,” she said. “But I was a wreck – sweating about my cheeses, and sat behind two fridge motors generating even more heat.”And, of course, there were no customers: “No one came.

Every now and then, he was successful, with a trickle of tourists darting towards him just long enough to snap a photo.As temperatures climbed this week, he had done what he could to mitigate the heat, shifting his start time to early evening in the hope that the one- or two-degree drop in temperatures would offer some respite. A quick cold shower, before and after his shift, had also become a necessity. “I play football, so that helps my body deal with the heat of the summer,” he said. “But a job’s a job – I have no other choice.”Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherClimate crisisTurkeyFranceSpainGermanyItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What went wrong?Sandra LavilleSat 5 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareLorries thunder over the A14 bridge north of Cambridge, above steep roadside embankments covered in plastic shrouds containing the desiccated remains of trees.Occasionally the barren landscape is punctuated by a flash of green where a young hawthorn or a fledgling honeysuckle has emerged apparently against the odds, but their shock of life is an exception in the treeless landscape.The new 21-mile road between Cambridge and Huntingdon cost £1.5bn and was opened in 2020 to fulfil a familiar political desire: growth. One of Britain’s biggest infrastructure projects of the past decade, it was approved by the secretary of state for transport over the heads of locally elected councillors.MapNational Highways, the government-owned company that builds and maintains Britain’s A roads, promisedthat the biodiversity net gain from the construction project would be 11.5%; in other words, they pledged the natural environment would be left in a considerably better state after the road was built than before.But five years on from the opening of the A14, the evidence is otherwise, and National Highways has admitted biodiversity and the environment have been left in a worse state as a result of the road project.Empty plastic tree guards stretch for mile after mile along the new road, testament to the mass die-off of most of the 860,000 trees planted in mitigation for the impact of the road. Culverts dug as a safe route for animals such as newts and water voles are dried up and litter-strewn, while ponds designed to collect rainwater and provide a wildlife habitat are choked with mud and silt.With concerns thatthe rollback of environmental protectionsin Labour’s planning and infrastructure bill will make it easier for developers to destroy nature, Edna Murphy, a Liberal Democrat on Cambridgeshire county council, is calling for MPs on the environmental audit committee to investigate the multimillion-pound failure of the A14 project.“National Highways has resisted attempts by local representatives to discover what it is up to,” Murphy said.“We have struggled over years to find out basic facts about the death of nearly all of the 860,000 trees that were originally planted and what has happened subsequently in terms of replanting.“How can they be allowed to get away with this? How can anyone have confidence in promises about environmental mitigations in any national infrastructure projects in the future?”View image in fullscreenEdna Murphy (left) and Ros Hathorn beside the A14.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianMurphy and her Lib Dem colleague Ros Hathorn believe the failure of the environmental improvements created in mitigation for the A14 are a shocking example of how powerful developers make environmental pledges in order to gain planning permission, which are then not upheld.They began asking questions of National Highways in 2021 when it became obvious from the scale of the tree die-off that something had gone wrong. They asked for details of how many trees were planted, how many had died, and for regular reports on the tree planting.A slide presentation in 2022 to Murphy and Hathorn indicated 70% of the 860,000 trees originally planted had died.In late 2023, Martin Edwards, a National Highways project manager,suggested to local councillorsthe die-off may have been only 50%. He said two re-plantings had taken place since the die-off, both of which had also subsequently failed. He blamed this on the policy to replant the same tree in the same place “and keep your fingers crossed”.Edwards insisted that lessons had been learned and that in 2023 National Highways had carried out a full soil survey and a three-month tree analysis.This revealed they had planted the wrong species in the wrong place, and provided valuable lessons about the most appropriate season in the year to plant a tree, he said.Nicole Gullan, principal ecologist at the ecology consultancy Arbtech, said she was surprised by the approach: “Tree planting on this scale should have been underpinned by ecological due diligence, including soil sampling, hydrological and geotechnical surveys, and an adaptive management plan to address potential failures. Proper reporting and mapping of planting locations is also essential for long-term monitoring and accountability.”A third replanting of 165,000 trees – at an estimated cost of £2.9m – took place over the autumn and winter of 2023-2024. National Highways promised to share details of their surveys and a new planting plan with Cambridgeshire council’s biodiversity team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Vhari Russell from Brampton said she had grown various different trees in her garden in pots and planted all of those into the A14 embankment. “I think we’ve probably put in 150,” she told local reporters.National Highways, which has been reprimanded by the office of roads and railways for failing to fulfil a key metric on biodiversity gain, has admitted that the A14 project has left nature worse off despite having pledged to improve it.In anevaluation reportNational Highways said the impacts on biodiversity “were worse than expected”, as were the impacts onthe water environment. National Highways has faced no sanction for these failures.From 2026, biodiversity net gain will be mandatory for big infrastructure such as the A14 road. But Becky Pullinger, head of land management for the Wildlife Trusts, said developers had to be held to account once the mandate came in, so that recreated habitats had a fighting chance of survival. A recent report showedthat only a thirdof ecological enhancements promised by housebuilders were fulfilled.Pullinger said the example of the A14 showed how important it was that harm to wildlife was avoided in the first place, reducing the need for compensation planting.“The failures highlight the challenges of trying to recreate mature habitats: it takes years, if not decades, for saplings to turn into woodland and provide much needed spaces for the wildlife [affected] by development,” she said.A National Highways spokesperson said: “We take our responsibility to the environment very seriously. The A14 upgrade project was not limited to just improving the road; our ongoing environmental work remains a long-term project that we will continue to monitor and support. Between October 2023 and April 2024 – the optimum planting season – 165,000 trees and shrubs were planted. These comprised 16 different species specially selected to enhance the surrounding areas and habitats. Our latest survey showed that nearly 90% of these trees have survived. Nationally, we continue to monitor, evaluate and adapt our practices to respond to a rapidly changing climate to meet the challenges that it brings.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentBiodiversityTrees and forestsConservationWildlifeInfrastructureRoad transportnewsShareReuse this content"

A similar push is ongoing in Europe.Last week the Center for a Humane Economy, which runs the Kangaroos Are Not Shoes campaign, announced British sportswear brand Umbro was the latest to join the likes of Nike, Adidas, Puma and Asics in phasing out the use of so-called “k-leather” that has most often been used in some of their brand’s football boots.But the success of the campaigns, and the ongoing criticism of Australia’s regulated kangaroo harvests, hides a complex story and one which, Prof Chris Johnson says, is “infuriating” for many Australian conservationists and ecologists.“The public advocacy by opponents has been very effective, but unfortunately it’s all wrong, is conceptually muddled and it’s not based on knowledge or experience,” says Johnson, a kangaroo expert and professor of wildlife conservation at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage.View image in fullscreenA US ban would be harmful to kangaroo populations, Nationals leader David Littleproud says.Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Nationals leader and shadow agriculture minister, David Littleproud, accused the governing Labor party of failing to “dispel misconceptions around the use and overseas imports of kangaroo products”.“This has allowed animal activists to spread false information that kangaroos are being killed solely for [soccer] cleats.“It’s important to note that without a commercial industry, conservation culling is still needed to occur to manage populations.“We know kangaroos can breed easily and are not a threatened species. The practical reality of import bans in the US would be detrimental to kangaroo populations in Australia.”The government did not answer questions sent to the agriculture minister, Julie Collins.The kangaroo ‘harvest’Since European colonisation, farmers have grown pasture for livestock and added watering holes across Australia’s landscape, both of which help kangaroos to survive and, in times of good rainfall, flourish.Governments havebacked controls and cullsof the kangaroo’s natural predator – the dingo.Johnson says grazing from abundant kangaroos can take away areas that other native animals such as bandicoots and dunnarts use to hide from introduced predators like cats and foxes.How kangaroos could be jeopardising conservation efforts across AustraliaRead more“Overgrazing can be a serious ecological threat,” he says.“The harvest protects other native species because it protects vegetation. If the kangaroo program fails, that would be a contributor to increased extinction threat.”Regulated commercial kangaroo harvesting takes place every year in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.Since 2010,data collated by the Australian government showsthat between 1.1 million and 1.7 million kangaroos have been killed annually under the commercial harvest.Harvest quotas are set at about 15% of the estimated kangaroo population, but the data suggests less than a third of the quota is used up each year.Barbaric or humane?Kangaroo harvesting takes place at night, and anational code of practicesays the animals should be killed by a bullet to the head.Ben Pearson, Australia and New Zealand country director for World Animal Protection, says this method of killing, coupled with a lack of oversight of both commercial and non-commercial kangaroo culling, which is also done under licence, is a concern.“In other animal farming industries there is a requirement for humane slaughter which includes stunning before slaughter,” he says.“With wild harvesting, kangaroos are shot outright and evidence suggests that many are not killed instantaneously, instead being merely wounded and thus suffering from gunshot wounds. Kangaroos that are wounded but escape could suffer over a prolonged period.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is that we are exemplary,” he claims.“Over 6 million native deer are killed in the USA every year. Over-abundant herbivores need management. The code of practice for shooting kangaroos requires a shot to the brain. Virtually all deer shot in the USA are shot in the chest.“The reason campaigners can quote how many kangaroos are killed is because we actually publish that information,” he said.Boom, bust and starvationKangaroo numbers are known to boom in times of good rainfall and then crash during droughts – swings that mirror Australia’s variable climate.Between 2010 and 2023, official estimates of kangaroo numbers across four states show numbers fell as low as 25 million in 2010 and went as high as 53 million in 2013.Latest figures estimate a kangaroo population of 34 million.“We either choose to sustainably harvest these kangaroo populations or we will see kangaroos starve in their many thousands during droughts, and habitats will be overgrazed and degraded,” says Prof Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University. “It’s a choice.”As uncomfortable as the thought may be for many, Johnson says that in lean times, many kangaroo deaths may not be as short and sharp as one from a harvester’s gun.“The natural alternatives are being killed by a dingo or dying by starvation,” he says.“There’s less suffering entailed by the harvest than by either of those alternatives.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The doctor has already run out of specialised formula meant for premature babies and is forced to use regular formula, rationing it between the infants under his care.“I can’t begin to describe how bad things are. Right now, we have enough formula for about one week. But we also have infants outside the hospital without any access to milk. It’s catastrophic,” al-Farra told the Guardian over the phone.Stocks of infant formula have dwindled inGazaas Israel has blocked all but a trickle of aid into the Palestinian territory. Food aid that comes through the controversial US-Israeli-backed private company Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) does not include infant formula, according to doctors.Hanaa al-Taweel, a 27-year-old mother of five living at al-Nuseirat refugee camp, said she was unable to breastfeed as she herself was not getting enough to eat. She has struggled to find infant formula for her 13-month-old child.“The problem of getting milk started since my son’s birth, as due to my malnutrition and general weakness I wasn’t able to breastfeed my baby,” al-Taweel said.View image in fullscreenTwenty-two-month-old Sham Qadeh struggling to survive with her mother in Khan Younis.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDoctors have told her that her son is suffering from stunting due to malnutrition and she has noticed he was developing slower than her other children, who had already begun speaking and walking at his age.“I try to keep a small piece of bread next to me when he sleeps because he wakes up often asking for food. I feel sadness and fear for my children, I fear they will die from hunger, thirst and disease,” she said.Already 66 Palestinian children have starved to death since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, according to local health authorities.Amnesty International accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza, which it said was a tactic intended “to inflict genocide against Palestinians”.Cogat, the Israeli authority responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, said it does not restrict the entry of baby food, including formula, into the Gaza Strip. The agency added that more than 1,400 tons of baby food had been delivered to Gaza in recent weeks.Doctors entering Gaza have resorted to packing individual cans of infant formula in their personal luggage. On at least one occasion, Israeli authorities confiscated 10 cans of infant formula from the luggage of an American doctor recently entering Gaza for a medical mission.“In the end they confiscated all the cans of baby formula, which was specifically formula for pre-term babies. What on earth is baby formula going to do against the security of the state of Israel?” said Dr Diana Nazzal, a Palestinian-German eye surgeon who helped the American doctor pack his bags in a way that would be acceptable to Israeli border authorities.Nazzal added that many medical staff entering Gaza are filling their bags with calorie-dense foods such as protein bars and nuts, rather than medical supplies.Infant formula has become more critical as the hunger crisis has worsened in Gaza, with almost 500,000 people facing catastrophic hunger while the rest of the population is experiencing acute food insecurity.View image in fullscreenAmnesty International has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMothers who are severely malnourished themselves or have been killed are unable to breastfeed, creating a higher need for formula. On the parallel market, what little supply exists has become exorbitantly expensive, with one can of formula going for about $50 – 10 times the normal price.“I was able to breastfeed her naturally for one month, but due to lack of food I could no longer continue,” said Nourhan Barakat, a 25-year-old mother of three displaced to Khan Younis. “I know that breastfeeding strengthens the bond between mother and child – but what can I do?”In late June, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said about 112 children were being admitted daily to Gaza’s hospitals for malnutrition treatment. Malnutrition before the age of three can cause permanent developmental problems.“This whole generation is being targeted. They will suffer from memory problems, developmental delays … And the problem is even if nutrition becomes available later on, the damage is permanent,” al-Faraa said.Doctors said the deaths of infants was a worrying sign of Gaza’s looming starvation crisis, as young children are the most vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition.“When you see babies start to die, panic and alarms should start to flare. Essentially, children are the first to die in starvation crises,” said Dr Thaer Ahmad, a member of a medical delegation trying to deliver aid through the international group Avaaz.Doctors have blamed the Israeli aid blockade for the shortage, as Israel prevents all but a few aid trucks entering the territory – far below what humanitarians say is required to feed the population. UN agencies say Gaza needs at least 500 trucks a day to meet basic needs, but often less than 50 are admitted.What UN aid does come through is often confiscated by hungry crowds and armed gangs who have begun looting trucks out of desperation.If Palestinians want to access aid given by GHF, they have to navigate a complicated, ever-changing set of instructions to queue at one of four distribution sites. More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces while queueing for aid over the last month.Humanitarian groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates the core principles of humanitarianism. Previously, the UN-led aid system in Gaza maintained more than 400 aid distribution points throughout Gaza set up at points of need. The GHF said it had delivered more than 52m meals in five weeks and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.Israel has said the UN system was being exploited by Hamas to hoard aid, an accusation for which humanitarians say there is no evidence.The war in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people since 7 October 2023, and was launched in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack on the same day that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Israel and Hamas have signalled in recent days that they are nearing a US-brokered ceasefire, though key sticking points remain.In the meantime, doctors in the territory say time is running out. “You should see the children arriving,” said al-Farra. “They’re just skin and bones. It’s horrifying. The real solution is to end the war, open the crossings and allow baby formula in.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelChildrenAidnewsShareReuse this content"

In a potential breakthrough for preventive health, researchers have found that owning a four-pawed friend is linked to slower cognitive decline by potentially preserving specific brain functions as we grow older.Interestingly, the associations differ depending on the animal: dog owners were found to retain sharper memory, both immediate and delayed, while cat owners showed slower decline in verbal fluency.When it comes to slower cognitive decline in their owners, however, it seems that not all pets are created equal: fish and birds, while charming companions, showed no significant link.“Pet ownership has been linked to a positive influence on cognitive functioning and cognitive decline in late adulthood,” said Adriana Rostekova, a researcher and lead author of the article, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports. “However, there is limited understanding of how different species of pets are associated with these outcomes.”Rostekova, who works at the lifespan developmental psychology research group at theUniversity of Geneva, used data from eight waves of the Survey ofHealthand Retirement in Europe to examine the relationship between pet ownership and cognitive decline over an 18-year period among adults aged 50 and older.She specifically looked at the distinct role of owning dogs, cats, birds and fish. “The key novelty of our study was that we found notable differences between the species,” she said.Rostekova hypothesised that because keeping fish or birds showed no meaningful link to changes in cognitive decline, the overall pattern of pet ownership may be driven primarily by having a cat or dog rather than pet ownership in general.“Several explanations may help explain the absence of this association in fish and bird owners, despite the reports of their ownership’ positive influence on wellbeing in ways that are usually associated with cognitive benefits,” she added.“A fish or bird’s short lifespan may potentially limit the level of emotional connection one is able to develop with the pet fish,” she said. “Bird ownership may negatively affect the owner’s sleep quality due to the increased noise levels, which has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline.”Rostekova added: “[It is] further possible that interaction with dogs and cats provides unique cognitive stimulation, which may be less pronounced in other, less demanding pets.”Other research has foundevidenceof an increase in prefrontal brain activation and stronger attentional processes and emotional arousal caused by interaction with a dog.There is furtherevidenceof increased activation of the prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus when interacting with cats, which is speculated to be linked to the characteristic, hard-to-predict temperament of the animal.“There is also a possibility of increased social stimulation facilitated by cats and dogs, which may be linked to the slower cognitive decline experienced by their owners: an increased frequency of social interactions when accompanied by a dog – or for cats, a substitute for a social network,” said Rostekova.As the NHS grapples with an ageing population and rising dementia rates, experts say the findings could reshape how we think about healthy ageing – and the animals we choose to age alongside.Andrew Scott, the author of The Longevity Imperative and a cat owner (although also a dog lover), said: “We tend to think of health as being about disease and hospitals but as we live longer and need to focus on preventive measures that keep us healthy for longer, we will discover that the health system extends well beyond doctors and hospitals.“It is about how we live our life. What is nice about this study is it suggests a fun and meaningful way of keeping healthy and engaged. A lot of things we are recommended to do for our health aren’t always fun or companionable (does anyone fast as a family?). Having a pet can be fun and if it keeps you healthy that’s a great bonus.”Explore more on these topicsAgeingDementiaPetsMedical researchMental healthHealthDogsnewsShareReuse this content"

No official reason has been given for sending the premier, Li Qiang, other than scheduling conflicts.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is facing an international criminal court arrest warrant and may have decided not to travel to Rio to avoid embarrassing the summit hosts, who are signatories to the ICC statute.Mongolia has been in an acrimonious legal dispute with the ICC after it did not act on the warrant when Putin visited last year.Putin abandoned his plans to attend the 2023 Brics summit inSouth Africaafter the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was unable to offer any guarantees regarding Putin’s arrest or otherwise under the warrant.Putin is accused by the ICC of being instrumental in abducting and deporting tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.Brics, often described as the developing world’s alternative to the G7 group of nations, has undergone arecent rapid expansion, but in the process has diluted its coherence as a body offering an ideological alternative to the western capitalism represented by the G7.View image in fullscreenFrom left, the leaders of Brazil, China, South Africa and India with Russia’s foreign minister at the 2023 Brics summit in South Africa.Photograph: ReutersIts founding members were Brazil, Russia,India, China and South Africa, but the group last year expanded to include Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, countries in various stages of economic development and with varying levels of antagonism towards the west. The additions skewed the body towards autocracies, leaving Brazil, South Africa and India uneasy.Brazil has said theBricsgrouping is just one sign of an emerging new world order. Speaking recently at the Overseas Development Institute, the former Brazilian foreign minister and current ambassador to London, Antonio Patriota, said Donald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy would move the world order away from the US as a superpower and towards a multipolar world with power spread more evenly.“The US, through its policies, including on tariffs and sovereignty, is accelerating the transition to multipolarity in different ways,” Patriota said.He added that new alliances were likely to develop that would challenge the current distribution of power.“It’s difficult to argue today that Europe converges with the US policy on trade or on security or on sustaining democracy, for example. So where there used to be one unique western pole, now perhaps there are two.”View image in fullscreenWelcome banners for the Brics summit in Brazil. The host country may benefit from the absence of the Russian and Chinese leaders, as it wants to champion a theme of inclusive global governance reform.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockBrazil, an emerging diplomatic powerhouse in the global south, may benefit from Russia and China’s leaders being absent this weekend, since it wants to use the summit to champion a theme of inclusive global governance reform. It would not want the focus to be solely on criticism of western double standards in the Middle East and Ukraine.The hosts have a set of concrete proposals: the green energy transition, cooperation on vaccines and expanding most-favoured nation status to all countries in the World Trade Organization.Patriota denied that new multipolarity – a world in which many different cooperative alliances are formed – was inherently unstable, arguing it was unilateralism that had been the more disruptive force.“There is strong support for preserving multilateralism, but that does not mean that we need to preserve it as it stands,” he said. “Brazil is arguing we shouldn’t wait for another world war, or for something of that nature, or scale, to start reforming. Unless there is a strong movement towards reform now, we run the risk of reaching a tipping point.”But Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, has argued Brazil will struggle to impose an agenda on the Brics. “Brics was an unwieldy group before it opened its membership – even if the stated goals of the emerging-economy alliance were initially laudable and long-overdue,” he wrote recently.“While UN security council expansion was once a stated goal, China was always likely to block India’s accession to the body. Brazil’s commitments to reduce carbon emissions were also likely to collide with Saudi Arabia, Russia and the UAE’s oil- and gas-based economic interests (though Brazil has doubled down on oil production and exports despite its public rhetoric over climate change).” India is also opposing the idea of a Brics currency as an alternative to the dollar.Nevertheless, Xi’s decision to stay away is puzzling, given the US’s retreat from its global leadership role has provided a golden opportunity for China to pick up the mantle.Dr Samir Puri, the director of the centre for global governance at Chatham House, questioned whether a transition to a new multilateralism was happening. “It seems that the ending of one international order does not necessarily beget the sudden arrival of another,” he said. “The vacuums created by the US’s sudden retreat from multilateralism and global governance will not be automatically filled by others.”Explore more on these topicsBricsRussiaChinaBrazilIndiaSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Richard E Grant! Andrew Scott! Rhea Perlman! And they’re the tip of the iceberg…Rebecca NicholsonSat 5 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTShareToo Much (Netflix, Thursday 10 July) opens with a montage of the kind of woman you could be, if you were a carefree New Yorker who upped sticks and moved to London on a whim. You could be a candlelit period heroine, roaming across the moors, or one of Jack the Ripper’s victims, or you could be a sturdy northern police sergeant, which leads to the slightly strange spectacle of seeingMegan StalterfromHacksdoing a French and Saunders-style parody of what looks a lot like Happy Valley.The much-hyped newLena Dunhamcomedy follows Jess (Stalter), an open-hearted American woman who moves to London to escape a broken heart. There, she falls for a messy indie musician called Felix, whom she meets when he’s playing a gig in a pub. Dunham co-created the series with her husband Luis Felber, and it is loosely based on their real-life romance and marriage.Jess decides to reinvent her life following the decline of her relationship with the highly strung Zev (Michael Zegen). Zev has quickly moved on to an influencer, played by Emily Ratajkowski, and Jess records long videos about her feelings, addressed to Zev’s new girlfriend, which she never plans to send … but you can probably guess that they won’t stay private for ever. Following a post-breakup spell amid the matriarchs of her Long Island family home, she  packs her bags and books a room on a British estate. What Jess imagines an estate to be is basically Mr Darcy emerging from the lake at Chatsworth. You can imagine the estate she ends up on when she arrives in London.This culture-clash, fish-out-of-water strand is not the main point, though it does bubble under throughout. It offers the chance to hear British slang and idioms with new ears: if “getting a bollocking” never sounded strange to you, then it is worth considering that if you have no idea what it means in the first place, it can come across as a little smutty. I wonder if it is also the first time “oi oi saveloy” has made its way on to a Netflix series.When Jess meets Felix (Will Sharpe, in leather jacket, lipstick and nail polish), her Mr Darcy/Mr Rochester dreams shuffle off in a very different direction. It is clear from the off that they like each other very much, but they don’t have the patience to pretend to be better people, or show each other their best sides. Instead, they come together over their flaws and oddities, finding a way to be together despite their considerable excess baggage. Too Much presents itself as a romcom, at least on the surface – Jess loves Love Actually and Notting Hill, and each of the episodes gets a romcom pun as its title – but in the end, it is an abrasive, complicated, grownup version of romance, rather than any picture-perfect illusion.View image in fullscreenNotting Hill … Stalter in Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixThe Bear has sparked an ongoing debate about what counts as comedy and what counts as drama, by entering itself into various comedy categories at awards shows, despite being defiantly laugh-free and deeply traumatic in almost every scene. While Too Much isn’t quite on that same level of harrowing, viewers should know in advance that it is not exactly a laugh-a-minute lolfest. Jess must slowly work out how she lost herself in her relationship with Zev, while Felix’s family are an eccentric, unreliable nightmare, and his struggles with sobriety are pressing and ongoing. You begin to hope that it’s only loosely based on real life when it delves into the grotesque, cartoonish awfulness of the English upper classes. Not even the most obnoxious of interlopers deserves to be exposed to a country house horror show in which grown women have nicknames that make them sound like horses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she has used royalties from the novel to open a recovery residenceSat 5 Jul 2025 04.01 EDTShareIn the spotless kitchen of a white clapboard house in the Appalachian mountains, a retired deacon, a regional jail counsellor and I form an impromptu book club. The novel under discussion is Barbara Kingsolver’s bestselling, Pulitzer prize-winningDemon Copperhead, which is set in this area, Lee County, Virginia, during the 1990s, at the beginning of the opioid epidemic. I say that I loved the novel, that it was vivid and brilliant, heart-warming and tragic. Their reaction is more complex – there’s a real sadness behind it. Julie Montgomery-Barber, the jail counsellor, tells me she found the book “hard to read”. The Rev Nancy Hobbs agrees that reading it was painful, “because I felt like: I knew these people. At every level, from foster care to the football coaches to Demon. I knew Demon.”Hobbs and Montgomery-Barber sit on the board of Higher Ground, therecovery residencerecently established by Kingsolver using royalties from the novel. We are viewing the house together as part of its official launch party, on a sunny Saturday in June. The house is a bright and welcoming space. It provides a safe place to live for women whose lives have been torn apart by addiction, who are seeking long-term recovery. Some of its residents have come directly from prison; one was living in a tent before she moved in; current ages range from 33 to 65 years old. Higher Ground gives residents a roof over their heads and supports them in myriad ways, from transport to AA appointments (most have lost their driving licences), to access to education and help with finding employment. The women can stay for between six months and two years. It opened in January and will be at full capacity later this month, when its eighth resident arrives, though there are plans for expansion.It is the first such residence for women in the county, explains Joie Cantrell, a public health nurse and the board’s co-director. She is, she says, “ecstatic” to be part of the project. So often, when people recover from addiction, they are sent “right back into the same situation. We were setting them up for failure.” Not here, says resident Syara Parsell, 35,who came to Lee County from prison in 2019. Born and raised in Connecticut, her mother drove her over here, she says, in the hope that the change of location would help her overcome a heroin addiction. Instead, she “started getting high in this town”, and was incarcerated again. She found Higher Ground when she was discharged in February and will be six months sober this month. Thanks to the house, she says, “my life has changed. My mentality has changed. I am truly sober.” She believes Higher Ground will give hope to others in active addiction nearby. They can see that “it gets better – and I would have never said that. I’ve been at some low points. I never thought I could do this.”View image in fullscreen‘My mentality has changed. I am truly sober’ … women at the Higher Ground women’s recovery centre.Photograph: Shawn PoynterThe launch event includes an afternoon of free Appalachian food and music in the nearby Pennington Gap Community Center, where Kingsolver stands beaming, with her husband Steven at her side, hugging guests and posing for pictures. Later, that evening, she takes to the stage of Lee theatre, an attractive mid-century playhouse next door, and ushers the centre’s staff and board members on stage to rapturous applause. Then, with spotlights illuminating the distinctive streak of white in her hair, she tells a largely local audience why she set her story here, in Lee County, the former coal mining region ravaged by addiction after Purdue Pharma flooded the area with its supposedly non-addictive new wonder drug, OxyContin, in the 1990s.Kingsolver, who grew up in the foothills of the Appalachians, tells the audience that the area’s struggles “are things we are supposed to be ashamed of – but they are not our fault”. Rather, she says, they are the legacy of “big companies who came here to take something away”.First that was timber, then coal, “then they came to harvest our pain”. It’s a rousing speech which turns emotional when she interviews some residents on stage. Nikki is now studying for her GED (the equivalent of a high school diploma) and says she feels, for the first time, as though she has kin. “I really got to know the girls in the house, and when you don’t have a family, and you really get close to them, that’s your new family.”I meet Kingsolver the next day at her hotel, a 40-minute drive along open roads in the green mountains, past clapboard houses with US flags on their porches, churches with white steeples, corrugated iron side-of-road shops and cows chewing the cud on hillside farms. She wears a patterned red top and bootcut jeans, and is still in high spirits from the previous evening, telling me proudly, “There wasn’t a dry eye in the house!” That it has all come together is “amazing”, she says. She could not have imagined any of this happening when she was writing the novel, a retelling of Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield. “I didn’t have any idea Demon would bring home so much bacon,” she says. “I never presume success. I write about things that can make people uncomfortable, that ask them to examine their prejudices and think about the world in a new way. I never assume that’s going to be marketable.”There was a sense of: we can’t have people knowing that bad stuff happens here. That wonderful denial that keeps people afloatKingsolver has been a towering figure in American culture for decades, author of acclaimed novels including The Poisonwood Bible, her 1998 epic about a family of American missionaries in the Belgian Congo, and The Lacuna, for which she won the 2010 Women’s prize for fiction. She has frequently written about the Appalachian region which, she says, is the only place that feels like home. She grew up in rural Kentucky, and, after a stint as a journalist in Arizona, has spent most of her adult life on a farm in Washington County, southwest Virginia. Her longstanding literary preoccupations – nature and the web of relationships between people and systems – derive from growing up “around wildness and woodlands”, and from living in a rural community, through which she became aware of “the interconnectedness of our every ambition and accomplishment”.Rural life and the opioid crisis have not been sufficiently represented in fiction, she says. “Appalachian life in general has not been sufficiently represented. People don’t know the complexity and the nuance.” Appalachians represent “ecosystems of people, the people in need and the people who give; the Memaws (grandmothers) who take care of all the kids.” She dismisses one infamous account – vice president JD Vance’s 2016 memoirHillbilly Elegy– as a book that was “really all about himself, how he got out and made good, and the people that stay behind, well, are just lazy”. Appalachian culture, she says, is about modesty and self-reliance. “If he were a real Appalachian, he wouldn’t tell that story.”Fittingly, then, she says it was Demon’s voice that made the novel so compelling to many, and “I thank Mr Dickens for that. My hesitation with this book, and the trouble I had getting started with it for years, was the stereotypes I was working against. People have ideas about Appalachians, and they have ideas about what so-called addicts are like. By telling the story from the point of view of an orphaned child, readers are immediately sympathetic.” It helps that Demon is so loveable: “He has moxie, he’s so funny. So mad and profane, but he has such a good heart. People want to adopt him.”View image in fullscreenBarbara Kingsolver meets volunteers from a Tennessee recovery centre during a celebration for the opening of Higher Ground.Photograph: Shawn PoynterEven by Kingsolver’s standards, Demon Copperhead’s success was “of a different magnitude”. As well as the Pulitzer, she became the only woman to win the Women’s prize twice. Her sales were in a “new stratosphere”. She tells me she has given much of her income away for years. “Material success came gradually. So I had time to learn how to draw a cap on what we need as a family and what we can do with the rest.” So, when “that first royalty cheque came in and our eyes all popped wide open, I thought: ‘I could do something significant with this.’”After learning from local residents about the desperate need for recovery residences, she bought a building and set about assembling a local team. Many Lee County locals have become deeply involved, from the community college offering one resident free electrical and carpentry training to the centre’s 83-year-old neighbour Larry, who “just kind of adopted these ladies”, as Kingsolver puts it, and frequently gives them lifts to appointments. Community involvement is crucial, she says. “Charity is a very loaded concept. It involves a power imbalance. It is a person standing in a position of privilege saying: I will give this gift to you, and implicit is: ‘to help you become more like me’. Everything about that is odious to me.”For all the successes, of both the centre and the book, there has been some local pushback. “Initially, and maybe still, specifically in Lee County, some people felt like:‘Why did you have to name us?’ Nobody told me to my face, but I heard other people sort of sniping about it. I think it’s pride. Very privileged people who would really rather not think about their neighbours who are struggling and suffering.”One such naysayer made his opinion clear when Kingsolver tried to donate a set of books to Lee County High School, Demon’s alma mater, at the request of an English teacher. “Between opening the trunk of the car and getting the books to the classroom, they mysteriously vanished,” she says. After some investigation Kingsolver appealed to the school board, telling them how “life-changing” she would have found it, as a girl in Kentucky, to have read a novel written nearby. The books miraculously reappeared in the principal’s office. She is convinced that the perpetrator had not read the book but “had a sense that it was set in Lee County and it talked about bad things. We can’t have people knowing that bad stuff happens here. You know, that wonderful denial that keeps people afloat.”It has become so easy for urban people to dismiss all of rural America, to paint us all with the brush of backward, dumbPride, denial and shame are longstanding Kingsolver fascinations. She says that the archetypal American story of the lone hero pulling themselves up by their bootstraps “is just bullshit. We have classes in this country. We have class barriers. There are places you can be born that you’re never going to get out of.” Still, she says, that myth is powerful: it “brainwashes” people; it can lead to self-blame. Shame, she believes, is intrinsic to Trump’s success, something she explores in one memorable Demon Copperhead passage addressing the word “deplorable”, a reference to Hillary Clinton’s infamous description of Trump voters as a “basket of deplorables”.“I spent more worry on that word than perhaps any other single word in the book,” she says. “I took it out, put it back in because, I mean, I love Hillary. I voted for her. I think it was so unfair that one sentence was taken out of context. But, also, there are people in my neighbourhood driving around with trucks that say: ‘I’m a deplorable.’ It has become so easy for urban people to dismiss all of rural America, to paint us all with the brush of backward, dumb – that was toxic. I’m sure she read this book, and I’m sure she didn’t like that I used that word, but I didn’t mean it personally. It’s just awfully important to get it across that, as Demon says, we have cable. We know what you’re saying about us – and we’re mad about it.”Trump understands this, she says. He’s the guy who says: “I’m not like them. I’m not a fancy educated guy. I’m one of you. That’s what appealed to people. Shame is such a part of this. He got under people’s sense of shame and found other places to put it.” She lives in Trump country, and says she understands how he “hooked” so many people, but she never demonises Trump voters herself, describing her neighbours as “some of the most generous, kindhearted people you will ever meet”. She has no kind words for the man himself. His presidency is, she says, “a circus. That’s too kind a word for it. Circuses make you laugh. This one makes you cry. It’s stunning how much damage one ignorant man can do.”She points out that Trump’s “so-called Big Beautiful Bill” could be devastating for the region, with its cuts to the National Park Service, the Weather Service and disaster preparedness – just last year the area was hit by the devastating Hurricane Helene – and cuts to Medicaid, which could cause havoc in an already under-served area. “The damage will be unimaginable. Lots of people will die, lots of wild lands will be destroyed. The damage is terrifying.” Does she think her Trump-voting neighbours will change their allegiance if such terrors come to pass? “Will they connect the dots when our hospital closes? I don’t even know the answer to that,” she says, shaking her head, fearing that the TV and radio stations that told them to vote for Trump in the first place will “come up with some other reason why your hospital closed. For those of us who are in the information business, that’s a depressing subject.”Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver review – Dickens updatedRead moreShe writes to her Republican congressman every other day to say: “You studied history. You know better than this. Come on!” She is seethingly angry with the administration “because the Congress people do know the law. Pretty much all of them come from wealthy backgrounds. They know what all this means, and they’re not standing up to him. I just want them to grow a spine.” She is not thrilled with the Democrats, either. “I’m very critical of both political parties in this country in terms of how beholden they are to corporate interests. Corporations run this country. It’s really just a question of how much or how little they are willing to spare for the public good. A lot of us have been reading about late capitalism for a long time, and now we’re seeing it.”In the long term, she says she believes in the Martin Luther King Jr quote that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice”. Until we start to see that bend, good news comes locally, at least: Higher Ground is already growing, she tells me, with the acquisition of a neighbouring building, which the women will run as a thrift shop. She hopes that the project will expand further, will help more people. She plans to be involved for the long run and hopes to do whatever she can to help in “destigmatising this disease and bringing the community into the project of supporting our lost citizens”. She is also currently adapting one of her books – she can’t say which – for film and is in the middle of writing a new novel.Meanwhile, Demon lives on. His spirit is in the recovery house, whose residents Kingsolver describes as “the mothers of real-life Demon Copperheads”. Unlike their fictional counterpart, these women have hope of getting back on their feet, thanks to a house paid for, in large part, by book lovers – many of whom have continued contributing. When Kingsolver announced the initiative on her Instagram page, her 150,000 followers donated more than $50,000 in cash in a week, and purchased reams of items from an Amazon wish list. The house’s patio seating was gifted by a book club in Switzerland. Demon also lives on in readers’ brains. “Readers still ask me: ‘Did he get his happy ending?’ I tell them: ‘He’s yours. Now, you get to imagine whatever happy ending you like for him.’”Faber has reissued Barbara Kingsolver’s titles The Lacuna, Flight Behaviour and The Poisonwood Bible this summer; for more information on Higher Ground seehgwrr.orgIn the UK, Action on Addiction is available on 0300 330 0659.

It wants what it wants, as Emily Dickinson wrote. Especially when you’re young and have no previous experience of love and desire, or the deleterious effects of time on both. This is the core subject of 24-year-old Harriet Armstrong’s debut novel, To Rest Our Minds and Bodies, published by the consistently adventurous independent press Les Fugitives.When the unnamed narrator, a third-year psychology student, meets fellow student Luke in their campus kitchen, she falls hard. They begin sharing meals and confidences in her room, which bears a “suicide beam” running the length of the ceiling. This memento mori is archly juxtaposed with the narrator’s breathless infatuation, which feels as if “some great transition was occurring inside me, something was aligning, I could actually feel it”. She finds herself “wide open and completely soft like a small trembling animal held in two hands, two hands which could crush it completely but which would not”.Armstrong expertly adumbrates the emotional intensity and vulnerability of first love, with every page bearing a startling observation or wry aside. The world is made anew: “I had never seen a winter which was so yellow … before Luke I had never really felt gendered … Luke and I were inventing ourselves.” Of course, her loved one is filtered through her perceptions, and while he is intelligent and attractive, we can also see that he’s a self-involved, self-pitying young man, with all that entails. He leaves her dangling and fails to reciprocate her abundant, overflowing emotions. Unlike us, she can’t see him objectively. Nor can she see herself fully. While she’s aware that her self-conscious awkwardness is the result of her neurodivergence, she’s yet to gain the self-knowledge that might deter her from withholding men such as Luke.The passage where the narrator Googles vaginal dilators will, for a number of reasons, bring tears to the eyesAnd so we fear for her future the deeper she falls. What’s compelling is that unlike, say, Esther in The Bell Jar, the narrator has no perspective through which to filter her descent. At times the novel is unbearably intense, like experiencing the essence of obsession as it’s lived in every moment – which is not to say that it isn’t also very funny. Armstrong astutely atomises the gen Z world of online living and flat sharing: “I didn’t want to get up to go and make breakfast and be faced with some shirtless boy cooking ramen”. The passage where the narrator Googles vaginal dilators will, for a number of reasons, bring tears to the eyes. Armstrong’s voice is by turns jejune, candid and ludic, but always aware of its effects and its commitment to emotional truth.The Cartesian split alluded to in the title is crucial. While cerebral and obsessively analytical, the narrator is equally fervent about engaging with the messily somatic: “Perhaps sex was a necessary component of the life that I wanted, perhaps some things really couldn’t be accessed at all except through sex.” Luke is ambivalent about her joining Tinder. And so she embarks on a series of tragic dates, losing her virginity with a thirtysomething comedian in a sex scene of almost surreal awkwardness, but written with such dark humour and insight that it ends up feeling triumphant.Almost inevitably, Luke eventually turns away from her. Memories of their time together pour back “like some biblical flood or plague”. Eventually, it becomes “impossible to even breathe without thinking of Luke”. At the book’s close, she is invited to his 24th birthday party, aware that he’s moved on but unable to process the fact, leading to a searing denouement. The final scene is as deft and devastating as the conclusion to a Cheever story. While ostensibly belonging to the subgenre of novels about young women negotiating 21st-century relationships, To Rest Our Minds and Bodies is a world away from the derogatory label “sad girl lit”. It announces Armstrong as a bright and singular voice in literary fiction.To Rest Our Minds and Bodies by Harriet Armstrong is published by Les Fugitives (£14.99).

Like many Australian actors, it began with a soap opera – McMahon played Ben Lucini in 150 episodes of Home and Away – but he soon broke free to pursue a more ambitious and challenging oeuvre.McMahon, the son of former prime minister Sir William “Billy” McMahon, made a name for himself overseas through US television in his 30s. On supernatural drama Charmed he played Cole Turner, a half-human, half-demon assassin turned love interest for one of the witches he was hired to kill. McMahon took to the show’s campy tone with aplomb, delivering lines like “I’m going straight to hell, cause it’s got to be a sin to lookthisgood” with a twinkle in his eye.His next big role was in Ryan Murphy’s dramaNip/Tuck, as the arrogant plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy. In the early 2000s the show made headlines for its frank depiction of nudity and sex – the Guardian described McMahon’s character as“a vagina-seeking missile”– but it also showed his talent for bringing vulnerability to suave but damaged men. It was around this time McMahonbecame a favourite to succeed Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but missed out to Daniel Craig – instead he landed the role of Victor Von Doom, AKA Doctor Doom, the supervillain of two Fantastic Four movies.1:33Julian McMahon's most memorable roles – videoOver the years McMahon left Hollywood for home to appear in various Australian features – among them Stephan Elliott’s raucous 2018 comedySwinging Safari, in which he played an attender of a 1970s key party, alongside Guy Pearce and his former sister-in-law Kylie Minogue, and the 2012 horror movie Bait, in which he played a robber in a supermarket that’s been flooded by a tsunami and monstered by sharks. That film was a big hit overseas, where it became, in less than two weeks, themost successful Australian movie ever released in China. In a full circle move, he recently played the Australian prime minister in Netflix’s comedy-mystery The Residence (again opposite Minogue).Julian McMahon, Fantastic Four, Nip/Tuck and Charmed actor, dies aged 56Read moreDespite his career being well into its third decade, there’s a very sad feeling surrounding McMahon’s death that his talent has been dramatically cut short; that his star was very much on the rise again. One of his last roles was opposite Nicolas Cage as the villain in Lorcan Finnegan’s intensely trippy, sun-scorched thrillerThe Surfer, which premiered out of competition at last year’s Cannes film festival. McMahon played Scally, the leader of a gang of violent hoodlums from a small coastal town who patrol the local beach and harass visitors.And what a performance it was. Not everybody can hold their own against an actor like Cage, but McMahon pulled it off perfectly, countering the star’s off-the-wall style with a seething, magnetic portrait of toxic masculinity – darkly charismatic and creepy as all get-out. In one memorable scene, whichyou can watch on YouTube, McMahon slurps down a beer and implores Cage to “drink deep, eat your fill, turn around from this town and never come back”. Throughout the film he projects a layered, paradoxically chummy kind of menace: calm and imperturbable, then, suddenly, explosively violent and unsettling.View image in fullscreenJulian McMahon in a scene from The Surfer.Photograph: APMcMahon had amazingly bright and burning blue eyes, the colour of the sea. They were even more striking in person – I know because I was lucky enough to meet him on the set of The Surfer in Western Australia, where we chatted about this role and work ethic. On that day, McMahon was philosophical. “You want to be open to new suggestions, new thoughts, new ideas, and new creativity, wherever that’s coming from,” he told me. And he was funny, riffing on the something he may not have missed about his home country – the insects: “Australian flies just come and sit on your face, and they’ll stay there for an hour or two.”He is survived by his wife, Kelly Paniagua, and his daughter, Madison, from a previous marriage.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAustralian filmcommentShareReuse this content"

But the Oasis reunion did indeed come to pass, and the reaction has universally been one of wonderment. You’d expect that from fans – if you ended up spending north of £300 on a dynamically priced ticket, you’d decide you were going to have fun – but critics have also been united in their praise.Alexis Petridis, the Guardian★★★★★“You can still sense inspiration declining – 1997’s D’You Know What I Mean? sounds like a trudge regardless of how many people are singing along – but far more often, the show serves as a reminder of how fantastic purple patchOasiswere,” the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis said in a five-star review. “Against a ferocious wall of distorted guitars, there’s a weird disconnect between the tone of Noel’s songs – wistful, noticeably melancholy – and the way Liam sings them like a man seething with frustration, on the verge of offering someone a fight. Even discounting half their career, they have classics in abundance: Cigarettes & Alcohol, Slide Away, Rock ’n’ Roll Star, Morning Glory.Will Hodgkinson, the Times★★★★★The set took on extra resonance given everything that has happened since [Oasis’s split in 2009]. Noel may have once called Liam a man with a fork in a world of soup, and Liam accused Noel of being a potato, but Acquiesce is a song about the fact that they “need each other” – and they do. Noel has a soul complex enough to write beautiful songs. Liam has a soul simple enough to deliver them with pure feeling. They are, ultimately, stuck with each other … As for Supersonic, the song that started it all, it encapsulated everything the Gallaghers evoked, perhaps without even realising it: attitude, surrealism, familiarity, the madness of the everyday.View image in fullscreenLiam and Noel Gallagher.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APDianne Bourne, Manchester Evening News★★★★★Stop the clocks, the stars really did align, because yes, Oasis are back – and they’ve just reclaimed their crown as rock’n’roll stars. You can throw as many cliches as you like at this show and it still wouldn’t quite sum up what the 60,000-plus fans cramming into the Principality stadium inCardiffsaw, heard and felt, on Friday night. It was biblical, celestial, majestical – all of the superlatives that Liam likes to self-anoint himself with. But on this occasion, it was no hyperbole … I think it’s the first time I’ve seen a mosh pit stretch to the entire floor and right up into the seats such was the constant bouncing energy of an elated crowd not quite believing this was really happening, and that they were really here.Andrew Trendell, NME★★★★★As the flares light up for Don’t Look Back in Anger into the spoils of colossal closers Wonderwall and an everlasting Champagne Supernova, the sweet escape comes to an end. Lord knows we needed a taste of that halcyon 90s hope and abandon in 2025 – especially for the raving and craving gen Zers. The world is a rotting shitty bin-fire and tomorrow never knows, but tonight, you’re a rock’n’roll star.Neil McCormick, the Telegraph★★★★★I don’t think anyone who managed to get their hands on a ticket for this reunion could feel short-changed. Because really it was a reunion between an audience and their favourite band, a reunion between Britain and rock’n’roll … It was very loud, it was simplistic to the point of banality and it was magically, exhaustingly uplifting.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageMark Beaumont, the Independent★★★★★The real underlying thrill is of a historical moment fully revived. For all the laddish boorishness that Oasis undoubtedly encapsulated, the Britpop era, for millennials and gen Zers alike, is as halcyon as Beatlemania or the summer of love – a time of vivid colour, jubilant melody, political stability and affordable flats. And to be a part of this second wind of torrid Oasismania, hyped by effusive press coverage and leading to historic shows such as this one, is as close to actually “being there” as it’s possible to get.Ellie Henman, the Sun★★★★★The set list made me feel like I was being punched in the face – repeatedly – by the 90s. Liam’s vocals were out of this world – he ought to pie off Clarks and get an advertising deal with Halls Soothers because whatever he was sucking in rehearsals clearly paid off. And Noel, who has never failed to impress me performing live, was the cherry on the cake with his masterful ability on the guitar sure to inspire generations of young musicians to come.Martin Robinson, the Standard★★★★★Today, reports of gen Z loving Oasis have not been overplayed. There’s been a cross-generational vibe around these shows. Like Noel’s dream of melding dance music communality with punk rock attitude to kill off grunge in the 90s, seems to have been rebooted. Turn off and on again, and the aggro violence has gone, and what’s left is something fresh and cool and utterly exciting.View image in fullscreenOasis fans outside the stadium.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/GettyKathryn Williams, Wales Online★★★★★The city of Cardiff had been on a wave of excitement and bucket hats all week and the soundchecks coming out of the stadium were sounding class, proper bristles up on the back of your neck type stuff. But the real thing was intense and immense. A wall of sound burst around the closed Principality stadium … and Liam’s voice was faultless.Will Richards, Rolling Stone UK★★★★★The band sound, to use Liam’s favorite phrase, absolutely biblical. Within half an hour, we’re through Acquiesce, Morning Glory, Supersonic and Cigarettes & Alcohol at tremendous volume. Oasis’s arsenal of generation-defining hits is hardly a secret, but when confronted with them one after another like this, it was truly overwhelming.Explore more on these topicsOasisWhat the papers sayLiam GallagherNoel GallagherPop and rockWalesNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

It gave me a new father figure – and unblocked my creativityAs told toDeborah LintonSat 5 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTShareOn an unseasonably warm day in October 2023, I arrived, ahead of the queues, at London’s Southbank Centre for a conceptual art takeover by the world-famousMarina Abramović Institute.I had recently read Marina’s memoirWalk Through Walls, which had resonated. So, when I’d seen the event advertised – hours-long performances by artists she’d invited, curated and introduced by Marina – I bought a £60 ticket and waited for my time slot to enter the Queen Elizabeth Hall. I hadn’t seen performance art before, and this was due to include her well-known workThe Artist Is Presentwith an artist sitting, static and silent, in a chair all day, as Marina once did for an accumulated 736 hours and 30 minutes at the Museum of Modern Art.I felt certain that it would affect me, I just wasn’t sure how.It came at an interesting time in my life. I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian family, the daughter of a priest who was physically abusive. I’d been in therapy for years, but my experiences still affected me and I’d recently cut contact with my father with my family. So, when I entered the first room at the Southbank where Marina was to spoke and introduce around a dozen artists, I was still coming to terms with this new way of dealing with my past.I was immediately drawn to one of the artists, a man fromMyanmarwho was to perform the chair piece with a cloth sack over his head. We heard how he’d been part of an organisation in Myanmar that opposed violence and therefore risked death if he was publicly identified. I was moved by what he was risking for his art. I also knew it was a hard piece; Marina wasn’t going to give it to just anyone.I cried, the good tears, where you let part of your past go. It felt cleansing. When I left, I felt lighterAs people moved between performers, I saw him, seated in the atrium, with a large crowd; I waited for a quieter moment to return. When I finally stood before him, I was overcome. I felt an urge to sit down in front of him and didn’t care what others thought. I was compelled to do it for myself. I can’t say how long I sat there, maybe an hour. In that time, I rewrote my definition of “strength”. I used to think my father’s aggression made him strong but now I saw someone using his muscular arms and legs to be still, for peaceful protest. I imagined the loss he must have experienced in war and the mental strength to sit there. I thought of what I’d read in Marina’s book; how pain set in three hours into sitting still.I cried: the good tears, where you let part of your past go. It felt cleansing. When I left, I felt lighter. I decided that this would be my father figure now: this person who had strength but did not hurt me, who had reasons to be aggressive but did not direct his anger towards a six-year-old whispering in her brother’s ear or disturbing his preaching, as my father had.It unlocked something in me. It gave me a positive male figure to replace what had gone before and helped me not to hate my father or men. It also unblocked the creativity that had laid dormant within me, an artistic side that had reminded me too much of my father’s similar creative charisma. I started drawing: comic-books and illustrations.I’m an atheist but I believe there are spiritual moments you can choose to embrace: this, for me, was one. I think of it often. I even have the poster from the takeover in my toilet, serving as a daily reminder. I’m 41 and throughout life I’ve learned to expect the unexpected. Usually, when I go to see art it’s to learn something new, and this was a big one. This changed me as a woman, as a soul, an immigrant, a creative, a child. That man gave himself to us as an artist and I accepted his gift.Share your experienceYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Having already played six Wembley Stadium shows on their Music of the Spheres tour in 2022, Coldplay are bringing it back for 10 more later this summer, plus two more in Hull. And now, here come Oasis, playing a total of 17 stadium concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, London and Edinburgh.These are the kind of figures that get the music industry very excited. Last year, according toUK Music, 23.5m concertgoers spent a total of £10bn in the UK, supporting 72,000 jobs. “Artists are delivering spectacular performances, and there’s nothing like the feeling of being at a live show,” says Denis Desmond, UK and Ireland chair of the massive promoter Live Nation. “We’re seeing a real and sustained boom in outdoor shows, festivals and stadium concerts”.Certainly, it looks that way. The Guardian has calculated that in London alone this summer, there are at least 100 single-day outdoor shows with a capacity of 15,000 or more, ranging from events in local parks to stadium shows. Festivals and arena shows have always been popular in the UK, but there have never been so many big outdoor gigs.Industry insiders put the shift down to customer demand. That’s undoubtedly part of it – there are many people who enjoy standing in the sun with thousands of others listening to a selection of acts, but have no desire for it to involve camping in the middle of nowhere. One senior figure in the live industry says the changing nature of the music industry has driven the shift, too – social media and streaming mean many artists are popular enough to play to bigger audiences earlier in their careers, and outdoor shows provide the perfect opportunity.View image in fullscreenImmense … Lana Del Rey performs at Hampden Park, Glasgow, June 2025.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesIt’s not just consumer-led, though. Local councils have been actively courting promoters to put on shows in parks, to raise money for local services; stadium operators have been trying to attract more shows (theRugby Football Unionwants to put on more shows each year at Twickenham, up from the three it is currently allowed, to nine next year, 12 in 2027 and 15 in 2028).Either way, this current glut of shows is so immense that there are those wondering if it can be sustained. All summer, there have been stories of cheap last-minute tickets available on secondary ticketing sites, and Facebook-disseminated offers to shift unsold seats. And while the demand forOasistickets might have been enormous, not everyone can be Oasis. At the time of writing, there are seated tickets available in all areas for Catfish and the Bottlemen’s show at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at the start of August (and plenty for their Cardiff Principality Stadium concert, too). Nor will you have any trouble getting into Post Malone’s two shows at Tottenham. Even at shows billed as sold out, venues don’t appear full – there were many pockets of empty seats when Dua Lipa played the first of two shows at Wembley Stadium.That’s not necessarily bad news for the artists, who are paid a guaranteed fee, but it is very bad news for promoters, because shows at this scale tend only to break even when 90% of tickets have been sold. And that is where some industry figures sound a note of caution. “I think we’re all surprised at the amount of large-scale events London can sustain,” one says. “Will it continue at this same growth and to the same scale? Only time will tell.” Another says brusquely: “There are certainly a lot this year, and they’re not all doing well.”Artists, too, are uncertain: the Guardian knows of acts who turned down slots high on stadium show bills this summer, because they were concerned about the reputational damage of playing to a crowd sparse enough to be mocked on social media.It’s perhaps a measure of industry uncertainty that so few people within live music were willing to talk on the record about this year’s boom, and certainly not to confront the issue of whether sellouts or sparsely attended washouts are likely to shape next summer’s bookings. Desmond, though, remains optimistic. To him, these shows are a chance to build memories: “We’re seeing generations come together – fans who saw the Beatles or the Rolling Stones in the 60s are now attending shows with their children and grandchildren. A connection that only live music can create.”Nevertheless, whether those younger generations will need the older ones to pay for the incredible cost of a ticket, and whether the live music sector can continue to operate at the scale that it is, remain points of debate in the industry.Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryOasisBeyoncéLana Del ReyKendrick LamarColdplayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve got AI and other tech use cases under way at the moment, but ultimately I’m a strong believer that it’s the real [life] experience that we are delivering.”View image in fullscreenThe virtual reality headsets on the Galactica ride at Alton Towers were ditched after theme park goers didn’t rate the experience.Photograph: Alton Towers Resort/PAEastwood, who is a board member of the industry body UKHospitality, joined Merlin a decade ago and was made interim chief executive in November, then confirmed in the role in February.Prior to Merlin, Eastwood spent 18 years at the BBC in marketing, then moved to the commercial arm of the corporation, BBC Studios, where she had responsibility for the Doctor Who franchise.Competition in the UK and Europe theme park sector is accelerating as Comcast, the US parent company of the Hollywood studio and theme park giant Universal,is building a theme park in Bedford that it aims to open in 2031.The park, which promises a 115-metre high rollercoaster that would be the tallest in Europe, has received significant support from the government amid a push by Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to kickstart economic growth.Late last month it emerged that part of the government-agreed support for the projectincludes £500m of public investment in rail and road infrastructure, part of which will involve a new railway station being built.Eastwood welcomes the competition but says any “special treatment” for Universal needs to also be considered for other park operators.“It’s a great opportunity for the overall market,” she says. “With the analogy of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’, I’m a big fan. The entire theme park market benefits. I think the only thing we need to be careful of is that everyone’s treated fairly in terms of planning permission.“Planning permission in the UK is not easy. And so we need to make sure that if Universal are given any special treatment, that that special treatment is also given to the entire industry.”View image in fullscreenMerlin Entertainments also operates franchises including Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the ‘Eye’ wheels in cities including London.Photograph: Rudy Sulgan/Getty ImagesEastwood has been quick to ring the changes at Merlin, aiming to simplify the sprawling global business to operate more as a single company.“Merlin has grown up over many years as separate sites which have operated independently,” she says. “The big shift in our operating model was to become one company. For example, in the UK what you don’t want is Alton Towers doing something at the same time as Legoland Windsor.”This weekend she is in China opening Merlin’s latest attraction, Legoland Shanghai, its first in the world’s second largest theme park market.The 11th Legoland is being touted by Merlin as its most perfect at launch, with elements such as a 250-room hotel ready to go.“It’s a big deal for us, it’s been many years in the making,” Eastwood says. “It’s going to be the world’s largest park at opening, it is a massive moment. It’s a real fusion of east and west.We will have 75 rides, lots of [interactive experiences], and it’s on the doorstep of 55 million people that live within a two-hour drive.”As well as Legoland staples, such as the castle and dragon coaster, the park features attractions with a more specific appeal to local and regional tourists. These include a boat experience based on real-world trips through the water towns of the Yangtze lower delta and a Lego Monkie Kidride inspired by the legend of the Monkey King and his journey to the west.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This followed a £214m loss in 2023.Most of the losses over the past two years are attributable to non-cash impairment charges of almost £600m in the value assigned to some of its attractions, reflecting the tough trading conditions and a reassessment of the growth rate of newer parks.Legoland parks in New York and Korea have been written down by £340m over the past two years, while the 20 Madame Tussauds waxworks sites were subjected to a £163m impairment charge last year.View image in fullscreenArtists add the finishing touches to a Queen Camilla wax figure at Madame Tussauds in London.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAMerlin, where adjusted profits fell 15% last year to £540m, has responded by upping its marketing budget by £10m to £100m and increasing promotions and discounts.The company also bolstered its marketing firepower by hiring Craig Inglis, the man who madeChristmas ads a cultural phenomenon during his time at John Lewis, and Tui’s global brand and content director, Toby Horry.As the battle for consumers’ attention in the digital era has reached fever pitch, Merlin has been on a deal-making spree to secure intellectual property crown jewels to exploit at its parks across the world.Deals have been struck with therights owners of the global preschool phenomenon Peppa Pig, Sony toexploit the $2bn Hollywood film franchise Jumanji, a $110m deal with theMicrosoft-owned global gaming franchise Minecraftand most recently theUS media company Paramount for Paw Patrol.“I’d say our biggest competitor is entertainment in the home, or indeed, increasingly bedrooms, where kids have access to gaming and the internet,” says Eastwood. “What is in our favour is when you look at all the research, increasingly parents of kids aged from six to 12 and beyond actually see the home as a battleground.“They’re trying to get their kids off screens. We know that what parents value is an opportunity to be together and experience a world outside the house. We’re almost an antidote to the phone and digital technology. What we deliver is that escapism.”Explore more on these topicsTheme parksMerlin EntertainmentsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

You can add butter, beat the eggs in the pan and roll to make it French, add spices, coriander and onion to make it Indian, or mirin and soy, as in today’s dish, for a trip to Japan. You could add any condiment or pickle from mayonnaise to ketchup and chilli oil to chimichurri, and bolster the meal with bread or rice. Today’s recipe is merely one of many wonderful scenic routes on which to take your omelette.Omelette rolls with rice, carrot pickles and wasabi mayonnaiseSimply double the quantities to serve four. Sushi rice vinegar is widely available in the UK, and has been very helpfully pre-seasoned. If you can’t find it, use regular rice vinegar and add a tablespoon of sugar when you make the sushi seasoning.Prep10 minCook30 minServes2200g sushi riceFine sea salt8 tbsp sushi rice vinegar– I likeSaitaku1 large carrot, peeled and cut into matchsticks1-2 tsp wasabi paste, to taste3 tbsp mayonnaise½ tsp black sesame seeds6 medium eggs1 tbsp mirin1 ½ tbsp soy sauce2½ tbsp sesame oilFirst make the sushi rice. Put the rice in a saucepan for which you have a tight-fitting lid and cover with 280ml cold water. Bring to a boil, then cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and set a timer for 10 minutes. When the time is up, take the pan off the heat but leave the lid on for at least another 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make up the sushi seasoning by mixing a teaspoon of salt with four tablespoons of sushi rice vinegar. When the rice has cooled down to almost room temperature, fold in the seasoning using a wooden spoon.To make the pickled carrots, put the carrot matchsticks in a shallow-lipped dish, pour over the remaining four tablespoons of sushi rice vinegar, sprinkle on three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and mix well.To make the wasabi mayo, mix the mayonnaise with the wasabi paste (start with one teaspoon and add a second if you like it hotter), then sprinkle the black sesame seeds over the top.Finally, to make the omelette rolls, crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk with the mirin, soy sauce and half a tablespoon of sesame oil. Put a tablespoon of sesame oil in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s very hot, pour in half the egg mixture and cook until golden on the bottom and semi-set on top (that is, with only a little liquid egg still visible). Using a spatula, roll it up, slide out on to a plate and repeat with another tablespoon of sesame oil and the remaining beaten egg mix.To serve, cut the omelettes into 2cm-wide rolls, place on two plates and serve with bowls of sushi rice, pickled carrots, wasabi mayo and more soy sauce nearby.Explore more on these topicsJapanese food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodVegetarian food and drinkEggsRiceMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

So you phone up and complain, and maybe suggest you will take your business elsewhere. Suddenly and miraculously, you are offered a much better price.Most of us would chalk that down as a serious win – but what if you hadn’t called?The consumer organisation Which? is concerned that customers might be being “taken for a ride” on renewals. It wants theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA), the UK regulator, to investigate whether insurers are falling short of requirements to offer “fair value” to their customers.Which? surveyed more than 2,000 adults with car insurance and found that “a large number” had benefited from reductions to their renewal price, with some getting £200 or more lopped off the original quote.Six in 10 said they had got into a discussion with their insurer about the quote they had been offered, with most of them doing so over the phone. In 61% of cases this led to them being offered a lower price.The average saving was £64 a year, although some received much more sizeable reductions. One in 20 said they had saved more than £200.Which? says that if significantly better prices are offered to customers, but only after they make a fuss, insurers may be in breach of the FCA’s consumer duty rules, which came into force in July 2023 and require financial firms to demonstrate their products provide fair value for customers.Mystifyingly large price rises at renewal are certainly not unusual. Guardian Money has featured several cases during the past few months, including the home insurance policyholderwho was quoted £4,730for renewing a policy that had previously cost £440, and another home insurance customer whose quoteleapt from £518 to £1,353.With 40% of survey respondents not talking to their insurer about the quoted price before renewing, this suggests many customers “may be unfairly paying over the odds”, Which? says.It has outlined tips for negotiating with your insurer over the price.If the renewal price has gone up, ask the company to justify the increase.Point out any lower prices you have found elsewhere, and ask your insurer if it can better those offers.If it is not able to provide a better quote, say that you are willing to go elsewhere. If you have been a loyal customer for many years, mention that.If your insurer isn’t budging much, one option is to ask for an add-on (such as breakdown cover) to be thrown in to provide better value.The Association of British Insurerssays that variations between an initial quote and a bespoke over-the-phone offer “often come down to a deeper dive into individual factors which may have changed from the previous policy – such as your vehicle’s security measures, driving habits, level of cover and choice of voluntary excess”.It adds: “Our members take their commitment to their customers and their regulatory requirements seriously.”Explore more on these topicsCar insuranceInsuranceMotoringConsumer rightsConsumer affairsInsurance industryFinancial Conduct AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

The world seems to be lurching from one political crisis to the next, and each one has an impact on stock markets and prices.A recent surveyfound UK consumers are worriedabout a slowing economy, possible tax increases in the next budget and rising food costs. We asked experts how you should manage your money in an uncertain world.InvestmentsStock markets around the world, especially in the US, were in flux earlier this year over Donald Trump’s tariff plans. Things have settled down now but it is impossible to predict what shocks may be around the corner.If you hold stocks and shares – in an Isa or pension, perhaps – you may have been nervously checking their value. UK fund managershave been increasing their holdings in US companiesover recent years, largely fuelled by the boom in tech stocks, so big moves over there have an impact here.However, experts say the most important thing to do is to not sell up out of panic. The analyst Dan Coatsworth of the financial advisers AJ Bell says: “The worst thing people can do is to see troubling things in the news and then suddenly try to shift around their portfolio.” Markets have recovered in the past, he says, so patience is key.View image in fullscreenGold has tripled in price over the past decade.Photograph: Denys Rudyi/AlamyWhere this advice may differ is if you need your money for something in less than five years – such as a wedding, university fees or a house purchase. Then you should look at how much risk you are taking, he says.Andrew Oxlade, an investment director at the fund management company Fidelity International, says this could mean switching some of your money away from the markets and into bonds. Bonds are issued by a corporation or country – the investor loans it money in exchange for a fixed rate of interest.They are typically bought through a fund. Many investment management companies offer funds that have a split between equities and bonds, such as Vanguard’s Lifestrategy 80%.Gold, an investment that is often seen as a safe bet during times of crisis, has tripled in price over the past decade, and many investors now hold a small amount in their portfolios, Oxlade says, after years of poor performance. Investing does not have to mean buying bars or coins – Fidelity says the most direct way for most is through an exchange traded fund that tracks the price of gold.MortgagesInterest rates in the UK can be affected by what goes on globally. The Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation down. Beforethe war in Ukraine started, it had begun to put up rates, and as prices increased, it continued, raising them from 0.25% at the start of 2022 to 5.25% by August 2023, before holding them there for another year.The Bank has been reducing rates and is expected to make more cuts later this year, but the question is when. If you are planning to take out a new mortgage – either to buy a home or as a remortgage – you face a decision about whether to fix for the short or long term, choose a tracker or even to go on a bank’s standard variable rate (SVR).Currently, the best-priced two- and five-year fixed deals have a rate of just below 4%.Nick Mendes of the brokers John Charcol says lenders are reducing rates at present largely because of falling swap rates, a key factor in how mortgages are priced. Swap rates reflect what the money markets expect to happen to interest rates in future.“Fixed mortgage rates are more influenced by swap rates than the base rate itself, which means they are shaped by what markets think might happen in the future rather than what is happening today,” he says.View image in fullscreenIf you want to take out a mortgage you face a decision about whether to fix for the short or long term, choose a tracker or go on a bank’s SVR.Photograph: Ian Nolan/Getty Images/Image SourceGoing on to a lender’s SVR in the hope that fixed rates will improve later in the year is a risky strategy as the rates are high, at about 6.5%, and can change at any time and increase your monthly repayments.Tracker mortgages are also worth considering, Mendes says. These are linked to the Bank base rate. “They tend to start lower than SVRs and often come without early repayment charges, which means borrowers can move on to a fixed deal later,” he says.Mendes says people who are remortgaging should not “sit back and wait. Most lenders allow you to secure a new deal up to six months in advance, which is a smart way to hedge your bets,” he says. “You can lock in a deal now as a safety net and still switch to something better if rates improve before the new deal begins.”For new buyers, Mendes says they should base decisions on what is affordable now rather than making assumptions about what may or may not happen in the future. “The last position anyone wants to be in is having overstretched themselves on the assumption that they will be able to refinance on to something cheaper at the end of their fixed-rate period,” he adds.You are not tied to a rate until completion, so you should be able to switch if a better deal comes along.SavingsSavings rates could fall even before the Bank reduces the base rate, says Rachel Springall of the financial information site Moneyfacts, as account providers may decide that they have enough deposits for a certain product. “If the whole market starts moving in one direction, you’ll find that other peers will do the same because they don’t want to put themselves too high up [in best buy tables],” she says.Until then, easy access and fixed-term rates are competitive, Springall says.If you have money in a variable-rate account it may be a good time to fixThe best rates this week for fixed one-year and two-year bonds are from Cynergy Bank (4.55% for the one-year and 4.45% for the two-year), while an easy access account from Chase offers 5%, although this includes a 12-month bonus and is a variable rate, so it could go down.There have been increases in the interest paid on fixed-rate bonds in recent weeks, she says.Anna Bowes of the financial advisers The Private Office says “now is a really good time for a saver who has not been paying attention to their savings” as there is good competition in the market.If you have money in a variable-rate account it may be a good time to move it to a fixed rate.PensionsThe tumultuous times that stock markets have been having since the start of the year will have had a direct effect on many people in the UK through their pensions. Oftenfunds are heavily invested in US stocks, so the ups and downs there could be affecting your retirement saving.It is understandable if you are considering shifting money in your pension into other safer options such as bonds, says Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at the financial advice company Hargreaves Lansdown. However, unless you are cashing in your pension within the next five years, you should avoid reactions based on the international turmoil, she says.View image in fullscreenThe tumultuous times that stock markets have been having this year will affect many people in the UK through their pensions.Photograph: Alamy/PA“Over the course of your saving journey, you will hit several periods of market volatility and it’s important to keep in mind that markets do recover over time,” she says. “Making kneejerk reactions such as changing investment strategy has the potential to lock in losses as you miss out when markets do recover.”Workplace pensions are often invested in “lifestyling” funds, which reduce the amount of risk as the holder gets older by shifting from equities to bonds. So if you are approaching retirement this may be happening automatically.If your fund has been hit by turbulence in the markets and you intend on retiring soon, Morrissey says that you may want to start to take a lower amount out from your fund than you had planned in order to allow the rest to recover from any losses caused by market turbulence.“We suggest that people in [income] drawdown keep between one and three years’ worth of essential expenditure [from their savings] in an easy access account that they can use to supplement their income during times of turbulence,” she adds.Another option, on retirement, is to invest some or all of your fund in an annuity, where returns are close to all-time highs. Annuities convert a lump sum from your pension into a regular guaranteed income for the rest of your life or a fixed term. A healthy 65-year-old can now get an annuity rate of 7.72% on average, according to the pension provider Standard Life – that means that for every £100,000 invested, they would get an annual income of £7,720.Energy billsAbout 21 million households will see their bills decrease afterthe price cap was reducedthis week. For a household with typical usage, the cap has dropped by £129, to £1,720 a year. The good news may not last too long, however, as there are predictions of increases in October.After the recent conflict between Iran and Israel, oil prices went up because of concerns that supplies could be affected by threats of a blockade of thestrait of Hormuz. Prices later reduced after a ceasefire deal was agreed.View image in fullscreenThe energy price cap has dropped, but that may not be for long.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWill Owen of the price comparison website Uswitch says the volatility of the international economy has led to uncertainty. “We are now seeing predictions from various organisations and energy suppliers that the price cap from October onwards will probably go up,” he says.To protect yourself against a rise you could considered a fixed-rate tariff – with these each unit of energy and the standing charges are set for a certain length of time.The MoneySavingExpert site advises that you are “very likely” to save if you can find a fixed-rate deal priced at least 5% below the current price cap, which is predicted to fluctuate.The current best deals are a 12-month fix from E.ON Next that is 8.8% below the cap, another from Outfox Energy that is 8.1% less and then a fix from EDF Energy that is 7.2% less, according to the site.Explore more on these topicsMoneyFamily financesConsumer affairsInvestmentsMortgagesSavingsMortgage ratesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has more than 5,500 stores in 98 countries and an online presence in 116 more – from the US and UK to Zimbabwe and Uzbekistan.Zara, which has been worn by the Princess of Wales, Taylor Swift and,controversially, Melania Trump, was the first brand in the group and remains by far the biggest. It is budget friendly but not super cheap, drawing in shoppers with affordable tailoring and on-trend items, especially dresses – most famously the2019 polka dot viral dress.Ortega, who at 89 is still regularly seen at the head office chatting with staff, was a local clothing manufacturer who had worked his way up from being a delivery boy at a shirtmakers when he opened his first shop. He is now the 12th richest person in the world according to Forbes, with a net worth of about $120bn (£880m).View image in fullscreenZara’s first store in La Coruña, 1975.Photograph: Courtesy of ZaraMore than 160,000 people work for the company he founded, more than 5,000 of them at the Inditex HQ in Arteixo, a complex which includes the new, soon to be opened Zara head office. Together they helped ring up sales of €38.6bn (£33.3bn) last year and profits of €7.6bn.As the Guardian was given rare access to the building’s gleaming white corridors, staff whizzed past on electric scooters or even bikes to navigate the vast site.But as the company hits middle age, Inditex faces challenges. Sales growth slowed to 4.2% in the most recent quarter, a slowdown from 10.5% in the previous quarter.Like many other retailers, the company is reducing its overall store estate – with a net 136 stores closed in the past year.The slowdown comes only a few years after a changing of the guard at Inditex, when the founder’s daughter Marta Ortega Pérez stepped in as chair while former lawyer and banker Óscar García Maceiras became chief executive.Local boy García Maceiras, who joined in 2021 from Spain’s Banco Santander, is seen as an outsider with quite a lot to prove.When we meet in his spacious office, the conservatively dressed CEO, in tight-fitting blue suit and shirt, is bullish about the company with which he shares a 50th birthday year. “We remain very confident in our capability to keep on growing,” he says.View image in fullscreenFormer lawyer and banker Óscar García Maceiras became chief executive of Inditex in 2021.Photograph: Brais Lorenzo/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhile store numbers are reducing globally, the amount of space devoted to Inditex fashions around the world will increase by 5% this year as it shifts to ever larger outlets.In the UK, for example, next month Zara will reopen its doors at Manchester’s Trafford Centre with a store that is 40% bigger than before, while Pull & Bear is doubling the size of its outlet there. Meanwhile, Bershka will open its first store in Manchester.Bershka is also opening a new store in Glasgow this summer while Stradivarius, another Inditex brand, is opening there and near Newcastle later this year. The group is also looking for a site for The Apartment, a new concept that combines premium Zara clothing and , in a store laid out like a stylish influencer’s home. Right now there are only three in the world – in La Coruña, Paris and Madrid.View image in fullscreenThe Apartment shop floor.Photograph: ZaraThe UK expansion comes despite retailers’ warnings that a rise in taxes might depress new store openings and hit jobs.“We keep on considering the UK a very relevant and attractive market,” García Maceiras says.Similarly in the US, Inditex’s second-biggest market, he says the company will flex its supply base, which includes factories in 50 countries, to deal with whatever tariffs the Trump administration settles on. Inditex doesn’t use factories in the US or Americas at present – but García Maceiras doesn’t rule it out for the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if something is incredibly successful, it will never be reproduced exactly again.When the weather or the economic climate turns against them, most retailers must plough ahead with plans made more than six months in advance. At Inditex, every store receives a tailored assortment delivered twice a week. Local managers have considerable control over what flows into their stores – feeding back what is selling, and what customers are asking for.Its new larger stores are, meanwhile, designed to house an ever broadening array of products and services. That includes more premium product to tempt in a broader range of shoppers.The new stores are also given an upmarket feel, using material made from recycled ceramics that looks like marble, and split into departments to house sportswear, footwear and other growing categories.Technology is also helping lower costs and aiming to improve service. In Manchester, shoppers will be able to return or pick up goods bought online with a scan of a barcode thanks to robot-operated systems, while a new gadget will automatically sort unwanted items from the changing rooms.Many of the tills will automatically scan in basket loads of purchases with the use of smart radio-frequency tags.The group is also trying out different kinds of services including cafes, now in a handful of stores in Spain, Japan, South Korea and China.García Maceiras says constant change is the key to the business staying healthy into middle age. “This is a business in which you should take nothing for granted.”Explore more on these topicsZaraRetail industrySpainEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I fundamentally believe that.” I’m in Great Yarmouth for a long weekend, standing in the ring at theHippodrome circus, bristling from that particular crackle of energy you get from an empty stage. Ringmaster Jack Jay, the fourth generation in a family of impresarios, is fresh from his annual scouting trip in search of international acts to tread the boards in Norfolk: “We have artists whose CV reads ‘Macau, Las Vegas, Great Yarmouth’,” he tells me. “That’s the standard we aim to bring in.”The Hippodrome is a national treasure, one of only two purpose-built circuses left in the country (the other is part of Blackpool Tower, which Jack’s father also managed, briefly, in the 1980s). Founded in 1903 by equestrian George Gilbert, who ran off to join the circus aged 11, it’s an ornate building with art nouveau flourishes. But the real extravaganza is the sinking floor, restored by the Jays in 1979. Using original mechanisms, the ring is transformed into a pool with fountains and synchronised swimmers for the spectacular finale. I’ve seen the show countless times and it never loses its magic.View image in fullscreenA holiday in Yarmouth will undoubtedly involve a Jay-run establishment at some point. They have two majestic Edwardian cinemas, one of which,the Empire,recently reopened as a live music and comedy venue. And the Windmill, originally nicknamed the Palace of Light thanks to the electric bulbs that illuminated its facade, now contains one of the best crazy golf courses I’ve been to (I am something of a connoisseur), crammed full of cinema and theatre memorabilia.At this point I should add a disclaimer. I grew up on this stretch of coast and have always been Great Yarmouth’s biggest fan. My first jobs were in the caravan parks that dot the coastline, one of which employed every member of my family at some stage.View image in fullscreenThe Hippodrome, a rare purpose-built circus, was founded in 1903The town has always inspired me, from writing books about the maritime origins of our clothes toexhibitions about swimwear. But it has also given me an understanding of the precariousness of seasonal work and the generational impact on communities forced to deal with declining industries, from fishing and shipbuilding to leisure and tourism.While there is evidence of deprivation here, as there is in many coastal towns, there is also a strong sense of resilience. It’s a town with solid foundations, built on its twin pillars of fishing and fun.Winter Gardens is a magnificent seafront glasshouse with enough facets to rival a diamond. This marvel of Victorian engineering is due to reopen in 2027Celebrating this heritage is theIce House, which was recently transformed into the National Centre for Outdoor Arts and Circus by the Out There Arts charity, which runs the town’s annual circus festival. Built in the 19th century to store ice to transport fish, this unique thatched structure overlooking the River Yare has been converted into a training space and performance hub complete with pop-up cafe and bar.On our sunset walk along the promenade, my partner and I stroll past the Winter Gardens, a magnificent seafront glasshouse with enough facets to rival a diamond. Closed since 2008 and clad in hoardings, this marvel of Victorian engineering is due to reopen in 2027 and will house a cafe, exhibition and events space, and horticultural displays to mimic the floral interiors of the original.View image in fullscreen‘From the castle to the rocket ship, it is utterly entrancing,’ says Amber Butchart of Merrivale Model Village.Photograph: Josh Edgoose/The GuardianFor dinner, we head toCourtyard Italian Restaurantein the historic Rows, a tangle of narrow passageways that once formed the medieval heart of the town. The candlelit space is suitably intimate, with reservations lasting the whole evening so we can linger over our meal. The award-winning chef delivers generous portions of wild mushroom linguine. Sated and sleepy, we head to our hotel, the family-runAndover House. A restored Victorian building on a leafy side street, it is remarkably peaceful considering it’s just off the bustling stretch of promenade known as the Golden Mile.The next day, we rise early for a visit toMerrivale Model Village, a fixture since the 1960s. I visit Merrivale every time I’m in town because, from the castle to the rocket ship, I find it utterly entrancing. Like a regular town, if slightly unhinged, and tiny. And it comes complete with an excellent penny arcade, a fantastic tearoom and nine-hole crazy golf.From Neptune’s Kingdom to the Spook Express, Joyland plays out like a hallucinogenic history of the fairgroundThe fact that attractions such as this have not only survived but thrived is largely thanks to the flair and innovation of the travelling show folk who settled in coastal resorts such as Great Yarmouth in the mid-20th century.Joyland, a seafront institution since 1949, was established by Horace Cole, who married into a travelling show family. Inspired by this lineage, he created the Super Snails and Tyrolean Tub Twist, rides that are still going strong, run by the fourth generation of Coles. Crammed with colourful attractions, from Neptune’s Kingdom (1970s) to the Spook Express (1990s), it plays out like a hallucinogenic history of the fairground.When so much of our leisure industry is now corporatised, it’s refreshing to be in a town that is still dominated by family businesses. We head to the south end of the Golden Mile to visit thePleasure Beach, run by the same family since the 1950s, who also trace their roots back to travelling fairs. Rides range from traditional (dodgems and the Scenic Railway wooden rollercoaster, which opened in Yarmouth in 1932 and is one of only two left in the country, the other being in Margate’s Dreamland) to the white-knuckle terror of the Sky Drop, which catapults us 22 metres above the seafront before plummeting back down to the ground.View image in fullscreenYarmouth’s wooden rollercoaster opened in 1932.Photograph: Josh Edgoose/The GuardianAfter a turn on the Edwardian carousel (much more my pace), we stop for lunch atSara’s Tearoomsby the fortune-telling hut. Family-run since 1999, it prides itself on homemade fare, and Sara still bakes the cakes that you can eat on the beach terrace looking out to sea. We marvel at a gigantic sailing ship while I devour a perfect fish finger sandwich.Before fish fingers there were, of course, herrings. From the 11th century, the town’s fortunes were made by the “silver darlings” migrating down the coast, and the bloater – an ungutted, lightly smoked herring – became a Yarmouth speciality in the 1830s. A century later, sending a box of them as a holiday gift was as common as sending a postcard, with up to 5,000 crisscrossing the country every day.TheTime and Tide Museum, housed in a Victorian curing works, gives visitors a visceral feel for the process (the oak-smouldered aroma still lingers in the smokehouse stacks) and a sense of the scale of an industry that once exported pickled fish to Germany and Russia and smoked fish to the Mediterranean. It also chronicles the area’s story, from the last ice age to the town’s heyday as a booming seaside resort.View image in fullscreenDeckchairs for hire on Great Yarmouth’s huge beachPhotograph: Roger Green/Flickr VisionGreat Yarmouth’s herring traditions are also kept alive in theWhite Swan, where we head for dinner. A seafood restaurant with a fishmonger’s attached, it overlooks the river next to one of the medieval town wall towers. It was set up by local fisher Paul Williams, who has his own smokehouse and prepares bloaters, kippers and red herring in the original Yarmouth way. Shiplap-panelled walls strewn with netting and photographs of fishing fleets give it the convivial air of a beach hut. Highlights are oysters Rockefeller followed by hake with sea-kissed samphire and cockle veloute. We vow to return in the autumn for bloater season.Sunday morning starts with a wander through theVenetian Waterways, at the calmer north end of the seafront. Developed in the 1920s as a work scheme for unemployed men, it was designed to mimic the canals and bridges of Venice, albeit on a much smaller scale. The Waterways were recently restored as part of a seven-acre park with ornamental gardens, and include a boating lake which is home to swans, occasional herons and pedalos for hire.We round off our weekend with lunch at thePier Hotelin nearby Gorleston, enjoying Cromer crab and sweet cured herrings with a sea view. The coastline here is glorious: miles of wide, sandy beaches, tufted with marram grass and rippled with dunes. Looking out to people paddling in the waves, I recall ringmaster Jack’s words: “It’s like a pilgrimage. Even if you only go once, you should go on holiday to Great Yarmouth.”The trip was provided byvisitgreat yarmouth.co.uk.

Where the anxious and the uncertain might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in aseemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re in China,DeepSeek.To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do. Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young Chinese areturning to ancient forms of divinationto find out what the future holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongsidexuanxue,or spiritualism. The trend makes sense:China’s economy is struggling, and although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper than other forms of retail therapy oran actual therapist. With a deep-rooted culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.View image in fullscreenFortune telling sticks, orqiuqian, in a Beijing bar.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianThis week, I decided to join them.Myxuanxuehaunt of choice is Qie Le, a newly opened bar in Beijing’s wealthy Chaoyang district. On a Thursday evening, the bar, adorned with yellow Taoist talismans and draped translucent curtains, is quiet. All the better for hogging the fortune-teller’s attention with questions from my deep wells of narcissism. But Wan Mo, either because of her spiritual intuition or because I am not the first self-involved millennial to seek her services, sees me coming a mile off. It’s strictly one question per drink bought.Wan Mo, a stylish 36-year-old dressed in a loose white Tang-style jacket fastened with traditional Chinese knots, specialises inqiuqian,or Chinese lottery sticks. The practice involves shaking a cylindrical wooden container full of wooden sticks, while focusing on a question in your mind. Eventually, one of the sticks, engraved with text and numerals, falls out, and a fortune-teller can interpret the answer.Qiuqiandates back to the Jin dynasty (AD266 to AD420) and has survived centuries of war, upheaval,a Cultural Revolutionand the rise of artificial intelligence to remain a stalwart of Taoist temples, and now, Beijing cocktail bars.So I’m hoping thatqiuqianwill be well placed to answer my first question: Will AI take my job?“Use both hands,” Wan Mo says firmly. She is a no-nonsense savant. “Focus on your question.” She tells me that as a foreigner, my connection with the sticks might not be as profound as a Chinese person’s. So I need to “think carefully”.After a few seconds of focused yet vigorous shaking, not one but two sticks drop on to the table between us.Wan Mo studies the first one. “This stick means that later on, AI will have an impact on your job … even though you’re very talented, you can’t compete with its scale. For example, if you write one article, it can write 10. It will definitely affect you.”View image in fullscreenQie Le, a newly opened bar in Beijing’s wealthy Chaoyang district.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianThis is not the spiritual salve I was hoping for. Wan Mo tells me that the second stick even provides a timeline for my professional redundancy. “It says that within one to three years, there won’t be a major impact. But after three years, AI will become a major force.”The spiritual economy: young Chinese turn to fortune tellers as anxiety about the future risesRead moreWan Mo’s predictions don’t leave me full of hope for my next question. But in the spirit ofxuanxue,I decide to try my luck again, and order another round. We take a brief break for Wan Mo to have a cigarette break and catch up with a friend who has wandered into the bar. His chipper demeanour makes me think that he is yet to discover that AI will take his job – or he’s just made his peace with it.Eventually I muster up enough liquid courage to ask my second question. Wan Mo’s stern demeanour sends a slight chill through my hands as I grasp theqiuqianbox for the second time. Shake, shake, shake. Think, think, think. A single wooden stick falls out of the container.“Will I get a pay rise?” I ask, tentatively. The answer comes unnervingly quickly.“There’s not much possibility at the moment. Although [the stick] is about transition … it shows there is no major change … There is some hope, but it’s not immediate. You need to make some personal adjustments.”I ask what kind of personal adjustments I could make, hoping that she won’t make me order another drink to find out.View image in fullscreenThe fortune table at Qie Le in Beijing.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The Guardian“If you want a pay rise,xuanxuecan only offer support,” she demurs. “For example, the bracelet I’m wearing is for attracting wealth. It’s made from natural materials … we’d recommend wearing something like this. It can help bring in some financial luck and may have a positive effect. But the most important thing is still communicating with the superiors.”I am not sure if she means my spiritual or editorial superiors. But with that my time is up. Wan Mo’s friend says that everyone comes to Qie Le with the same kinds of questions: how to get rich, stay healthy, find love. I feel as if all I’ve discovered is how dim my chances are on the first question, and it’s getting too late to ask the second and third. I slink off home to get some sleep before my early start the next day. I bet AI doesn’t have to worry about feeling tired.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it appears that the alchemical code has finally been cracked.There are six specific attributes needed to be cool, according toa studypublished this week by the American Psychological Association.It found that cool people are generally perceived to be extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open and autonomous, according to the survey of 6,000 participants from 12 countries including the USA, Australia and South Africa.So what does a cool person make of it?Chris Black, the co-host ofthe podcast How Long Gone(which is cool) and the founder of Done to Death Projects, a brand consultancy with fashion clients including Stüssy (also very cool), says that while the traits are “relatively accurate” for him, cool is something that cannot be easily outlined. “The je ne sais quoi of the whole thing has always been what I associate with cool,” he says.Does Black like being described as cool? “It’s become a pretty general word. I don’t think it has the sort of gravitas that it once had. There are things I don’t embody that I think make people cool. So it’s tough to think of yourself as it, no matter how much you want it.”Philippa Snow, a writer and cultural critic whose latest book,It’s Terrible the Things I Have to Do to Be Me, explores female celebrities and the price of femininity, says trying to define cool is similar to defining charisma. “Like the famous quote about pornography, it’s tempting to say about both that you know it when you see it.”Some suggest that sprezzatura, an Italian word first used about by Baldassare Castiglione in 1528 and defined as “a certain nonchalance, to conceal all art and make what one does or say appear to be without effort” captures the earliest essence of what cool is.Cool as a characterisation originated from 1940s jazz culture, when the black musician Lester Young challenged racial norms by refusing to smile when performing. He also used fashion as a marker of defiance, wearing sunglasses indoors on stage. Not long after he coined the slang term “that’s cool”, his fans began to use it when referencing him.View image in fullscreenCharli xcx, performing at Glastonbury in June, is still considered cool – despite describing herself as such.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APProfJoel Dinerstein, who has taught a course called The History of Cool at Tulane University, Louisiana, for more than 25 years, says the terms he associates with cool people are “rebellious” and “charismatic”, flagging that another key quality is self-authorisation.For Black, whose line of work is based around finding cool people to partner with brands, someone “being comfortable with who they are and what they say” is his “real baseline for coolness”. His criteria also includes someone “being very, very good at what they do”, saying it “shows a level of dedication and self-respect that I think is deeply cool”.While Pierre Bourdieu’s 1970s concept of cultural capital is not directly a theory on coolness, cultural and social assets both play into the notion of cool. Nowadays, social media means being cool is often less about a person and more about an aesthetic that can be carefully curated. Unlike a person, however, as soon as an item becomes mainstream, it is generally no longer deemed cool. SeeLabubusandStanley cups.Conversely, Brat – the cultural phenomenon unleashed by Charli xcx a full year ago – is still considered cool. AtGlastonbury, she did something that typically a cool person would never do – describing herself as cool. “Thank you so much, you’re fucking cool as fuck.

How wrong I wasTim DowlingSat 5 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareOn a weekend afternoon, with the temperature nudging 30C, my wife and I take the dog for a walk. Neither of us wants to go, so we go together, and agree to keep it short.“Oh no,” my wife says when we get to the park. I look across the open expanse and see what she sees.“Picnics,” I say. Under every tree, in every square foot of available shade, people are sitting on blankets with food spread in front of them.“An absolute minefield,” my wife says. “I should have thought of this.”To be fair, the dog has never disrupted a picnic in progress, causing the sort of mayhem my wife and I are both very good at imagining. That’s because the dog has never been allowed anywhere near a picnic.We keep the dog on the lead until we are safely across some baked playing fields, taking a wide route that affords no shade and makes the walk twice as long as we’d anticipated.When we get home, drained and listless, I find the tortoise on his back in the garden again, legs flapping helplessly. Like the summer heat, the tortoise going upside down used to be a once-every-four-years event, but this is the second time it’s happened in six weeks. I think: how careless can one animal be? I set the tortoise back on his feet, and promptly step on a rake.To be fair, I was heading for the rake on purpose – it was leaning against the house and I was intending to put it away. But as I approach I fail to notice the tines are facing outward, and put my foot on them. The handle flies past my outstretched fingers and thwacks me in the face.The handle flies past my outstretched fingers and thwacks me in the face. Slapstick really is the purest form of humiliation“Ow,” I say, feeling my upper lip, which has already begun to swell. Flinging the rake into the bushes by the back door, I am reminded that slapstick is the purest form of humiliation – simple and total. I resolve to tell no one about this episode.“I just stepped on a rake, like in a cartoon,” I say to the middle one five minutes later.“Really?” he says, not looking up from his laptop.“A once-in-a-lifetime act of stupidity,” I say, although I recall the same thing happening to me about three years ago. At least it was dark that time.“I guess the lesson is, put the rake away,” he says.“I was putting the rake away,” I say.The next morning my wife suggests a walk in a place she is sure will be free of picnics. “And it’s on the way to the dump,” she says.We drive to a car park at the very edge of the borough, alongside a remote skateboard park patronised exclusively by men over 30.“What’s that about?” my wife says.“Dunno,” I say. “Some restraining order-based initiative, maybe.”Beyond the skate park lies a small, empty field, recently mowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But in front of us we can only see a couple of acres. We cross the field to a line of trees and follow a narrow path overgrown with brambles and nettles, emerging at a gurgling stream spanned by an improvised bridge of garbage: an old tyre, a partially burnt log and two of those long rubber feet used to support temporary fencing.“What now?” I say.“We cross,” my wife says.Beyond the stream we find a vast space reclaimed by wilderness: stubby trees, wildflowers, wetlands full of ducks and herons.We can see nothing beyond this oasis but tall buildings in the distance. There are no other people. The dog zips through the tall grass, leaving zigzagged indentations.“It’s amazing,” my wife says.“And so handy for the dump,” I say.Back at home, the dog stretches out on the cool kitchen floor, exhausted. I go to open the garden door, only to find it jammed. The handle of the rake is leaning against it on the other side, wedged into the corner of the glass pane, holding it shut.I think: this rake really has it in for me. I force the door open a few inches and squeeze past.At the other end of the rake I find the tortoise, his back leg trapped between two tines. Evidently he was ambling past, caught his foot and pulled the rake over against the door.“I can’t help feeling this is partly my fault,” I say, freeing his trapped foot. The tortoise gives me a look that says: this is all your fault.I guess the lesson is, put the rake away.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump claimed – without any serious evidence – that the edit of the interview betrayed bias against him.60 Minutes journalists countered – and nearly all other observers agreed – that it was just standard editing, common to all major interview segments.So then why settle? The key may lie with the fact that the super-wealthy Redstone family, which owns Paramount, is seeking to gain approval fromTrump administrationregulators for an $8bn deal to sell Paramount to the movie studio Skydance – a deal in which they stand to profit with a $2.4bn payday.Paramount opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chiefBob Corn-Revere of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression“Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chief,” said lawyer Bob Corn-Revere of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.No wonder Sanders was mad. He has warned that the Paramount deal “will only embolden” Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which the US president has repeatedly labeled “the enemy of the people”. It was, Sanders said, a “dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press”.View image in fullscreenBernie Sanders speaks during a stop in the Fighting the Oligarchy tour in McAllen, Texas, 20 June 2025.Photograph: Joel Martinez/APMany would agree. For as Trump’s second presidency has unfolded amid chaos, vast cuts to government spending and a rollback of civil liberties, his repeated and blistering attacks on the press have been one of the things most worrying those who fear for America’s democratic health.Former CBS anchor slams Paramount settlement with Trump: ‘It was a sellout’Read moreThe US media is now in a deep crisis of the sort that observers of creeping autocracy in places such as Hungary might find familiar. For the Paramount deal is not alone. The settlement follows another, six months ago, when Disney – which ownsABCNews – put to bed a legal claim over how George Stephanopoulos, one of its top news anchors, described the president’s sexual assault of the magazine writer E Jean Carroll. Again, the payment was $16m.He is even pursuing a legal claim against a relatively tiny newspaper for printing a poll he didn’t like: Trump’s lawsuit against the Iowa pollster Ann Selzer accuses her and the Des Moines Register of fraud, after she conducted a poll right before the 2024 election that showed Kamala Harris leading in Iowa, a state which she did not ultimately win.Last week the Trump administration also threatened legal action against no less a news giant thanCNN, over its reporting on an app that warns users of nearby immigration enforcement agents. As the administration continues its mass deportation efforts, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said her department and the Department of Justice are now examining the idea of prosecuting the network.View image in fullscreenKristi Noem watches Donald Trump speaking off frame to journalists as they arrive at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on 4 July 2025.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images“We’re working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them,”Noem said of CNN, “because what they’re doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities and operations. We’re going to actually go after them and prosecute them. What they’re doing is illegal.”Trump then added, seemingly for good measure, that he believed the network’s reporting on the success – or lack thereof – of the US bombing on Iran could also be examined. “Our people have to be celebrated, [and] not come home to ‘What do you mean we didn’t hit the targets?’” Then he crystallised his entire approach: “You have scum. CNN is scum. MSDNC [his insult for MSNBC] is scum. The New York Times is scum. They’re bad people. They’re sick.”But if Trump is determined to wage a fierce crackdown on the press in the US, in some high-profile quarters it has been met with a distinct lack of resistance – especially from news organizations whose owners are billionaires or large corporations, keenly aware of Trump’s control of the nation’s regulators and their power to make or break a company’s fortunes.Indeed, while the legal settlements with Trump represent a compromise of press freedoms, they may also represent an economic reality: that news outlets are more of a curse than a blessing to the multibillion-dollar media corporations that own them.A generation ago this would have seemed an outrageous story in the history of journalismBob Thompson of Syracuse UniversityThe billionaire owners of both theLos Angeles Timesand the Washington Post – the biotech mogul Patrick Soon-Shiong and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, respectively – have conspicuously moved their once-powerful newspapers closer to Trump and his Maga movement. Their opinion sections, both once fierce havens for Trump critics, have been the subject of particular attention by their owners – and the outraged resignation letters of staff have appeared to make little impact.“A generation ago this would have seemed an outrageous story in the history of journalism,” said Bob Thompson, a media professor at Syracuse University.Not now in Trump’s America. It is a two-pronged spear: even as Trump and his administration have launched an unprecedented attack, at the same time significant parts of the US media have seen its owners and power brokers often fold their hands.The head of Reporters Without Borders, Clayton Weimers,said: “A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom, and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.”Jameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said: “Calling these ‘settlements’ doesn’t quite capture what’s happening. It’s more like surrender – or even payoff.”The Trump administration has even signaled precisely that. Brendan Carr, Trump’s handpicked chair for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – which holds the reins over whether the Redstone family gets its $2.4bn payday – said in an interview last year that “the news distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction”, referring to the Paramount-Skydance deal.The Democratic party, without power and shouting from the sidelines, is furious. The leftwing Massachusetts senatorElizabeth Warrenon Wednesday called for an investigation into the Paramount settlement.Trump team threatens to prosecute CNN over reporting on Ice-tracking appRead more“With Paramount folding toDonald Trumpat the same time the company needs his administration’s approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight,” Warren said in a statement.The settlement, she said, exposed “a glaring need for rules to restrict donations to sitting presidents’ libraries” – referring to the Trump entities that both ABC and CBS said their settlement payments would be directed – and added that “the Trump administration’s level of sheer corruption is appalling, and Paramount should be ashamed of putting its profits over independent journalism”.In May, Warren, Sanders and their fellow senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to the Paramount CEO, Shari Redstone, cautioning her that “under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act”.But prosecutors in the state of Delaware, where Paramount is incorporated, appear unlikely to open an investigation.Perhaps most chilling has been Trump’s ongoing attack on theAssociated Press, the news agency that is generally relied on to announce the winners and losers of individual elections, up to and including the presidency. When Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico renamed to “Gulf of America”, and the AP continued to use both names – noting that the rest of the world still uses the original – Trump jumped on it as a pretext to ban AP reporters from the White House.The AP has sued, but whatever the result, Trump’s attempt to undermine the impartiality credentials of an organisation that is crucial to letting the American people know who their next president is may prove even more dangerous in the long run. And while AP remains banned, official coverage of White House activities has been opened to various new media individuals and groups with no history of impartial journalism at all, and who appear to be selected entirely for their willingness to ask Trump sycophantic questions.The political and legal assault could hardly have come at a worse time for American journalism, either, which is assailed by economic headwinds that would be challenging even under a more friendly administration. Scores of once healthy and powerful regional newspapers and television stations have declined or closed. News deserts have appeared all over the country.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump departs the White House for visit to Alligator Alcatraz, Florida, on 1 July 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBig TV names – such as CNN and its rival MSNBC – are being jettisoned by the owners that once provided a safe haven for them, and few expect the good economic times to return as the rise of social media giants and artificial intelligence chokes off advertising and revenue streams for a public increasingly sceptical of mainstream media.Meanwhile, some of the fresh new digital startups that were meant to take their place have either shrunk themselves or been axed. Names such as BuzzFeed, HuffPost and Vice News that were once darlings of the digital media world are pale shadows of their former selves, unlikely to provide any sort of bulwark against Trump while mired in economic difficulties. One of the few booming parts of the US media landscape? Fox News, the Trump-boosting conservative channel owned byRupert Murdochand his family.“Part of the various crises in journalism, from the business model to the interference of an aggressive presidential administration, is that so much of journalism are in fact little compartments in huge corporate entities for whom the standards of American journalism, the first amendment, the obligation to inform the citizenry in a republic, are not at the top of their priorities,” Thompson said.“It’s no surprise that we would have constant conflicts of interest when news organisations are owned by enormous, multivalent corporations that have got a lot of other interests besides telling the truth in journalism.”In this world, the Trump administration’s role in the crisis of US journalism is not as singular villain, but as just one more factor in an area of American civic life that was already deeply ailing and standing near the edge of a cliff. Trump and his allies have just started pushing it closer.“As it collapses before our very eyes, we might be surprised that it didn’t happen a long time ago,” Thompson said."

But it comes as airlines fall into line behind a new EU guaranteed bag size of 40cm by 30cm by 15cm. The current dimensions of the Ryanair free carry-on limit are 40cm by 25cm by 20cm – below the EU rule. It is increasing them to 40cm by 30cm by 20cm.Ryanair trumpets this is “bigger than the EU standard”. It says the change “will be implemented over the coming weeks, as our airport bag sizers are adjusted”.View image in fullscreenRyanair passengers can add a larger cabin bag to a flight booking for £6 to £36 by buying a priority package.Photograph: Wiskerke/AlamyThe size change represents a 20% increase in volume and means Ryanair will be accepting free bags one-third bigger than the new EU minimum.But that is the only aspect of Ryanair’s baggage policy that is changing. If you get it wrong and a gate check reveals the bag is oversized you will pay a fee of £60. A larger cabin bag can be added to a flight booking for £6 to £36 depending on the route but, again, if it is deemed too large at the airport it will cost £75 to stow.Will other airlines change their luggage rules, too?Some won’t have do anything. Rival budget airline easyJet, for example, already allows a more generous free underseat bag. Wizz Air’s current free bag policy is the same as the one that Ryanair is moving to.The airline association Airlines for Europe (A4E) says its 28 members have started applying the bag dimensions which were agreed by EU transport ministers last month.“This will bring more clarity to passengers across Europe,” says its managing director, Ourania Georgoutsakou. “From city-hoppers to family travellers, everyone will benefit from the same clear rule across our members’ networks.”Standardising cabin-bag rules has been on the Brussels agenda for years with the decision to settle on a size enabling frequent travellers to buy one piece of luggage that will be accepted by multiple airlines.All A4E airlines will be following the bag rule by the end of the 2025 summer season, it says, adding that “carriers will continue to permit larger personal items at their discretion”.Aren’t hand baggage fees being abolished anyway?Not yet, but they could be.European consumer groupsare calling on EU lawmakers to investigate budget airlines for “exploiting consumers” by charging for hand luggage.In May, BEUC, an umbrella group for 44 consumer organisations, called for Brussels to investigate seven airlines, including Ryanair,easyJetand Wizz Air for this. BEUC director general Agustín Reyna said the airlines were “ignoring the EU top court who ruled that charging [for] reasonably sized hand baggage is illegal”.View image in fullscreenWizz Air is following other airlines in being investigated in Spain for charging passengers for hand luggage and seat reservations.Photograph: Marek Slusarczyk/AlamyThe organisation was referring to a EU court of justiceruling in 2014that said the “carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions”.In the meantime, Spain has become a battleground for the issue. Last year, its consumer affairs ministryfined five carriers, including Ryanair, a total of €179m(£150m) for charging passengers for hand luggage and seat reservations. Now low-cost carrier Wizz Air is being investigated, too.Will charges be banned?Ryanair’s chief executive,Michael O’Leary,says no. He is dismissive of the Spanish effort, recently telling the Guardian the country has a “mad minister who’s decided that as General Franco passed some law 30 years before Spain joined the EU, passengers are free to bring as much baggage as they want.”A Spanish court has now temporarily suspended the fines on three of the airlines (including Ryanair) while the matter is under judicial review, after a legal challenge.To complicate matters further, last month thetransport committeeof the European parliament voted to give passengers the right to an extra piece of free hand luggage weighing up to 7kg.Under the new rule, travellers could bring one cabin bag measuring up to 100cm (based on the sum of the dimensions) on board their flight, as well a personal bag, at no additional cost. (MEPs also want children under 12 years old to be seated next to their accompanying passenger free of charge.)The proposed law requires approval from 55% of EU member states, but if adopted after the negotiations due to start this month, would extend to all flights within the EU, as well as routes to and from the EU.The airline industry is predictably opposed, stating that the cost of the bag will be folded into overall prices, pushing up fares.“Europe’s airline market is built on choice,” Georgoutsakou says. “Forcing a mandatory trolley bag strips passengers of that choice and obliges passengers to pay for services they may not want or need. What’s next? Mandatory popcorn and drinks as part of your cinema ticket?“The European parliament should let travellers decide what services they want, what services they pay for and, importantly, what services they don’t,” she says.Explore more on these topicsRyanairFlightsConsumer affairsAirline industryTravel & leisureexplainersShareReuse this content"

Just one is from South Sudan. All have been convicted of serious crimes, which the Trump administration has emphasized in justifying their banishment. Many had either finished or were close to finishing serving sentences, and had “orders of removal” directing them to leave the US.A lawyer for the men have said they could “face perilous conditions” upon arriving in the country. South Sudan is enmeshed in civil war, and the US government advises no one should travel there before making their own funeral arrangements.The administration has been trying to deport the immigrants for weeks. The government flew them to the US naval base in Djibouti but couldn’t move them further because Murphy had ruled no immigrant could be sent to a new country without a chance to have a court hearing.Jennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the Seattle Clemency Project who represents the migrants, called the ruling disappointing.“Both courts’ decisions today have denied them their opportunity to have these claims heard and to protect their own lives,” she said. “That is what is so tragic about where we came out.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationSouth SudanAfricaUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Authorities had previously accused him and other suspects of being near the Bogotá park whereMiguel Uribe Turbay was shoton 7 June.Uribe was giving a political speech in the park when he was attacked from behind and wounded in the head, allegedly by a minor who was captured as he fled. Three other people have been arrested for participating in the logistics and execution of the crime. The motive is still being investigated.View image in fullscreenElder José Arteaga Hernandez (alias El Costeño) on Saturday after his arrest in Bogotá.Photograph: Colombian Police/AFP/Getty ImagesUribe, who in October announced his intention to run in the 2026 presidential election, remains in intensive care and has undergone several surgeries. From his senate seat, he had become one of president Gustavo Petro’s most vocal critics.The attack has been widely condemned in a country with a dark past in which drug cartels and insurgent groups murdered and kidnapped politicians.Charges against Arteaga include attempted aggravated homicide; manufacturing, trafficking and carrying firearms or ammunition; and using minors to commit crimes. Interpol issued a red notice against him on Friday.It was not immediately clear if Arteaga had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. Authorities said he would make his first court appearance over the weekend.Triana last month said Arteaga “has been involved in a life of crime for more than 20 years, performing hit jobs in all types of crimes in Bogotá”.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Where the anxious and the uncertain might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in aseemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re in China,DeepSeek.To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do. Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young Chinese areturning to ancient forms of divinationto find out what the future holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongsidexuanxue,or spiritualism. The trend makes sense:China’s economy is struggling, and although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper than other forms of retail therapy oran actual therapist. With a deep-rooted culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.View image in fullscreenFortune telling sticks, orqiuqian, in a Beijing bar.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianThis week, I decided to join them.Myxuanxuehaunt of choice is Qie Le, a newly opened bar in Beijing’s wealthy Chaoyang district. On a Thursday evening, the bar, adorned with yellow Taoist talismans and draped translucent curtains, is quiet. All the better for hogging the fortune-teller’s attention with questions from my deep wells of narcissism. But Wan Mo, either because of her spiritual intuition or because I am not the first self-involved millennial to seek her services, sees me coming a mile off. It’s strictly one question per drink bought.Wan Mo, a stylish 36-year-old dressed in a loose white Tang-style jacket fastened with traditional Chinese knots, specialises inqiuqian,or Chinese lottery sticks. The practice involves shaking a cylindrical wooden container full of wooden sticks, while focusing on a question in your mind. Eventually, one of the sticks, engraved with text and numerals, falls out, and a fortune-teller can interpret the answer.Qiuqiandates back to the Jin dynasty (AD266 to AD420) and has survived centuries of war, upheaval,a Cultural Revolutionand the rise of artificial intelligence to remain a stalwart of Taoist temples, and now, Beijing cocktail bars.So I’m hoping thatqiuqianwill be well placed to answer my first question: Will AI take my job?“Use both hands,” Wan Mo says firmly. She is a no-nonsense savant. “Focus on your question.” She tells me that as a foreigner, my connection with the sticks might not be as profound as a Chinese person’s. So I need to “think carefully”.After a few seconds of focused yet vigorous shaking, not one but two sticks drop on to the table between us.Wan Mo studies the first one. “This stick means that later on, AI will have an impact on your job … even though you’re very talented, you can’t compete with its scale. For example, if you write one article, it can write 10. It will definitely affect you.”View image in fullscreenQie Le, a newly opened bar in Beijing’s wealthy Chaoyang district.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The GuardianThis is not the spiritual salve I was hoping for. Wan Mo tells me that the second stick even provides a timeline for my professional redundancy. “It says that within one to three years, there won’t be a major impact. But after three years, AI will become a major force.”The spiritual economy: young Chinese turn to fortune tellers as anxiety about the future risesRead moreWan Mo’s predictions don’t leave me full of hope for my next question. But in the spirit ofxuanxue,I decide to try my luck again, and order another round. We take a brief break for Wan Mo to have a cigarette break and catch up with a friend who has wandered into the bar. His chipper demeanour makes me think that he is yet to discover that AI will take his job – or he’s just made his peace with it.Eventually I muster up enough liquid courage to ask my second question. Wan Mo’s stern demeanour sends a slight chill through my hands as I grasp theqiuqianbox for the second time. Shake, shake, shake. Think, think, think. A single wooden stick falls out of the container.“Will I get a pay rise?” I ask, tentatively. The answer comes unnervingly quickly.“There’s not much possibility at the moment. Although [the stick] is about transition … it shows there is no major change … There is some hope, but it’s not immediate. You need to make some personal adjustments.”I ask what kind of personal adjustments I could make, hoping that she won’t make me order another drink to find out.View image in fullscreenThe fortune table at Qie Le in Beijing.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The Guardian“If you want a pay rise,xuanxuecan only offer support,” she demurs. “For example, the bracelet I’m wearing is for attracting wealth. It’s made from natural materials … we’d recommend wearing something like this. It can help bring in some financial luck and may have a positive effect. But the most important thing is still communicating with the superiors.”I am not sure if she means my spiritual or editorial superiors. But with that my time is up. Wan Mo’s friend says that everyone comes to Qie Le with the same kinds of questions: how to get rich, stay healthy, find love. I feel as if all I’ve discovered is how dim my chances are on the first question, and it’s getting too late to ask the second and third. I slink off home to get some sleep before my early start the next day. I bet AI doesn’t have to worry about feeling tired.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So the state returning to the polls on 19 July shouldn’t be much of a surprise.While the parties will be hoping for a more enduring result, it’s again unlikely either major partywill be given a majority.AYouGov pollpublished on 30 June gave Labor 34% of the vote with the Liberals on 31%, Greens on 13% and other parties and independents on 22%. That outcome would represent a five-point improvement for Labor compared with the 2024 election, and would probably make it the largest party in parliament, but still without an overall majority.Tasmania’s lower house is elected using the proportional Hare-Clark system. There are five electorates, each with seven members. Parties run up to seven candidates in each electorate, with candidates grouped by party.The order of the candidates’ names is randomised on different ballot papers, rather than the parties deciding on the order. This produces competition between candidates in the same party, and on occasion, sitting MPs lose their seats to a member of their own party. Parties usually win a share of seats that is close to their share of the overall vote.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe 2024 election produced a parliament of 14 Liberals, 10 Labor, five Greens, threeJacqui LambieNetwork (JLN) members and three independent MPs. The three JLN members were largely unheard of and had not worked together before, and it was unclear what they wanted to achieve by agreeing to support the government.With 18 MPs needed for a majority in the parliament, the incumbent Liberal government continued in office after signing deals with the JLN and another member, but found it hard to work with them.The JLN members also struggled to work as a bloc, with Lambie sometimes intervening from her federal office. The JLN members split in late 2024, with Miriam Beswick and Rebekah Pentland leaving the party and continuing to support the government, while Andrew Jenner continued as a JLN member while not supporting the government.View image in fullscreenLabor leader Dean Winter concludes the two-day debate on the motion of no confidence in Tasmania premier Jeremy Rockliff in state parliament in Hobart on 5 June 2025.Photograph: Ben Mckay/AAPThe Liberal government has continued to have trouble with the crossbench since this split. A motion of no confidence forced the deputy premier, Michael Ferguson, to resign from the ministry after losing the support of a key independent. By early 2025, it was clear that there were likely to be enough votes on the crossbench to pass a motion of no confidence if supported by Labor. But for some time Labor was reluctant to give the government the nudge it needed to collapse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Labor opposition moved a motion of no confidence, which passed and thus triggered a the state election.The JLN will not be contesting this time, creating a vacuum for voters who don’t like the Liberal government but don’t want to vote for Labor or the Greens. TheNational partywill be hoping to fill that gap, but the position of the Nationals in a post-election negotiation is unclear, with two of the ex-JLN members who found themselves on opposing sides of that party’s split now both running for the Nationals.In Tasmania, neither the Liberals nor Labor seem to comprehend the reality of minority government | Kate CrowleyRead moreSupport for the major parties remains very low in Tasmania, which is likely to result in another hung parliament with a large crossbench. The major parties have struggled to share power and both are reluctant to do deals. Labor and the Greens have a particularly difficult relationship, which means Labor will be reluctant to take government if it would mean relying on the Greens for a majority.For Labor, the best-case scenario is probably a hung parliament where they have the choice of working with the Greens or other crossbenchers to form government and pass legislation.There is a history in Tasmania of Labor-Liberal swing voters moving towards whichever major party has the best chance of governing without requiring crossbench support. Those voters have favoured the Liberals in recent elections, but Labor will be hoping to gain them this time.Explore more on these topicsTasmanian politicsTasmaniaJacqui LambieLabor partyLiberal partyNational partyAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Formed by a syndicate of charities, Goodstart Early Learning is the biggest not-for-profit operator in Australia, with about 660 centres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Collectively, they control about 10% of the sector.In 2024, G8 reported a $67.7m net profit, up more than 20% from the prior year. Affinity is owned by Quadrant Private Equity.G8 had been enjoying a period of strong returns before the allegations of child sexual abuse appear to have sparked a share selloff due to investor concerns that parents may opt for a different childcare centre provider.The federal government has also threatened to cut payments to centres not up to standard.James Alexander, from the Sustainable Investment Exchange, said companies with shareholders tend to be primarily motivated by profit.“It would be too much of a generalisation to say the for-profit sector is broken,” said Alexander, who haspreviously criticisedG8 staffing arrangements.“A for-profit entity in charge of vulnerable members of the community, such as kids or the elderly, should go beyond the minimum legal requirements for checking the suitability of staff.”Some previous attempts to maximise profit in the childcare sector have not ended well.The listed ABC Learning Centres famously built a network of about 3,000 centres across Australia, New Zealand and the US before collapsing under a heavy debt load at the height of the global financial crisis.Explore more on these topicsChildcare AustraliaBusinessSuperannuationVictoriaMelbournenewsShareReuse this content"

Ábalos and García are also under investigation and have denied wrongdoing. Cerdán, who stepped down from his party role and resigned his parliamentary seat shortly after the news broke, has vowed to clear his name.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A former PSOE member was also recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil unit investigating the corruption allegations.The PP said the latest allegations were further proof of the prime minister’s poor judgment and his unfitness to lead the country.“He has no credibility and his supposed fight against corruption and sexism is mere posturing,” PP sources said on Saturday. “Sánchez is as good at being prime minister as he is at talent-spotting. Either there aren’t many decent people in his party or he’s not very good at choosing people who deserve to be in Spanish politics.”Calls for a fresh election are also beginning to bubble up within some sections of the socialist party. Emiliano García-Page, the PSOE president of the Castilla-La Mancha region, said the time had come to let parliament and the people have their say.According to elDiario, García-Page used Saturday’s party meeting to ask Sánchez to consider holding a confidence vote in parliament. “I don’t know if we’ll win it,”he said. “But if we don’t, then don’t rule out the option of calling an election.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As his plane approached the US, it felt as though the battle had hit home, as Sandberg worried that he would face reprisals over comments he had made during his travels to the French media on the future of research in the US.“It makes you think about what your status is as a researcher and the principle of academic freedom,” he said. “Things have really changed … The entire system of research and higher education in the United States is really under attack.”Soon after, he became one of the nearly 300 researchers to apply for a French university’sgroundbreaking offerof “scientific asylum”. Launched by Aix-Marseille University, the programme was amongthe firstin Europe to offer reprieve to researchers reeling from the US crackdown on academia, promising three years of funding for about 20 researchers.Last week, Sandberg was revealed as one of the 39 researchers shortlisted for the programme. “The American system is being destroyed at the moment,” he told the 80 reporters who turned up to meet the candidates. “I think a lot of people in the United States and as well as here inEuropehave not understood the level to which all of higher education is being targeted.”View image in fullscreenÉric Berton, the president of Aix-Marseille University, likened the programme to the US welcoming academics from France during the second world war.Photograph: Theo Giacometti/The GuardianAs reports began to emerge of funding freezes, cuts and executive orders targeting institutions across the Atlantic, institutions across Europesprang into action, announcing plans to lure US-based academics.At Aix-Marseille University,hundreds of applications came infrom researchers tied to institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, Nasa, Columbia, Yale and Stanford. Three months after they launched their programme – named Safe Place for Science – the university said it had received more than 500 inquiries.It was a glimpse of the “historic” moment the world was facing, said Éric Berton, the university’s president. “More than 80 years ago, asFrancewas under occupation and repression, America welcomed exiled researchers, offering them a helping hand and allowing them to keep science alive,” he said. “And now, in a sad reversal of history, some American scientists have arrived in France in search of a space for freedom, thought and research.”Last week, the university opened its doors, allowing reporters to meet a handful of the Americans who were in the final running to join the programme. As high-profile battles play out between universitiessuch as Harvardand the White House, all of them asked that their institutions not be named, citing concerns that their employers could face reprisals.Some declined to speak to the media, while others asked that their full names not be used, offering a hint of how the Trump administration’s actions are sowing anxiety among academics. “The worry is that we’ve already seen that scientists are being detained at the border. Granted they’re not US citizens, but they’re even saying now that if you speak out against the government, they will deport you,” said a biological anthropologist who asked to be identified only as Lisa. “And so I don’t need anything against me at the moment until I can officially move here with my family.”View image in fullscreenJames, a climate scientist, said he had mixed feelings about leaving the US for France.Photograph: Theo Giacometti/The GuardianTogether the researchers painted a picture of a profession that had beenplunged into uncertaintyas the US government slashes spending on research grants and dismantles the federal institutions that manage and hand out funding. Months into Trump’s second presidency, politics is increasingly blurring into academia as the government works to root out anything it deems as “wokeism” from the post-secondary world.“There’s a lot of censorship now, it’s crazy,” said Carol Lee, an evolutionary biologist, pointing to thelist of termsnow seen as off-limits in research grant applications. “There are a lot of words that we’re not allowed to use. We’re not allowed to use the words diversity, women, LGBTQ.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And China is laying out the red carpet. If people are getting an offer from Canada, people are moving to Canada.”For Lisa, the biological anthropologist, the reality of dismantling her life in the US and moving her husband, a schoolteacher, and their two kids across the Atlantic was starting to sink in. “It’s excitement, but it’s nerve-racking,” she said.She knew she had to get out when it became clear that Trump had won a second term. Months later, she has found a potential path to do so, but is still wrapping her head around all that taking part in Aix-Marseille University’s programme would entail.“It is a big pay cut,” she said. “My kids are super gung-ho. My husband is just worried that he won’t find a job. Which is my worry too, because I don’t think I’ll be able to afford four of us on my salary.”But for her, and several others on the shortlist, the view was that there were few other options. “It’s a very discouraging time to be a scientist,” said James, a climate researcher who asked that his full name not be used. “I feel America has always had a sort of anti-intellectual strain – it happens to be very ascendant right now. It’s a relatively small proportion that doesn’t trust scientists, but it’s unfortunately a very powerful segment.”His wife had also been shortlisted for the same programme in southern France, leaving the couple on the brink of uprooting the lives and careers they had spent decades building in the US. “I have very mixed feelings,” he said. “I’m very grateful that we’ll have the opportunity, but really quite sad that I need the opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsAcademicsDonald TrumpFranceHigher educationEuropeResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

Thirty years later it became established as the papal summer bolthole after undergoing renovations commissioned by Pope Urbano VIII, the first pontiff to holiday in the town in a quest to flee the stifling heat of Rome.The tradition continued almost uninterrupted until Francis, who tended to shun the Vatican’s pomp and privilege. He visited Castel Gandolfo on only three occasions, and all during the first months of his papacy – twice to preside over mass and once to see his predecessor, Benedict.View image in fullscreenThe Apostolic Palace in Castel Gandolfo.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Archivio Marco Piraccini/Marco Piraccini/Mondadori/GettyFrancis spent his summers in his humble Vatican abode. But he did help to transform Castel Gandolfo from a pilgrim site into more of a tourist destination after the papal palace became a museum in 2015. Visitors can wander through its Renaissance-era gardens and vast rooms, which contain garments worn by popes dating back to the 16th century, and marvel at the views over Lake Albano from the windows of the papal bedroom.“We did feel abandoned by Francis and the first few years were difficult,” said Maurizio Carosi, who with his son owns a bar and gift shop opposite the palace. “But now we’ve moved on from a pilgrim town to a tourist one – so even if Francis didn’t come, he gave us a spiritual charge.”The palace will remain a museum while Leo and his accompanying Swiss Guards reside in another newly renovated property within its grounds.View image in fullscreenThe Apostolic Palace gardens in Castel Gandolfo.Photograph: Sandro Barbagallo/Musei VaticaniThe excitement in the town is palpable as it prepares for the American pontiff’s arrival. Gardeners were preening the lawns within the palace on Friday morning while workers were putting the finishing touches to the pope’s holiday home and tidying up its tennis court so that Leo can indulge his passion for the game.As with pontiffs over history, the break will not only be about resting. Leo is expected to host audiences and rosaries for the local residents and carry out Vatican duties.View image in fullscreenPope John Paul II and George W Bush looking out over Lake Albano from Castel Gandolfo in 2001.Photograph: Arturo Mari/AP“Just because they’re on holiday, they don’t necessarily stop working,” said Tadeusz Rozmus, the parish priest of San Tommoso dal Villanova church. “Pope John Paul II wrote encyclicals here and others have hosted heads of state. Castel Gandolfo is a much more pleasant place for them to reside in summer as they can escape the heat of Rome, and with the way things are going, summers are only going to get hotter.”Alberto De Angelis, the mayor of Castel Gandolfo, has readily embraced the papal return, especially as it is expected to help fill the town’s coffers. “Knowing that Pope Leo has listened to the wishes of our community, which for years has been waiting to see a pope in its square, fills our hearts and souls with joy,” he wrote on social media.View image in fullscreenA view of the Pontiff's private apartments, now open to tourists as a museum.Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty ImagesThe town’s smattering of gift shops are yet to be filled with souvenirs featuring Leo’s image. “Everyone is asking for his image but I heard he doesn’t want to see his face on glasses, plates, candles or whatever,” Carosi said, claiming that whatever was being sold in Rome was bootleg. “Leo souvenirs have not been officially authorised.”Carosi was born in Castel Gandolfo and recalls popes of the past greeting people in the square and shaking hands.When it comes to Pope Leo, he said his character was “yet to be discovered”. “But I know he’ll be happy here,” he added. “He’ll have a view of the lake, will breathe the fresh air and will find himself among good people. Being an athletic pope, he will also have the possibility to enjoy long walks in the gardens.”Explore more on these topicsItalyPope Leo XIVThe papacyEuropePope FrancisCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

Four others were killed in the town of Bani Suheila, and three people were killed in three different strikes in the town of Khan Younis.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made no immediate comment on the attacks.Separately, two US contractors with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in the south of the territory after unknown assailants threw grenades at them at a food distribution site, the organisation said.The GHF, a US-supported private organisation that began handing out food parcels in Gaza last month, has been mired in controversy, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying it was “inherently unsafe” and that it was “killing people”. The GHF denies this, saying it has delivered tens of millions of meals in “safety and security”.On Saturday night the US state department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, blamed “Hamas terrorists” for the attack, adding in a post on X: “This act of violence against the people actually bringing relief to Gazans lays bare the depravity of Hamas.”Hundreds of Palestinianshave been killedin recent weeks in shooting or shelling by the IDF while travelling to GHF sites or gathering in large crowds to get aid from convoys brought into Gaza by the UN that are often stopped and looted.Aid workers in Gaza have called again for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that fuel stocks for NGOs are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, much of the health system and communications across the territory. Power supplies in Gaza rely primarily on large quantities of diesel for generators.“We are pretty much down to about half a day’s worth. When that is gone, everything has to shut down,” said one humanitarian worker in Deir al-Balah.Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade on Gaza after the most recent ceasefire collapsed in March, which has only been partly lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. No fuel has been permitted to enter, and supplies that still exist in Gaza are often in Israeli-controlled areas or combat zones and so inaccessible.Netanyahu is to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with the US president, Donald Trump, who has said in a series of social media posts that he wants the Gaza war to stop.A ceasefire in Gaza appears to be close. Here’s why it could happen nowRead moreDrafts of the proposed deal seen by the Guardian include a provision specifying that Trump would personally announce any ceasefire – possibly in the coming days during Netanyahu’s visit.However, sources close to Hamas said the organisation wants greater clarity over guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a permanent end to the war and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.There is also disagreement over who would be allowed to deliver the “sufficient aid” described in the draft. Hamas want the GHF to be closed down. Israel wants to maintain a system of distribution independent from the UN or other countries.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday, Trump said he was optimistic and suggested there “could be a Gaza deal” next week. But Israeli media have described a series of steps involving separate Israeli delegations flying to Qatar and Egypt to complete negotiations, and the current draft specifies that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s personal envoy, will travel to the Middle East to finalise the deal.Analysts said this could mean lengthy delays before an agreement is reached.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise Hamas-led attack into Israel in October 2023, during which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Fifty remain in Gaza, less than half still alive.Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The doctor has already run out of specialised formula meant for premature babies and is forced to use regular formula, rationing it between the infants under his care.“I can’t begin to describe how bad things are. Right now, we have enough formula for about one week. But we also have infants outside the hospital without any access to milk. It’s catastrophic,” al-Farra told the Guardian over the phone.Stocks of infant formula have dwindled inGazaas Israel has blocked all but a trickle of aid into the Palestinian territory. Food aid that comes through the controversial US-Israeli-backed private company Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) does not include infant formula, according to doctors.Hanaa al-Taweel, a 27-year-old mother of five living at al-Nuseirat refugee camp, said she was unable to breastfeed as she herself was not getting enough to eat. She has struggled to find infant formula for her 13-month-old child.“The problem of getting milk started since my son’s birth, as due to my malnutrition and general weakness I wasn’t able to breastfeed my baby,” al-Taweel said.View image in fullscreenTwenty-two-month-old Sham Qadeh struggling to survive with her mother in Khan Younis.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesDoctors have told her that her son is suffering from stunting due to malnutrition and she has noticed he was developing slower than her other children, who had already begun speaking and walking at his age.“I try to keep a small piece of bread next to me when he sleeps because he wakes up often asking for food. I feel sadness and fear for my children, I fear they will die from hunger, thirst and disease,” she said.Already 66 Palestinian children have starved to death since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, according to local health authorities.Amnesty International accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza, which it said was a tactic intended “to inflict genocide against Palestinians”.Cogat, the Israeli authority responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, said it does not restrict the entry of baby food, including formula, into the Gaza Strip. The agency added that more than 1,400 tons of baby food had been delivered to Gaza in recent weeks.Doctors entering Gaza have resorted to packing individual cans of infant formula in their personal luggage. On at least one occasion, Israeli authorities confiscated 10 cans of infant formula from the luggage of an American doctor recently entering Gaza for a medical mission.“In the end they confiscated all the cans of baby formula, which was specifically formula for pre-term babies. What on earth is baby formula going to do against the security of the state of Israel?” said Dr Diana Nazzal, a Palestinian-German eye surgeon who helped the American doctor pack his bags in a way that would be acceptable to Israeli border authorities.Nazzal added that many medical staff entering Gaza are filling their bags with calorie-dense foods such as protein bars and nuts, rather than medical supplies.Infant formula has become more critical as the hunger crisis has worsened in Gaza, with almost 500,000 people facing catastrophic hunger while the rest of the population is experiencing acute food insecurity.View image in fullscreenAmnesty International has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians in Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMothers who are severely malnourished themselves or have been killed are unable to breastfeed, creating a higher need for formula. On the parallel market, what little supply exists has become exorbitantly expensive, with one can of formula going for about $50 – 10 times the normal price.“I was able to breastfeed her naturally for one month, but due to lack of food I could no longer continue,” said Nourhan Barakat, a 25-year-old mother of three displaced to Khan Younis. “I know that breastfeeding strengthens the bond between mother and child – but what can I do?”In late June, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said about 112 children were being admitted daily to Gaza’s hospitals for malnutrition treatment. Malnutrition before the age of three can cause permanent developmental problems.“This whole generation is being targeted. They will suffer from memory problems, developmental delays … And the problem is even if nutrition becomes available later on, the damage is permanent,” al-Faraa said.Doctors said the deaths of infants was a worrying sign of Gaza’s looming starvation crisis, as young children are the most vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition.“When you see babies start to die, panic and alarms should start to flare. Essentially, children are the first to die in starvation crises,” said Dr Thaer Ahmad, a member of a medical delegation trying to deliver aid through the international group Avaaz.Doctors have blamed the Israeli aid blockade for the shortage, as Israel prevents all but a few aid trucks entering the territory – far below what humanitarians say is required to feed the population. UN agencies say Gaza needs at least 500 trucks a day to meet basic needs, but often less than 50 are admitted.What UN aid does come through is often confiscated by hungry crowds and armed gangs who have begun looting trucks out of desperation.If Palestinians want to access aid given by GHF, they have to navigate a complicated, ever-changing set of instructions to queue at one of four distribution sites. More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces while queueing for aid over the last month.Humanitarian groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates the core principles of humanitarianism. Previously, the UN-led aid system in Gaza maintained more than 400 aid distribution points throughout Gaza set up at points of need. The GHF said it had delivered more than 52m meals in five weeks and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.Israel has said the UN system was being exploited by Hamas to hoard aid, an accusation for which humanitarians say there is no evidence.The war in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people since 7 October 2023, and was launched in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack on the same day that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Israel and Hamas have signalled in recent days that they are nearing a US-brokered ceasefire, though key sticking points remain.In the meantime, doctors in the territory say time is running out. “You should see the children arriving,” said al-Farra. “They’re just skin and bones. It’s horrifying. The real solution is to end the war, open the crossings and allow baby formula in.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelChildrenAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The centres will offer help with breastfeeding and housing issues, as well as supporting children’s early development and language, ministers said.The £500m project will open 1,000 centres from April 2026, meaning every council in England will have a family hub by 2028. It will build on the existing family hubs and start for life programme to provide a single point of access for services in health, education and wellbeing.Parents will also be able to register births, access midwifery and maternity services, and get help to stop smoking. There will also be activities for children under five and youth service provision.About 200 new nurseries to open at schools in England in SeptemberRead moreThe education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, said the hubs would provide a “lifeline of consistent support across the nation, ensuring health, social care and education work in unison to ensure all children get the very best start in life”.The policy forms part of the government’s push to replace services lost since 2010, which include the closure of more than 1,400 Sure Start centres.Research showed that children who lived near aSure Start centrefor their first five years were more likely to get five good GCSE grades at age 16.Family hubs were originally opened in 75 local authority areas at the start of 2024 by the then Conservative government.The announcement by theDepartment for Educationcomes ahead of the government unveiling its strategy on child development on Monday.The Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life plan will lay out how ministers hope to improve the development of children under five, and give support to parents and wider families.Phillipson said: “It’s the driving mission of this government to break the link between a child’s background and what they go on to achieve – our new Best Start Family Hubs will put the first building blocks of better life chances in place for more children.“I saw firsthand how initiatives like Sure Start helped level the playing field in my own community, transforming the lives of children by putting in place family support in the earliest years of life, and as part of our Plan for Change, we’re building on its legacy for the next generation of children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well, it’s a mess of our own making,” he said.“We could have avoided some of this by just listening to some of the people in the party who want to support Starmer, want to support Labour, but are finding it difficult because the mistakes are made and they could have been avoided.”View image in fullscreenSteve Rotheram.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRotheram, a former MP who was elected as firstLiverpoolcity region mayor in 2017, said the government appeared “disjointed” from the rest of Labour.He added: “I don’t think it’s necessarily about Keir or Keir’s team necessarily – although there are definitely some siren voices around all of that – but I do think it’s about the feeling that there’s a lack of connectivity between different bits of the party.”Tracy Brabin, the Labour mayor ofWest Yorkshire, urged Starmer to place the devolution of power at the heart of his premiership.She said “The devolution revolution has been all too quickly forgotten by some [government] departments” despite mayors “driving incredible change for our communities bringing growth, hope and optimism”.Brabin, a former shadow culture secretary who took office in West Yorkshire in 2021, said Labour had an opportunity to win back the trust of voters who had “lost confidence in politicians ability to improve their lives” by backing mayors with more powers.The call was repeated by Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor ofSouth Yorkshire, who urged government ministers to invest more in frontline policing in the region and in its cultural sector.But he said ministers appeared “genuinely interested” in what he was trying to achieve in South Yorkshire, describing dealings with them as “chalk and cheese” compared with the “absolute shambles” under the Conservatives.“The difference is I think this government listens and I hope this government learns. That certainly seems to be the case. I want things to go better, of course I do, because what’s good for South Yorkshire is good for this country and vice versa.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means that, from Saturday, being a member of, or expressing support for, the organisation became a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison.The campaign group Defend Our Juries, which organised the demonstration, said “a priest, an emeritus professor and a number of health professionals” were among those arrested.More than two dozen people gathered close to the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament Square, holding signs that appeared to express support for the group.At about 1.40pm, Metropolitan police officers began arresting people who were holding the signs.In a statement on X, the Met said: “Officers have arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act 2000. They have been taken into custody. Palestine Action is a proscribed group and officers will act where criminal offences are committed.”The force posted another update on X on Saturday evening to say 29 arrests had been made and added that those arrested remain in custody.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: “We commend the counter-terrorism police for their decisive action in protecting the people of London from some cardboard signs opposing the genocide in Gaza and expressing support for those taking action to prevent it. It’s a relief to know that counter-terrorism police have nothing better to do.”On Friday, the group wrote to the Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, to give him advance warning of the demonstration.Before officers made arrests, the Guardian spoke to some of the demonstrators.Tim Crosland, of Defend Our Juries, said: “What we’re doing here as a group of priests, teachers, health workers, human rights lawyers [is] we’re refusing to be silenced. Because it goes to the core of what we believe in: that we oppose genocide – I didn’t think that was that controversial – and we support the people who resist genocide.“In theory we are now terrorist supporters and can go to prison for 14 years, which is kind of crazy. I think what we are here to do is just expose the craziness of that.”An environmental campaigner, Donnachadh McCarthy, said: “To proscribe an organisation of peaceful direct action as terrorists is a huge red line for our democracy. It means that all the rest of us, whether we’re climate activists, Greenpeace, women’s suffragettes, disabled activists, it means that the government can now declare any act of property damage to be terrorism, which gives you a sentence of 14 years.“This is worse than Putin’s Russia. I don’t say that lightly. It’s 10 years for doing what we’re doing today in Russia; it’s 14 years in the UK, because of Yvette Cooper’s outrageous betrayal of democracy, liberalism, and what is in my view a step towards fascism.”A retired priest, Sue Parfitt, 83, said the group’s ban was “a very dangerous move that has to be challenged”.“We are losing our civil liberties, we must stop that for everybody’s sake. Whatever you want to protest about,” she said.View image in fullscreenSue Parfitt being led away by police.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PACooper, the home secretary, announced plans to ban Palestine Action late last month, days after activists from the groupbroke into RAF Brize Nortonand defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.MPs voted in favour of proscribing the group on Wednesday. The House of Lords backed the move without a vote on Thursday.UN experts, civil liberties groups,cultural figuresandhundreds of lawyershave condemned the ban as draconian and said it sets a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.The ban means Palestine Action has become the first direct action protest group to be banned under the Terrorism Act, placing it in the same category as Islamic State, al-Qaida and the far-right group National Action.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It says he borrowed £50,000 for one business, JAM Financial Ltd, which had no employees and negligible assets until the Covid pandemic.For a firm to have been eligible for the loan, it would have needed to report a turnover of at least £200,000. In 2021 McMurdock is said to have resigned as a director from the company, transferring his shares to Yvonne Allen.Another company McMurdock owned, Gym Live Health and Fitness Limited, is said to have borrowed £20,000. It would have required a turnover of £100,000 under the Bounce Back scheme.It too had no employees according to the latest registered accounts available on Companies House, and had nominal assets until the Covid pandemic.As a result, the companies were due to be struck off the register at Companies House. Yet on the same day in February 2023, the process of suspending both companies was halted after the regulator had an objection from a third party.Reform UK puts teenagers in charge of vital public servicesRead moreMcMurdock told the Sunday Times to be “very, very careful”, when approached for comment and said a “technical expert” would be necessary to understand the issue. He repeatedly refused to say why he took out the loans, the newspaper reported.The report was pre-empted by an announcement from Anderson, who posted a statement on X saying: “I have today received a call from James McMurdock who has advised me, as chief whip, that he has removed the party whip from himself pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations that are likely to be published by a national newspaper.“The allegations relate to business propriety during the pandemic and before he became an MP.”After resigning theReform UKwhip, pending an investigation, McMurdock said, in a statement on X, that he asked for the whip to be suspended as a “precautionary measure” and “for the protection of Reform UK”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that other people who were in the area but not at the camp could also be unaccounted for. Torrential rain caused the river to rise 26ft (8 meters) in just 45 minutes before dawn on Friday, washing away homes and vehicles.About 750 girls were camping along the river for the Independence Day weekend, according to Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr county, who said that “catastrophic” rains had devastated the area, located to the north of San Antonio.Authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, with more than 1,700 people involved in the search-and-rescue operation.Of the bodies recovered so far, 12 adults and five children were still unidentified, officials said.One of the girls attending the camp, Renee Smajstrla, who was nine years old, was confirmed to be among the dead by her uncle.“Renee has been found and while not the outcome we prayed for, the social media outreach likely assisted the first responders in helping to identify her so quickly,” Shawn Saltawroteon Facebook. “We are thankful she was with her friends and having the time of her life.”LiveDrone footage shows extent of deadly Texas flooding – videoSearchers used helicopters and drones to look for victims and rescue people stranded by flood waters. The confirmed death toll is almost certain to rise, although hopes remain that some of those affected will be found alive. “They could be in a tree, they could be out of communication,” said Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor. “We are praying for all of those missing to be found alive.”The danger was not over as more heavy rains were expected Saturday, with flash flood warnings issued for parts of central Texas. “This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION,” the National Weather Service (NWS) warned in abulletin. “SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!”Huge downpours like this are becoming more common around the world due to the climate crisis, with a warming atmosphere holding a greater amount of moisture. In eastern Texas, there hasalreadybeen a 20% increase in the number of days with heavy rain or snow since 1900, with the intensity of extreme rainset to riseby another 10% in the next decade.In the area affected by the floods in Texas, parents and families posted photos of missing loved ones and pleas for information. “The camp was completely destroyed,” said Elinor Lester, 13, one of hundreds of campers at Camp Mystic. “A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”A raging storm woke up her and her cabin mates just after midnight Friday – and when rescuers arrived, they tied a rope for the girls to hold as they walked across a bridge with flood waters whipping around their legs, she said.The flooding in the middle of the night on the Fourth of July holiday caught many residents, campers and officials by surprise. Officials defended their preparations for severe weather and their response but said they had not expected such an intense downpour that was, in effect, the equivalent of months’ worth of rain for the area.One NWS forecast this week had called for only 3-6in (76-152mm) of rain, said Kidd, of the Texas division of emergency management.“It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said.Saturday’s deaths renewed questions about whether it was wise for the Trump administration to implementdeep budget and job cutsat the NWS – among other federal government agencies – since his second presidency began in January.“After media reports & experts warned for months that drastic & sudden cuts at the [NWS] by Trump could impair their forecasting ability & endanger lives during the storm season, TX officials blame an inaccurate forecast by NWS for the deadly results of the flood,” Ron Filipkowski, editor in chief of the liberal news website MeidasTouch,wroteon X.However, Avery Tomasco, a meteorologist with CBS Austin, defended the forecasters after local officials claimed they had not been warned of the potential danger. “The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kerr County more than 12 hours ahead of the catastrophic flood,”Tomasco wrote. “A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt [and] Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb. They did their job and they did it well.”Trump addressed the deadly floods shortly before 11am eastern time on Saturday. On his Truth Social platform, he said that his administration was working with state and local officials – and that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, were “praying for all of the families” affected.The afternoon news conference began with a series of long, self-congratulatory statements and praise for Trump from Republican officials, including Abbott, the homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, the senator John Cornyn and the representative Chip Roy. It was only after reporters pressed them for details on the rescue and recovery effort that they provided an update on the missing and the dead.One river gauge near Camp Mystic recorded a 22ft (6.7-meter) rise in about two hours, said Bob Fogarty, meteorologist with the NWS’s Austin/San Antonio office. The gauge failed after recording a level of 29.5ft (9 meters).“The water’s moving so fast, you’re not going to recognize how bad it is until it’s on top of you,” Fogarty said.On the Facebook page of the Kerr county sheriff’s office, people posted pictures of loved ones and begged for help finding them.In Ingram, Erin Burgess woke to thunder and rain in the middle of the night on Friday. Just 20 minutes later, water was pouring into her home directly across from the river, she said. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough to walk up the hill to a neighbor’s home.“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung on to it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away,” she said. “He was lost for a while, but we found them.”Of her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: “Thankfully he’s over 6ft tall. That’s the only thing that saved me – was hanging on to him.”Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors but that he had received no warning on his phone.“We got no emergency alert. There was nothing” until suddenly there was “a pitch-black wall of death”, Stone said.At a reunification center set up in Ingram, families cried and cheered as loved ones disembarked from vehicles loaded with evacuees. Two soldiers carried an older woman who could not climb down a ladder. Behind her, a woman clutched a small white dog.Later, a girl in a white Camp Mystic T-shirt and white socks stood in a puddle, sobbing in her mother’s arms.Barry Adelman, 54, said water pushed everyone in his three-story house into the attic, including his 94-year-old grandmother and nine-year-old grandson. The water started coming through the attic floor before finally receding.“I was horrified,” he said. “I was having to look at my grandson in the face and tell him everything was going to be OK, but inside I was scared to death.”The forecast had called for rain, with a flood watch upgraded to a warning overnight for at least 30,000 people.The lieutenant governor noted that the potential for heavy rain and flooding covered a large area.“Everything was done to give them a heads-up that you could have heavy rain, and we’re not exactly sure where it’s going to land,” Patrick said. “Obviously, as it got dark last night, we got into the wee morning of the hours, that’s when the storm started to zero in.”Asked about how people were notified in Kerr county so that they could get to safety, Judge Rob Kelly, the county’s chief elected official, said: “We do not have a warning system.”When reporters pushed on why more precautions weren’t taken, Kelly said: “Rest assured – no one knew this kind of flood was coming.”The area is known as “flash flood alley” because of the hills’ thin layer of soil, said Austin Dickson, chief executive officer of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations to help non-profits responding to the disaster.“When it rains, water doesn’t soak into the soil,” Dickson said. “It rushes down the hill.”River tourism is a key part of the Hill Country economy. Well-known, century-old summer camps bring in kids from all over the country, Dickson said.“It’s generally a very tranquil river with really beautiful clear blue water that people have been attracted to for generations,” Dickson said.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTexas Floods 2025TexasFloodingExtreme weatherUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

These benefits will start to phase out for those with incomes of more than $75,000 and married couples of more than $150,000 a year.Previous SSA officials said that the Trump administration’s framing of the bill was misleading. “People are like: ‘Is this real? Is this a scam?’ Because it’s not what they signed up for,” Kathleen Romig, a former senior adviser at the SSA during the Biden administration, told CNN.“It doesn’t sound like normal government communications, official communications. It sounds like – you know – partisan.”Jeff Nesbit, who served as a top SSA official under Republican and Democratic presidents,postedon X: “The agency has never issued such a blatant political statement. The fact that Trump and his minion running SSA has done this is unconscionable.”The New Jersey representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House’s energy and commerce committee, wrote on X that “every word” of the SSA’s email on Thursday “is a lie”.“This big, ugly bill doesn’t change that,” Pallonewrote. “It’s disturbing to see Trump hijack a public institution to push blatant misinformation.”Explore more on these topicsUS social securityTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

You are! And parents and guardians have got to step up.”Police said one minor had died at a hospital after the shooting.Mass shootings – defined as cases where four or more shooting victims are injured or killed – were reported in other cities, including Philadelphia andChicagoand Brockton, Massachusetts, where six people were hospitalized following an early morning fight Saturday.Violence and shootings often surge in the summer months, especially around the Fourth of July, historically one of the deadliest days of the year in the US.The shooting in Chicago, which left seven people in serious or critical condition, came on the heels of another mass shooting that happened late Wednesday in that city in a busy neighborhood known for its restaurants and nightlife. Four people were killed and 14 others injured.Four dead and 14 injured in shooting at Chicago party for rapper Mello BuckzzRead moreAs of Saturday, there had been more than 205 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the nonpartisanGun Violence Archive. Perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many to call for more meaningful gun control, though Congress has largely left such pleas unheeded over the years.In the New York City borough of Queens, police said one person was dead and three injured in a triple stabbing following fireworks celebrating the 249th anniversary of the US’s declaration of independence from the UK.Meanwhile, a Wareham, Massachusetts, man is dead after being hit by a firework. Police said they found 70-year-old Robert Spagnuolo with a “facial injury”. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Officials inGeorgiareported two boat explosions Friday on lakes.

The woman – who has not been identified publicly – was rescued,News 4 San Antonioreported.Erin Burgess told the outlet that the rain on Thursday night and into Friday was “pretty heavy, but no big deal”. She was woken by the storm at 3.30am, and waters around her home in the Bumble Bee Hills neighborhood in Kerr county started to rise.Texas begins grim flood recovery after dozens killed and scores still missing – including childrenRead moreWithin 2o minutes, she said, water was coming in through the walls and rushing through the front and back doors. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough that she was able to walk up the hill to a neighbor’s home.“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung on to it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said. She clung to her 19-year-old son, Burgess, through the ordeal.“Thankfully he’s over 6ft tall. That’s the only thing that saved me – was hanging on to him,” she told the outlet.In Ingram, Texas, the fiancee of one man described how he died saving her and their children. Christinia Wilsontoldthe Texas news station KHOU that her fiance, Julian Ryan, severed an artery in his arm punching out a window to get her, their children and his mother out of their home as flood waters rushed in early on Friday.Wilson said she kept calling for emergency help, but no one could arrive in time to save Ryan.“He looked at me and the kids and my mother-in-law and said: ‘I’m sorry, I’m not going to make it. I love y’all,’” Wilson told KHOU.Ryan’s sister, Connie Salas, said to the station: “He died a hero, and that will never go unnoticed.”Officials have said that a flood watch was issued on Thursday afternoon with estimated rainfalls, but that was upgraded to a flood warning for at least 30,000 people overnight. Officials have also said that the area around the Guadalupe River, known as “flood alley”, does not have a flood warning system.As of Saturday morning, 850 people had been rescued by emergency services, with 167 having been rescued by helicopter.The devastation has triggered a scramble to locate as many as two dozen children missing from Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp on the banks of the river, but the missing also include campers who were not connected to that camp.Among them are four young adults who were last heard from at 4am on Friday morning when they were attempting to reach higher ground. They have been identified by family as Ella Cahill, Aidan Heartfield, Joyce Badon and Reese Manchaca.“My little sister, her boyfriend, and their two friends are missing due to flood,” Mackenzie Hodulik said on a Facebook post. “Last we heard from them was at 4am.

It definitely was tough to find my rhythm. But I stuck in there, toughed it out.”After an early hold from Navarro, the defending champion began her service game with a double fault, but an accurate ace and a well-timed slice got her back on track to make it 1-1. The rain then delayed play for 15 minutes before Krejcikova earned a hard-fought double break; her smooth forehands left Navarro scrambling.Serving to stay in the set, the American targeted Krejcikova’s backhand and took the game due to a wayward shot from the Czech. The 29-year-old, seeded 17, responded with a quick serve and forehand combination, then clinched the set with an accurate serve.Hoping to come back from her first set dropped atWimbledon, Navarro held before breaking with creative shotmaking. Krejcikova failed to deal with a tricky lob before a backhand into the net took the match to a decider and upped her unforced error count to 17 in the set. After composing herself in the locker room, Krejcikova held before failing to take five chances to break. Navarro then followed up her own hold with a break after Krejcikova’s sixth double fault and slice straight into the net.View image in fullscreenBarbora Krejcikova has her blood pressure measured during her defeat by Emma Navarro.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty ImagesTwo back-to-back breaks from both gave Navarro a 3-2 lead before another pause in play as Krejcikova had her blood pressure checked. Despite looking exhausted and in tears, the older player continued to fight, but Navarro held twice before sealing the win with an unreturnable serve down the line.“The first set I was playing too fast and playing into her game, letting her do what she wanted to do,” said Navarro. “She was doing it really well. I regrouped, tried to slow things down a bit from my side and make her look at some different shots. Just tried to make her as uncomfortable as I could.”The American will face Mirra Andreeva, whose teenage dream continued as she stormed to a 6-1, 6-3 win against Hailey Baptiste. The Russian has now won 35 WTA Tour main draw matches in 2025, the third most behind the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, (44) and Iga Swiatek (37), and is the youngest player to reach the fourth round at the first three slams of the season since Nicole Vaidisova in 2006.“My goal for the match was just to stay focused and be aggressive,” said Andreeva. “I’m super happy with my level today.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Franklin Tiafoe, Baptiste’s coach, was joined in the box by his twin, Frances. Baptiste is a childhood friend and credits the brothers for helping her rise through the ranks. She began nervously, double-faulting to give Andreeva an early break and the 18-year-old capitalised with a comfortable hold, using precise drop shots to establish an early lead.Andreeva failed to return a a 121mph serve in the American’s composed second service game. Baptiste continued the pressure on Andreeva’s serve, forcing deuce with close net action, but another break and hold from the Russian, with her backhand helping her hit 10 winners in the set, made it 5-1. Serving to stay in the set, Baptiste attacked from the off in an attempt to narrow the gaps, but Andreeva hit two more winners to break.Baptiste’s play in the second was to target Andreeva’s weaker forehand, but despite some wobbly points, the No 7 seed held serve. A first ace on Baptiste’s serve helped to make it 1-1. A hold and a break from Andreeva followed, with Baptiste still unable to control her long forehands. “I found a good balance between slicing and changing the rhythm with the forehand,” said Andreeva. “When I had time I used my forehand. It gave me a lot of benefits.”Baptiste remained patient and broke. Andreeva broke back immediately to love and held after Baptiste failed to take five break points before securing the win.View image in fullscreenThe 2022 champion Elena Rybakina slipped out of Wimbledon following a rain-delayed defeat to the 22-year-old Dane Clara Tauson.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/ReutersMeanwhile, Clara Tauson secured her first win against Elena Rybakina, 7-6 (6), 6-3, and a meeting with Swiatek in the fourth round. Before this week, the world No 22 had never won a main draw match here, but she displayed good form to secure her first top-20 win on grass. It was a disappointing performance from the 2022 champion, who failed to capitalise on a main draw that had lost six top-10 seeds.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

That incredible conclusion to an otherwise pedestrian match also included a late red card given to Real Madrid’s Dean Huijsen, the impressive new arrival in central defence, who will miss the semi-final as a result of bringing down Serhou Guirassy right after Mbappé’s stupendous volley for Real Madrid’s third.Real Madrid dominated most of the game, with Gonzalo García opening the scoring for his impressive fourth goal of the tournament and the left-back Fran García (no relation) adding the second – his first goal in 52 appearances this season.But while the final stages may be the most memorable period of this game for any of the 76,611 who filled MetLife stadium to 93% of its listed capacity, it was the Garcías’ contributions and Real Madrid’s general play through the preceding 90 minutes that most represented what the Spanish giants might look like in the coming season under Alonso.View image in fullscreenFran García celebrates after scoring Real Madrid’s second goal against Borussia Dortmund.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APWhen the former Bayer Leverkusen manager took over the club he used to play for after Carlo Ancelotti’s disappointing final season, theClub World Cupkicked off in just over two weeks. The start of a major standalone tournament coming so soon after a new manager appointment is far from the norm, but Alonso’s intentions were clear.“I see it as an opportunity for two reasons,” he said. “One, because it means that we can accelerate processes, get to know each other sooner, see things that we want to be. Then it’s a chance to fight for another trophy … If we can bring together those two things then it can be a very good start.”It has indeed been a very good start. On Saturday, as they had throughout the tournament so far, Alonso’s Real Madrid seamlessly integrated young players that seemed primed to make a leap into the elite, with their contributions helping Real to be one win away from a chance at that trophy in the Club World Cup final.The goals came from two players who represent the strong role youth development still can play in a Madrid team laden with stars. Both are academy products, and both caused danger throughout the match aside from their goals.View image in fullscreenThibaut Courtois denies Borussia Dortmund's Marcel Sabitzer an equaliser from the last shot of the game.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThe assists, meanwhile, seem to indicate that the Spanish giant’s succession planning for life after Luka Modric is working. Arda Guler, the 20-year old Turkey international, was brilliant once again, providing the assist for Gonzalo García’s opener and generally being a nuisance to a timid Dortmund backline throughout the 90 minutes. Along the backline, Huijsen effectively controlled proceedings just behind the brilliant Aurélien Tchouaméni in defensive midfield. The pair, along with Huijsen’s partner in central defence, Antonio Rüdiger, kept Dortmund from threatening much if at all – at least until Huijsen’s red card and the madness that surrounded it.These quietly efficient performances bring to mind the best of what Alonso was able to achieve in his time in charge of Bayer Leverkusen. But this is still Real Madrid, and there are still big stars capable of improvising extraordinary things. Vinícius Júnior, as usual, proved to be good for a few of those moments, at one point attempting an audacious chip from 30-plus yards that nonetheless went high and wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French superstar is still finding his feet after being in hospital with gastroenteritis, an illness that reportedly cost him 5kg of body weight and presumably days of training and getting in sync with his new manager and teammates. With the added lightness, though, Mbappé provided the game’s signature moment in that memorable stoppage time, hanging in the air to meet a cross with a sideways scissor kick from close range that flew past Dortmund’s goalkeeper, Gregor Kobel, and into the back of the net, delighting the near-capacity crowd.Now, Mbappé will hope to be fully fit and one can imagine he will be breaking down Alonso’s door begging to start a headline semi-final at this same venue on Wednesday, his first chance to face the team with whom he became a World Cup winner and a global superstar.Upon his introduction to his new charges, Alonso set out “to see the things we want to be” and “to win a trophy” as his goals. “If we can bring together those two things then it can be a very good start,” he said.That good start is now just one win from yet another major final forLos Merengues.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Real MadridBorussia DortmundClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet Kipyegon was able to find an extra gear as she ran the last 300m in a staggering 44 seconds to break her previous world record by 0.36sec.Faith Kipyegon certain a woman will break four-minute mile barrier within a decadeRead moreEight days earlier she had faded sharply in Paris to run 4:06 for the mile. But here she looked far stronger and sharper as she came home in 3min 48.68sec. Ethiopia’s Diribe Welteji was second in 3:51.44, ahead of Australia’s Jessica Hull in 3:52.67. Britain’s Georgia Bell finished strongly to come fourth in a season’s best 3:54.76.Earlier the Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m champion, Beatrice Chebet, became the first woman in history to cover 5,000m inside 14 minutes, clocking a world record of 13:58.06. The Kenyan, returning to the track where she broke the world 10,000m record last year, was tracked for most of the race by the former world 5,000m record holder Gudaf Tsegay and Agnes Jebet Ngetich.View image in fullscreenBeatrice Chebet leads the 5,000m at the Prefontaine Classic en route to a world record.Photograph: Ali Gradischer/Getty ImagesBut she kicked hard with 200m remaining before taking 2.15sec off Tsegay’s best. Ngetich took second place in 14:01.29, the third-fastest time in history, and Tsegay placed third in 14:04.41.“When I was coming here to Eugene, I was coming to prepare to run a world record, and I said I have to try,” Chebet said. “I said: ‘If Faith is trying, why not me?’ And today, I’m so happy because I’ve achieved being the first woman to run under 14.”There was also a thrilling men’s mile race as the 20-year-old Dutch star Niels Laros came from 20 metres back in the final 100m to somehow beat Yarod Neguse by one-hundredth of a second in a time of 3:45.94.There was also a shock in the women’s 100m as Melissa Jefferson-Wooden beat the Olympic champion, Julien Alfred, in a thriller. The pair were locked together all the way down the straight before the American just got her head in front to win in 10.75, despite running into a -1.5m/s headwind, with Alfred 0.02 back.Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith was sixth in 11.14 with Sha’Carri Richardson last in 11.19.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsWorld recordsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a salutary reminder, were one needed, of why the defending world champion remains the most sought-after driver on the grid.In beating the charging McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Britain’s Lando Norris into second and third, Verstappen proved once more to be the difference, his touch and precision exquisite through the sweeping, high-speed blast of Silverstone, which demands inch-perfect commitment.F1 British Grand Prix: Max Verstappen denies McLarens to take pole at Silverstone – liveRead moreIt was justification writ large for all the furore around the Dutchman,whose futurehas dominated the discourse all week, with Mercedes once more considering poaching him away from Red Bull and they, in turn, just as anxious to hang on to their most valuable weapon.Rumour and speculation have hung as heavy over the paddock as the looming grey clouds above the old airfield on Saturday. Neither, however, dampened the ardour with which Verstappen took to the track.While Norris andLewis Hamilton, who was in feisty form and very much in the mix until the final laps where he took fifth, would have stirred the hearts of the home crowd with pole, they and Piastri were denied by an imperious lap by Verstappen.It was all the more striking given it was very much against the odds for Verstappen, who had to absolutely wring the neck of theRed Bull. He has not been particularly happy with his car here, having also struggled with its balance all season. From circuit to circuit he has dealt with its variance in performance, its wilful handling and lack of the pointy front-end he enjoys, making for a mercurial beast.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen during qualifying at Silverstone, where he took his first pole since Miami, six races ago.Photograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was even more to deal with on Saturday, the team using a trimmed-back, low-downforce configuration to try to make the most of the high-speed aspect of the track and to dial out the understeer they had experienced, but this came at the expense of downforce through the corners.“It’s also tracks that I just enjoy more,” he said. “I just like the high speeds where you have to be committed. It’s more flowing. That’s really where an F1 car comes alive. We know that on these kind of tracks, the car just comes alive a bit more.”He had not looked to be in it on the opening runs in Q3, but last out for the decisive laps, which were fiercely contested, he had it hooked up to perfection.

I definitely feel like we’re punching out better results, so we’ve got to keep pushing.”After being knocked out on the first lap in Austria by Kimi Antonelli, Verstappen is clinging on in the title fight. He is 61 points off Piastri, who is 15 in front of Norris. But the Dutchman will not be thinking of the difference. Thirteen races remain and he is focused simply on returning the best he can at each one, but if he can translate pole into a win it will be an enormous achievement given how dominant the McLarens have been. They will, as ever, expect to have a tyre advantage and be fearsome in race pace, making for a potential battle royal on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenMercedes GPFerrariLewis HamiltonMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The Lionesses were lacklustre and were punished, kicking off their European title defence with a 2-1 defeat by an impressive France team and handing Sarina Wiegman’s first major tournament defeat outside a final.After a promising and pressing start fell away, Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Sandy Baltimore delivered for a resurgent France. Keira Walsh’s late strike from a corner reduced the reigning European champions’ blushes but the late charge was not enough and England have a lot of work to do to escape the tournament’s group of death.There had been a cautious optimism around England fans in the buildup, a feeling that the holders would be able to make a statement in the showpiece of the opening set of fixtures. In the French press, pessimism was the order of the day, the unceremonious dropping of the long-term captain, Wendie Renard, and the record goalscorer, Eugénie Le Sommer, the key talking point. It felt like an even more outrageous decision with Griedge Mbock struggling to shake off a calf issue that Laurent Bonadei all but confirmed ruled her out of their first match.The manager had provoked some raised eyebrows when he quoted Einstein in reply to questions about Renard’s omission for the first time since 2005, saying the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again. He had a point: the French had played 26 games at the Women’s Euros before this fixture but have never made the final. They have been perennial underachievers, awash with individual talent but crippled by off the field issues, dressing room controversy and poor coaching.View image in fullscreenMarie-Antoinette Katoto (second right) watches the ball bulge the net as she puts France 1-0 up, as England’s goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, looks on.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPAThe ferocity with which England burst out the blocks at a balmy Stadion Letzigrund in front of 22,542 fans will have not eased French nerves and they were lucky to not be behind inside the opening minute. While Renard’s absence dominated French headlines, the potential return of Lauren James – and the price of everything in Switzerland – was the talk of England’s media and fans. Her name in the starting XI was an extremely welcome sight, the forward, a generational talent, having played just 30 minutes of football in three months, when shecame on against Jamaicain England’s sendoff game last Sunday.And it was James who almost caught France out. England’s press won the ball and Alessia Russo found space down the right to cut back for James, who fired over inside 39 seconds. The Chelsea forward was the outlet in a blistering opening 20 minutes for the defending champions.Wiegman’s side thought they had the lead in the 16th minute and it would have been deserved, Russo firing a rebound past Pauline Peyraud-Magnin, who had saved from Lauren Hemp. However, it was ruled out after a VAR check for an offside in the buildup, but replays and stills were confusing, suggesting the most hairline of calls.Sandy BaltimoreThere was a cagier period after the disallowed goal, the wind seemingly taken out of England’s sails a little, and the French began to settle, finding joy out wide, particularly on the right against a somewhat bullied Jess Carter. A fine instinctive save from the foot of Hannah Hampton, freshly handed the No 1 shirt full time after the retirement of Mary Earps, spared England, although VAR also intervened for an offside. “Slowly, step by step in this game we came back with our forward players,” said Bonadei.The goal was coming. England’s passing was, put kindly, sloppy and France were quick to capitalise. Georgia Stanway was the culprit for the opener, her short pass pounced on by Élisa De Almeida. The full-back released Delphine Cascarino, who was untroubled by Carter, and pinged a cross in towards Katoto, who turned the ball coolly in.It was a bruising move. Six minutes laterLes Bleueshad a second and more calamitous defending proved costly. Lucy Bronze raced in to assist Leah Williamson as she tracked Baltimore but the full-back made a hash of her tackle and ended up on the floor poking the ball back to the Chelsea forward, who slammed across goal and in.“Of course we know France are very good but we created chances for them by playing short passes all the time. We were a bit sloppy. We didn’t help ourselves with that,” said Wiegman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It took until the hour mark for Wiegman to make changes and it felt overdue: James, who was quiet after that blistering start, was hooked for Ella Toone, Beth Mead made way for Chloe Kelly and Carter was spared facing forward Kadidiatou Diani, one of three France substitutions, when she was replaced by Niamh Charles.View image in fullscreenKeira Walsh scores a late goal for England.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersConcerningly, England just looked a little lost, unable to adapt to counteract the fluidity of the cohesive French.Toone fired wide the ball taking a deflection on the way, and Wiegman played her hail Mary, sending on the 19-year-old Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang as they waited to take the corner. The set piece was cleared as far as Walsh, who fired in from the edge of the box.Agyemang caused problems for the French defence, but she just did not have enough time. All is not lost though. As Bronze pointed out in the buildup, England lost to France in their opening game of the 2015 World Cup before going on to record their best ever tournament run at the time, when they suffered semi-final heartbreak against Japan. The difference now is the strength of the group.

After a thoroughly enjoyable journey to their first major tournament, Wales collided with the 2017 European champions and were left dizzy and disorientated. During the course of an instructive 90 minutes in the shadow of Lucerne’s Mount Pilatus, Vivianne Miedema scored her 100th international goal. Perhaps even more significantly Andries Jonker’s side did enough to suggest it would be thoroughly unwise to assume England and France are destined to fill Group D’s top two places.After conceding three soft goals and regularly being saved by either the woodwork or their quietly impressive goalkeeper, Olivia Clark, Wales will almost certainly be watching the knockout phase on television. No matter; Rhian Wilkinson’s players should eventually come to look back on this chastening evening in central Switzerland with real pride at their part in a landmark piece of national football history.At least the Wales coach was still smiling as she faced the media. “It was a tough, painful, game,” she said. “But this is a tough group, the big event, it’s intimidating. It’s also what we want, we want to play the biggest teams.“We’ve got two more games and we’ve got to show up. We’ve got to cut out the defensive lapses and create more but my players have put in a massive shift, they’ve run their socks off.”View image in fullscreenWales fans turned out in their thousands to support the team against the Netherlands.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APWilkinson, one of the women’s game’s rising managerial talents, had asked her players to turn into latter day Princess Gwenllians and, on that level at least, they did not disappoint. As a 12th-century Welsh warrior princess, Gwenllian led an army into battle against the mighty Normans and the Wales head coach spied parallels in the scale of the challenge her team faced against the Netherlands here.Like Gwenllian they ultimately met a sticky end but for 45 minutes Angharad James and company put up a wonderfully defiant fight in front of the loudest of travelling Red Walls massed at one end of Allmend Stadion.Wales supporters have registered the second highest ticket sales of any country involved in Euro 2025’s group stage and almost 4,000 were here. Many had overcome delays and flight diversions prompted by a French air traffic controllers’ strike action but, by Saturday lunchtime, downtown Lucerne was a kaleidoscope of Welsh red and Dutch orange.About 3,000 Netherlands fans saw their side dominate possession from the off. With Barcelona’s excellent wingback Esmee Brugts worrying Josie Green down the Dutch left, Wilkinson was soon imploring her players to make the game more compact.Yet as much as the Welsh back five spent protracted periods resisting hostile fire, the 38-year-old Jess Fishlock’s deployment as a false 9 blending indomitable industry with superior touch and vision sporadically ruffled the Netherlands.Wilkinson appeared content to see her team deliberately slow things down, with Lily Woodham’s booking for time-wasting a prime example of the early disruption to Dutch momentum that featured Miedema being second-guessed well by Rhiannon Roberts, initially.Jill Roord proved rather harder to pin down and, when she ghosted in behind Hayley Ladd, the Twente attacking midfielder unleashed the most vituperative of half-volleys which, having beaten Clark, ricocheted away off the inside of a post.It was quite a reprieve for Wales but their luck could not last and it finally ran out in the psychologically debilitating dying moments of first-half stoppage time. Just as Wilkinson’s containment plan seemed to have worked, the Manchester City striker received the ball from Daniëlle van de Donk and proceeded to put Roberts firmly in her place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlarm spread across Wilkinson’s face as the much-decorated former Canada defender watched Miedema tease Sunderland’s new signing from Real Betis by twice dropping a shoulder and feinting to shoot before finally swivelling imperiously beyond her bewildered marker. As Miedema’s perfectly calibrated 20-yard shot curved into a top corner, Welsh hopes dipped even lower than the early evening Swiss sun.Jonker, who had taken the precaution of ordering every outfield player back when Wales earlier won a couple of corners, simply looked relieved. On the eve of the tournament the outgoing Netherlands coach had taken to the airwaves to express his surprise and disappointment regarding his impending replacement by Arjan Veurink, the assistant to the England coach, Sarina Wiegman. In a heated pre-match press conference Jonker was asked if he was treating his arguably unimpressed players like “puppets”.As if to emphasise her team is well capable of rising above such creative tensions, Arsenal’s Victoria Pelova opened the second half by meeting Van de Donk’s lay off, taking a steadying touch and shooting unerringly beyond Clark. Wales had paid the price for being caught cold by a long ball over the top towards the advancing Van de Donk.Suitably encouraged, Miedema once again turned Roberts inside and picked out Roord with the outside of a boot, but the latter hit the woodwork again.It was purely a temporary stay of execution. When Jackie Groenen’s shot rebounded off the bar, Wales failed to clear properly, permitting Brugts to volley beyond Clark, before Lineth Beerensteyn evaded Clark’s reach only to see that effort disallowed for a tight offside.“We suffered,” said Wilkinson. “But sometimes a gameplan works, sometimes it doesn’t. You could see how tense we were but I’m not worried; these women will turn this round.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Wales women's football teamNetherlands women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, as had happened so many times in a breathless afternoon in Atlanta, the pitch opened up and players poured into the space. They should have been exhausted, but off went Vitinha through the middle, Ousmane Dembélé sprinting alongside and soon joined by more men. He smashed the bar with the first shot but Achraf Hakimi got possession back, dribbled through three and set up the Frenchman to score the goal that ended it.Actually, “ended” may not be the word, because although that was the 95th minute, there was still time for Bayern Munich to have a penalty given and taken away again. Ultimately, though, by adding to Désiré Doué’s 78th-minute opener, Dembélé had secured PSG’s passage to theClub World Cupsemi-finals. Bayern were out. Worse, they had watched Jamal Musiala carried off at half-time, unlikely to return for a long time having suffered a suspected broken ankle in a challenge from Gianluigi Donnarumma who, seeing the grim sight, was close to tears.‘That’s reckless’: Manuel Neuer points finger at Gianlugi Donnarumma after Musiala injuryRead moreThat gave a sour, sad note to a match that overflowed with enthusiasm in which the players gave generously, one always open to anything happening, as the coaches had predicted. We will have less of the ball than normal, Luis Enrique said; so will we, Vincent Kompany added. Bayern’s manager called them teams with “extreme principles”, and so it was: a meeting of intensity and intent, a frenetic game of rob and rob back where the roars from the stands had a bit of “He’s behind you” about them and the running was relentless.Passes were misplaced but not for lack of quality – quite the opposite – but the speed at which it all happened. They had been playing just three minutes when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia robbed Michael Olise for Doué to shoot wide, and just four when Hakimi – the right-back, remember – almost stole the ball from Josip Stanisic in his own six-yard box. If this was what they predicted, it was a riot, blows traded. Not like heavyweights, but something faster, the combinations too quick to see coming, a kind of organised chaos.On 18 minutes, Bradley Barcola released Hakimi and he dashed off to deliver to the far post, where Kvaratskhelia hit the side netting. Nineteen seconds later, there was another roar as it looked like Kingsley Coman would escape at the other end. PSG closed that quickly, but the speed with which it had happened, from one attack to another, told a tale. PSG’s pass completion was at 76%, way below normal levels, but there was no reduction of their threat; no reduction of Bayern’s either.Fabián Ruiz fired over the first half’s best chance at one end. Donnarumma saved from Olise at the other. And then Manuel Neuer produced a brilliant stop from Kvaratskhelia, who had driven almost to the line. More followed. Harry Kane headed over a Coman cross before Donnarumma stopped from Aleksandar Pavlovic and Dayot Upamecano’s header was ruled out for offside, PSG holding the line and their nerve.This had been brilliant, and then just on half-time it went bad. Diving at the byline, Donnarumma went through Musiala, whose left ankle turned. The forward was left in a heap, a silence falling and a crowd forming; the goalkeeper was left crouched by his line wearing a lost look. As they went off at half-time, he didn’t know what to do with himself. In the second period he was booed, some supporters blaming him, even if his opponents didn’t.The game went on, the momentum maintained. PSG should have led when Barcola raced clear but as he opened up his body Neuer got a glimpse of his intentions and made another hugely impressive save. Play tilted Bayern’s way, if that meant anything, given how quickly everything could switch, a moment’s clarity in the chaos. An example came on the hour when an outrageous 70-yard diagonal from Nuno Mendes that you actually heard set Doué away.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé fires home Paris Saint-Germain’s second goal in stoppage time.Photograph: S Mellar/FC Bayern/Getty ImagesOlise then lifted a great chance over the near post. As if this wasn’t open enough, with 20 minutes remaining on came Dembélé and immediately left Olise in his dust. He also might have scored when Neuer hit a pass straight at Kvaratskhelia near the area. Bayern’s keeper lunged desperately at the Georgian’s feet but Dembélé nipped past and, with the goal unguarded, rolled the ball into the side netting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heading into the final minutes, every threat could be decisive too. The one that broke the deadlock started with a robbery. Kane was the man caught this time and there was Vitinha dashing forward. João Neves turned superbly and found Doué, who cut the shot in at the near post, Neuer slipping as he tried to adjust.Four minutes later, Pacho was sent off for a foul on Leon Goretzka. Kane then had an equaliser ruled out before Hernández put victory in danger with an act of stupidity, sent off for elbowing Guerreiro, only for Dembélé to double the lead.Still Bayern came and thought they had a penalty when Mendes appeared to catch Thomas Müller in the head, only for Anthony Taylor to be sent to his pitchside monitor, deciding that Mendes touched the ball on to Bayern player’s head and didn’t foul him. The final seconds slipped away and it is PSG who are heading to the semi-final in New York.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainBayern MunichClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In March, the national team became the second to qualify for the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States. In June, Donald Trumpauthorised the dropping of bombs on Iranand hit the country with atravel ban. As things stand, while the national team will be able to enter the US next summer, fans – and perhaps media – will not.Residents of Tehran and other cities may have had enough to deal with of late, but still, being barred from entry stings, even if Iranians have long found it difficult to get into the US. “If the US government has issues with the Iranian regime for any reason, it should not result in discrimination against Iranian citizens,” Behnam Jafarzadeh, a writer for the leading sports site Varzesh3, says. “If someone hasn’t committed any illegal activity, why should they be punished? It’s not just about theWorld Cup– the policy needs to change in general.”Mauricio Pochettino is bringing fight and focus back to the USMNT | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreWhat canIrando? “Boycotting the World Cup is not a solution,” Siavash Pakdaman, a Tehran-based fan, says. “Refusing to play on US soil would be a dangerous precedent – any host country could start excluding teams it has issues with. Just as the Iranian delegation can and should be present at the United Nations in the US, the Iranian team should also play on American soil if the draw requires it – without relocation.”There is a feeling that staying away would not make much difference anyway. “It would only deprive the national team of the opportunity to participate in a major tournament and would ultimately hurt Iran more,” Jafarzadeh says. “It might even be welcomed by some American officials. It could make headlines briefly, but once the tournament starts, it will be forgotten and will have achieved nothing.”Questions have been asked – including in Iran, whose supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long banned competing against Israeli athletes – about what the international reaction would have been if Qatar had banned citizens from certain nations from attending the 2022 World Cup.“If the USA makes it difficult for football fans to attend, then changing the host country is necessary,” Rezaei says. “Doing so would harm the USA’s reputation, not the World Cup’s. If strict entry rules remain, we should focus on protecting football. This is supposed to be a celebration of sport.”Jafarzadeh is not confident that the competition could be taken away from the busiest of the three hosts. “It is not a challengeFifaand [its president Gianni] Infantino would want to take on.” Perhaps there is another way. “Fifa should use all of its influence to push for a suspension of this policy at least during the World Cup.”View image in fullscreenIran celebrate scoring against Wales at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Iran will feature next year as players are exempt from the US travel ban.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty ImagesFifa may find it easier to place Iran in Canada or Mexicoand hope that Iran don’t make it to the latter stages, when there would have to be a game in the US. “Playing in Mexico or Canada is not a real solution – it just ignores the actual problem,” Rezaei says.Many expect it to happen anyway. “Canada has a large Iranian immigrant population, although some of them are opponents of the Iranian regime and the national team can’t count on their support,” Jafarzadeh says. “Mexico is probably a more attractive and less controversial destination for the team.”That is another question. The Iranian-American community is more than a million strong yet many of these headed west before, or in response to, the Islamic Revolution of 1979.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course, I hope my analysis is wrong.”Jafarzadeh, who went to the World Cups in Russia and Qatar and would love to go to the United States, says: “Some see the team as one that represents the regime, and this sentiment is even stronger among Iranians living abroad. Of course, the war with Israel has stirred feelings of patriotism among many Iranians, but I’m not sure if this will translate into support for the national team. We’ll have to wait and see how things unfold in the coming months.”That there is time is perhaps a small reason for optimism that things could change. Iran is one of 19 countries subject to a full or partial US entry ban. Several of the others retain hope of qualifying for the first 48-team World Cup, including Sudan, Sierra Leone, Venezuela and Haiti.“Considering that there is almost a year left until the 2026 World Cup, there is a possibility that the situation may stabilise,” says Isa Azimi, a columnist and translator, regarding Iran’s situation, though he is not confident. “Despite claims of separating politics from football, Fifa has shown that it is not particularly independent when facing major political powers.”Especially when Infantino appears to prize hisclose relationship with President Trump. “If Fifa considers itself a global body independent of governments, it must stand up to such laws and not allow politics to contaminate the world of sports,” Pakdaman says. “Of course, we all know that, unfortunately, such contamination exists – especially when one side of the issue is a superpower that answers to no one. It is Fifa’s duty to treat all member countries equally, but will that actually happen?”Explore more on these topicsIranWorld Cup 2026World CupFifaFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s done an amazing job here, guiding the club back to the Premier League with a 100-point haul, and now we’re looking forward, together, at being back in the greatest league in the world.Garnacho, Rashford and Sancho among five who tell Manchester United they want outRead more“Burnley had a tremendous campaign last season, built on an incredible defensive record, and I can’t wait to come in and add my experience and quality to what looks an exciting squad.”Walker won 17 major trophies during his decade at the Etihad Stadium but asked to leave in the winter transfer window, spending the second half of the season on loan at Milan. The Serie A club decided against making the deal permanent and Walker sought a move to a Premier League club.Walker, who has 96 caps, has been part of each of Thomas Tuchel’s England squads and will have his eye on representing his country at sixth major tournament and believes playing in the Premier League will help him achieve his aim.Walker becomes Burnley’s fifth signing of the summer after they won promotion from the Championship, having finished second last season behind Leeds.Meanwhile, Newcastle have agreed a£55m fee with Nottingham Forestfor Anthony Elanga, with the winger set to complete a move to the Champions League side in the coming days.The winger’s personal terms are not thought to be an issue and the signing of the Sweden international will end a year-long pursuit by Eddie Howe. Newcastle tried to sign Elanga last summer but the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, was adamant he would not be sold.

Enzo Maresca is not short of options in the final third and the extra competition for places may cause Madueke to consider his future.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreChelsea’s attacking ranks will also be boosted by the arrival of the Palmeiras winger Estêvão Willian after the Club World Cup, with Liam Delap and João Pedro having already joined.West Ham, meanwhile, expect the Stamford Bridge club will make a new offer for Mohammed Kudus if Madueke is sold. West Ham do not want to sell Kudus to Tottenham but are prepared to deal with Chelsea over the Ghana attacker.The current plan is for Maresca to go into next season with as many as nine senior forwards in his squad. But Chelsea are also looking to make sales and are open to offers for Madueke, whose hopes of regular starts could be limited following the new signings.Arsenal are understood to have discussed personal terms with Madueke and are weighing up whether to bid for the England international. Chelsea are not actively looking to sell the 23-year-old, who impressed after coming on whenMaresca’s side beat Palmeirasin the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup on Friday, but they are unlikely to stand in his way if he signals a desire to move to Arsenal.Mikel Arteta is keen to bring in two new wide players and is also tracking Real Madrid’s Rodrygo and Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. Madueke’s appeal lies in his speed and ability to play on both flanks. He could provide cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and give Arsenal a left-footed option on the opposite side.Chelsea will look for a sizeable fee if they are to sell Madueke, who has scored 13 goals and provided five assists in 67 Premier League appearances. They will point to West Ham looking for at least £60m for Kudus andNottingham Forestseeking more than £50m from Newcastle United for Anthony Elanga.Madueke has predominantly played on the right for Chelsea but will have competition from Pedro Neto and Estêvão next season, while Geovany Quenda is due to join from Sporting Lisbon next year. Chelsea are also monitoring Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho and Lyon’s Malick Fofana.Maresca was asked about Madueke’s situation after the win over Palmeiras. “Noni has been very important for us during this season,” he said. “Today, again, he has been important. But my message to the players and to the club is that I just want players that are happy to be with us. The ones that are not happy, they are free to go. It’s not for Noni, it’s for all the players we have.”Chelsea are also open to offers for Christopher Nkunku and could send the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George on loan. Madueke would be the second player to move from Chelsea to Arsenal this summer after the Spanish goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga joined for £5m.View image in fullscreenBrighton have confirmed the signing of Belgian defender Maxim De Cuyper from Brugge.Photograph: PA Wire/PABrightonhave confirmed the signing of the Belgian defender Maxim De Cuyper from Brugge. The 24-year-old has signed a five-year contract, with the deal worth a reported £17.5m, and is set to link up with his new teammates for the start of pre-season training this weekend.“Maxim is a creative left-back who has great experience at Champions League level as well as in the domestic league,” said Brighton’s head coach Fabian Hürzeler. “He has a great reputation for creativity and has shown his ability across different positions, although we primarily see him challenging for a left-back spot with us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are excited to work with him.” De Cuyper made his senior Belgium debut in June 2024 and has won 10 caps, scoring three goals.Leaving Brighton is the defender Odel Offiah, who has completed a move to Preston. The 22-year-old arrives at the Championship club on a four-year deal, which Preston said was for a “seven-figure fee”.Nottingham Foresthave signed the Brazil striker Igor Jesus on a four-year deal from Botafogo. The 24-year-old has recently returned from the Club World Cup, where he scored twice, includingthe winner against Paris Saint-Germain. He was selected for Brazil’s World Cup qualifiers in October and November, scoring against Chile on his debut.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Fifa/Getty ImagesThe arrival of Jesus boosts Forest’s frontline options, though Nuno Espírito Santocould lose Anthony Elanga, who is expected to join longtime admirers Newcastle in a deal worth about £55m.

I didn’t have to think twice about the offer. I am delighted to be coming here and hope to do some great work.”The versatile Forest full-back Neco Williams has signed a new deal until 2029, while Ola Aina is also expected to commit his future to the club.Manchester United have signed the Paraguay youth international Diego León. The 18-year full-back is their second signing of the summer after the arrival of theWolves forward Matheus Cunha.

In the second Test against West Indies in Grenada, Australia added 209 for five after resuming at a vulnerable 12 for two, taking their overall lead out to 254. The normality of the score is masked by the fact that several tropical rain delays kept play to 58.3 overs, so a full day’s play would likely have seen Australia bowled out and West Indies at least commencing the fourth innings. As it is, this match will now make it into a fourth day.It was Cameron Green and Steve Smith who created that sense of normality, after the nightwatch Nathan Lyon hung around for almost an hour before nicking Alzarri Joseph to third slip on eight. The fact that John Campbell held the catch in a faulty cordon was a boost for West Indies, but Green and Smith tamped that back down. Green had the occasional problem, with an inside edge past the stumps or a sharply lifting ball, but produced the most convincing innings of his brief foray to No 3 in the batting order, moving to 52 with the occasional powerful cut shot, and otherwise a lot of forward defence and working the ball around.It was after lunch when he played a perfect straight drive, his shot of the innings, to reach his fifty, then next ball chopped the ball on to his stumps attempting a late cut. Feeling he had wasted the hard work to the stage, he lost his bat as he swung it in frustration.View image in fullscreenWest Indies’ Shamar Joseph (left) celebrates the dismissal of Cameron Green (right) of Australia.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesBut at 121 for four, Travis Head walked out to crash his first ball through cover for four, and his free scoring seemed to ease some pressure on Smith. To that point Smith had looked more twitchy and unsure, playing conservatively but spasmodically trying an overly big shot that didn’t work with the variable bounce of this pitch, balls scooting under or jumping over the bat.With Head periodically smoking a drive, Smith’s aggressive shots came off, slotting Justin Greaves’ medium pace over mid on for four, and Roston Chase’s off spin over long off for six. Half century number 44 in his career came and went, but he couldn’t turn it into century number 37. It was shortly after tea, on 71, when Greaves got his own back, angling the ball in to smash pad, then bat, the on-field umpire ruling correctly.Australia have relied on Beau Webster of late, but Greaves got on a roll, drawing a hearty drive that Webster nicked to Chase for another successful slip catch. Head had a little flurry with fellow South Australian Alex Carey for seven overs, then was bowled for 39 by a ball angled in at the left-hander around the wicket. By that stage it was past the scheduled close, but two overs later, added time was ended when the umpires decided that the light was insufficient. Without light towers on the small island ground, nature must be respected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia’s lead of 254 would already be a testing chase on a pitch with enough inconsistencies, and the leading likelihood of those getting worse. The home side can’t afford to let those last three wickets add anything substantial on morning four, whereas Australia know that even another 50 runs will deflate their opponents. Showers may continue having an effect, but there is all the time in the world left for a result in a match this far along.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamSportblogWest Indies cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Tomorrow, back on it.”The Arsenal centre-back added to ITV: “[It was] cheap defending one-v-one, we learnt from those mistakes in fairness and grew in the game, but on the ball, [we were] not good enough, we couldn’t keep it in the areas that we needed to keep it, and we got better as they tired, we took advantage of that, but [it was] not enough in the end.“I think, everybody [has to] take responsibility for themselves today, have a look at ‘what areas could they have had an impact on the game more?’ - I will. But then tomorrow, we have a new gameplan [versus the Netherlands], different spaces available, a different type of opposition, but we’ll look at what we did today, and improve.”England were 2-0 at the break after a dominant spell of pressure from France in the latter part of the first half, but after the game, their head coach Sarina Wiegman defended their decision not to make any half-time substitutions. When asked why she did not make any changes at the break, she replied: “Because I had the conviction that having a short meeting at half-time [would mean] that we could do things better in the second half and I wanted to give them that opportunity. I think this team is capable so I didn’t want to swap straight away.”Wiegman also defended her decision to give Lauren James a first start since April, following a hamstring injury. The Chelsea forward had played just half an hour of football, against Jamaica last Sunday, before this tournament but Wiegman deemed her fit to face France. When asked if that had been a gamble or a mistake, Wiegman replied: “No, I don’t see it as a mistake, it was a choice. I think if she had scored in that first minute, and if the cross she made in the first half where we just couldn’t just get a head on it [had gone in], I think we’d be having a different conversation.”England defender Jess Carter said: “I think we played like we were a little bit scared today, maybe we weren’t aggressive enough, we maybe were worrying about their threats in behind and what they can do rather than doing what we can do. We didn’t do as well on the ball, or off the ball.“The only positive to take is that last 10 minutes, for me watching it from the side I really believed we would get a goal, I really felt like we could get a second goal. We have to focus on that 10 minutes that we did have at the end and take that over to the next game, the energy the subs brought on was incredible, really pressing and being aggressive. It’s something to take to the next game.”France, who reached the semi-finals in England three years ago, face Wales next, hoping to secure a place in the knockout stages. Their in-form winger Delphine Cascarino recognised that England had made a bright start but added: “Yes, we got scared initially at the beginning but we remained calm. We managed to get to our goal and our objective. We complied with our gameplan and we really controlled this match, I believe.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025France women's football teamEngland women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

In front of a partisan full house at the Estadio Uno in La Plata, an hour’s drive south of Buenos Aires, the century maker displayed his customary calm to steer the tourists through troubled waters early on.England were reduced to 13 when losing two players to the sin-bin before half-time, yet somehow made it to the interval ahead thanks to Ford’s drop goal. From there they were the only team in the contest. In a remarkable transformation Steve Borthwick’s team bagged four second-half tries, three in seven minutes between the 42nd and 49th minute.All Blacks hold off depleted France in thriller and Wales slump again in JapanRead moreTom Roebuck claimed two tries and Freddie Steward added a third, before Cadan Murley came off the bench to seal the deal late on.“It is all about the team, as always,” said Ford, deflecting praise away from his own milestone achievement. “We understand how difficult it is here in Argentina so it is a great win for us. We were under pressure in the first half; we gave away too many penalties and could not get out of our half. We had to make sure second half we got out of our half and create some try-scoring opportunities, which we did.“We have to back it up next week and we know Argentina will come back at us. Another challenge that we will look forward to.”Ford came into the game inspired by messages from Frank Lampard, John Terry and the former prime minister Tony Blair, a fly-half during his school days at Fettes College. The trio sent video tributes, along with adventurer Bear Grylls, and cricket stars Freddie Flintoff and Joe Root.He, himself, insisted it was “just another day at the office” but it did not feel that way as Alex Coles and Seb Atkinson were sent to the sin-bin repelling Argentina’s early charge.Quick GuideArgentina 12-35 England: first Test teams and scorersShowArgentinaElizalde (Roger 61); Isgro, Cinti, Piccardo, Cordero (Moroni 62); Carreras, Bertranou (Benítez Cruz 49); Vivas (Gallo 45), Montoya (capt; Bernasconi 72), Delgado (Coria Marchetti 45), Paulos (Grondona 54), Rubiolo, Matera, González, Isa (Moro 49).TriesMatera, Rubiolo.ConCarreras.EnglandSteward; Roebuck, Slade, Atkinson, Muir (Atkinson 71); Ford (co-capt), B Spencer (Van Poortvliet 57); Baxter (Rodd 57), George (co-capt; Dan 76), Heyes (Opoku-Fordjour 57), Ewels (Cunningham-South 49), Coles, B Curry, Underhill (Pepper 61); Willis (Dombrandt 61).Sin-binColes 16-26, Atkinson 21-31.Tries:Roebuck 2, Steward, Murley.ConsFord 3.PensFord 2.Drop goalFord.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The match could easily have got away from England at that stage given they were blooding three new caps in Atkinson, Will Muir and Guy Pepper.

It allowed them to lead at half-time, from where they took the game away from their hosts in hugely impressive fashion.Within two minutes Roebuck had his first, put over in the corner by Ford and Steward. Five minutes later Ford was at it again, zinging a pass to Steward for the second. Before the Pumas could get their head round what was happening, Roebuck helped himself to his second from a Heyes pass.Stung into a response, Argentina finally found a cutting edge. Pablo Matera pulled a try back, from SantiagoCarreras’s cross kick, and soon after Pedro Rubiolo added a second.A fortnight ago an England team very similar to this blew a 12-point lead to lose to France at Twickenham in the final five minutes of their non-cap international.For a moment it seemed the Pumas had the wind in their sails and could inflict further damage. But Ford stepped up, put a calm hand on the tiller and guided England away from danger.Two penalties, the conversion of Murley’s late try, and the match was won. It is only half-time in the series but given Borthwick had billed Argentina as “heavy favourites”, this was a statement win of which England can feel rightly proud.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionArgentina rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Musiala’s left ankle appeared to be dislocated following a challenge from Gianluigi Donnarumma just before half-time in Atlanta, with players from both teams covering their faces and looking away, clearly affected by what they had seen.TheBayern Munichcoach called the injury an “accident,” but the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer criticised Donnarumma’s challenge and the club’s sporting director, Max Eberl, said that the PSG goalkeeper had not taken sufficient care.Real Madrid v Borussia Dortmund: Club World Cup quarter-final – live updatesRead moreSupporters inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium booed the PSG goalkeeper in the second half. When the incident happened, Donnarumma had crouched down on his goalline, seemingly close to tears. At one point, he covered his face with his shirt. At half-time, he did not immediately go down the tunnel. Instead, he went towards Musiala and appeared to talk to some Bayern players, although he eventually turned back in the other direction.A goal from Désiré Douégave PSG a 1-0 lead with 11 minutes of normal time remaining of an intense and open game before PSG had two men sent off: Willian Pacho departed with eight minutes left and then Lucas Hernández was shown a red card after seeming to elbow Raphaël Guerreiro after 92 minutes. But with Bayern pressing, PSG broke away for Ousmane Dembélé to secure the victory. However, a superb game had been soured by Musiala’s injury.View image in fullscreenGianluigi Donnarumma looks devastated as he leaves the pitch at half-time following an injury to Bayern’s Jamal Musiala.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/FIFA/Getty Images“It was very emotional because we didn’t like what we saw at all,” Kompany said. “We hope it is not so serious and that he can get the best treatment. It didn’t look good. Just watching the images – you have probably seen it – it looks like an ankle injury of some type but I am not going to make a diagnosis here.“It was tough; I have rarely been so angry. Not against my players but just because …” Kompany said, pausing as if looking for the right words before adding: “There are many things in life that are more important but [for] these guys it’s their life and someone like Jamal lives for this. He’s here, after a setback and something like this happens. And you feel powerless.“We tried to take strength from it. We wanted to do it for Jamal but [it wasn’t to be]. The thing that gets my blood boiling is not the result, I understand that this is football; it is the fact that it happened to someone who enjoys the game so much and is very important for us.”Neuer was more explicit. “[This is] a situation where you don’t have to go in like that; that’s reckless,” he said. “He accepts the risk of injuring his opponent. I went to him and said: ‘Don’t you want to go to [check on] our player? It’s a question of respect to go over and wish the guy all the best. He did it afterwards. Fairness is always important.

His first serve thundered through at 145mph; on the third point, he upped it to 146mph and on the fifth, he bashed one down at 147mph. If Marton Fucsovics had picked up his rackets there and then and left the court, people would surely have understood.As it was, the Hungarian, ranked 105 having dropped from a high of No 31 in 2019, battled hard to compete but Shelton was a man on a mission, his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory putting him through to the last 16, equalling his previousWimbledonbest.Jannik Sinner barely breaks sweat to cruise through Martínez mismatchRead moreA hammer of a forehand gave Shelton the first break for 3-1 in the opener and when Fucsovics had the temerity to force a break-back point in the next game, he slammed down a serve at 148mph. That would have equalled the fastest-ever serve at Wimbledon had Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard not raised it to 153mph earlier this week.“I had a lot of fun,” Shelton said. “It’s always special playing at Wimbledon. This is my third time playing on Court No 1. Hopefully I get a few more matches on one of these two big courts. I’m trying to make my way to Centre Court. Maybe I’ll get there one day.”If he keeps playing this well, that’s an inevitability. Though the second set was tight all the way through, Shelton pulled away to take the tie-break 7-4 and an early break in the third set him on his way. As his powerful all-court game flowed, he raced to a 5-1 lead and though Fucsovics got one break back, the left-hander broke again to clinch a convincing victory that sets up a clash with Lorenzo Sonego of Italy.“He’s a great player,” Shelton said of the Italian. “I played him tight in Australia this year, I played him tight in Roland Garros so it’s only fitting we do it in Wimbledon. Grass is a good surface for him, it’ll be difficult, but I like my chances right now, the way I’m playing, the way the crowd is helping with my energy.”Sonego will need to find some energy somewhere after he edged out Brandon Nakashima 6-7 (5), 7-6 (8), 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3) in five hours and four minutes, the longest match of the tournament this year. The Italian won 45 of his 76 points at the net as he matched his previous best performance here.View image in fullscreenAlex de Minaur will get a shot at Novak Djokovic this year after being forced to withdraw before their scheduled match at Wimbledon last season.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesThis time last year, Alex de Minaur was due to face Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals only to withdraw before the match because of a hip injury that disrupted the rest of his year. On Saturday, the Australian ensured he will get another crack at the seven-time champion as he ended the run of the unheralded Dane August Holmgren 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-3.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And even that defeat, to the Czech player Tomas Berdych, was down to an elbow injury that forced him to retire.It is a staggering run, stretching over eight years and 45 matches. Yet rarely has Djokovic played as well as he did here against his fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic on Saturday night. Over the course of three destructive sets, Djokovic hit 60 winners to just 19 unforced errors as he put a masterclass of spin and subtlety, guile and laser-like power, to a wildly appreciative Centre Court.Wimbledon 2025: Djokovic races to victory; Sinner and Swiatek sail through – as it happenedRead moreCertainly Kecmanovic, the world No 49, had no answers. Then again, with the seven-time champion in this form, how many would? If anything the 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 score could have been even more emphatic.Victory left Djokovic beaming, especially when he was told that he had just become only the third player inWimbledonsingles’ history to enter the 100-win club, joining Martina Navratilova and Roger Federer. “It sounds very nice,” Djokovic said. “Particularly at this age, I am still going strong and still trying to compete with the younger players. I’m doing some slides and some splits on the court and am pushing myself to the limit.“Wimbledon is a dream tournament. And any history I make at my favourite tournament, I am blessed.”Initially we looked to be in for a contest of sorts. Djokovic started with an ace and won the first three points of the match. But Kecmanovic retaliated with a textbook drop shot and a forehand winner before forcing deuce.It set the early tone. Djokovic pressing, but with his opponent determined to resist. But, all of a sudden, the dam broke at 4-3. It came after one of the rallies of the tournament, a 14-shot thriller that twirled into life with an immaculate Djokovic drop shot.View image in fullscreen‘It is never easy playing a friend.’ Novak Djokovic and compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic embrace at the end.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAIt led to the players exchanging diving volleys at the net, before a lob volley by Djokovic had his opponent scrambling backwards. Somehow Kecmanovic got to the ball, and the subsequent smash, and even looked to be winning the point with a pass. But while Djokovic turned 38 in May, he is as spry as he ever was. Somehow he was able to launch his body towards the ball, Boris Becker-style, and hit a winning backhand volley.As the Centre Crowd crowd rose to applaud, Kecmanovic stood at the net smiling before playfully hitting a ball at Djokovic, his good friend and Davis Cup teammate. But it also seemed to implant a thought in his head: how the hell am I going to beat this guy?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came at a really important moment, as well. 4-3, deuce, long point. We were both running around each other, around the whole court. Then just that diving backhand volley down the line passing shot. Can’t wait to see the highlights!“I was pumped for that one,” he added. “Obviously I’m not diving as much on the courts. Obviously the only surface where you would dive is grass. But I’m not used to it as much. So these unique, rare moments are really something you cherish. Of course, if you win a point like this in an important moment, it is even better.”It had been a startlingly impressive opening, but it turned out Djokovic was just getting started. He raced through the second set in just 24 minutes, hitting 13 winners and just two unforced errors.When Kecmanovic finally stemmed the bleeding by holding his serve at the start of the third set, he felt compelled to raise his arms in triumph. But Djokovic continued to play God-mode tennis, and when a lob volley put him 5-1 up it looked like nothing could interrupt his flow.That wasn’t quite the case as a rowdy Centre Court crowd briefly distracted him. After losing three games in a row, he recovered his composure to book a last-16 match against Alex de Minaur, who beat August Holmgren in straight sets.“I enjoyed myself very much, except the last couple of games,” said Djokovic. “A bit of tension at the end, things got a bit complicated. It is never easy playing a friend and compatriot.”True. But over one hour and 48 minutes of engrossing tennis, Djokovic showed he means business. And while the bookies might think this year’s tournament is a near coin-toss between Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, write him off at your peril.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Novak DjokovicWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, Trump is using the UFC to project a nationalist cult of masculinitySat 5 Jul 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 15.06 EDTShareTen years ago – before I became an investigative journalist – I found myself working as a color commentator for a Russian mixed martial arts organization bankrolled by an oligarch deep in Vladimir Putin’s orbit.The job took me around the Russian Federation and its neighboring states, allowing me to pursue unique stories that would otherwise have been out of my reach. I met a Latvian fighter who escaped a black magic cult run by his coach, attended anMMAshow with the president of Ingushetia (now Russia’s deputy minister of defence) and knocked back vodka shots with ex-KGB officers and Russian oligarchs.Donald Trump says he wants to stage UFC fight on White House groundsRead moreThen there was the time the organization attempted to host an event in Moscow’s famed Red Square, one of the most historically and politically significant landmarks in Russia. It also sits adjacent to the Kremlin, the seat of Russia’s political power. The event would have been a chance for the organization and its oligarch to ingratiate themselves to Putin, a known MMA fan who had previously attended their shows.Logistical issues, including security concerns and layers of bureaucratic red tape, rendered the event impossible at the time. But the incident stuck with me nonetheless as an example of the political undercurrent flowing through the sport. That memory became especially relevant as Donald Trumpannounced plansto host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at the White House to commemorate the nation’s 250th birthday next year.Speaking to a crowd of supporters during a Salute to America event in Iowa Thursday, Trump said: “Does anybody watchUFC? The great Dana White? We’re going to have a UFC fight. We’re going to have a UFC fight – think of this – on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the news during the press briefing, adding that the president was “dead serious” about hosting a UFC event at the official residence and workplace of the president.The announcement comes as no surprise given Trump’s longstanding relationship with the UFC, its current owner Ari Emanuel and its CEO Dana White.Over the past few years, Trumphas frequently attended UFC events, basking in the admiration of the young, predominantly male crowd. He has cultivated relationships with fighters, leveraging their support to portray himself as a symbolic strongman. He has embraced the UFC’s culture of defiance, machismo and spectacle to help buttress his image as a rebel against liberal norms. It has also hastened the replacement of America’s conventional political culture with an abrasive new blend of entertainment and confrontational politics, perfectly embodied by both Trump and White.The UFC CEO stumped for Trump at three Republican national conventions and a slew of campaign rallies over the past eight years. He traveled with the president on Air Force One and produced a propaganda documentary on Trump entitled Combatant-in-Chief. And when Trump won the 2024 presidential election, it was White who took the stage at his victory party – because, naturally, Trump needed his fight promoter to seal the deal.For the UFC, its association with Trump has granted the once-renegade promotion a new kind of political legitimacy and influence. It also set it apart from other sports leagues through its unapologetically conservative posture. The UFC is evensponsoring the United States semiquincentennial, dubbed America250, joining the likes of Amazon, the Coca-Cola Company, Oracle and Walmart.Since taking office in January, Trump has attended two UFC events. He most recently attended UFC 316 in June just hours after signing a memo ordering the deployment of 2,000 national guard troops to Los Angeles county after Ice immigration raids sparked mass protests. He nevertheless enjoyed a standing ovation from the fans in attendance, and glowing endorsements from the fighters, one of whom even kneeled before Trump. UFC champion Kayla Harrison embraced him, planted a kiss on his cheek and wrapped her championship belt around his waist as his family and supporters looked on in delight. It was a spectacle befitting the strongman Trump imagines himself to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the natural climax of a partnership in which the UFC has become the stage for Maga mythology. It carries shades of fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, particularly its obsession with masculinity, spectacle and nationalism – but with a modern, American twist.View image in fullscreenWhen Trump won the 2024 presidential election, UFC CEO Dana White took the stage at his victory party in West Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesFascist Italy used rallies, parades and sports events to project strength and unity. Sports, especially combat sports, were used as tools to cultivate Mussolini’s ideal masculinity and portray Italy as a strong and powerful nation. Similarly, Trump has relied on the UFC to project his tough-guy image, and to celebrate his brand of nationalistic masculinity. From name-dropping champions who endorse him to suggesting a tournament that wouldpit UFC fighters against illegal immigrants, Trump has repeatedly found ways to make UFC-style machismo a part of his political brand.Since Trump returned to office in January, his presidency has been marked by a purge of federal agencies, crackdowns on dissent and immigration, and hollowing out institutions once designed as guardrails against abuses in presidential power. Loyalty to Trump, rather than the constitution and the American people, has become the primary litmus test for political advancement. Meanwhile,sports have emerged as a central feature of his administration, advancing his policies while projecting a cult of personality and the celebration of violence. All of these are the hallmarks of authoritarianism.There was once a time when the US could point to the authoritarian pageantry of regimes like Mussolini’s Italy and claim at leastsomemoral distance. That line is no longer visible. What was once soft power borrowed from strongmen is now being proudly performed on America’s own front lawn.Karim Zidan writes aregular newsletteron the intersection of sports and authoritarian politics.Explore more on these topicsUFCDonald TrumpMMAUS sportsVladimir PutinUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, without immediately elaborating, the former Trump adviserannouncedon X that he had created the so-called America party.“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,”wroteMusk, who is the world’s richest person and oversaw brutal cuts to the federal government after Trump’s second presidency began in January. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring they serve the true will of the people.”‘The vehicle suddenly accelerated with our baby in it’: the terrifying truth about why Tesla’s cars keep crashingRead moreMusk did not specify any seats he may be eyeing.In another post on Friday, when the US celebrated the 249th anniversary of its declaration of independence from the UK, Musk published a pollaskinghis X followers whether he should advance on his previously stated idea of creating the America party to contend against both Republicans and Democrats. More than 65% of about 1.25m responses indicated “yes” as of Saturday morning.“Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!” Musk also wrote in text accompanying the poll, which he promoted several times throughout Friday.Musk on Saturday then posted on X: “Today, the America party is formed to give you back your freedom.”He also wrote: “By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party, and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.”One of the replies to Musk’s announcement that he reposted showed a picture of a two-headed snake near the word “uniparty” as well as the logos of the Democratic and Republican parties.“End the Uniparty,” the reply said. Musk in turn responded to the reply with: “Yes.”He also suggested the party would run during the 2026 midterms.New political parties do not have to formally register with theFederal Election Commission“until they raise or spend money over certain thresholds in connection with a federal election”.Musk’s posts on Friday and Saturday came after he spent $277m of his fortune supporting Trump’s victorious 2024 presidential campaign. The Republican president rewarded Musk by appointing him to lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which abruptly and chaotically slashed various government jobs and programs while claiming it saved $190bn.But Doge’s actions may also have cost taxpayers $135bn, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan non-profit dedicated to studying the federal workforce.Musk left Doge at the end of May and more recently became incensed at Trump’s support for a budget bill that would increase the US debt by $3.3tn. Hethreatenedto financially support primary challenges against every member of Congress who supported Trump’s spending bill – along with promising to “form the America Party” if it passed.The House voted 218 to 214 in favor of the spending bill, with just two Republicans joining every Democrat in the chamber in unsuccessfully opposing it. In the Senate, JD Vance broke a 50-50 deadlock in favor of the bill, which Trump signed on Friday hours after Musk posted his America party-related poll.The Trump spending bill’s voting breakdown illustrated how narrowly the winning side in Congress carries some of the most controversial matters.Trump has warned Musk – a native of South Africa and naturalized US citizen since 2002 – that directly opposing his agenda would be personally costly. The president, who has pursued mass deportations of immigrants recently, publicly discussed deporting Musk from the US as well as cutting government contracts for some of his companies.“Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head to South Africa,” Trumppostedon his own social media platform, Truth Social.The president also told a group of reporters in Florida: “We might have to put Doge on Elon.

But a series of shocking incidents – from drivers trapped in burning vehicles to dramatic stops on the highway – have led to questions about the safety of the brand. Why won’t Tesla give any answers?Sönke Iwersen and Michael VerfürdenSat 5 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt was a Monday afternoon in June 2023 when Rita Meier, 45, joined us for a video call. Meier told us about the last time she said goodbye to her husband, Stefan, five years earlier. He had been leaving their home near Lake Constance, Germany, heading for a trade fair in Milan.Meier recalled how he hesitated between taking hisTeslaModel S or her BMW. He had never driven the Tesla that far before. He checked the route for charging stations along the way and ultimately decided to try it. Rita had a bad feeling. She stayed home with their three children, the youngest less than a year old.At 3.18pm on 10 May 2018, Stefan Meier lost control of his Model S on the A2 highway near the Monte Ceneri tunnel. Travelling at about 100kmh (62mph), he ploughed through several warning markers and traffic signs before crashing into a slanted guardrail. “The collision with the guardrail launches the vehicle into the air, where it flips several times before landing,” investigators would write later.The car came to rest more than 70 metres away, on the opposite side of the road, leaving a trail of wreckage. According to witnesses, the Model S burst into flames while still airborne. Several passersby tried to open the doors and rescue the driver, but they couldn’t unlock the car. When they heard explosions and saw flames through the windows, they retreated. Even the firefighters, who arrived 20 minutes later, could do nothing but watch the Tesla burn.At that moment, Rita Meier was unaware of the crash. She tried calling her husband, but he didn’t pick up. When he still hadn’t returned her call hours later – highly unusual for this devoted father – she attempted to track his car using Tesla’s app. It no longer worked. By the time police officers rang her doorbell late that night, Meier was already bracing for the worst.Customers described their cars suddenly accelerating or braking hard. Some escaped with a scare; others ended up in ditchesThe crash made headlines the next morning as one of the first fatal Tesla accidents in Europe. Tesla released a statement to the press saying the company was “deeply saddened” by the incident, adding, “We are working to gather all the facts in this case and are fully cooperating with local authorities.”To this day, Meier still doesn’t know why her husband died. She has kept everything the police gave her after their inconclusive investigation. The charred wreck of the Model S sits in a garage Meier rents specifically for that purpose. The scorched phone – which she had forensically analysed at her own expense, to no avail – sits in a drawer at home. Maybe someday all this will be needed again, she says. She hasn’t given up hope of uncovering the truth.Rita Meier was one of many people who reached out to us after we began reporting on theTesla Files– a cache of 23,000 leaked documents and 100 gigabytes of confidential data shared by an anonymous whistleblower. The first report we published looked at problems with Tesla’s autopilot system, which allows the cars to temporarily drive on their own, taking over steering, braking and acceleration.Though touted by the company as “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), it is designed to assist, not replace, the driver, who should keep their eyes on the road and be ready to intervene at any time.Autonomous driving is the core promise around whichElon Muskhas built his company. Tesla has never delivered a truly self-driving vehicle, yet the richest person in the world keeps repeating the claim that his cars will soon drive entirely without human help. Is Tesla’s autopilot really as advanced as he says?The Tesla Files suggest otherwise. They contain more than 2,400 customer complaints about unintended acceleration and more than 1,500 braking issues – 139 involving emergency braking without cause, and 383 phantom braking events triggered by false collision warnings. More than 1,000 crashes are documented. A separate spreadsheet on driver-assistance incidents where customers raised safety concerns lists more than 3,000 entries. The oldest date from 2015, the most recent from March 2022. In that time, Tesla delivered roughly 2.6m vehicles with autopilot software. Most incidents occurred in the US, but there have also been complaints from Europe and Asia. Customers described their cars suddenly accelerating or braking hard. Some escaped with a scare; others ended up in ditches, crashing into walls or colliding with oncoming vehicles. “After dropping my son off in his school parking lot, as I go to make a right-hand exit it lurches forward suddenly,” one complaint read. Another said, “My autopilot failed/malfunctioned this morning (car didn’t brake) and I almost rear-ended somebody at 65mph.” A third reported, “Today, while my wife was driving with our baby in the car, it suddenly accelerated out of nowhere.”Braking for no reason caused just as much distress. “Our car just stopped on the highway. That was terrifying,” a Tesla driver wrote. Another complained, “Frequent phantom braking on two-lane highways. Makes the autopilot almost unusable.” Some report their car “jumped lanes unexpectedly”, causing them to hit a concrete barrier, or veered into oncoming traffic.Musk has given the world many reasons to criticise him since he teamed up with Donald Trump. Many people do – mostly by boycotting his products. But while it is one thing to disagree with the political views of a business leader, it is another to be mortally afraid of his products. In the Tesla Files, we found thousands of examples of why such fear may be justified.View image in fullscreen‘My husband died in an unexplained accident. And no one cared.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianWe set out to match some of these incidents of autopilot errors with customers’ names. Like hundreds of other Tesla customers, Rita Meier entered the vehicle identification number of her husband’s Model S into the response form we published on the website of the German business newspaper Handelsblatt, for which we carried out our investigation. She quickly discovered that the Tesla Files contained data related to the car. In her first email to us, she wrote, “You can probably imagine what it felt like to read that.”There isn’t much information – just an Excel spreadsheet titled “Incident Review”. A Tesla employee noted that the mileage counter on Stefan Meier’s car stood at 4,765 miles at the time of the crash. The entry was catalogued just one day after the fatal accident. In the comment field was written, “Vehicle involved in an accident.” The cause of the crash remains unknown to this day. In Tesla’s internal system, a company employee had marked the case as “resolved”, but for five years, Rita Meier had been searching for answers. After Stefan’s death, she took over the family business – a timber company with 200 employees based in Tettnang, Baden-Württemberg. As journalists, we are used to tough interviews, but this one was different. We had to strike a careful balance – between empathy and the persistent questioning good reporting demands. “Why are you convinced the Tesla was responsible for your husband’s death?” we asked her. “Isn’t it possible he was distracted – maybe looking at his phone?”No one knows for sure. But Meier was well aware that Musk has previously claimed Tesla “releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately and always will”; that he has bragged many times about how its superior handling of data sets the company apart from its competitors. In the case of her husband, why was she expected to believe there was no data?Meier’s account was structured and precise. Only once did the toll become visible – when she described how her husband’s body burned in full view of the firefighters. Her eyes filled with tears and her voice cracked. She apologised, turning away. After she collected herself, she told us she has nothing left to gain – but also nothing to lose. That was why she had reached out to us. We promised to look into the case.Rita Meier wasn’t the only widow to approach us. Disappointed customers, current and former employees, analysts and lawyers were sharing links to our reporting. Many of them contacted us. More than once, someone wrote that it was about time someone stood up to Tesla – and to Elon Musk.Meier, too, shared our articles and the callout form with others in her network – including people who, like her, lost loved ones in Tesla crashes. One of them was Anke Schuster. Like Meier, she had lost her husband in a Tesla crash that defies explanation and had spent years chasing answers. And, like Meier, she had found her husband’s Model X listed in the Tesla Files. Once again, the incident was marked as resolved – with no indication of what that actually meant.“My husband died in an unexplained and inexplicable accident,” Schuster wrote in her first email. Her dealings with police, prosecutors and insurance companies, she said, had been “hell”. No one seemed to understand how a Tesla works. “I lost my husband. His four daughters lost their father. And no one ever cared.”Her husband, Oliver, was a tech enthusiast, fascinated by Musk. A hotelier by trade, he owned no fewer than four Teslas. He loved the cars. She hated them – especially the autopilot. The way the software seemed to make decisions on its own never sat right with her. Now, she felt as if her instincts had been confirmed in the worst way.We uncovered an ominous black box in which every byte of  customer data was collected – and sealed off from public scrutinyOliver Schuster was returning from a business meeting on 13 April 2021 when his black Model X veered off highway B194 between Loitz and Schönbeck in north-east Germany. It was 12.50pm when the car left the road and crashed into a tree. Schuster started to worry when her husband missed a scheduled bank appointment. She tried to track the vehicle but found no way to locate it. Even calling Tesla led nowhere. That evening, the police broke the news: after the crash her husband’s car had burst into flames. He had burned to death – with the fire brigade watching helplessly.The crashes that killed Meier’s and Schuster’s husbands were almost three years apart but the parallels were chilling. We examined accident reports, eyewitness accounts, crash-site photos and correspondence with Tesla. In both cases, investigators had requested vehicle data from Tesla, and the company hadn’t provided it. In Meier’s case, Tesla staff claimed no data was available. In Schuster’s, they said there was no relevant data.Over the next two years, we spoke with crash victims, grieving families and experts around the world. What we uncovered was an ominous black box – a system designed not only to collect and control every byte of customer data, but to safeguard Musk’s vision of autonomous driving. Critical information was sealed off from public scrutiny.Elon Musk is a perfectionist with a tendency towards micromanagement. At Tesla, his whims seem to override every argument – even in matters of life and death. During our reporting, we came across the issue of door handles. On Teslas, they retract into the doors while the cars are being driven. The system depends on battery power. If an airbag deploys, the doors are supposed to unlock automatically and the handles extend – at least, that’s what the Model S manual says.The idea for the sleek, futuristic design stems from Musk himself. He insisted on retractable handles, despite repeated warnings from engineers. Since 2018, they have been linked to at least four fatal accidents in Europe and the US, in which five people died.In February 2024, we reported on a particularly tragic case: a fatal crash on a country road near Dobbrikow, in Brandenburg, Germany. Two 18-year-olds were killed when the Tesla they were in slammed into a tree and caught fire. First responders couldn’t open the doors because the handles were retracted. The teenagers burned to death in the back seat.A court-appointed expert from Dekra, one of Germany’s leading testing authorities, later concluded that, given the retracted handles, the incident “qualifies as a malfunction”. According to the report, “the failure of the rear door handles to extend automatically must be considered a decisive factor” in the deaths. Had the system worked as intended, “it is assumed that rescuers might have been able to extract the two backseat passengers before the fire developed further”. Without what the report calls a “failure of this safety function”, the teens might have survived.1:14'I feel like I'm in the movies': malfunctioning robotaxi traps passenger in car – videoOur investigation made waves. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, Germany’s federal motor transport authority, got involved and announced plans to coordinate with other regulatory bodies to revise international safety standards. Germany’s largest automobile club, ADAC, issued a public recommendation that Tesla drivers should carry emergency window hammers. In a statement, ADAC warned that retractable door handles could seriously hinder rescue efforts. Even trained emergency responders, it said, may struggle to reach trapped passengers. Tesla shows no intention of changing the design.That’s Musk. He prefers the sleek look of Teslas without handles, so he accepts the risk to his customers. His thinking, it seems, goes something like this: at some point, the engineers will figure out a technical fix. The same logic applies to his grander vision of autonomous driving: because Musk wants to be first, he lets customers test his unfinished Autopilot system on public roads. It’s a principle borrowed from the software world, where releasing apps in beta has long been standard practice. The more users, the more feedback and, over time – often years – something stable emerges. Revenue and market share arrive much earlier. The motto: if you wait, you lose.Musk has taken that mindset to the road. The world is his lab. Everyone else is part of the experiment.By the end of 2023, we knew a lot about how Musk’s cars worked – but the way they handle data still felt like a black box. How is that data stored? At what moment does the onboard computer send it to Tesla’s servers? We talked to independent experts at the Technical University Berlin. Three PhD candidates – Christian Werling, Niclas Kühnapfel and Hans Niklas Jacob – made headlines for hacking Tesla’s autopilot hardware. A brief voltage drop on a circuit board turned out to be just enough to trick the system into opening up.The security researchers uncovered what they called “Elon Mode” – a hidden setting in which the car drives fully autonomously, without requiring the driver to keep his hands on the wheel. They also managed to recover deleted data, including video footage recorded by a Tesla driver. And they traced exactly what data Tesla sends to its servers – and what it doesn’t.The hackers explained that Tesla stores data in three places. First, on a memory card inside the onboard computer – essentially a running log of the vehicle’s digital brain. Second, on the event data recorder – a black box that captures a few seconds before and after a crash. And third, on Tesla’s servers, assuming the vehicle uploads them.The researchers told us they had found an internal database embedded in the system – one built around so-called trigger events. If, for example, the airbag deploys or the car hits an obstacle, the system is designed to save a defined set of data to the black box – and transmit it to Tesla’s servers. Unless the vehicles were in a complete network dead zone, in both the Meier and Schuster cases, the cars should have recorded and transmitted that data.View image in fullscreen‘Is the car driving erratically by itself normal? Yeah, that happens every now and then.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianWho in the company actually works with that data? We examined testimony from Tesla employees in court cases related to fatal crashes. They described how their departments operate. We cross-referenced their statements with entries in the Tesla Files. A pattern took shape: one team screens all crashes at a high level, forwarding them to specialists – some focused on autopilot, others on vehicle dynamics or road grip. There’s also a group that steps in whenever authorities request crash data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Some we tried to reach by email or phone. For others, we showed up at their homes. If they weren’t there, we left handwritten notes. No one wanted to talk.We searched for other crashes. One involved Hans von Ohain, a 33-year-old Tesla employee from Evergreen, Colorado. On 16 May 2022, he crashed into a tree on his way home from a golf outing and the car burst into flames. Von Ohain died at the scene. His passenger survived and told police that von Ohain, who had been drinking, had activated Full Self-Driving. Tesla, however, said it couldn’t confirm whether the system was engaged – because no vehicle data was transmitted for the incident.Then, in February 2024, Musk himself stepped in. The Tesla CEO claimed von Ohain had never downloaded the latest version of the software – so it couldn’t have caused the crash. Friends of von Ohain, however, told US media he had shown them the system. His passenger that day, who barely escaped with his life, told reporters that hours earlier the car had already driven erratically by itself. “The first time it happened, I was like, ‘Is that normal?’” he recalled asking von Ohain. “And he was like, ‘Yeah, that happens every now and then.’”His account was bolstered by von Ohain’s widow, who explained to the media how overjoyed her husband had been at working for Tesla. Reportedly, von Ohain received the Full Self-Driving system as a perk. His widow explained how he would use the system almost every time he got behind the wheel: “It was jerky, but we were like, that comes with the territory of new technology. We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that.”The Colorado State Patrol investigated but closed the case without blaming Tesla. It reported that no usable data was recovered.For a company that markets its cars as computers on wheels, Tesla’s claim that it had no data available in all these cases is surprising. Musk has long described Tesla vehicles as part of a collective neural network – machines that continuously learn from one another. Think of the Borg aliens from the Star Trek franchise. Musk envisions his cars, like the Borg, as a collective – operating as a hive mind, each vehicle linked to a unified consciousness.When a journalist asked him in October 2015 what made Tesla’s driver-assistance system different, he replied, “The whole Tesla fleet operates as a network. When one car learns something, they all learn it. That is beyond what other car companies are doing.” Every Tesla driver, he explained, becomes a kind of “expert trainer for how the autopilot should work”.According to Musk, the eight cameras in every Tesla transmit more than 160bn video frames a day to the company’s servers. In its owner’s manual, Tesla states that its cars may collect even more: “analytics, road segment, diagnostic and vehicle usage data”, all sent to headquarters to improve product quality and features such as autopilot. The company claims it learns “from the experience of billions of miles that Tesla vehicles have driven”.‘Lidar is lame’: why Elon Musk’s vision for a self-driving Tesla taxi falteredRead moreIt is a powerful promise: a fleet of millions of cars, constantly feeding raw information into a gargantuan processing centre. Billions – trillions – of data points, all in service of one goal: making cars drive better and keeping drivers safe. At the start of this year, Musk got a chance to show the world what he meant.On 1 January 2025, at 8.39am, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. The man behind the incident – US special forces veteran Matthew Livelsberger – had rented the vehicle, packed it with fireworks, gas canisters and grenades, and parked it in front of the building. Just before the explosion, he shot himself in the head with a .50 calibre Desert Eagle pistol. “This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wakeup call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence,” Livelsberger wrote in a letter later found by authorities. “What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives.”The soldier miscalculated. Seven bystanders suffered minor injuries. The Cybertruck was destroyed, but not even the windows of the hotel shattered. Instead, with his final act, Livelsberger revealed something else entirely: just how far the arm of Tesla’s data machinery can reach. “The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,” Musk wrote on X just hours after the blast. “Will post more information as soon as we learn anything. We’ve never seen anything like this.”Later that day, Musk posted again. Tesla had already analysed all relevant data – and was ready to offer conclusions. “We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,” he wrote. “All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.”Suddenly, Musk wasn’t just a CEO; he was an investigator. He instructed Tesla technicians to remotely unlock the scorched vehicle. He handed over internal footage captured up to the moment of detonation.The Tesla CEO had turned a suicide attack into a showcase of his superior technology.Yet there were critics even in the moment of glory. “It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,” warned David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, when contacted by a reporter. “When something bad happens, it’s helpful, but it’s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.”View image in fullscreen‘In many crashes, investigators weren’t even aware that requesting data from Tesla was an option.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThere are other examples of what Tesla’s data collection makes possible. We found the case of David and Sheila Brown, who died in August 2020 when their Model 3 ran a red light at 114mph in Saratoga, California. Investigators managed to reconstruct every detail, thanks to Tesla’s vehicle data. It shows exactly when the Browns opened a door, unfastened a seatbelt, and how hard the driver pressed the accelerator – down to the millisecond, right up to the moment of impact. Over time, we found more cases, more detailed accident reports. The data definitely is there – until it isn’t.In many crashes when Teslas inexplicably veered off the road or hit stationary objects, investigators didn’t actually request data from the company. When we asked authorities why, there was often silence. Our impression was that many prosecutors and police officers weren’t even aware that asking was an option. In other cases, they acted only when pushed by victims’ families.In the Meier case, Tesla told authorities, in a letter dated 25 June 2018, that the last complete set of vehicle data was transmitted nearly two weeks before the crash. The only data from the day of the accident was a “limited snapshot of vehicle parameters” – taken “approximately 50 minutes before the incident”. However, this snapshot “doesn’t show anything in relation to the incident”. As for the black box, Tesla warned that the storage modules were likely destroyed, given the condition of the burned-out vehicle. Data transmission after a crash is possible, the company said – but in this case, it didn’t happen. In the end, investigators couldn’t even determine whether driver-assist systems were active at the time of the crash.The Schuster case played out similarly. Prosecutors in Stralsund, Germany, were baffled. The road where the crash happened is straight, the asphalt was dry and the weather at the time of the accident was clear. Anke Schuster kept urging the authorities to examine Tesla’s telemetry data.Every road user trusts the cars around them not to be a threat. Does that trust still stand when a car is driving itself?When prosecutors did formally request the data recorded by Schuster’s car on the day of the crash, it took Tesla more than two weeks to respond – and when it did, the answer was both brief and bold. The company didn’t say there was no data. It said that there was “no relevant data”. The authorities’ reaction left us stunned. We expected prosecutors to push back – to tell Tesla that deciding what’s relevant is their job, not the company’s. But they didn’t. Instead, they closed the case.The hackers from TU Berlin pointed us to a study by the Netherlands Forensic Institute, an independent division of the ministry of justice and security. In October 2021, the NFI published findings showing it had successfully accessed the onboard memories of all major Tesla models. The researchers compared their results with accident cases in which police had requested data from Tesla. Their conclusion was that while Tesla formally complied with those requests, it omitted large volumes of data that might have proved useful.Tesla’s credibility took a further hit in a report released by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in April 2024. The agency concluded that Tesla failed to adequately monitor whether drivers remain alert and ready to intervene while using its driver-assist systems. It reviewed 956 crashes, field data and customer communications, and pointed to “gaps in Tesla’s telematic data” that made it impossible to determine how often autopilot was active during crashes. If a vehicle’s antenna was damaged or it crashed in an area without network coverage, even serious accidents sometimes went unreported. Tesla’s internal statistics include only those crashes in which an airbag or other pyrotechnic system deployed – something that occurs in just 18% of police-reported cases. This means that the actual accident rate is significantly higher than Tesla discloses to customers and investors.There’s more. Two years prior, the NHTSA had flagged something strange – something suspicious. In a separate report, it documented 16 cases in which Tesla vehicles crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. In each, autopilot disengaged “less than one second before impact” – far too little time for the driver to react. Critics warn that this behaviour could allow Tesla to argue in court that autopilot was not active at the moment of impact, potentially dodging responsibility.The YouTuber Mark Rober, a former engineer at Nasa, replicated this behaviour in an experiment on 15 March 2025. He simulated a range of hazardous situations, in which the Model Y performed significantly worse than a competing vehicle. The Tesla repeatedly ran over a crash-test dummy without braking. The video went viral, amassing more than 14m views within a few days.Mark Rober’s Tesa test driveThe real surprise came after the experiment. Fred Lambert, who writes for the blog Electrek, pointed out the sameautopilot disengagementthat the NHTSA had documented. “Autopilot appears to automatically disengage a fraction of a second before the impact as the crash becomes inevitable,” Lambert noted.And so the doubts about Tesla’s integrity pile up. In the Tesla Files, we found emails and reports from a UK-based engineer who led Tesla’s Safety Incident Investigation programme, overseeing the company’s most sensitive crash cases. His internal memos reveal that Tesla deliberately limited documentation of particular issues to avoid the risk of this information being requested under subpoena. Although he pushed for clearer protocols and better internal processes, US leadership resisted – explicitly driven by fears of legal exposure.We contacted Tesla multiple times with questions about the company’s data practices. We asked about the Meier and Schuster cases – and what it means when fatal crashes are marked “resolved” in Tesla’s internal system. We asked the company to respond to criticism from the US traffic authority and to the findings of Dutch forensic investigators. We also asked why Tesla doesn’t simply publish crash data, as Musk once promised to do, and whether the company considers it appropriate to withhold information from potential US court orders. Tesla has not responded to any of our questions.Elon Musk boasts about the vast amount of data his cars generate – data that, he claims, will not only improve Tesla’s entire fleet but also revolutionise road traffic. But, as we have witnessed again and again in the most critical of cases, Tesla refuses to share it.Tesla’s handling of crash data affects even those who never wanted anything to do with the company. Every road user trusts the car in front, behind or beside them not to be a threat. Does that trust still stand when the car is driving itself?Internally, we called our investigation into Tesla’s crash data Black Box. At first, because it dealt with the physical data units built into the vehicles – so-called black boxes. But the devices Tesla installs hardly deserve the name. Unlike the flight recorders used in aviation, they’re not fireproof – and in many of the cases we examined, they proved useless.Over time, we came to see that the name held a second meaning. A black box, in common parlance, is something closed to the outside. Something opaque. Unknowable. And while we’ve gained some insight into Tesla as a company, its handling of crash data remains just that: a black box. Only Tesla knows how Elon Musk’s vehicles truly work. Yet today, more than 5m of them share our roads.Some names have been changed.This is an edited extract from The Tesla Files by Sönke Iwersen and Michael Verfürden, published on 24 July by Penguin Michael Joseph at £22.

Same with the court of public opinionSat 5 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTShareLaws are for the poorsWouldn’t it be nice if, just now and again, bad things happened to bad people? Wouldn’t it be refreshing if violence against women was taken seriously instead of being treated like one big joke?Yes, but alas, that is not the world we live in. Over here in reality, we’ve got an adjudicatedsexual predatoras president, a defense secretary who has been accused ofsexual assaultandaggressive behaviourtowards his second wife, and a supreme court where a third of the male justices who get a final say on legal issues have beenaccused of sexual misconduct.And we’ve gotSean “Diddy” Combs: the disgraced entertainer who escaped this week with what many people consider to be a slap on the wrist after a New York jury delivered a mixed verdict in hisseven-week federal sex-trafficking trial. The trial was focused on allegations that Combs had coerced two women, including his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, to take part in “freak offs”: drug-fueled sexual encounters involving hired male prostitutes and humiliating acts.I don’t want to downplay the Diddy verdict. While Combs was acquitted on the most serious federal charges, of racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking, he was still found guilty of the lesser charges of transporting the male prostitutes he allegedly forced women to have sex with across state lines. The disgraced musician was also denied bail and is facing a barrage of new civil casesalleging abuse and assault. While we still don’t know how much time (if any) Combs will be sentenced to, he did not get off scot-free.I also don’t want to boil the results of a complex trial down to “misogyny”. It would be overly simplistic to say that the jury of eight men and four women in the Diddy trial simply didn’t believe women. The fact is Diddy was not on trial for being an abuser, or a bad person, or for his highly publicized battery of Cassie, one horrifying instance of which was caught on camera and the subject of a previous civil case. He was on trial for a specific set of charges, the most serious of which the prosecution did not have enough evidence to prove.But this is not to say that justice was done. Far from it. The trial is yet another demonstration that the legal system is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of intimate partner violence, the ways in which survivors deal with trauma, and the uneven power dynamics weaponized by abusers. If we had better legal frameworks for domestic violence and coercive control, perhaps prosecutors would not have turned to trafficking charges to try to secure justice.“Trafficking cases come with longer statutes of limitations, more severe penalties and more public support,” notes the human-trafficking expert Kimberly Mehlman-Orozcoin USA Today. “And existing domestic violence statutes are often outdated or ill-equipped to address coercive control, especially when the abuser is wealthy, powerful and legally savvy.”It’s not just the law that is ill-equipped to address coercive control – this complex issue is still minimized by some factions of the media. AWashington Post piece(written by two women), for example, described Combs as a “music producer turned modern-day Gatsby”, a framing which casts the “freak offs” as hedonism rather than something more sinister. The writer Sarah Kendzior notes that allusions to F Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby have been used to soften the image of high-level sexual predators like Jeffrey Epsteinfor decades.In the courts of public opinion, men like Combs are also far too often seen as playboys rather than predators. After the verdict on Wednesday, CNN reported that several spectators could be seenpouring baby oil on themselves, along with wearing T-shirts reading: A Freako is not a RICO (RICO is a reference to the racketeering charges).Perhaps what is most depressing about the Diddy verdict is that it is all too easy to imagine a path in which Combs finds his way back to prominence in public life. Donald Trump hasn’t ruledout pardoning Diddyand it is not inconceivable that he might; birds of a feather stick together, after all. Chris Brown still has a music career despite being charged with felony assault following a domestic violence incident when he beat upRihannain 2009.Brett Ratneris directing the very expensive Prime Video documentary about Melania Trump despite being accused ofsexual misconduct by six women(he hasdenied the claims). With enough money, good lawyers and the right connections, you can get away with almost anything.If you can call Sean Combs ‘Diddy’, you can respect someone’s preferred pronounsThe indictment against Diddy is titledUnited States of America v Sean Combs, AKA ‘Puff Daddy’, AKA ‘P.Diddy’, AKA ‘Diddy’, AKA ‘PD’, AKA ‘Love’. And yet some people think that calling someone by their preferred pronouns is too complicated.Horrific sexual violence used against Tigray’s women“Tigray is often described as a forgotten war,”Tess McClure writesin an incredibly disturbing but essential read. “If it has been forgotten, it is not by those who endured it, but by the global powers that looked away from one of the most brutal conflicts of this century.” That brutality includes reported wartime sexual abuse by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers against tens of thousands of Tigrayan women.After Texas banned abortion, more women nearly bled to death during miscarriagesMorebrilliant reporting from ProPublicaon the devastating effects of abortion bans.Men don’t sleep through baby cries after allThere’s a longstanding idea that women are fine-tuned to hear babies crying in a way that men aren’t.

The 60 Minutes settlement shows Trump has weaponized the agencyTom WheelerWhat was once an independent, policy-based agency is now using its leverage to further the Maga messageSat 5 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShareIt is time to unfurl the “Mission Accomplished” banner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Paramount Global, the parent of CBS Television, hasagreed to pay $16mto settle alawsuitbrought by Donald Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. Presumably, the FCC can now cease its slow-walking of the Paramount-Skydance Media merger.Just two days after the president took office, the agency’s new chair, Brendan Carr,inserted the FCCinto the issues in the Trump lawsuit that alleged “news distortion”. As the New York Postheadlined: “Trump’s FCC pick Brendan Carr says ‘60 Minutes’ editing scandal could affect Paramount-Skydance merger review.”That lawsuit was filed in the final week of the 2024 presidential campaign under theTexas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a statute historically used against false advertising. The case was filed in a single-judge federal district court that one legal publicationcharacterizedas “afavored jurisdictionfor conservative legal causes and plaintiffs”. CBS characterized the case as “without merit”.The 60 Minutes broadcast aired in October; theday before, a different excerpthad appeared on Face the Nation. Soon after, theCenter for American Rights– a group that describes itself as “a public interest law firm dedicated to protecting Americans’ most fundamental constitutional rights” – filed acomplaintat the FCC alleging CBS had engaged in “significant and substantial news alteration”. The complaint wasdismissedas seeking “to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment”. Immediately upon becoming the FCC chair, Carrreversedthat decision and ordered a formal proceeding on the matter (butlet standthe dismissal of a complaint against a local Fox stationover its 2020 election coverage).The election of Trump and the installation of a Trump-appointed FCC chair transformed the Paramount/CBS merger from a review of the public interest merits of the transfer of broadcast licenses into a broader question that included the 60 Minutes editing. Carrtoldan interviewer: “I’m pretty confident that the news distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction.”The formal paperwork for FCC approval of the license transfers wassubmitted10 months ago, on 6 September 2024. Now that the lawsuit has been settled, it will be interesting to see how quickly the FCC acts.The CBS case is just one example of the tactical leverage the Trump FCC regularly exerts over those it regulates. Carr, whowrote the FCC chapterin the “Project 2025” Maga blueprint, has not been shy about using this authority to achieve such political goals.Even before formally assuming the FCC chair position, Carr began exercising chair-like authority to advance the Maga agenda. This began with aletterto the CEOs of Alphabet (Google and YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Microsoft and Apple alleging: “you participated in a censorship cartel … [that is] an affront to Americans’ constitutional freedoms and must be completely dismantled.” Going beyond traditional FCC authority, he threatened: “As you know, Big Tech’s prized liability shield, Section 230, is codified in the Communications Act, which the FCC administers.” Carr suggested he might investigate whether those editorial decisions were made in good faith.Recently, Carrconditionedthe approval of Verizon’s acquisition of Frontier Communications on Verizon agreeing to drop its corporate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. Continuing his anti-diversity efforts, helaunched an investigationinto Comcast Corporation because it promotes DEI as “a core value of our business”.In his pre-FCC chair days, Carr championed press freedom. In a 2021statement, he wrote: “A newsroom’s decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official.” Once he became Trump’s FCC chair, however, he not only picked up on the 60 Minutes matter, but alsolaunchedan investigation into the public broadcasters NPR and PBS “regarding the airing of … programming across your broadcast member stations”.The FCC’s regulatory authority directly covers about one-sixth of the American economy while also affecting the other five-sixths that rely on the nation’s communications networks. What was once an independent, policy-based agency has been transformed into a performance-based agency, using any leverage it can discover or invent to further the Trump Maga message.Tom Wheeler was the chair of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpKamala HarrisUS politicsUS televisionUS television industryUS press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

Now, Trump is using the UFC to project a nationalist cult of masculinitySat 5 Jul 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 5 Jul 2025 15.06 EDTShareTen years ago – before I became an investigative journalist – I found myself working as a color commentator for a Russian mixed martial arts organization bankrolled by an oligarch deep in Vladimir Putin’s orbit.The job took me around the Russian Federation and its neighboring states, allowing me to pursue unique stories that would otherwise have been out of my reach. I met a Latvian fighter who escaped a black magic cult run by his coach, attended anMMAshow with the president of Ingushetia (now Russia’s deputy minister of defence) and knocked back vodka shots with ex-KGB officers and Russian oligarchs.Donald Trump says he wants to stage UFC fight on White House groundsRead moreThen there was the time the organization attempted to host an event in Moscow’s famed Red Square, one of the most historically and politically significant landmarks in Russia. It also sits adjacent to the Kremlin, the seat of Russia’s political power. The event would have been a chance for the organization and its oligarch to ingratiate themselves to Putin, a known MMA fan who had previously attended their shows.Logistical issues, including security concerns and layers of bureaucratic red tape, rendered the event impossible at the time. But the incident stuck with me nonetheless as an example of the political undercurrent flowing through the sport. That memory became especially relevant as Donald Trumpannounced plansto host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at the White House to commemorate the nation’s 250th birthday next year.Speaking to a crowd of supporters during a Salute to America event in Iowa Thursday, Trump said: “Does anybody watchUFC? The great Dana White? We’re going to have a UFC fight. We’re going to have a UFC fight – think of this – on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the news during the press briefing, adding that the president was “dead serious” about hosting a UFC event at the official residence and workplace of the president.The announcement comes as no surprise given Trump’s longstanding relationship with the UFC, its current owner Ari Emanuel and its CEO Dana White.Over the past few years, Trumphas frequently attended UFC events, basking in the admiration of the young, predominantly male crowd. He has cultivated relationships with fighters, leveraging their support to portray himself as a symbolic strongman. He has embraced the UFC’s culture of defiance, machismo and spectacle to help buttress his image as a rebel against liberal norms. It has also hastened the replacement of America’s conventional political culture with an abrasive new blend of entertainment and confrontational politics, perfectly embodied by both Trump and White.The UFC CEO stumped for Trump at three Republican national conventions and a slew of campaign rallies over the past eight years. He traveled with the president on Air Force One and produced a propaganda documentary on Trump entitled Combatant-in-Chief. And when Trump won the 2024 presidential election, it was White who took the stage at his victory party – because, naturally, Trump needed his fight promoter to seal the deal.For the UFC, its association with Trump has granted the once-renegade promotion a new kind of political legitimacy and influence. It also set it apart from other sports leagues through its unapologetically conservative posture. The UFC is evensponsoring the United States semiquincentennial, dubbed America250, joining the likes of Amazon, the Coca-Cola Company, Oracle and Walmart.Since taking office in January, Trump has attended two UFC events. He most recently attended UFC 316 in June just hours after signing a memo ordering the deployment of 2,000 national guard troops to Los Angeles county after Ice immigration raids sparked mass protests. He nevertheless enjoyed a standing ovation from the fans in attendance, and glowing endorsements from the fighters, one of whom even kneeled before Trump. UFC champion Kayla Harrison embraced him, planted a kiss on his cheek and wrapped her championship belt around his waist as his family and supporters looked on in delight. It was a spectacle befitting the strongman Trump imagines himself to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the natural climax of a partnership in which the UFC has become the stage for Maga mythology. It carries shades of fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, particularly its obsession with masculinity, spectacle and nationalism – but with a modern, American twist.View image in fullscreenWhen Trump won the 2024 presidential election, UFC CEO Dana White took the stage at his victory party in West Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesFascist Italy used rallies, parades and sports events to project strength and unity. Sports, especially combat sports, were used as tools to cultivate Mussolini’s ideal masculinity and portray Italy as a strong and powerful nation. Similarly, Trump has relied on the UFC to project his tough-guy image, and to celebrate his brand of nationalistic masculinity. From name-dropping champions who endorse him to suggesting a tournament that wouldpit UFC fighters against illegal immigrants, Trump has repeatedly found ways to make UFC-style machismo a part of his political brand.Since Trump returned to office in January, his presidency has been marked by a purge of federal agencies, crackdowns on dissent and immigration, and hollowing out institutions once designed as guardrails against abuses in presidential power. Loyalty to Trump, rather than the constitution and the American people, has become the primary litmus test for political advancement. Meanwhile,sports have emerged as a central feature of his administration, advancing his policies while projecting a cult of personality and the celebration of violence. All of these are the hallmarks of authoritarianism.There was once a time when the US could point to the authoritarian pageantry of regimes like Mussolini’s Italy and claim at leastsomemoral distance. That line is no longer visible. What was once soft power borrowed from strongmen is now being proudly performed on America’s own front lawn.Karim Zidan writes aregular newsletteron the intersection of sports and authoritarian politics.Explore more on these topicsUFCDonald TrumpMMAUS sportsVladimir PutinUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Some liken his loyalty demands, patronage networks and intimidation tactics to the methods of a mafia don. Others cast him as a feudal overlord, operating a personality cult rooted in charisma and bound by oaths, rewards and threats rather than laws and institutions. A growing number of artists and AI creatives are depicting himas a Viking warrior. And of course, fierce debates continue over whether the moment has arrived for serious comparisons with fascist regimes.While some of these analogies may offer a degree of insight, they are fundamentally limited by their Eurocentrism – as if 21st-centuryUS politicsmust still be interpreted solely through the lens of old-world history. If we truly want to understand what is unfolding, we must move beyond Scandinavian sagas and Sicilian crime lore.I’ve found it increasingly difficult not to see striking parallels between recent events in the US and the rise of cold war-era dictatorships in Africa. It began with Trump’srenaming of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, which recalled how Mobutu Sese Seko, on a personal whim, changed Congo into Zaire in 1971.Geographical renaming has been extensive in Africa because of its history of colonialism, but now the US has started changing names too.Trump’sdeployment of national guard troopsand marines to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids also echoed Mobutu’s preferred method for dealing with civil unrest: presidential guards patrolling the streets to crush protests. The blunt use of military force to suppress domestic opposition is a tactic associated with figures such as Idi Amin in Uganda, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe andPaul Biya in Cameroon– albeit with deadlier consequences.View image in fullscreenMobutu Sese Seko addresses reporters outside his residence in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 23 March 1997.Photograph: Remy de la Mauvinière/APTrump’s aggressive deportation of undocumented Latino workers also resembles Amin’s 1972 expulsion ofUganda’s Asian minority. Amin framed it as a way to return economic power to “the ordinary Ugandan”, but it led to financial ruin. The embrace of bizarre, theatrical economic measures that look great on television but wreak havoc in practice is another striking parallel. Trump’s tariffs, announced with patriotic fanfare on “liberation day”, evoke Mugabe’s grandiose land reforms of the 1980s, which hastened Zimbabwe’s collapse.Anti-intellectualism, egomania and delusions of grandeur were hallmarks of dictatorships in Africa. Ivory Coast’s Félix Houphouët-Boigny built a replica of St Peter’s Basilica in his home town. Jean-Bédel Bokassa crowned himself “emperor” of Central African Republic. “Marshal” Mobutu ensured thatConcorde could landin his native village. A similar extravaganza of ambitionhas reached the US, with Trumpaccepting a luxury Boeing 747from Qatar and hoping his face will becarved into Mount Rushmorebeside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.The army parade in Washington on the day the US military turned 250 and Trump turned 79 was another moment of self-aggrandising narcissism. A populist personality cult and masculine pride often go hand in hand with deep paranoia and contempt. Trump’s relentless war on academia and the free press fits squarely within this tradition. In Equatorial Guinea, President Francisco Macías Nguema outlawed the word “intellectual” and prosecuted academics. Amin terrorised universities to the point of brain-drain.At first glance, viewing Trump as a westernised version of one of Africa’s dictators may seem jarring. After all, his interest in the continent appears limited to its natural resources, not its political models. The trade tariffs and travel bans he recently unleashed have hit several African countries hard, and his cruel withdrawal of aid hardly suggests admiration for anything African.What’s more, Trump hasnever set foot on African soiland reportedly dismissed the continent as a cluster of “shithole countries”. Only when a raw materials deal is in sight does he spring into life, such as last week when a “peace deal” between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda was signed at the White House. “We’re getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it,” Trump said.But once the comparison between Trump and a cold war dictator is made, it becomes hard to unsee. And it shouldn’t surprise us. The postcolonial dictator was, to a significant degree, an American creation. Sooner or later, it had to come home.The US supported repressive regimes unconditionally during the cold war, viewing them as bulwarks against communism – not just in Africa, but in Asia and Latin America. Dictators such as Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Suharto in Indonesia, Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Jorge Rafaél Videla in Argentina remained in power for decades thanks to US backing. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the US abruptly abandoned these allies and championed the gospel of democratisation. Though the 1990s were rich in rhetoric about human rights, good governance and the rule of law, on the ground the spectre of autocracy never vanished entirely.We’re now witnessing a startling reversal. With the demise of USAID and its retreat from a role promoting global democracy, it’s not only that the US has turned its back on democratising countries in Africa and elsewhere – but that it has begun to imitate some of the worst historical examples of authoritarian rule.Viewing Trump’s regime through the lens of cold war-era autocracies in postcolonial states offers a framework that is both alarming and oddly reassuring.If there is one enduring lesson from the history of autocracy in Africa, it is this: things can turn ugly, fast. Cold war dictatorships were ruthless, bloody and often ended in chaos and state collapse. Yet their histories also show that when courts are neutered and legislatures reduced to rubber stamps, civil society, independent media and the moral force of religious and academic institutions can emerge as the last formidable strongholds against tyranny. After all, sooner or later, dictators die, whereas collective efforts remain.David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

There is a mountain to climb but should the incumbents stumble badly, the Coalition is the only viable governing option. In Australia, governments lose office rather than oppositions win.The Coalition must regroup quickly, hold the government to account and commence serious policy development based on its enduring values.Sussan Ley must define herselfbefore her opponents do. She can begin by going on the road and engaging with and listening to her fellow Australians.The debacle over the work from home policy in the last election inevitably has revived calls for gender quotas, suggesting that would make the party more in touch. It’s a great announceable, signalling a change in the party culture. There are strong arguments for and against given the more individualistic ethos of theLiberal party.If the Liberals want to appeal again to aspirational Australians, they could start by taxing wealth | Judith BrettRead moreDelivering such a structural change is fraught with risk. It would require herding the cats of state divisions. The issue will probably become another front in the internal culture wars as it is already identified by detractors as a “left” issue. It could spark a proxy leadership contest. Leaders must pick their fights and win. Is this the hill that Ley is prepared to die on?It may be better to tackle this issue through the prism of party reform including more open membership and nomination processes. This is on the agenda in New South Wales and that’s good as far as it goes. There is however a case for giving party directors more say in candidate identification and development, including testing candidate profiles in the electorate. The late secretary of the NSW Liberal party, Senator John Carrick, was a master at this.Better candidate pathways also require that Liberal party factions and groupings be house trained. Formal power sharing to give everyone a voice at the table might help. Robust policy arguments between liberals and conservatives within the broad Liberal church are necessary and desirable but there can be no winner-take-all mentality. The party interest should trump factional interests.1:39'We got smashed': Sussan Ley reflects on Coalition's historic election defeat – videoTheCoalitionhas to double down on its traditional strengths of economic management and national security, reflecting long-held values that elevate the national interest above sectional interests. Failure to control spending and taxation levels is a basic test of managerial competence.If you cannot manage the budget, you cannot manage the country.National defence is core government business. At present, more guns mean less butter, unless we radically improve our productivity. Governments need to take the public into their confidence about our rapidly changing strategic circumstances that require the most significant industrial mobilisation since the second world war. Economic reform and resilience are intimately connected to our capacity to maintain Aukus and other programs without shredding the national budget.Social policies must be embedded in a Liberal vision of society. That means supporting the family unit, in all its contemporary manifestations, strengthening the sinews of civil society as a counter to big government, monopolistic businesses and powerful trade unions. An overriding regard for the rights of the individual as opposed to the collective. Liberals have long recognised the social benefit of high rates of home ownership.Does the Liberal party need to change its values to survive? - podcastRead moreDonald Trump’s presidencies have energised the more conservative elements of the global right, promoting economic populism, “traditional” values, nativism and a disdain for liberal elites that enforce drab conformism and cancel culture. In Australia this translates into a view that the centre is Labor-lite territory and there is a poultice of votes on the more conservative right, which represents a silent majority of voters, the “real” people.View image in fullscreenLiberal leader Peter Dutton conceding defeat on election night.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/ReutersIt’s true that major parties can be Tweedledum and Tweedledee if they huddle too closely to each other. The risk for parties that go too far in one direction is to cede too much ground to their opponents. However, the centre also shifts depending on the salience of specific issues. If immigration appears out of control, for example, voters will give it a higher priority. The alchemy of politics lies in judging the Goldilocks moment, when policy is neither too right nor too left but just right.Dutton misjudged the alchemy, allowing himself to be tagged with the Trump brush, not having defined himself over the last three years. Dutton did not need to agree with the government on everything. But politics is about arithmetic and building a big tent.In 1996, John Howard improved the electability of the Coalition by taking the rough edges off many Fightback era policies, including embracing Medicare and putting a safety net under industrial relations reforms.One pole of the big tent is addressing climate change in a pragmatic fashion. The weather is changing and nations that adapt quickly will gain a first mover advantage. Business and communities can see what is coming and are moving to address the issue, even if some governments want to turn back the clock. Most Australians will support sensible measures that provide affordable, abundant and clean energy with appropriate back up. The British Conservative party crossed this bridge some time ago. Failing to engage on the issue in a factual way makes it almost impossible to talk to those who regard this as a high priority, such as younger voters and Teal supporters.Arthur Sinodinos is a former Australian ambassador to the US.

It was an article of faith that Australia would have 10 years warning to prepare for any conflict, and that the nation the defence minister calls our capital-A ally wouldspring to our defence.The 10-year buffer was debunked in the 2020 defence review, and the update two years later concluded that the Australian Defence Force “as currently constituted and equipped isnot fully fit for purpose”.As the US administration scrambles many of the accepted norms of the past 80 years and urges all its allies to spend more money to militarise, the reliability of our Ally is now a matter of intense public debate.But this is not just a geopolitical dilemma, or an abstract discussion about scenarios.A recent report by the Australian National Audit Office highlights shortcomings in the defence department in managingcontracts and even investigating bribery claims. It also found it failed to provide regular formal and detailed ministerial briefings about thescale of imminent threats.Aukus deal’s importance ‘well understood’ by Trump administration, Penny Wong says – but no iron-clad guarantee givenRead moreThis suggests that greater security would not necessarily be assured by spending billions more on big, shiny machines and weapons that inevitably cost more than predicted and, almost as inevitably, fail to live up to the sales spiel embodied in the tender document.The shortcomings that cause concern about security lie even closer to home. The number of people employed in the ADF has beenfalling for decades. Atlast countthere were only 57,226 permanent staff in the army, navy and air force, another 32,560 in the reserves and a similar number of civilians in the department. By comparison, Woolworths employs 210,000 people.If the pandemic taught us nothing else, it is that food security is important. But so is national security. That takes on many new dimensions these days on land, sea, air, space and in cyberspace, and most importantly security in our homes, cities and communities.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAustralia is still low on the list of countries facing imminent invasion or attack but attempts to neutralise the continent could arrive with devastating stealth.The rumble of natural disaster and war is such a constant these days that it is easy to forget that when they land, they erupt in a flash. One day you are going about your normal life and then suddenly it changes, everything you took for granted gone.For years the consequences of these catastrophes have provided an unwelcome backdrop to daily life. Images of death and devastation delivered by terrifying military machines in Ukraine, Gaza, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Sudan and Iran flicker across our screens, competing with images of lives and communities devastated by floods, fires, droughts and cyclones.It is striking that even in the publicly available documents about defence preparedness, climate change is a major talking point.Reading between the lines, it’s not hard to see that the destructive regional impact of climate change – inundated islands, devastated economies, shattered lives – keeps defence strategists up at night. Experience has shown that when natural disasters strike, resilience is tested to breaking point.We have become accustomed to hearing that the ADF is being deployed to assist during climate-triggered disasters, sometimes with tragic unintended consequences, as the2020 Canberra firesand thetragic accident near Lismoreduring the recent Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.The review of defence capacity has made it clear that the ADF should only be used as a “last resort” during disasters, a recommendation that the government agreed to “in principle”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there is no public sign of discussion about an alternative civilian defence force being actively developed – people with the skills to know what to do when disaster happens.One of the more important observations in the review that didn’t make it into the recommendations was about social resilience. Resilience is an overused weasel word, but making it real means “equipping communities to absorb shocks, adapt to new conditions, and (potentially) transform itself as a result of particular shocks”.Looking around the world, there are lessons about how this might be done, and ANU’s National Security College hasbegun a national consultationabout what Australians think security might look like, beyond the missiles, drones, frigates, fighter planes and submarines.Will the Aukus submarine deal go belly up? - podcastRead moreNations that share borders with potential aggressors, likeFinlandand Poland, have maintained active civil defence operations, or those living with threat, like Taiwan and Israel, have built bunkers,car parksthat transform into hospitals to protect citizens.Nearly athird of the fundsthat the Nato countries agreed to commit to increased defence spending demanded by the US is going to this civilian security, protecting the infrastructure that makes life possible.In Australia we have barely begun to have this conversation, though we are told almost daily that the threat is growing. The pandemic and natural disasters highlighted the gaps, but typically we stalled on the next steps. Activating real civic resilience could be a KPI for the prime minister’s progressive patriotism, much as his predecessor John Curtin once did.This might be more effective than shipping more dollars overseas to buy ever more complex machines that can, as we see nightly on the news, be destroyed by another even bigger machine.Julianne Schultz an emeritus professor at Griffith University and the author of The Idea of Australia​Explore more on these topicsAustralian militaryOpinionAustralian foreign policyAukuscommentShareReuse this content"

The Bank of England’s decision to ask the public what they want on their cash stirs the same “too little, too late” sentiment in me. Still, it is nice to take a day off from the cynicism and tackle the question with sincerity: what item, idea or thing best represents Britain? So much comes to mind: aGreggs vegan sausage roll; a rail replacement bus; atraffic conestuck somewhere it’s not supposed to be. All things quintessentially British. However, there is nothing as irrefutably representative of our national character than themeal deal. An unsatisfying sandwich, a shrinkflation-hit packet of crisps and a flat fizzy drink. Functionally satiating and depressing at the same time. Stick that on your fiver and spend it (since that’s what a meal deal seems to cost these days).The ubiquitous robin redbreast is the democratic choiceDavid ReynoldsProfessor of international history at Cambridge UniversityDespite being a historian, I welcome the Bank of England’s decision to move away from historical and cultural figures. Icons touch too many nerves. I like theBermudian ideaof using flora and fauna to capture a country’s distinctive identity. A shift like this would show that we’re not trapped in tradition. It also plays to the passion for gardens even in thesmallest of spacesand gently reminds us of the climate crisis that is being pushed dangerously to the sidelines. Of course, the precise choice of plants and animals will also generate controversy but one on which everyone can, and will, have a view, ensuring it’s democratic rather than elitist. Personally, I would make a special plea to include therobin redbreast– colourful in voice and appearance all through the year.At a time of division, let’s laugh at ourselves and choose the seagullCoco KhanWriter and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UKSadly, the Bank of England has excluded “living people” from the criteria of what should adorn the new banknotes, which rules out my first choice: the “what a sad little life, Jane” guy. Hear me out. If you haven’t seen the iconic piece of British television to which this refers (it’s a line from an indignant concession speech by a contestant on Come Dine With Me), get thee to YouTube at once. It’s a television moment that has burrowed its way deep into the psyche of large swathes of the public. And at a time of enormous division, what could be amore unifying source of national pride than our irreverent sense of humour? Perhaps this tone applied to the allowed criteria could bear fruit. Native animals and landscapes? Got to be a seagull, chip in beak. Architecture and landmarks? Surely the wheelie bin. Admittedly none are as worthy as say, the suffragettes or the Windrush generation, or feel as emotional as the NHS or our precious rivers and lakes. But it would be a bold message to the world: here we are, a nation so resilient, thick-skinned and confident it can even gently laugh at itself.Lincoln Cathedral reminds us of the endurance of communityConnor MyersStudent at the University of Exeter and a Guardian internIt’s often London-based landmarks that occupy the nation’s imagination with these things. So, with an eye on representing Britain’s architectural heritage and the ingenuity of our early craftsmen outside of the capital, I proposeLincoln Cathedral. A perhaps radical but entirely worthy option, the structure overtook the Great Pyramid of Giza to become the world’s tallest building upon its completion in 1311. The majority of the cathedral still stands to this day, having withstood wars and periods of rapid social change. And, having housed one of onlyfour survivingcopies of Magna Carta, its importance to the British democratic tradition is hard to overstate. In a world moving away from cold, hard, physical cash, Lincoln Cathedral on the notes that remain in circulation would remind us of the ambition of those who came before us, and the endurance of the communities that kept it standing.Removing barriers of race, colour and creed: the London MarathonHenry BonsuBroadcaster and journalistNot so long ago, the Bank of England would have been on safe ground. Back when people and tastes were more monochrome, it was relatively easy to decide which historical figures had enough universal appeal to appear on our banknotes. But now that even a Labour prime minister can declare we’re becoming an “island of strangers”, how do we agree on a notable figure who can withstand the fury of today’s culture wars? Thankfully, the bank has widened the net to include suggestions from the worlds of architecture, popular culture, nature or great events. This means that as well asOlaudah Equiano, an enslaved African who bought his freedom and became a great 18th-century abolitionist and writer, I can suggest an annual occasion that truly speaks not just to who we are, but who we might become if only we listened to our better angels. It attractsmore active participantsthan any other event of its kind, it removes barriers of race, colour or creed rather than erecting them, and sends a healthy message around the world about Britain and the people who live here. I speak of course of the London Marathon.

I was born in 1988, a year before the Iran-Iraq war came to an end. For my generation, war was something that belonged to the past – an impossible event, until this summer.For 12 days, we lived in the capital under incessant Israeli attacks, and what we saw has changed us for good: dead neighbours, buildings gutted and worry – endless, deep-etched worry – on the faces of people.There is comfort in speaking of “the Iranian people” as though we are one unified bloc. But like most societies, Iranians hold divergent views. When fighting first broke out, there were people who were glad to see a foreign power targeting the widely disliked Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) top brass, at least in the beginning. But others – though dissidents themselves – deeply resented the idea of foreign invasion. Some hardliners saw this war as a messianic mission to be carried through to the bitter end; others were numb to what was happening.But as the news filled with footage of civilian casualties, and the attacks grew harsher and less targeted, different social factions began to unite around the notion ofwatan, homeland. Patriotism gained new currency, and national pride was on most lips. Scenes of solidarity – whether lasting remains to be seen – abounded: landlords cancelling rent in light of the crisis; people outside Tehran hosting those fleeing the capital; no rush to grocery stores, no chaos, no panicked evacuations.In my view, the way European countries responded to Israel’s onslaught played a key role in this shift. The E3, alongside other silent nations across the continent,supportedthe Israeli strikes, using all the usual justifications, from Iran’snuclear programmeto itssupport for terrorism, all while the US president painted a rosy image of Iran’s supposed greatness the “day after’”on his Truth Social. But those of us in the Middle East know better. Images of fresh devastation in Gaza appear daily, and we remember the chaos in Libya, civil war in Syria, two decades of occupation in Iraq and the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan. There was no promise in these conflicts – no seeds of democracy being planted.Surely, the naked reality of Israel’s aggression would register with the same powers that rightly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – so that yet another war would not crush the region once again. And surely, these attacks – brutal, unprovoked, deliberate – should have been met with a flood of condemnation and fury at the disregard for the UN charter. But none came.The silence was deafening. A reminder that Iranian lives, clearly, carry less worth than those of others. This, for many of us, was the main takeaway from the support western countries extended to Israel. The war was on Iran, but it was justified through the same old playbook: racism. The indifference and inaction of those with the power to intervene; the media’s passive tone when referring to non-white casualties; the habitual disregard for their suffering; and the blase attitude towards attacks on lands outside the western orbit – with the German chancellor evensaying: “This is dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us.”Don’t count on the Iran-Israel ceasefire lasting. What Netanyahu really wants is a forever war | Simon TisdallRead moreMany Iranians are angry at this injustice – so much so that the idea of building a nuclear weapon, once confined to the radical fringes of politics, is now gaining traction among ordinary people. As one user put it on X: “No one seems concerned about the state of human rights in North Korea,” implying that nuclear warheads remain the only reliable deterrent against aggression.It would be foolish to trust Israel with a ceasefire. The country has a track record of violating agreements with impunity. That means a Damoclean sword still hangs over Tehran, even as the sound of explosions fades. From afar, this city of over 10 million people may appear to have returned to its usual bustle. But uncertainty still hangs in the air, and what makes it worse is the absence of any credible broker capable of ending the war. For many here, the west’s tacit, explicit or even active participation in the conflict disqualifies it from any role as a good-faith negotiator.From where I stand, once again, feelings of mistrust towardsEuropeare bedding in. Buildings will be rebuilt, infrastructure repaired. But what may be damaged beyond repair – perhaps irredeemably so – is the moral fabric on which Europe stands to preach to others. The double standards. The hypocrisy. The injustice of it all. The imperial mindset – still visibly alive and well – now casts a long shadow over how Europe is perceived. Not just for Iranians, I suspect, but for many people across the global south.These are hard times to live through. Whether the Islamic republic survives this moment, strikes a deal, or continues down its current path of retaliation, I do not know. But what is sure is that whoever governs Iran in the future will not forget what happened here.Hossein Hamdieh holds a joint PhD in Geography and Anthropology from Humboldt University of Berlin and King’s College London.

Two recent studies have different takes on this decades-long controversy. The answer might be more complicated, and more interesting, than either study suggests.One study, led by Ivan Kroupin at the London School of Economics,asked howpeople from different cultures perceived a visual illusion known as the Coffer illusion. They discovered that people in the UK and US saw it mainly in one way, as comprising rectangles – while people from rural communities in Namibia typically saw it another way: as containing circles.To explain these differences, Kroupin and colleagues appeal to a hypothesis raised more than 60 years ago and argued about ever since. The idea is that people in western industrialised countries (these days known by the acronym “weird” – forwestern, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic– a summary that is increasingly questionable) see things in a specific way because they are generally exposed to highly “carpentered” environments, with lots of straight lines, right angles – visual features common in western architecture. By contrast, people from non-“weird” societies – like those in rural Namibia – inhabit environments with fewer sharp lines and angular geometric forms, so their visual abilities will be tuned differently.The Weirdest People in the World review – a theory-of-everything studyRead moreThe study argues that the tendency of rural Namibians to see circles rather than rectangles in the Coffer illusion is due to their environments being dominated by structures such as round huts instead of angular environments. They back up this conclusion with similar results from several other visual illusions, all supposedly tapping into basic brain mechanisms involved in visual perception. So far, so good for the cross-cultural perceptual psychologists, and for the “carpentered world” hypothesis.The second study, by Dorsa Amir and Chaz Firestone, takes a sledgehammer to this hypothesis, but for the much better-known illusion: theMüller-Lyer illusion. Two lines of equal length seem to be different lengths because of the context provided by inward-pointing, compared with outward-pointing, arrowheads. It’s a very powerful illusion. I’ve seen it on thousands of occasions and it works every time for me.View image in fullscreenThe Müller-Lyer illusion: contradicting the ‘carpentered world’ hypothesis of the Coffer illusion.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyThere are many explanations for why the Müller-Lyer illusion is so effective. One of the more popular is that the arrowheads are interpreted by the brain as cues about three-dimensional depth, so our brains implicitly interpret the illusion as representing an object of some kind, with right angles and straight lines. This explanation fits neatly with the “carpentered world” hypothesis – and indeed a lot of early support for this hypothesis relied on apparent cultural variability in how the Müller-Lyer illusion is perceived.In their study, Amir and Firestone carefully and convincingly dismantle this explanation. They point out that non-human animals experience the illusion, as shown in a range of studies in which animals (including guppies, pigeons and bearded dragons) are trained to prefer the longer of two lines, and then presented with the Müller-Lyer image. They show that it works without straight lines, and for touch as well as vision. They note that it even works for people who until recently have been blind, referencingan astonishing experimentin which nine children, blind from birth because of dense cataracts, were shown the illusion immediately after the cataracts were surgically removed. Not only had these children not seen highly carpentered environments – they hadn’t seen anything at all. After you absorb their analysis, it’s pretty clear that the Müller-Lyer illusion is not due to culturally specific exposure to carpentry.Why the discrepancy? There are several possibilities. Perhaps there are reasons why cross-cultural variability should be expected for the Coffer but not the Müller-Lyer illusion (one possibility here is that the Coffer illusion is based on how people pay attention to things, rather than on some more basic aspect of perception). It could also be that there are systematic differences in perception between cultures, but that the “carpentered world” hypothesis is not the correct explanation. It’s also worth noting that the Kroupin study has some potential weaknesses. For example, the UK/US and Namibian participants were exposed to the illusions using very different methods. All in all, the jury remains out and – favourite scientist punt coming up – “more research is needed”.View image in fullscreenA ‘highly ‘carpentered’ environment with lots of straight lines, right angles and so forth’: the financial district in the City of London.Photograph: William Barton/AlamyThe notion that people from different cultures vary in how they experience things is certainly plausible. There’s a wealth of evidence that as we grow up our brains are shaped, at least to some extent, by features of our environments. And just as we all differ in our externally visible characteristics – height, body shape and so on – we will all differ on the inside too. As the author Anaïs Nin put it in quoting the Talmud: “We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.”For me, an important implication of this line of thought is that there are likely to be substantial differences in perceptionwithin“groups” as well asbetweenthem. This will probably hold however these “groups” are defined, whether as different cultures or as a contrast between “neurotypical” and “neurodivergent” people. I believe that paying more attention to within-group perceptual diversity will help us to better interpret the differences we do find between groups, and equip us with the tools needed to resist relying on simple cultural stereotypes as explanations.More research is needed here too. But it’s on the way. In thePerception Census, a project led by my research group at the University of Sussex together with professor Fiona Macpherson at the University of Glasgow, we are studying how perception differs in a large sample of about 40,000 people from more than 100 countries.Our experiment includes not just one or two visual illusions but more than 50 different experiments probing many different aspects of perception. When we’re done analysing the data, we hope to deliver a uniquely detailed picture of how people experience their world, both within and between cultures. We’ll also make the data openly available for other researchers to explore new ideas in this important area.One critical insight lies behind all these questions.How things seem is not how they are.Neuroscientist Anil Seth: ‘We risk not understanding the central mystery of life’Read moreFor each of us, it might seem as though we see the world exactly as it is; as if our senses are transparent windows through with the world pours itself directly into our mind. But how things are is very different. The objective world no doubt exists, but the world we experience is always an active construction, a kind of “controlled hallucination” in which the brain uses sensory signals to update and calibrate its best interpretation of what’s going on. What we experience is this interpretation, not a “readout” of the sensory information.For me, this is the key insight that underlies any claim about perceptual diversity. When we take it fully on board, it encourages a much-needed humility about our own ways of seeing. We live in perceptual echo chambers, just as we do in those of social media, and the first step to escaping any echo chamber is to realise that you’re in one.Anil Seth is a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex, and author of the Sunday Times bestsellerBeing You: A New Science of ConsciousnessExplore more on these topicsNeuroscienceOpinionConsciousnessPsychologyHuman biologycommentShareReuse this content"

Until last weekend, sure, it might have been a tough sell to proclaim them as an avatar for Britain’s revolting youth: prominent though they might be on the UK’s punk scene, they had about about 220,000 monthly listeners on Spotify – a mere 1,000,000 away from a place inthe top 10,000. But then, at Glastonbury, they made the most powerful possible case for broad media attention: theysaid something controversialabout Israel’s assault on Gaza, and opened up a chance to have a go at the BBC.And so the following morning, on thefront page of the Mail on Sunday: “NOW ARREST PUNK BAND WHO LED ‘DEATH TO ISRAELIS’ CHANTS AT GLASTONBURY.” Pascal Robinson-Foster, aka Bobby Vylan, had started a round of “antisemitic chanting” that was broadcast live on the corporation’s coverage of the festival, the story explained. Keir Starmer called it “appalling hate speech”. The calls for the band members’ arrest werequickly picked up, and before long the Conservatives were suggesting thatthe BBC should be prosecutedas well. On Monday, the story splashed in the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express.In fact, Robinson-Foster hadn’t chanted “Death to Israelis”, but “Death to the IDF”, a sharply different proposition, and one focused on the military machine attacking Gaza, the Israeli Defense Forces, rather than Israeli civilians. Nonetheless, the Mail on Sunday’s headline elision stuck. In much of the coverage, the idea that the chant was inherently antisemitic wasn’t even a question.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mail on SundayThe assertion was barely explained in any of the front page stories;the BBCand evenGlastonbury’s Emily Eaviswent along with it too. If you were looking for a rationale, the closest you got came fromStephen Pollard in the Mail on Sunday: after comparing the scene to the Nuremberg rallies, he added that “what they meant – because the IDF is the army of the world’s only Jewish state – was ‘Death, death to the Jews’”. Later, Andrew Neilwent further: “I was going to say that they sometimes seem to have more in common with the Nuremberg rally,” he mused. “But even the Nazis didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’.”Meanwhile, Yvette Cooper has ordered that Palestine Action should be banned as a terrorist group for its targeting of buildings and businesses in opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza, even though it has no agenda for violence – and after a last-minutelegal challenge to the proscription failedon Friday, supporting them is now a criminal offence. In that environment, any uncertainty about the Bob Vylan story would plainly be treated as apologism for hate speech, or worse, and so there wasn’t a lot of it about.In truth, though, a lot of people might have been uncertain. The IDF as metonym for any Jew is not a typical trope in the extremist’s lexicon, and the circumstances of the Israeli military’s assault on Gaza are the obvious, and urgent, locus of the chant’s intended force. Nonetheless, Avon and Somerset police have nowopened a criminal investigation.There are, to be sure, cogent objections to raise. Robinson-Foster described a record label boss as a “Zionist”, and while he noted that the executive “would speak very strongly about his support for Israel”, it is reasonable to accuse him of playing into afamiliar antisemitic trope, particularly about the music industry.Meanwhile, some Jewish people already alert to arise in racist hostility towards themmay well have felt alarmed by the sight of a crowd chanting against the Israeli army. Sensible people will come to a range of conclusions about those points – but there has been no space for that discussion, because the IDF apparently represents Jewish people everywhere, and everything else gets lost in the shuffle.The death toll in Gaza nowstands at more than 57,000, according to figures from the Gaza ministry of health; a robust independent surveyrecently put the countat almost 84,000. Israeli ministers and officials have given weight to allegations that a genocide is under way with assertions that starving two million Palestinians to deathmight be “justified and moral”and descriptions of aforced “deportation plan”. The amount of aid going into the territory remains afraction of what is needed. At least400 Palestinians have been killedrecently in incidents involving the IDF while approaching food distribution centres;Haaretz reportedthat soldiers were ordered to fire on them deliberately, a claim denied by Israel as “vicious lies”.Meanwhile, in the UK, the only adjacent story deemed worthy of front page attention is the conduct of an obscure punk-rap group from Ipswich. On 17 June,at least 59 Palestinians were killedafter the IDF fired on a crowd waiting for flour trucks near Khan Younis. The next day’s Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Sun and Daily Express featured no coverage of that story at all. Perhaps they would have done if the BBC had broadcast it live.It would be understandable, then, to conclude that the obsession with Bob Vylan – and Kneecap, and Palestine Action – matters mainly for its diversionary force. But there is something more at work here. It isn’t just that people are angry that the catastrophe in Gaza isn’t being given due attention: it is that their encounters with observable reality are being flatly denied. The choice framed by these stories is between being an anti-racist, or even an anti-terrorist, and being horrified by the slaughter of thousands of brown civilians in a military siege. For anyone who routinely sees videos of the aftermath of Israeli violence against civilians in their social media feeds, this is enough to make you feel crazy.Across the UK and the US, there is increasing evidence that people who object to what we might call the Vylanising of the Gaza discourse are finding their voice. In the general election last year, Labourlost five seats to pro-Gaza candidates, andforfeited about a third of its votein some Muslim majority areas. In New York, Zohran Mamdani won an underdog victory in the Democratic mayoral primary despite attempts to caricature him asan advocate of “jihad”. Some 55% of the British publicopposes Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, and 45% view Israel’s actions as genocidal; less than half of Americans are now moresympathetic to Israel than to Palestinians, and almost 60% of Democrats are now more supportive of Palestinians. Among people under 40, those numbers only go up.Those people have been told that Gaza protests are hate marches; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that US campus protesters arelargely motivated by antisemitism; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that Palestine Action is a terrorist organisation because it spray painted military aircraft; they can seeit’s not true. They have been repeatedly told, by Benjamin Netanyahu, that opposition to Israel’s war is antisemitic; they can seeit’s not true. They have been told that the British governmentfinds Israel’s actions “intolerable”; they can seeit’s not true.Now they are being told that opposing the IDF is antisemitic, that the Glastonbury crowd is more virulent than the one at Nuremberg, and that direct action is a form of terrorism. They can see all that’s not true, either, and however far their view is from the front pages, they know that they are far from alone.Archie Bland is the editor of the Guardian’sFirst EditionnewsletterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ski resorts around the world are increasingly relying on artificial snow making – a process that uses vast amounts of water and energy, creating anunsustainable and counterproductive cyclefor winter sports.Like most climate impacts there’s a limit to how much individuals can do, and structural change is needed. But there are still meaningful steps we can take when visiting the snowfields to make our trips more sustainable.1. Start by reducing our (snow)printAccording to Cam Walker, a veteran environmental campaign manager for Friends of the Earth Australia and longtime skier, there are tangible things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAfter many years of enjoying groomed runs in Australian resorts, Walker says he now mostly prefers cross and backcountry skiing, which don’t require as much infrastructure and offer greater exposure to nature away from the crowds.How to stay warm this winter without breaking the bank – or the planetRead moreHe recommends people consider travelling to the snow using public transport, which cuts costs, unclogs alpine roads and lowers carbon emissions. There are train and bus services connecting cities including Wangaratta in Victoria’s north-east to resorts includingMount BullerandFalls Creek, while theSnowy Mountains bus servicelinks Jindabyne with Perisher and Thredbo in New South Wales.If you prefer to drive, consider ride sharing – most resorts have Facebook pages where you can organise a lift and some haveride sharing pages. If you want to fly to international snowfields, think about replacing an annual pilgrimage with fewer, longer trips.Another option is to rent your equipment rather than buying it – especially if it’s your first time out on the slopes.2. Don’t switch on your ‘holiday brain’Walker says one of thechallenges in reducing the environmental impact of tourism is that many people go into holiday mode – turning heating up to full, not recycling and even littering.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Mount Hotham, for example, the resort has a“living bin” programto properly recycle food scraps, which is estimated to account for 50% of its waste.And some resorts offer carbon-intensive extras including helicopter or snowmobile rides into backcountry areas. These should be avoided.3. Encourage resorts to do betterAuden Schendler, the author of the bookTerrible beauty: Reckoning with climate complicity and rediscovering our souland a former senior vice-president of Aspen Skiing Company, says the ski industry has largely dodged the hard work to be done on climate up until now by focusing on modest operational tweaks and putting the responsibility on individuals.“Instead, what resorts should do is publicly and loudly use their voice, power, influence and media play to advocate for policy changes at the province and federal level,” he says. “This includes publicly lobbying and discussing the threat of climate change and the need for major policy solutions, like fees on carbon, incentives for clean power, and so forth.”Walker agrees, arguing that skiers should be applying pressure on resorts. “While some globally owned resorts have done a great job of reducing their emissions by shifting to renewable energy, most in Australia have not,” he says. “Ask questions when you book your holiday – are the lifts and snow making running off green electricity? If not, why not?“If people ask these hard questions and apply significant consumer pressure, resort management will need to respond.”Explore more on these topicsSkiing holidaysChange by degreesClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsVictoriaNew South WalesWasteTourism (Australia)featuresShareReuse this content"

It has not been an epic show – just War Pigs, NIB, Iron Man and Paranoid – but is the farewell this extraordinary band deserve, with an undercard of stadium-fillers and festival headliners come to pay tribute.The returning Bill Ward adds the swing other Sabbath drummers have never managed, Tony Iommi churns out those monstrous riffs, Geezer Butler flits around them on bass, andOzzy Osbourne… is Ozzy Osbourne, a baffled and discomfited force of nature.At a packed Villa Park, 40,000 metalheads – plus a peak of 5.8m more on the accompanying livestream – have seen their dreams come true in what is basically metal’s Live Aid, right down to the revolving stage. They have been, as many from the stage remind us, part of history.All of Birmingham has draped itself in black for the final appearance of its prodigal sons. The four members of Sabbath were granted the freedom of the city this week, and the tourist board has declared this the “Summer of Sabbath”, with events not just this weekend, but right through the season. And, of course, there have been the other genuflections towards the group: the renaming of a bridge in their honour, the dedication of a bench, theBlack Sabbath ballet(which returns to the city this autumn), and the giant “tifo” of Ozzy Osbourne that the Holte End of Villa Park unveiled last football season.‘I don’t want to die in a hotel room somewhere’: Black Sabbath on reconciling for their final gig – and how Ozzy is living through hellRead moreSabbath are so indistinguishable from Birmingham at this point (the “home of metal”, as the city likes to remind us) that it was inevitable their final show should happen in the city, just as their previous last-ever shows did, in 1999 and 2017. This time, though, with Osbourne’s health a matter of public concern, this surely will be the last time. Certainly, Ozzy dominates proceedings before even stepping on to the stage, in a way that leaves a slightly sour aftertaste: Ticketmaster sends punters reminders before the gig about the Ozzy Osbourne show, not the Black Sabbath show. Even the Test Match Special team, across at Edgbaston, are talking about it: there’s an Ozzy standup cutout surrounded by black balloons in his hotel lobby, notes former England skipper Michael Vaughan.In truth, Sabbath’s relationship with Birmingham has not been so close as both sides would like to pretend. One fan site lists all known gigs, and there were plenty of tours during which the band didn’t visit their home town. During their 1970s heyday, especially, they were too busy touring America incessantly to pay more than cursory attention to the UK. It’s entirely possible that more people from Cleveland or Detroit or Pittsburgh than actual Brummies have seen Sabbath live.Perhaps those years across the Atlantic also account for the composition of the bill, which is heavily weighted in favour of the US – it might have been nice to see some of their West Midlands descendants on the bill, and while KK Downing is there, his presence perhaps precludes the attendance of his former band Judas Priest, with whom relations are fraught. Nevertheless, the bill comprises a list of hard rock superstars, some of which raise questions all of their own: will Guns N’ Roses, even this new, professional iteration, be able to manage a seven-minute changeover and stick to a 15-minute set?After a greeting from master of ceremonies, Hollywood actor Jason Momoa – a fitful and baffling presence through the day – Mastodon begin proceedings, in front of a stadium already nearly full by 1pm. Giant beach balls in Villa’s claret and blue and Ozzy emblazoned on them bounce around the front of the crowd, as the breeze flicks the sound back and forth. To be fair, though, you wouldn’t realise they had recently shed their lead singer/guitarist and replaced him with an expert YouTube shredder. And like the bands that follow them, they offer up a Sabbath cover in homage.Rival Sons’ cleaner, bluesier riffs are better suited to the booming stadium sound than Mastodon’s technical grinding. How Anthrax were must remain a mystery to me: sets are so short (around 15 minutes), turnarounds so quick and bar queues so immense that those who try to get a drink at the end of one set are sure to miss the whole of the next.View image in fullscreenHuge response … Yungblud sings with one of the concert’s superstar lineups.Photograph: Kazuyo HorieFronting Halestorm – who don’t cut through – Lzzy Hale asks where all her “women of heavy metal are”, and maybe a twentieth of the crowd raise their hands, but for all the drinking and the testosterone, there is no lairiness or aggression in the air. Even if plastic bottles had been allowed in, no one would be bottled off today.Much of the afternoon, though, passes in a blur of growled vocals and downtuned guitars. Sets are too short to build momentum, though the inverse of that is that even the most metal-agnostic get no chance to be bored: no one has the time to be self-indulgent. And as the beer kicks in, the crowd liven up: the first circle pits appear during Lamb of God’s set, 90 minutes in, and they get the first true roar for covering Children of the Grave, Sabbath’s 1971 classic, though it doesn’t benefit from Bill Ward’s shuffles being replaced with double kick-drums.The first of the day’s two all-star bands is fronted by Hale but the day is so focused on Ozzy that the big shout-out goes to his former guitarist Jake E Lee. It’s a set of covers, with rotating singers and players, and A Shot in the Dark is the first sighting of the hair metal side of Osbourne’s career, before a thrillingly brutal Sweet Leaf.Yungblud is a change of pace and generation, opening with Changes, the piano waltz from the fourth Sabbath record. He’s sincere, passionate and wins a huge response from a crowd who might not be familiar with him, compelling a whole-stadium singalong. One song and he’s gone, having stolen the first third of the show.As the day passes, Alice in Chains are sluggish, but Gojira impressively pulverising, playing with clarity and directness. Their intricate lead guitar lines somehow serve the PA and the breeze, and for Mea Culpa – accompanied by a soprano – the circle pits reopen. They seem charmingly nervous about introducing their Sabbath cover, Under the Sun, but they shouldn’t be. They kill it.View image in fullscreenMusical director Tom Morello and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler at Back to the Beginning.Photograph: Ross HalfinThey’re followed by a three-drummer superstar drum-off, inserted into a cursory cover of the mighty Symptom of the Universe, rearranged for multiple drum solos. No matter that Momoa insists drums are the heartbeat of heavy metal – drum solos are actually its blocked U-bend. That’s followed by Billy Corgan singing Breaking the Law accompanied by local hero KK Downing and Tom Morello, at which point it’s starting to feel like the metal Royal Variety show: only here would Corgan give way to Sammy Hagar, who kills the momentum stone dead. The variety show air is not quelled by Steven Tyler and Ronnie Wood assembling for Train Kept a Rollin’, before Walk This Way gets the biggest cheer of the day so far, immediately surpassed when the ensemble launch into Whole Lotta Love.The wholly tribal nature of the event is illustrated when Pantera take the stage and Cowboys From Hell gets tens of thousands singing along. Thankfully, Phil Anselmo chooses not to offer any of his favourite white power slogans as accompaniment. Tool, too, are greeted like heroes, though their prog-metal is baffling to the uninitiated.One can see the stadium-readiness when the very biggest turns arrive. After Slayer – which is like listening to road works, take that as compliment or not – Guns N’ Roses patrol the stage as if they own it, opening with Sabbath’s Never Say Die, with Axl Rose on surprisingly good voice. They play Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, too, and only throw in a couple of their own big hits, Paradise City and Welcome to the Jungle. Metallica are fantastic – taut and aggressive from their opening cover of Hole in the Sky. It helps, too, that in For Whom the Bell Tolls they have half a dozen of metal’s greatest riffs in one song.And then, at last it’s Ozzy. He arrived on stage in a black throne, from which he does not stir. During Coming Home, his struggle with pitch is both painful and moving: he seems on the brink of tears as the crowd carry him home, but brings everything back with a triumphant Crazy Train.There’s a clear distinction between Ozzy’s set and Sabbath’s set. Ozzy’s, of course, is based largely on his 80s solo hits. Mr Crowley, which opens with ominous organ, is ludicrous in its cod-satanism, but equally marvellous. It is perhaps daring for Ozzy to play Suicide Solution – the song that was seen as promoting death among young metalheads – but in this crowd it’s a celebration rather than a commiseration.View image in fullscreenThe prince on his throne … Ozzy Osbourne.Photograph: Ross Halfin/Black SabbathSabbath, by contrast, draw solely on their first two albums. Fortunately, for those who wish to hear more, throughout the show the assembled artists visit the Sabbath catalogue with great frequency and ardour.Nevertheless, none of them have the unique bludgeoning force that the forefathers of heavy music still possess. On the big screens you can see Tony Iommi’s false fingertips, employed to enable him to play those downtuned chords for the decades since he lost those digits in a factory accident. And the band pay tribute to their surroundings: to close their set, Geezer Butler plays a bass in Villa’s claret and blue colours with the club motto printed on the body. It’s a very Birmingham way of doing things on what has been a very international day.It’s affecting to see how united the crowd are behind Ozzy, with plenty of wiped tears during his solo set. But in the end, the night, rightly, belongs not just to him, but to four Brummies who changed rock music for ever.Explore more on these topicsMusicBlack SabbathOzzy OsbourneMetalPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But what would James Definitely Not?All sorts of things. Skydiving. Morris dancing. Living as a monk. Agricultural work. Being a high court judge. Anything that involves dressing up. I’m not too fussy about food. I can’t think of anything I wouldn’t eat, although I have a strange ambivalence about broccoli. I can’t make my mind up about it and it infuriates people. People say: you’re not doing it properly. I think: how do you know how I’m doing it? I’ve heard you can roast it with bits of bacon, garlic and olive oil. In which case, it’s not only broccoli any more, is it?Why does the water flow anticlockwise down the plug hole in Australia but clockwise in the UK?Because of the rotation of the Earth. If you go to the equator – and I’ve done this – you can do an experiment with a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom. If you stand exactly on the equator and drop in a matchstick, it will stay stationary. If you walk north of the equator 100 paces, it starts going around one way. If you walk south, it starts going the other way. It’s quite a boring experiment and you have to have absolutely nothing else left to do in your life.If you could have a sandwich named after you, what would you call it?I think sandwiches are crap. I’m making a series on YouTube called Sarnies of the 70s, where we dig up these terrible old fillings like Spam and Branston pickle. It’s fascinating to remember what we ate when I was a child. But I describe sandwiches – and I’m afraid I also think this about pizza – as crisis food. Nobody ever says: I can’t be bothered to cook tonight. Should we go out for a sandwich? No one wants a sandwich. You are reduced to having a sandwich.Both you and Clarkson own pubs. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, which pub would you rather be stuck at?Oh, mine. It’s in Wiltshire. We’re heavily armed down here. People queue up at Clarkson’s. There’s queueing protocol going on, which I don’t like. We’ve had this argument many times. The whole point of the bar in a pub is that it’s wide and shallow. It’s not a hatch. Why would you queue at it? Good bar people know the order in which to serve.View image in fullscreenJeremy Clarkson behind the bar at his pub in an episode of Clarkson’s Farm.Photograph: Prime VideoAlan Davies told usin this very columnthat he gets mistaken for you. Who do you get mistaken for, if not Alan Davies?Alan Davies: ‘I get called Jonathan Creek all the time – nowadays people think I’m James May’Read moreI have been mistaken for Alan Davies. I’ve been told I look like King Théoden from Lord of the Rings. Robert Plant is very flattering. Billy Connolly is flattering. Unfortunately, quite a few times when I’ve been out walking or riding my bike around London, I’ve been mistaken forJeremy Clarkson. I have to go home, examine myself very deeply and think: what have I done?The small print on your new tour, Explorers, warns of “occasional scent, fog and other immersive theatrical elements”. What is your favourite occasional scent?Good question. I like all the obvious nature scents like flowers, freshly mown grass and rain falling on a hot pavement. I like the smell of bicycle shops because I like that smell of rubber and rubber solution. It’s not a pervy or fetish thing. I like the smell of freshly pumped petrol, which smells exactly like what it isn’t – which is delicious. If you get petrol in your mouth because you’re siphoning it from the lawnmower, it tastes absolutely foul. But when it’s coming out of the pump into your car, it’s got almost a mango juice smell to it.What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?I haven’t had any, really. I’ve never run up to Alan Davies and said: “I loveTop Gear. Can I have your autograph?”Would you rather die at the bottom of the ocean or deep out into space?I’ve wondered about dying in space. The Apollo 11 lunar module was too fragile to test on Earth, so what if it hadn’t worked? They’d have been stuck on the moon for eternity. How do you end it? Do you just sit there and gradually suffocate? Or do you take off your space helmet, take a deep breath, open the door and effectively boil? Dying at the bottom of the ocean feels particularly dark and lonely. I’m going to go for space because the view in the last few seconds would be better.If you could change the size of any animal and keep it as a pet, what would you choose?A miniature elephant. I was going to say a tiger. But then you can just have a domestic cat, can’t you? A miniature great white shark in a pond in your garden would be pretty cool. If you had miniature blue whales in an aquarium, they’d come up to the surface and blow off in miniature. I’d like that.Who is your biggest nemesis?Honestly, it’s probably Jeremy Clarkson.James May’s showExplorers – The Age of Discoverytours Australia and New Zealand from 29 July, and the UK from 20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTelevision10 Chaotic QuestionsTop GearJeremy ClarksonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It gave me a new father figure – and unblocked my creativityAs told toDeborah LintonSat 5 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTShareOn an unseasonably warm day in October 2023, I arrived, ahead of the queues, at London’s Southbank Centre for a conceptual art takeover by the world-famousMarina Abramović Institute.I had recently read Marina’s memoirWalk Through Walls, which had resonated. So, when I’d seen the event advertised – hours-long performances by artists she’d invited, curated and introduced by Marina – I bought a £60 ticket and waited for my time slot to enter the Queen Elizabeth Hall. I hadn’t seen performance art before, and this was due to include her well-known workThe Artist Is Presentwith an artist sitting, static and silent, in a chair all day, as Marina once did for an accumulated 736 hours and 30 minutes at the Museum of Modern Art.I felt certain that it would affect me, I just wasn’t sure how.It came at an interesting time in my life. I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian family, the daughter of a priest who was physically abusive. I’d been in therapy for years, but my experiences still affected me and I’d recently cut contact with my father with my family. So, when I entered the first room at the Southbank where Marina was to spoke and introduce around a dozen artists, I was still coming to terms with this new way of dealing with my past.I was immediately drawn to one of the artists, a man fromMyanmarwho was to perform the chair piece with a cloth sack over his head. We heard how he’d been part of an organisation in Myanmar that opposed violence and therefore risked death if he was publicly identified. I was moved by what he was risking for his art. I also knew it was a hard piece; Marina wasn’t going to give it to just anyone.I cried, the good tears, where you let part of your past go. It felt cleansing. When I left, I felt lighterAs people moved between performers, I saw him, seated in the atrium, with a large crowd; I waited for a quieter moment to return. When I finally stood before him, I was overcome. I felt an urge to sit down in front of him and didn’t care what others thought. I was compelled to do it for myself. I can’t say how long I sat there, maybe an hour. In that time, I rewrote my definition of “strength”. I used to think my father’s aggression made him strong but now I saw someone using his muscular arms and legs to be still, for peaceful protest. I imagined the loss he must have experienced in war and the mental strength to sit there. I thought of what I’d read in Marina’s book; how pain set in three hours into sitting still.I cried: the good tears, where you let part of your past go. It felt cleansing. When I left, I felt lighter. I decided that this would be my father figure now: this person who had strength but did not hurt me, who had reasons to be aggressive but did not direct his anger towards a six-year-old whispering in her brother’s ear or disturbing his preaching, as my father had.It unlocked something in me. It gave me a positive male figure to replace what had gone before and helped me not to hate my father or men. It also unblocked the creativity that had laid dormant within me, an artistic side that had reminded me too much of my father’s similar creative charisma. I started drawing: comic-books and illustrations.I’m an atheist but I believe there are spiritual moments you can choose to embrace: this, for me, was one. I think of it often. I even have the poster from the takeover in my toilet, serving as a daily reminder. I’m 41 and throughout life I’ve learned to expect the unexpected. Usually, when I go to see art it’s to learn something new, and this was a big one. This changed me as a woman, as a soul, an immigrant, a creative, a child. That man gave himself to us as an artist and I accepted his gift.Share your experienceYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But the Oasis reunion did indeed come to pass, and the reaction has universally been one of wonderment. You’d expect that from fans – if you ended up spending north of £300 on a dynamically priced ticket, you’d decide you were going to have fun – but critics have also been united in their praise.Alexis Petridis, the Guardian★★★★★“You can still sense inspiration declining – 1997’s D’You Know What I Mean? sounds like a trudge regardless of how many people are singing along – but far more often, the show serves as a reminder of how fantastic purple patchOasiswere,” the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis said in a five-star review. “Against a ferocious wall of distorted guitars, there’s a weird disconnect between the tone of Noel’s songs – wistful, noticeably melancholy – and the way Liam sings them like a man seething with frustration, on the verge of offering someone a fight. Even discounting half their career, they have classics in abundance: Cigarettes & Alcohol, Slide Away, Rock ’n’ Roll Star, Morning Glory.Will Hodgkinson, the Times★★★★★The set took on extra resonance given everything that has happened since [Oasis’s split in 2009]. Noel may have once called Liam a man with a fork in a world of soup, and Liam accused Noel of being a potato, but Acquiesce is a song about the fact that they “need each other” – and they do. Noel has a soul complex enough to write beautiful songs. Liam has a soul simple enough to deliver them with pure feeling. They are, ultimately, stuck with each other … As for Supersonic, the song that started it all, it encapsulated everything the Gallaghers evoked, perhaps without even realising it: attitude, surrealism, familiarity, the madness of the everyday.View image in fullscreenLiam and Noel Gallagher.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APDianne Bourne, Manchester Evening News★★★★★Stop the clocks, the stars really did align, because yes, Oasis are back – and they’ve just reclaimed their crown as rock’n’roll stars. You can throw as many cliches as you like at this show and it still wouldn’t quite sum up what the 60,000-plus fans cramming into the Principality stadium inCardiffsaw, heard and felt, on Friday night. It was biblical, celestial, majestical – all of the superlatives that Liam likes to self-anoint himself with. But on this occasion, it was no hyperbole … I think it’s the first time I’ve seen a mosh pit stretch to the entire floor and right up into the seats such was the constant bouncing energy of an elated crowd not quite believing this was really happening, and that they were really here.Andrew Trendell, NME★★★★★As the flares light up for Don’t Look Back in Anger into the spoils of colossal closers Wonderwall and an everlasting Champagne Supernova, the sweet escape comes to an end. Lord knows we needed a taste of that halcyon 90s hope and abandon in 2025 – especially for the raving and craving gen Zers. The world is a rotting shitty bin-fire and tomorrow never knows, but tonight, you’re a rock’n’roll star.Neil McCormick, the Telegraph★★★★★I don’t think anyone who managed to get their hands on a ticket for this reunion could feel short-changed. Because really it was a reunion between an audience and their favourite band, a reunion between Britain and rock’n’roll … It was very loud, it was simplistic to the point of banality and it was magically, exhaustingly uplifting.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageMark Beaumont, the Independent★★★★★The real underlying thrill is of a historical moment fully revived. For all the laddish boorishness that Oasis undoubtedly encapsulated, the Britpop era, for millennials and gen Zers alike, is as halcyon as Beatlemania or the summer of love – a time of vivid colour, jubilant melody, political stability and affordable flats. And to be a part of this second wind of torrid Oasismania, hyped by effusive press coverage and leading to historic shows such as this one, is as close to actually “being there” as it’s possible to get.Ellie Henman, the Sun★★★★★The set list made me feel like I was being punched in the face – repeatedly – by the 90s. Liam’s vocals were out of this world – he ought to pie off Clarks and get an advertising deal with Halls Soothers because whatever he was sucking in rehearsals clearly paid off. And Noel, who has never failed to impress me performing live, was the cherry on the cake with his masterful ability on the guitar sure to inspire generations of young musicians to come.Martin Robinson, the Standard★★★★★Today, reports of gen Z loving Oasis have not been overplayed. There’s been a cross-generational vibe around these shows. Like Noel’s dream of melding dance music communality with punk rock attitude to kill off grunge in the 90s, seems to have been rebooted. Turn off and on again, and the aggro violence has gone, and what’s left is something fresh and cool and utterly exciting.View image in fullscreenOasis fans outside the stadium.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/GettyKathryn Williams, Wales Online★★★★★The city of Cardiff had been on a wave of excitement and bucket hats all week and the soundchecks coming out of the stadium were sounding class, proper bristles up on the back of your neck type stuff. But the real thing was intense and immense. A wall of sound burst around the closed Principality stadium … and Liam’s voice was faultless.Will Richards, Rolling Stone UK★★★★★The band sound, to use Liam’s favorite phrase, absolutely biblical. Within half an hour, we’re through Acquiesce, Morning Glory, Supersonic and Cigarettes & Alcohol at tremendous volume. Oasis’s arsenal of generation-defining hits is hardly a secret, but when confronted with them one after another like this, it was truly overwhelming.Explore more on these topicsOasisWhat the papers sayLiam GallagherNoel GallagherPop and rockWalesNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Like many Australian actors, it began with a soap opera – McMahon played Ben Lucini in 150 episodes of Home and Away – but he soon broke free to pursue a more ambitious and challenging oeuvre.McMahon, the son of former prime minister Sir William “Billy” McMahon, made a name for himself overseas through US television in his 30s. On supernatural drama Charmed he played Cole Turner, a half-human, half-demon assassin turned love interest for one of the witches he was hired to kill. McMahon took to the show’s campy tone with aplomb, delivering lines like “I’m going straight to hell, cause it’s got to be a sin to lookthisgood” with a twinkle in his eye.His next big role was in Ryan Murphy’s dramaNip/Tuck, as the arrogant plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy. In the early 2000s the show made headlines for its frank depiction of nudity and sex – the Guardian described McMahon’s character as“a vagina-seeking missile”– but it also showed his talent for bringing vulnerability to suave but damaged men. It was around this time McMahonbecame a favourite to succeed Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but missed out to Daniel Craig – instead he landed the role of Victor Von Doom, AKA Doctor Doom, the supervillain of two Fantastic Four movies.1:33Julian McMahon's most memorable roles – videoOver the years McMahon left Hollywood for home to appear in various Australian features – among them Stephan Elliott’s raucous 2018 comedySwinging Safari, in which he played an attender of a 1970s key party, alongside Guy Pearce and his former sister-in-law Kylie Minogue, and the 2012 horror movie Bait, in which he played a robber in a supermarket that’s been flooded by a tsunami and monstered by sharks. That film was a big hit overseas, where it became, in less than two weeks, themost successful Australian movie ever released in China. In a full circle move, he recently played the Australian prime minister in Netflix’s comedy-mystery The Residence (again opposite Minogue).Julian McMahon, Fantastic Four, Nip/Tuck and Charmed actor, dies aged 56Read moreDespite his career being well into its third decade, there’s a very sad feeling surrounding McMahon’s death that his talent has been dramatically cut short; that his star was very much on the rise again. One of his last roles was opposite Nicolas Cage as the villain in Lorcan Finnegan’s intensely trippy, sun-scorched thrillerThe Surfer, which premiered out of competition at last year’s Cannes film festival. McMahon played Scally, the leader of a gang of violent hoodlums from a small coastal town who patrol the local beach and harass visitors.And what a performance it was. Not everybody can hold their own against an actor like Cage, but McMahon pulled it off perfectly, countering the star’s off-the-wall style with a seething, magnetic portrait of toxic masculinity – darkly charismatic and creepy as all get-out. In one memorable scene, whichyou can watch on YouTube, McMahon slurps down a beer and implores Cage to “drink deep, eat your fill, turn around from this town and never come back”. Throughout the film he projects a layered, paradoxically chummy kind of menace: calm and imperturbable, then, suddenly, explosively violent and unsettling.View image in fullscreenJulian McMahon in a scene from The Surfer.Photograph: APMcMahon had amazingly bright and burning blue eyes, the colour of the sea. They were even more striking in person – I know because I was lucky enough to meet him on the set of The Surfer in Western Australia, where we chatted about this role and work ethic. On that day, McMahon was philosophical. “You want to be open to new suggestions, new thoughts, new ideas, and new creativity, wherever that’s coming from,” he told me. And he was funny, riffing on the something he may not have missed about his home country – the insects: “Australian flies just come and sit on your face, and they’ll stay there for an hour or two.”He is survived by his wife, Kelly Paniagua, and his daughter, Madison, from a previous marriage.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAustralian filmcommentShareReuse this content"

You can add butter, beat the eggs in the pan and roll to make it French, add spices, coriander and onion to make it Indian, or mirin and soy, as in today’s dish, for a trip to Japan. You could add any condiment or pickle from mayonnaise to ketchup and chilli oil to chimichurri, and bolster the meal with bread or rice. Today’s recipe is merely one of many wonderful scenic routes on which to take your omelette.Omelette rolls with rice, carrot pickles and wasabi mayonnaiseSimply double the quantities to serve four. Sushi rice vinegar is widely available in the UK, and has been very helpfully pre-seasoned. If you can’t find it, use regular rice vinegar and add a tablespoon of sugar when you make the sushi seasoning.Prep10 minCook30 minServes2200g sushi riceFine sea salt8 tbsp sushi rice vinegar– I likeSaitaku1 large carrot, peeled and cut into matchsticks1-2 tsp wasabi paste, to taste3 tbsp mayonnaise½ tsp black sesame seeds6 medium eggs1 tbsp mirin1 ½ tbsp soy sauce2½ tbsp sesame oilFirst make the sushi rice. Put the rice in a saucepan for which you have a tight-fitting lid and cover with 280ml cold water. Bring to a boil, then cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and set a timer for 10 minutes. When the time is up, take the pan off the heat but leave the lid on for at least another 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make up the sushi seasoning by mixing a teaspoon of salt with four tablespoons of sushi rice vinegar. When the rice has cooled down to almost room temperature, fold in the seasoning using a wooden spoon.To make the pickled carrots, put the carrot matchsticks in a shallow-lipped dish, pour over the remaining four tablespoons of sushi rice vinegar, sprinkle on three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and mix well.To make the wasabi mayo, mix the mayonnaise with the wasabi paste (start with one teaspoon and add a second if you like it hotter), then sprinkle the black sesame seeds over the top.Finally, to make the omelette rolls, crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk with the mirin, soy sauce and half a tablespoon of sesame oil. Put a tablespoon of sesame oil in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, once it’s very hot, pour in half the egg mixture and cook until golden on the bottom and semi-set on top (that is, with only a little liquid egg still visible). Using a spatula, roll it up, slide out on to a plate and repeat with another tablespoon of sesame oil and the remaining beaten egg mix.To serve, cut the omelettes into 2cm-wide rolls, place on two plates and serve with bowls of sushi rice, pickled carrots, wasabi mayo and more soy sauce nearby.Explore more on these topicsJapanese food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodVegetarian food and drinkEggsRiceMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

So, which supermarket brands are a sizzling success and which are a wrinkly flop?The best air fryers, tried and tested for crisp and crunchTom HuntSat 5 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sausages are more than the sum of their parts – a blend of tradition, technique, ethics and flavour. I’ve always preferred proper butcher’s sausages, featuring hog casings filled with well-seasoned pork shoulder, then linked and set (I used to love making them with butcherRay SmithonRiver Cottage’s regular Pig in a Day courses). Farmer’s markets and butchers are the best places to find them, but supermarkets now have a wide range, too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Texture is key: a good sausage should have bite and a bit of snap, with a juicy, meaty interior, rather than pasty from too much rusk (a crumb typically made with flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda) in the filling. Then there’s flavour: a decent sausage should be rich in umami, well-seasoned but not overpowering, so you can actually taste the meat, and not be too sweet or packed with preservatives.Sourcing matters, too, both from the perspective of taste and personal and planetary health. TheRSPCA has several welfare concernsabout pork production in the UK, but better options do exist, and not always at a premium. Supermarkets do respond to customer feedback, so call or email if your local one doesn’t stock good-value, high-welfare meat.Riverford,Pipers Farmand my local farmers’ market are my go-to suppliers, but I also buy from supermarkets when I need to. If free-range or organic sausages are too expensive for your budget or not available to you locally, look for ones labelled RSPCA Assured or outdoor-bred or -reared, and check the excellent pork labelling guide atFarms Not Factories.Let’s not forget the casings, either, because they’re also important. Natural pork casings brown and crisp up beautifully, which helps give the banger that all-important snap; alginate casings (derived from seaweed) are ultra-processed but use renewable resources, and also offer a decent pop. Collagen casings, however, which are made from beef hide or bone, can be rubbery and don’t caramelise as well.The ingredient lists varied widely across brands, but all the sausages I tested contained sulphites (used to preserve colour and extend shelf life, though they can cause adverse reactions in people who are sensitive to them); some were also full of ultra-processed additives such as stabilisers, emulsifiers and preservatives. If you’re curious or concerned about what’s in your sausage,the Yuka appis a useful tool – it scans product barcodes and gives easy-to-understand scores based on ingredients, additives, saturated fat, salt and sugar levels.As for the cooking, the best approach, in my book, is low and slow with a little oil and, essentially, some butter as well, because that helps them caramelise and go sticky. A high heat will split them, leaking precious fat and leaving them dry, which is a travesty.This was a fascinating tasting, and proof that you can still get a decent sausage at a fair price – and feel good about eating it, too.Bestoverall:Waitrose No 1 British free-range pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 400g at Waitrose (£1.19/100g)★★★★☆Made with 98% pork, these had the highest meat content of the whole test group. They had a juicy, coarse texture and well-balanced flavour, seasoned with mace, sage and onion. The aroma is fresh and inviting, and the flavour holds its own without being overpowering. The vegetable-based casings mean they don’t brown as readily, but that can be rectified by adding a little butter to the pan. Free-range outdoor-raised pork andstrong animal welfare credentials, too, alongside a fully recyclable tray and sleeve – only the film tray cover is not. While not the most striking in appearance, they’re a classic, high-welfare banger with strong provenance.Best bargain:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference British pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (75p/100g)★★★☆☆A high-quality banger for the price. A distinct, herby aroma with a hint of nutmeg, while the coarse texture is true to the traditional British banger. Made with 93% pork and using alginate casings, they didn’t colour well, but kept their shape. Contains sodium metabisulphite and vitamin C, but otherwise free from ultra-processed additives. Outdoor-bred and RSPCA Assured, this is a decent supermarket option.And the rest …Farmison & Co the Nidderdale sausageView image in fullscreen£6.95 for 400g at Farmison & Co (£1.74/100g)£6.95 for 400g at Ocado (£1.74/100g)★★★★☆A well-crafted sausage made with native-breed pork and a mix of fine and coarse textures that delivers on both flavour and provenance. It has a classic linked shape and caramelises nicely, although it did lose some shape during cooking, which means it may have been overfilled. The aroma is nostalgic and inviting, with balanced seasoning and super umami. Although made with only 78% meat (79% if bought directly from Farmison), these have wonderful flavour and texture. Farmison stands out for its commitment to traditional methods and transparent sourcing, with full details on breed and origin clearly laid out on itswebsite. Free-range pork, recyclable packaging apart from the film,and a focus on heritage make this sausage feel worth the premium. A strong contender with a clear mission to support British smallholdings and culinary heritage.The Black Farmer premium pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Ocado (75p/100g)£3.50 for 400g at Tesco (88p/100g)★★★☆☆These sausages brown nicely with a good caramelised colour and a classic butcher’s shape. The coarse texture gives them a satisfying bite, while the aroma is pleasantly mild, with hints of nutmeg and sage. Well balanced with good seasoning. They’re made with 90% pork and natural pork casings, but contain sodium sulphites and stabiliser triphosphates. While there’s no transparent animal welfare standard, the packaging is mostly recyclable. The meat is British but likely to be intensively reared. Overall, a solid all-rounder with decent credentials and fair value for money.The Jolly Hog outdoor-bred proper porkersView image in fullscreen£4 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (£1/100g)£4.25 for 400g at Waitrose (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆Brown beautifully with great caramelisation and a classic banger shape. The texture is juicy, combining both fine and coarse meat for a satisfying mouthfeel. The aroma is sweet with hints of white pepper and mace. Well seasoned, with a balanced depth of flavour. Made with 84% pork and encased in natural pork casings, but they’re highly processed and contain sodium metabisulphite, emulsifiers (mono- and di-glycerides) and stabiliser diphosphates. Outdoor-bred (born outdoors, fattened in sheds) and RSPCA Assured, and packed in a recyclable card sleeve and plastic tray, this is a traditional British banger of OK provenance and quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Very coarse and traditional, with a savoury, highly seasoned flavour led by herbs, spices, onion, and a touch of lemon.Made with 90% pork in natural pork casings, these are a classic, less-processed banger. Recyclable tray and sleeve. Outdoor-bred (born outdoors, fattened in sheds) and RSPCA Assured, giving them a more responsible edge, and provenance is reasonable. Not cheap, but a solid supermarket option with good flavour and the RSPCA’s stamp of approval.(For just 50p more, you can get certifiedfree-range sausages from the M&S Collectionrange, which is a great investment in quality.)Daylesford organic outdoor-reared pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£7.50 for 400g at Ocado (£1.88/100g)£7.50 for 400g at Daylesford (£1.88/100g)★★★☆☆A premium sausage with high welfare credentials and good flavour. These have a classic shape and colour, but did lose some structure when cooked, probably due to the natural casings or air pockets in the filling. The fine texture and light, peppery seasoning give a clean, subtle taste. Certified organic and made with outdoor-reared native breed pork sourced from Gloucestershire, these are packed in a recyclable tray and sleeve. Contain sulphites and fortified wheat flour (gluten), but are otherwise minimally processed. A strongsustainability storyand provenance make this a standout choice for ethical shoppers, albeit at a price.Tesco Finest pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£3 for 400g at Tesco (75p/100g)★★☆☆☆These sausages have a coarse texture and a fresh aroma with a strong hint of sage. They’re on the saltier end and quite plain in taste, with a touch of white pepper. Made from 90% pork shoulder and belly, encased in vegetable casings, they didn’t colour too well. They’re more processed than some brands and contain sodium metabisulphite, calcium lactate and diphosphate stabilisers. The packaging is recyclable, except for the film. Overall, a basic supermarket sausage with modest provenance and processing credentials.Heck 97% pork gluten-free sausagesView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (81p/100g)£3.25 for 400g at Ocado (81p/100g)★★☆☆☆With a medium coarse texture, these are quite plain in taste. They’re less processed than some, and made with 97% pork shoulder, but with beef collagen casings. Lacks transparent animal welfare standards, though most of the packaging is recyclable and the brand discloses a carbon footprint of 2.4kg CO₂, which does add some kudos. Better than some budget options, but a rather middling product with few redeeming qualities beyond their pork content.Richmond thick pork sausagesView image in fullscreen£2.18 for 410g at Asda (53p/100g)£2.30 for 410g at Tesco (56p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Less sausage and more processed meat-like substance wrapped in a reconstituted casing. These shrank and wrinkled in the pan, and have a pasty, floury texture typical of an emulsified product with very low meat content. The aroma is faint and sterile, while the taste is sweet and lacks depth. Made with just 42% pork and encased in beef collagen casings, they also contain soya protein, stabilisers such as guar gum, diphosphates and sulphites, firmly placing them in the ultra-processed category. The packaging aims for full recyclability by 2025, but the provenance is unclear, with no traceability or UK meat assurance. Contains gluten. The cheapest option, but hard even to call this a “sausage”.Explore more on these topicsSausagesThe FilterFoodPorkMeatSupermarketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"
