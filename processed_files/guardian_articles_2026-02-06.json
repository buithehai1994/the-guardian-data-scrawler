He’s one of the few people in England who gets to see red squirrels in his back garden.“I feel very lucky to have them on the farm. It’s an important thing to try and keep a healthy population of them. They are absolutely beautiful,” he said.Most of us are much more familiar with their sturdy, grey American cousins. But once there were 3.4 million red squirrels in the UK, and with their glossy auburn fur, delicate frames and big tufty ears, they are the endangered animal whose loss Britons perhaps feel most deeply.The non-native grey squirrels, which were introduced from 1876, have pushed their way into every corner of England, outcompeting the reds for food and carrying a disease called squirrelpox, which does not affect them but is fatal to the red population. However,some campaignershave raised welfare concerns over what they see as a “demonisation” of grey squirrels.Red squirrels also face habitat loss as they thrive in the ancient woodland that has been cleared from most of the UK. Because of this, there are estimated to be only 287,000 left. Around 75% are found in Scotland, with the population in England thought to be as low as 38,900, including ahealthy populationon the Isle of Wight.According to campaigners, this backdrop makes the government’s new squirrel action plan forEnglandeven more important. Published last week, the plan contains provisions to increase woodland habitat and remove grey squirrels from the areas in which reds still survive, mostly in the north of England and Scotland.The nature minister, Mary Creagh, said: “Non-native grey squirrels cause huge damage to our trees and native wildlife. So we’re stepping up action to tackle their threat while protecting our iconic, endangered red squirrels. We’ll be working with landowners and conservation partners to better manage grey squirrel populations, and engaging in promising research into fertility control.”Methods proposed by the government include new contraceptive vaccines for greys to stop them breeding, and incentivising landowners to remove grey squirrels from their land and create woodlands.Young Atlantic salmon seen in three English rivers for first time in a decadeRead moreOn the few hundred acres he controls, Beaumont is already doing this to protect his red squirrels. Part of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, he works with a local ranger to monitor the population – and eliminate any greys.“He comes to the farm quite regularly and has put cameras up to monitor them,” Beaumont said. “And if there are any grey squirrels he will shoot them.”Most of all, Beaumont says it is important to preserve habitat for red squirrels: “They love the ancient woodland, which has all the things they like to eat, like hazel and larch.”The introduction of grey squirrels to the UK and subsequent decimation of the red squirrel population can betraced backto the 11th Duke of Bedford, Herbrand Russell.He was fascinated by the larger American squirrels and released them on his property in Woburn Park, as well as across various London parks. He also gave them to other aristocratic friends, who released the then exotic creatures on their own land around the country.This, said Matt Larsen-Daw, CEO of the Mammal Society, had left the red squirrel population “on a knife edge” two centuries later.“What is clear is that in the last decade some areas where red squirrels were still present in the north of England have become increasingly vulnerable to encroaching grey squirrels, and are more vulnerable than ever,” he said.Most of the squirrel monitoring is being done by volunteers such as Beaumont and his ranger. “It is a constant effort to monitor and control grey squirrel numbers,” Larsen-Daw said.While a plan was welcome, he said more funding was required to support the community groups and landowners who were doing their best to protect the red populations, which thrive in isolation from the greys.View image in fullscreenThe non-native grey, introduced in 1876, outcompetes the red squirrel and carries a fatal disease.Photograph: Giedrius Stakauskas/AlamyThe grassroots campaign Save Our Reds also argues the plan does not go far enough.Marie Carter-Robb, founder of Save Our Reds, said: “This policy statement is a welcome step forward, and it matters that it acknowledges both the scale of the problem and the role of volunteers on the ground.“But a policy paper is not the same as protection. The question now is whether these commitments translate into measurable delivery in the woods, where red squirrel strongholds are still fragile, and where woodland quality and biodiversity must be protected as a matter of urgency.”One “glimmer of hope” was the contraceptive vaccine, Larsen-Daw added. “This will not be available any time soon but innovative ‘gamechanger’ projects like this are the best chance for a long-term solution to grey squirrel presence,” he said.The government also hopes to return pine martens in areas where there are too many grey squirrels. This was good news, Larsen-Daw said. “It has already been shown that in Ireland and Scotland red squirrels have benefited when pine martens establish in their habitat, and it is hoped that the same will be true in England.”The nimble reds were able to stay out of the clutches of the pine martens, but the greys were “easy prey” for the carnivorous creatures, Larsen-Daw said.He added: “Although it is hard to feel optimistic for the swift recovery of red squirrels in England, I do feel confident that the combination of research-driven solutions such as the fertility control vaccine, and the success with pine marten recovery, offers hope for the future.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeEndangered speciesAnimalsConservationLake DistrictEndangered habitatsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He put his name on the Kennedy Center in Washington, prompting artists and performers to flee in such numbers that the venue will nowshut downfor “approximately” two years. The Washington Post under owner Jeff Bezos sought to ingratiate itself with the second Trump presidency; this week it announced300 layoffsand the withering of that once great institution. And now we can add one more, unexpected item to the list poisoned by the touch of Trump: Britain’s Labour government.It’s easily forgotten, but it was because of Trump that Keir Starmer appointed Peter Mandelson to serve as the UK ambassador to Washington. The prime minister decided it would take a snake to navigate the serpentine backchannels of the new administration and that Mandelson had the skill set. The result is an irony rich enough to make you retch. The Epstein files, which contain more than38,000 references to Trump, his Mar-a-Lago estate and other related terms, seem set to bring down a national leader who is not mentioned by Epstein even once.Which points to a related irony, no less bitter. Because politics is Newtonian, with elections often won by those who represent an equal and opposite reaction to what has gone before, Starmer reached Downing Street in part because he was a boy scout – the squeaky clean antidote to the sleaze of Boris Johnson. His pitch to the voters was that he was not exciting, but he was trustworthy, a former prosecutor free of the whiff of scandal. For him to be linked, via Mandelson, to the netherworld of Jeffrey Epstein and the vile abusers of women and girls who filled it is not merely embarrassing or compromising: it destroys his chief claim to the top job. As theEconomist asked this week, if this can happen, then “What is the point of Sir Keir staying in office?”Hence the number of Labour MPs willing to text journalists – anonymously – declaring the prime minister a dead man walking. The only question, they say, iswhen, not if. We’ll come to the question of timing, but that Starmer is doomed is not the only conclusion that suggests itself. There’s a risk that other lessons will be drawn from this terrible episode – lessons that have to be resisted.The first is the one you could hear on phone-in shows all week and which has an immediate, easy appeal. It says, with a world-weariness that poses as wisdom: what has happened is no surprise because that’s what they’re all like. All politicians are in it for themselves. Sure, Mandelson was more blatant – grovelling to billionaires, hustling for big-money jobs and seats on the board when he was barely out of the ministerial door – but the rest are no different. Starmer himself recognises how widely that belief is held. He reportedlytold his cabinet: “The public don’t really see individuals in this scandal, they see politicians.”That has to be fought. Partly because, as anyone who has spent much time with actual politicians knows, most are not like Mandelson. Plenty are weird; quite a few are consumed by ambition and the desire to climb the greasy pole. But so lacking in scruples that they would not only be best pals with a convicted child abuser but pass government secrets to him at the height of a global financial crisis? No, that is the exception, not the rule.“Plague on all their houses” cynicism has to be fought for another reason too: because it is the seedbed for Reform UK and Nigel Farage. The only way they can prevail is if the British electorate decides that all politics, and all politicians, are rotten to the core. Farage feeds on such sour cynicism; he needs it to spread. It might seem smart, undeceived and suitably sophisticated to depict Mandelson as just the most visible fruit from a wholly poisoned Westminster tree, but do that and you smooth the way for a nationalist authoritarian government headed by a man whose favourite world leaders are Trump and Vladimir Putin.There is, incidentally, a factional version of the all-as-bad-as-each-other position and it’s already audible within theLabouruniverse. It holds that Mandelson might not be typical of all politicians, but he is typical of the New Labour tendency – in thrall to wealth, denuded of values, heedless of the vulnerable. But that too is a caricature, one that forgets that an even bigger figure in the creation of New Labour was Gordon Brown, a man obsessed with tackling poverty and whose lack of interest in material goods is renowned. It matters because, as Ed Miliband learned, trashing the reputation of New Labour does not endear voters to Labour – it just discredits the whole party.As for Starmer, his concerns are more immediate. There are things he can do. He can encourage his allies to scare Labour MPs thinking of toppling him by urging them to contemplate the alternatives. Wes Streeting, longtime mentee ofPeter Mandelson? Angela Rayner, driven out as deputy PM by financial scandal? Miliband, rejected by the voters more than a decade ago?Starmer can hope that the Labour chair of parliament’s intelligence and security committee decides to take months rather than days to work through all the documents they have been asked to review, in the hope that the fury currently felt by Labour MPs slowly subsides into mere sullen discontent. Or he can cast aside his human shield by demanding the resignation of his chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney, who pushed so assiduously for the Mandelson appointment.But those moves have one thing in common: they merely buy time, postponing the day of reckoning. There is one other argument Starmer may be tempted to offer in his defence, though it’s one he would surely not dare make.He could say that what has enraged so many, including among his own MPs, was his admission on Wednesday that he had known, when he appointed him, that Mandelson had continued his relationship with Epstein. But, Starmer could say, pointing his finger at the benches in front of and behind him, so did all of you. It had all been laid out, in detail, two years before Mandelson was posted to the US, in a JP Morgan reportcovered in the Financial Times. Why did so few of you protest at the time? Why, on the contrary, did the Westminster village,including Farageby the way, along with most of the media, support the appointment, declaring it a masterstroke?It’s not as though association with Epstein after the latter’s imprisonment was previously understood to be acceptable: look at the response to the then Prince Andrew’s Newsnight interview in 2019. Yet the outrage of that moment had clearly faded six years later. Just before Starmer sent him to Washington, Mandelson had been the chancellor of a British university and the co-host of a Times podcast; he was on screen throughout the BBC’s election night coverage in July 2024. What was once deemed disqualifying from public life was regarded so no longer.That raises much larger, and darker, questions than “How long has Starmer got?” Put simply, why did the pain and torment endured by so many women and girls register only fleetingly? What is it about the suffering of women at the hands of rich and powerful men that made it so forgettable?Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A gigantic arch! Trump’s gaudy plans for America’s 250th anniversaryFrom minting coins featuring his own face to covering buildings with gold, the president’s proposals for marking America’s semiquincentennial say a lot about the country’s backwards outlookCatherine SlessorFri 6 Feb 2026 09.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.42 ESTShareWhen the United States celebrated its bicentennial on 4 July 1976, it marked the occasion with the opening of the National Air and Space Museum’s exhibition hall on Washington DC’s National Mall. Designed in a boldly modernist style by the blue-chip firm Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum (now HOK), it stood as a testament to American aeronautical derring-do, from the Wright brothers to the moon landings.At the time, even though the stench of Republican political shenanigans was never far off, with Gerald Ford replacing the disgraced Richard Nixon in 1974, there was a sense of a nation embracing progress, looking forward, not back. For all the historical re-enactments of Washington crossing the Delaware, the US chose to see itself through the prism of modernity and technological puissance.Half a century on, as the country prepares to mark the 250th anniversary of its founding, historical re-enactments have edged out just about everything when it comes to architecture. Intent on stamping his crassly gilded imprimatur on Washington, Donald Trump recently shared the latest iterations of his proposed triumphal arch, first unveiled last October, to be erected just across from the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River.His post on Truth Socialshows three uncredited versions of the so-called “Arc de Trump” now rebadged as the Independence Arch, embellished with varying degrees of gilding and statuary.Given Trump’s weakness for bling, the smart money would be on the gilded iteration, a gaudy exemplar of what the American architecture critic Kate Wagner has described as “regional car dealership rococo”. All three versions are modelled on the Arch of Titus in Rome, originally constructed in the first century following Rome’s military conquest of Jerusalem. As a template from classical antiquity, it has popped up throughout history, from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to New York’s Washington Square Arch.View image in fullscreenA mock-up of the planned Independence Arch shows where it would sit, across from the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River in Washington DC.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesInitially, Trump teasingly floated a choice of three different scales for his Independence Arch but has apparently alighted on the largest, which would be 250ft (76 metres) tall. And though the scale has alarmed some architectural and conservation experts, who see it as potentially distorting the relationship between existing historic monuments, Trump feels that “250 for 250” – a foot for every year of the US’s existence – chimes perfectly with his ambitions.“The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And we’re gonna top it by, I think, a lot,” Trump said at a White House Christmas reception in December. For context, the Arc de Triomphe is 164ft tall.Historically, triumphal arches – the bigger the better – have been catnip to despots of all stripes. Hitler confected one with his pet architect, Albert Speer, for his postwar vision of Berlin as awelthauptstadtor world capital. At a colossal 328ft, it would have dwarfed the Arc de Trump and the Arc de Triomphe.Trump’s other semiquincentennial wheezes includeminting $1 coins with his face on them, thereby flouting an 1866 law that prohibits a living person from appearing on US currency. He also plans tostage a star-studded Ultimate Fighting Championship eventin a temporary arena at the White House. It’s hard to imagine any other US president countenancing a cage fight on the south lawn, but we’re not in Kansas any more, and Trump’s cronies in all areas of public and cultural life seem content to enable his killer clown proclivities.Yet there has been some pushback on his controversial plan toshutter and redevelop the Kennedy Center, a model of elegantly modern formalism by Edward Durell Stone dating from 1971. Trump employed his familiar gameplan for the Kennedy debacle, convinced that he knows better than the experts, and that a “silent majority” actually supports his disruptions.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s post of Truth Social showing the options for his arch, which would dwarf the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.Photograph: Truth Social/@realDonaldTrumpHowever, after boycotts by several performers, the US chapter of Docomomo, a global heritage body dedicated to conserving modern buildings, has come out swinging. Its executive director, Liz Waytkus, told the Architect’s Newspaper that “in addition to being a beloved cultural institution honouring the life and legacy of our 35th president, the Kennedy Center is a celebrated work of modern architecture and a landmark achievement by master architect Edward Durell Stone”.Waytkus added: “Docomomo US remains deeply concerned by the ongoing lack of adherence to the regulatory processes that govern federally owned properties. Sites such as the Kennedy Center belong to the public and must be stewarded transparently, not treated as private assets.” She also confirmed that Docomomo is “joining with like-minded organisations to assert the public’s right to review and participate in decisions affecting these nationally significant places”.In co-opting history and its symbols for his own ends, Trump clearly sees himself as some kind of untouchable modern Roman emperor, with a penchant for spectacle of both the human and architectural kind. His mandates stipulating that “classical” or “traditional” styles are used for federal buildings are calculated to exert power over public space and stifle any remotely progressive ideals. No doubt he loathes HOK’s National Air and Space Museum.While the latest iteration of Trump’s overbearing arch may be hucksterishly spun as a tribute to US independence, if he really means to go full Roman, he may want to engage a flunky to whisper in his ear what was murmured to triumphant Roman generals during their victory parades: “Memento mori.” Remember, you are mortal. And all things must pass.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With one about women in Belfast, obviously. That’s what Lisa McGee has done. Her new eight-parter, How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, is as far away fromDerry Girlsas you can get when the distance between the worlds amounts to 70 miles along the A6.Or as she puts it: “I wanted a shit, female, Northern Irish A-Team!”Part thriller, part surrealist comedy, How to Get to Heaven from Belfast follows Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher), Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) and Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne), who have been pals since their teenage years at the accurately named Our Lady of the Sorrows school – and who get dragged into a Knives Out-style mystery after the shocking death of their school friend, Greta.Although the show is billed as a mystery comedy thriller – McGee also took heavy inspiration from Columbo and Scooby-Doo – it is at heart, like Derry Girls before it, a story about friendship. More specifically, about female friendships that span decades, the shared memories and the pressure to edit those shared memories to suit our ideas of ourselves.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to put my voice on something new’ …Lisa McGee on the set of How To Get To Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/Netflix“The problem with a group of friends that have known each other since they were kids,” says McGee, “is that you know everything. And sometimes you don’t want that thing from your past being brought up again. Or you don’t want to talk about that story because it doesn’t represent you as you see yourself now. So it can get quite spiky. You’re living this agreed lie. But in a more comical way, you get away with nothing. I remember starting to eat sushi when I was in my 20s and my friends being like: ‘Who the hell do you think you are?’”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast comes on the heels of three seasons of Derry Girls, a smash hit for McGee. But it actually precedes it by decades. “I wrote it as a play when I was at Queen’s University here in Belfast, and it was about a reunion,” says McGee.She took the name from flyers thrust into her hands by Christian societies during freshers week. “I hadn’t done anything yet, and it wasn’t very good,” she jokes of the original How to Get to Heaven from Belfast. “But then during Derry Girls, a lot of my schoolfriends started coming to the premieres …” It was seeing those old pals again that made her go back to the play she’d written 20 years prior.View image in fullscreenThree’s company … (from left) Dunne, Keenan and Gallagher with Bronagh Gallagher as Booker in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixLike the teen survivalist thrillerYellowjackets, the story jumps back and forwards in time, showing the gang as adults but also as their teenage selves. The flashbacks are mysterious, all satanic symbols etched on walls and burning sheds in the woods. At other times it’s as explosive as a show likeThe White Lotus… if it were set in Ballycastle (there is somehow a yacht and a car chase, both of which blow up).Before they go on a madcap sleuthing adventure to get to the bottom of Greta’s death, the women’s circumstances are sobering. Dara lives at home, caring for her overbearing mother after a terrible breakup; Saoirse is a TV writer in London engaged to a man she doesn’t really like; and Robyn, a glamorous but harried mum of four, is married to one she’s not fond of either. Greta’s death unmoors them, but it also offers an escape from the humdrum and lets them embrace the uncanny elements of their own lives. It’s inevitable, really, in a place like the north-west. “Derry people,” Robyn muses, “are always such weirdos.”Together, the three travel to Greta’s wake, where they encounter her strange family. Her mother lies about Greta’s childhood, her daughter, wide-eyed and ghostly in a frog hat, freaks them all out. Worst of all is her widower, Garda officer Owen (Emmett J Scanlan), who is determined to cast himself as a grieving husband while seemingly hiding more sinister secrets.View image in fullscreenSleuth worker … James Martin as Tommy in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixThe show is a mystery within a mystery. While trying to uncover the truth about Greta’s death, Robyn, Saoirse and Dara confront the dark secret from their teenage years none of them want to look back on. The trio have matching tribal tattoos (Greta had one too), the meaning of which is never explained. They’re adamant they “didn’t do anything wrong” with the “thing we never talk about”, but the audience is only teased with what that thing could be – and whether the women are lying to us, and themselves, about their guilt.Like Scooby-Doo’s Mystery Gang running riot in the hills and villages of the west of Northern Ireland, Saoirse, Dara and Robyn are far more likely to stumble through their murder mystery than solve it. They storm the wrong funeral wearing Disney princess masks, scandalising a church full of mourners. A twister (bad weather, even for Ireland) forces them to take refuge in the attic of eccentric innkeeper Seamus (Ardal O’Hanlon), who wears a spinning bow tie and spends his evenings hosting a series of ever more wacky themed discos. Dara extracts information from a local funeral director by staging her own – very alive – mother’s wake.The craic may be deadly, in other words, but it’s still craic. The crimes and tragedies here are offbeat and fantastical – a boy from Fermanagh has been raised by chickens, a Kenny Rogers impersonator from Ballybunion has been killed by being thrown off a bucking bronco during country songBoot Scootin’ Boogie.“I always loved the mystery genre, and I wanted to put my voice on something new,” says McGee. “I really, really want people to like it, but I don’t feel that pressure I had [with Derry Girls], certainly when the third series was coming out. I felt like such a huge responsibility for that to land in a way that everyone at home was happy with. Now I feel like I’m just telling a story and it happens to be set in Northern Ireland. I just hope people enjoy the ride. I hope they like the friendship group. I hope they laugh.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m just telling a story and it happens to be set in Northern Ireland’ says Lisa McGee.McGee lives in Belfast with her husband, English actor Tobias Beer, and their two sons, after 12 years in London. “I was really frustrated with London,” she says. “But I was also frustrated when I came home, because I didn’t feel like I was part of that.” Those experiences are mirrored in Saoirse, who won’t commit to a life in either place, and endures the indignity of having her colleagues explain away her brusqueness as a cultural trait. “I’m so sorry,” one says, “she’s Irish.” Saoirse’s name is frequently shortened to “Seersh”, which is arguably only slightly less torturous than being an Irish writer in London named “Róisín” and having your name constantly shortened to “Rowsh”.“That’s the really interesting thing about identity,” says McGee. “You don’t quite know where you fit. Your job takes you to this place, but there’s stuff about this place that frustrates the hell out of you. And then you come home and people are like: ‘I don’t care about your stupid London job.’”There are elements of the Derry Girls in all the How to Get to Heaven from Belfast characters. McGee says Dara is similar to Orla, while Robyn shares much of the same DNA as Michelle, and is based on the same real-life friend, who grew up to become a similarly glam mum of four. But there’s an edge to the friendships that feels truer to the experience of navigating relationships in adulthood. “It’s the same group of girls,” she says, “only we’ve grown up now and we still don’t know what we’re doing!”Although How to Get to Heaven deals with inalienable truths of life – fashion is circular, friendship is complicated, you never get a crowd for a closed casket at a wake, obviously don’t marry a police officer, although it might be grand to ride one occasionally – it feels quintessentially Northern Irish in tone, a dark comedy odyssey through the Lynchian bleakness of Ireland’s rural north-west.View image in fullscreenBack in the day … Saoirse Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Dylan Llewellyn and Jamie-Lee O’Donnell in Derry Girls.Photograph: Peter Marley/Peter Marley/Channel 4“When you think about the history of Northern Ireland, the people and the landscape, there’s something so charming and beautiful, but it can turn really quickly,” says McGee. “Something that was the most picturesque, gorgeous thing [can become] suddenly really dangerous. There are so many layers to the place with the history and what we’ve been through. The landscape is so wild and gorgeous and in the dark so scary. There’s all the ingredients you need for a very scary story.”If there’s misery in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, it’s short-lived. “I don’t believe you can sustain that level of depression,” says McGee. “Really bad stuff was happening here for quite a long time, but it’s like, you can’t stay at that. Someone will say something ridiculous or do something inappropriate and then the conversation changes. I think comedy is way more truthful than drama at times because people are just ridiculous, particularly somewhere like Northern Ireland.”That doesn’t mean they’re not amazing to watch. As with Derry Girls, the women are active protagonists, not passive characters watching their lives pass them by. “They needed to feel badass,” says McGee. “They don’t make it better a lot of the time, and a lot of the time they’re making it worse. I wanted any woman watching this to think: ‘Oh, that looks a bit sticky, but I’d love to do that with my friends. I’d love to solve something like that.’ That was always my driving force … that and sometimes you need to blow a few things up.”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast is on Netflix on12 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But far better artists have been similarly profane for centuriesFri 6 Feb 2026 10.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 12.31 ESTShareIt must be the ugliest wall painting in Rome - and that’s even without the bizarre portrait of Giorgia Meloni as an angel. ArtistBruno Valentinetti painted his tributeto Umberto II, the last king of Italy, earlier this century in a side chapel of the ancient church of San Lorenzo in Lucina in its historic heart, the Centro Storico. It’s the kind of unsightly accretion you try to ignore when enjoying the city’s artistic glories which include, in this particular church, a staggering,stormy vision of the Crucifixionby the 17th-century painter Guido Reni, his most unforgettable masterpiece.Valentinetti’s mural, by contrast, is a glib, tacky, photorealist effort that didn’t even last two decades before water damage demanded restoration. Valentinetti, now 83, carried out the repairs himself and had the genius idea of giving an angel the face –highly recognisable because obviously based on photos of her – of Italy’s populist prime minister. What was he thinking? Is he in love? Or was this an insidious piece of propaganda?View image in fullscreenMeloni no more … the face of the angel erased from the fresco after protests.Photograph: Remo Casilli/ReutersGiven Meloni’s far right political roots, it may be significant that she materialised in the chapel of Italy’s last monarch. Umberto II’s father Victor Emmanuel III collaborated with Mussolini and ceded the throne to his son in 1946 in the hope of clearing the monarchy’s name. But in a referendum that year, the people chose a republic anyway and Umberto II went into exile in Portugal. So in the artist’s mind, and Meloni’s “Who, me?” reaction to his angelic vision of her, perhaps there are disturbing affinities with the authoritarian Italy of the early 20th century.The church may have suspected this. After removing Meloni’s face, the artist claimed he was pressured to do so by the Vatican. Cardinal Don Baldo Reina has spoken of his “bitterness” at the artist’s secret portrait, strong language conveying condemnation of Meloni’s uninvited appearance in the heavens. This is understandable in our dark times. In Europe’s populist age you never know what is funny and what is terrifying. The artist may be a harmless eccentric or a gaslighting manipulator – either way Meloni gets free publicity and the undercurrent of an idea that she’s in some way holy or chosen by God. Funny if you don’t think about it too much, a bit scary if you do.View image in fullscreenOnly human … Madonna and Child With Two Angels by Fra Filippo Lippi.Photograph: AlamyYet one thing the cardinal says about art, and Italy’s religious art in particular, is nonsense. It’s wrong to paint Meloni in a church, he argues, because “images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited”. In other words, the sacred and profane are separate, and Christian art must be free from any taint of politics or contemporary life. When has that ever been true?Italy’s frescoed churches are full of portraits of real people, powerful and famous in their day, depicted as unmistakably as Meloni. In Santa Maria Novella in Florence you can see women of the wealthy Tornabuoni family portrayed in scenes of theBirths of the Virgin and Baptist by Domenico Ghirlandaioin the 1400s. In another Florentine church, Lorenzo de’ Medici greets his young sons and their tutor in a scene of the history of the Franciscan order. These are naked displays of wealth and status by leading families in the sacred setting of a church. The Medici went further and had themselves and their friends portrayed byBenozzo Gozzoliin their family chapel in the company of the Magi, processing to the Holy Land. A business associate of theirs got Botticelli to portray them as the Magi themselves, wealthy and wise, with Cosimo de’ Medici touching the foot of Christ.Would these have made Don Baldo Reina feel “bitter” if he was around in 15th-century Italy? Such gross, quasi-blasphemous displays certainly appalled Savonarola, who toppled the Medici in a religious revolution. Yet the contemporary portraits that fill Italian Renaissance art also humanise holy themes, dragging art out of the holy shadows into real life. And while rich people paid for their faces to be inserted into religious scenes, artists also took advantage to do so secretly, in brilliantly ambiguous fusions of the sacred and profane that haunt and stun us today.View image in fullscreenPainfully familiar … Minos in Michelangelo’s Last Judgment.Photograph: Public domainThe first artist who did this was probably Fra Filippo Lippi, a friar who ran off with a nun called Lucrezia Buti. They had two children together and Lippi seems to celebrate his partner (they never married) in depictions of the Madonna. HisVirgin and Childin the Uffizi Gallery adorns Mary with ravishing jewels and translucent silk in a way that outrageously crosses the line between reverence and desire: it is hard to believe this is not his portrait of Buti.Some of the most celebrated frescoes in Rome contain portraits of contemporaries that artists added secretly or unofficially as private jokes, homages or acts of revenge, even in the heart of papal Rome. The most astonishing is inMichelangelo’s Last Judgmentin the Sistine Chapel. When a papal official called Biagio da Cesena accused Michelangelo of filling this fresco with male nudes for his own irreligious reasons, Michelangelo responded by giving Minos, the judge of Hell, Biagio’s face. He stands to this day, in the chapel where popes are elected, with a snake wrapped around his naked body, clamping its mouth on his penis.What has changed? Obviously these were great artists, their private portraits artistic miracles. The portrait of Meloni was an embarrassing hack job that deserved to be removed on aesthetic grounds alone. Yet our expectations of church art are also different. It is required to be safe and contemplative, not contentiously real. That is surely at least partly because while Christianity once permeated everyday life without barriers between life and faith, in the modern world it’s a more tenuous presence, even in Italy. And it is overshadowed by politics.It’s probably safe to say that the Vatican under American Pope Leo XIV is to the left of Meloni’s government. So when Valentinetti inserted into his restoration job the face of a rightwing populist, implying that Meloni belongs with the angels, the Church begged to differ. She may look like an angel to Bruno Valentinetti, but for a lot of us she’s the devil in disguise.Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtMichelangelocommentShareReuse this content"

Looking at Jack Thorne’s astonishing list of credits, it’s hard to argue. The prolific playwright and screenwriter’s output includes many of the best homegrown TV dramas of the past two decades.That’s without the many hit plays and films he has also written. There’s more to come, too. Next out of the Thorne pipeline is Channel 4’s forbidden romance Falling, with Keeley Hawes and Paapa Essiedu, and the film Enola Holmes 3, which will be followed by the small matter of Sam Mendes’four Beatles biopics.As Thorne’s new BBC adaptation of Lord of the Flies arrives, we’ve rated his 20 TV projects so far. Surely he’s overdue a holiday?20. The Eddy (2020)View image in fullscreenAmandla Stenberg and André Holland in The Eddy.Photograph: Lou Faulon/APA rare misfire saw Thorne penning a moody Netflix musical drama for director Damien Chazelle about a bereaved jazz pianist running a struggling Paris nightclub. With dialogue in French, English, Arabic and Polish, it was as confusing as it was chin-strokey.19.The Accident(2019)This Channel 4 miniseries followed a south Wales community’s fight for justice after local teens were killed in an explosion at a building site. It was rousing and righteous, but was let down by Sarah Lancashire’s wobbly Welsh accent and a plodding courtroom climax. Thorne would later tell a similar story in Toxic Town to more powerful effect.18. Cast Offs (2009)This unjustly forgotten Channel 4 mockumentary followed six disabled people sent to a remote island for a fictional reality show. Episodes intercut the Survivor-style action with flashbacks fleshing out their lives. These proved superior to the main plot. Darkly funny and bracingly transgressive.17. Lord of the Flies (2026)Pass the conch. The first ever TV adaptation of William Golding’s classic novel about stranded schoolboys sees writer Thorne reunite with a regular collaborator, director Marc Munden. The result is low on dialogue, high on unsettling atmospherics. However, it’s lifted by the brilliant performances of its young cast, particularly David McKenna as Piggy.16. The Last Panthers (2015)Kicking off with a diamond heist, this Sky Atlantic six-parter delved into a sprawling international alliance between criminal gangs and shadowy “banksters”. The sleek trilingual series had elements of a textbook Euro-pudding, deliberately designed to appeal continent-wide, but was more thrilling than most. Samantha Morton, John Hurt and a David Bowie theme tune helped.15.His Dark Materials(2019-2022)It was no easy task to adapt Philip Pullman’s epic multi-world trilogy for TV. This HBO/BBC co-production didn’t entirely succeed but did a damn sight better than the00s film flop. It was visually stunning and strongly performed (Ruth Wilson’s villainous Mrs Coulter was a standout) but, ironically, lacked a little magic dust.14.The Hack(2025)This ITV romp told the story of the News International phone hacking scandal. With David Tennant breaking the fourth wall as Guardian journalist Nick Davies and a parallel plot following Robert Carlyle’s police detective, it recounted the sprawling saga in galloping style, although the playful tone jarred with some. Anyone would think a Harry Hill cameo was a bad thing.13.Then Barbara Met Alan(2022)Co-written with Genevieve Barr, this one-off drama celebrated a milestone in civil rights history. It told the true story of cabaret performers Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth, whose campaign for disabled rights resulted in the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. A rollicking activism biopic, wrapped up inside a sparky romcom – complete with disabled sex scenes, rare on mainstream TV.12. Don’t Take My Baby (2015)Another superb standalone factual drama. Based on real testimonies, this BBC Three heartbreaker chronicled a young disabled couple’s fight for custody of their newborn daughter. Would wheelchair user Anna and partially sighted Tom be allowed to keep their baby? Or will social worker Belinda take her into care? It went on to win the Bafta for best single drama.11.Toxic Town(2025)View image in fullscreenJodie Whittaker and Aimee Lou Wood in Toxic Town.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixThe legal case was dubbed “the British Erin Brockovich”. This Netflix miniseries dramatised the Corby toxic waste scandal by following three mothers involved in the case. When contaminated soil from the dismantled steelworks caused congenital birth defects in local babies, the women fought a council cover-up. Jodie Whittaker, Aimee Lou Wood and Claudia Jessie made for compelling leads.10. Glue (2014)Broadchurch meets Skins, anyone? E4’s gripping rural whodunnit laid bare the dark heart of the bucolic Berkshire countryside. When a 14-year-old Romany boy was found murdered, the investigation uncovered all manner of druggy criminality. The cast brimmed with rising stars, among them Callum Turner, Billy Howle, Faye Marsay and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.9. The Fades (2011)This bold, Bafta-winning BBC Three supernatural drama followed bed-wetting student Paul (Iain de Caestecker), who was able to see vengeful spirits of the dead all around him. He was pulled into a battle between these zombie-like “Fades” and the “Angelics” able to detect them. Tense, haunting and gory, it had a strong cast that included Daniel Kaluuya, Natalie Dormer, Johnny Harris – and Daniela Nardini as a gun-toting priest.8. Skins (2007-2009)The landmark E4 teen drama would figure higher here, except Thorne was a relatively small cog in its machine, writing five episodes in its first three series – plus one instalment of the US remake. His writing of the Bristolian sixth formers was an early sign of his deftness of touch with controversial issues and acute understanding of young lives. Thorne credits showrunner Bryan Elsley as a formative influence on his career.7.Kiri(2018)This wonderfully observed, warmly humane four-parter centred on the abduction of the titular nine-year-old Black girl, who had been fostered by a middle-class white couple and was about to be adopted by them. The mighty Sarah Lancashire was mesmerising as her social worker, strongly supported by Paapa Essiedu and Wunmi Mosaku. It became a breakout hit for Channel 4, clocking up 5 million viewers and becoming the biggest ever drama on its catchup service. Not bad for a penetrating study of race, class and family.6.Help(2021)There was a flurry of lockdown dramas during Covid. This was comfortably the best – and angriest. Following Jodie Comer’s care home assistant and Stephen Graham’s resident with early-onset Alzheimer’s, it was a blistering indictment of the plight of vulnerable people during the pandemic and the myriad ways they were failed by the government. The harrowingly hellish night shift sequence, shot in a 26-minute single take by director Marc Munden, was a masterpiece.5.National Treasure(2016)View image in fullscreenFrom left: Andrea Riseborough, Robbie Coltrane and Julie Walters in National Treasure.Photograph: Joss Barratt/Channel 4/PA“They think I’m Jimmy fucking Savile.” Inspired by Operation Yewtree, this Bafta-winning miniseries starred Robbie Coltrane as a veteran gameshow host. When he was accused of historic sex crimes during his standup days, his family’s life fell apart. It would be Coltrane’s last major role before his death. Julie Walters as his longsuffering wife and Andrea Riseborough as his drug addict daughter were equally devastating. A morally knotty treatise on memory and truth, celebrity and power.4.Best Interests(2023)Another miniseries, this time for the BBC, tackling issues around disability. Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen delivered powerhouse performances as a married couple fighting for their disabled daughter’s future. When she winds up in intensive care after a chest infection, doctors question whether treatment should be withdrawn. Her parents fight for medical care to continue but are driven apart by the battle. Urgent, unflinching and profoundly moving, with tragic echoes of the previous year’sArchie Battersbee case.3.The Virtues(2019)One of Thorne’s fruitful collaborations with writer-director Shane Meadows. The Channel 4 miniseries was based partly on the latter’s own experience of repressing the memory of childhood sexual abuse. Stephen Graham was heartbreakingly convincing as the unravelling alcoholic who returned to his native Ireland to find his estranged sister – in the process unearthing a horrific buried trauma from his past. Niamh Algar and Helen Behan co-starred and PJ Harvey composed the soundtrack; the bruisingly painful material was masterfully handled.2.Adolescence(2025)In terms of sheer impact, this would be No 1. Quality-wise, it came mighty close, too. The Guardian’s critic Lucy Mangan called it “the closest thing to TV perfection in decades”. Co-created with star Stephen Graham, last year’s Netflix four-parter was an unflinching look at the deadly consequences of online life leaking into the real world. Tracing the fallout of a 13-year-old boy’s arrest for the murder of a female classmate, director Philip Barantini audaciously filmed each episode in one continuous take. Graham andErin Dohertydelivered bravura turns. Newcomer Owen Cooper became the youngest ever Emmy-winner. Thorne wanted to “look in the eye of modern male rage”. He did so in a devastating drama that transcended TV to hit headlines worldwide.1. This Is England ’86, ’88 and ’90 (2010-2015)Edging out Adolescence partly thanks to its scope and longevity, the three tumultuous TV sequels to Shane Meadows’ 2006 coming-of-age film combined bittersweet romance with brutal violence to uncompromising effect. Set in 1986, 1988 and 1990, the vibrant backdrop spanned from the mod revival to rave culture, adding up to a resonant parallel history of Thatcher’s Britain. The lovingly portayed Midlands gang of Shaun, Woody, Lol, Milky, Combo, Smell and the rest became like old friends. By turns deeply affecting, stomach-churningly tense and anarchically funny, all set to an evocative soundtrack, it’s a modern masterpiece. And if rumours ofThis Is England’00 are to be believed, the final adventure is still to come.Lord of the Flies starts on 8 February on BBC One.

APCO also sought to identify the journalists’ sources.Simons received a briefing from APCO on its final report, sources said, which included findings drawn from examination of the journalists who had investigated Labour Together.Labour thinktank close to Morgan McSweeney paid firm to investigate journalistsRead moreThe disclosures about Simons’ personal knowledge of the private investigation present another major challenge to Starmer and McSweeney, his most senior aide, after a week in which both havefaced calls for their resignationoverPeter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.Under McSweeney, Labour Together played a key role in Starmer’s victory in the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and remained closely allied to the Labour leader after Simons took charge.APCO’s work to investigate the journalists wasfirst reportedby the Substack publication Democracy for Sale. Downing Street has refused to say whether McSweeney also knew about the hiring of APCO.Two sources said he was intimately involved with the strategy of the organisation even after leaving. One said: “There was never any distance between Labour Together and Morgan, even after he left.”Earlier on Friday, there were calls from Labour MPs for an investigation and a “clear-out” in Downing Street after news of the thinktank’s relationship with APCO emerged. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the investigation into journalists “truly shocking” in a letter to Hollie Ridley, the Labour party’s general secretary.He added: “If the reports of [Labour Together’s] activities in surveilling journalists are accurate it is clear that this organisation and its operators and controllers are bringing our party into disrepute.”Ridley, who is close to McSweeney, has refused to launch an investigation, telling McDonnell in reply: “As there is no contractual or governance relationship between Labour Together and the party, any allegations regarding the activity of Labour Together as an entity fall outside our remit.”McDonnell called the refusal to investigate “appallingly complacent and ill-judged”. He added in a response to Ridley: “Given the seriousness of this matter and the report of the alleged direct involvement of Labour party members in this activity I would have expected you to have taken this matter more seriously.”The Labour MP Kim Johnson said that “what’s been exposed shows McSweeney’s operation is rotten to the core”. She added: “We’re told the adults are in the room. If this is their idea of leadership, No 10 needs gutting from top to bottom.”Questions over Labour Together’s fundingfirst emerged in February 2021after its interim leadership reported itself to the Electoral Commission for the late reporting of £740,000 in donations. The thinktank was later fined £14,250 in September 2021.In November 2023, the Sunday Timespublished an investigationthat alleged it was McSweeney who had failed to declare the donations between 2017 and 2020. The undeclared money is said to have paid for polling and campaigning that supported Starmer’s rise to the Labour leadership. McSweeney did not comment on the allegation.McSweeney formally left Labour Together in April 2020 when he became Starmer’s chief of staff upon his election as party leader. Sources close to McSweeney said he had not taken the decision to hire APCO and it was a matter for Labour Together.By the time of the Sunday Times investigation, Labour Together was being led by Simons. APCO was commissioned following concerns at the thinktank that the information published had been derived from a potential data breach, a source told the Guardian.Internal reports prepared by APCO for Labour Together named the Sunday Times journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, as well as the Guardian’s Henry Dyer, Declassified UK’s John McEvoy and journalists from other outlets as “significant persons of interest”. It sought to “identify the source of the information and to ascertain what additional information could be published” by journalists about Labour Together.APCO’s research included an examination of stories and social media posts written by the journalists. The work was led at APCO by Tom Harper, a former journalist at the Sunday Times. Harper provided briefings to Simons, sources have told the Guardian.Democracy for Sale has alleged Labour Together paid the PR firm at least £30,000 to identify the source of stories about its funding.The briefings supplied to the thinktank by APCO claim that one possible source of the Sunday Timesstory was a Russian or Chinese hack of the Electoral Commission.The contract shows that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the American journalist Matt Taibbi.Those close to the group said they were concerned that the information accessed by Holden and Taibbi originated from a hack of the Electoral Commission itself.They added that they did not intend for the probe to look into other journalists, even though the contract itself specifically mentioned the article by Pogrund and Yorke.Simons’ receipt of APCO’s research – which focused on the work of journalists carrying out public interest investigations into the finances of the thinktank that he led – has raised questions about his role as a Cabinet Office minister.Labour Together did not comment. One person who has previously worked with the group called the decision to hire investigators “bizarre”, adding: “I’ve never come across anything like it in my political life.” Another said it was “weird”.One Labour MP said: “If the prime minister wants to regain the support of the parliamentary Labour party, he has got to get Morgan the hell out of the party. Otherwise he will end up bringing it into disrepute.”Simons claimed on X on Friday night that the intention of the APCO project was to look into a suspected illegal hack “which had nothing to do with UK journalists at Sunday Times, Guardian or any other brilliant UK newspaper”.He added: “APCO’s investigation never fully got to the bottom of this. Those who know me know I think the work of journalists is vital to our democracy.”Simons and Harper did not respond to a formal request for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I greatly regret this appointment,” he wrote, saying that at the time he was told that Mandelson’s record in Brussels had been “unblemished” and he did not know about any Epstein links.“I did so in spite of him being anything but a friend to me, because I thought that his unquestioned knowledge of Europe and beyond could help us as we dealt with the global financial crisis,” Brown wrote.“I now know that I was wrong. He seems to have used market-sensitive inside information to betray the principles in which he said he believed, and he betrayed the people who believed in them – and him.”Mandelson was sacked as Keir Starmer’s ambassador to the US in September after new details emerged of his friendship with Epstein, ties that lasted beyond the late child sex offender’s jailing in 2008.But the release this week of masses of new documents about Epstein and his contacts showed the closeness of their ties. They also suggested Mandelson had received money from Epstein, and had leaked market-sensitive information to the financier, which is now the subject ofa criminal investigation.Labour MPs have expressed alarm thatStarmer’s decision to publish thousands of documents about Mandelsoncould lead to months of damaging headlines.In a statement on Friday afternoon, the Met said officers weresearching two homesconnected to Mandelson, in north London and Wiltshire. Mandelson has been living in a rented property in Wiltshire since returning to the UK.“The searches are related to an ongoing investigation into misconduct in public office offences involving a 72-year-old man. He has not been arrested and inquiries are ongoing,” the statement said.On Friday evening Starmer, in a letter to Lord Beamish, the chair of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, said that he had asked the cabinet secretary “to work with you and your committee to agree the detail of how material that may be prejudicial to the UK’s national security and international relations is shared and reviewed”.Starmer added: “It is important that documents are made available to parliament as soon as possible, noting that there is likely to be a very significant volume of material that will need to be reviewed to establish whether it is in scope.”This week’s revelationscaused furyamong many Labour MPs, especially after Starmer disclosed in the Commons on Wednesday that he had agreed to the ambassadorial appointment while knowing about Mandleson’s post-prison ties to Epstein.In response to a Conservative Commons motion, the prime minister has agreed to the publication of all documents, emails and messages connected to the appointment, an extremely broad remit that is worrying someLabourMPs.Government officials said on Friday that the total number of documents was thought to be in the “high tens of thousands”. One said: “It’s a very big task. This is a public inquiry-level amount of information.”Starmer had hoped to publish a mass of documents about the case on Wednesday. However, the scale of the task, in which officials will have to check every document for sensitive information, with any relevant ones passed to parliament’s intelligence and security committee for checking, could result in embarrassing revelations dribbling out over weeks or months.One MP said that while this was unwelcome, there was “no way to avoid it, as it would look like a cover-up”. Another said it was important to make sure the ISC had the necessary resources to cope with the expected workload.Although No 10 hoped MPs’ anger would dissipate over the weekend, there wererenewed calls on Friday for the removal of Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who is close to Mandelson and is believed to have pushed for the appointment.The Labour MP for Stroud, Simon Opher, told the BBC: “Keir Starmer needs to change his advisers in No 10. I think he’s been badly advised, and he’s been really let down, particularly on this decision.“I know in politics we really rely on people to cover our backs, our advisers, and I think they patently haven’t done this withPeter Mandelson. So we need a bit of a clear-out at No 10.”Asked whether that meant sacking McSweeney, Opher replied: “I think so, yes. If my chief of staff had done this I think he would be looking for another job, to be honest.”Downing Street said on Friday that McSweeney retained the prime minister’s confidence.Also on Friday, the immigration minister, Mike Tapp, said that while he understood MPs’ anger, the party needed to “stick with Keir Starmer”.Brown, in his article, said he worried deeply about the corrosive effect such scandals had on public opinion, and called for what he termed “comprehensive and immediate action to clean up our politics”.As part of that, he said, new government ministers should face US-style confirmation hearings, “to ensure the right questions are asked and answered in public about present and past interests and conduct”.Brown also called for a powerful and independent anti-corruption commission, and for expanded powers for the ethics and integrity commission, set up by Starmer’s government last year.Explore more on these topicsGordon BrownPeter MandelsonLabourJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmerShareReuse this content"

And I think that that is just a concern of mine. It’s something that, sadly, we’re seeing a bit more frequently as a result.”Sunak returned topast commentshe has made about how he and his siblings had faced racism growing up in Southampton, adding: “I haven’t a brilliant memory on most things, but that is really seared in my memory, because racism stings in a way that other things don’t.”Referring to Javid, who has also addressed the issue inhis recently published memoirdescribing the racism he experienced in 1970s Rochdale, Sunak said they would agree such experiences were “less common” today.But he added: “There’s always more we can do. And I definitely wouldn’t want us to slip back into a world where racist language was heard regularly on the street, or considered permissible on TV.”The commission is being facilitated by the Together Coalition, founded by Brendan Cox, the husband of theLabour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right extremist.‘It could be a shoe or a stick’: Sajid Javid on being beaten by his father, petty crime – and turning his life aroundRead moreSunak, who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton in North Yorkshire, said: “We’re all British, and underneath that, or alongside that, you can have lots of different identities that don’t come into conflict with that. Of course you can.“I’m British, I’m British Asian, I’m British Hindu, English. Sotonian – what we call people from Southampton, and an apprentice Yorkshireman.”On immigration, Sunak said that, with hindsight, he wished he had implemented measures to bring down numbers sooner.On the tensions that spilled over into street violence in 2024, he said it was “evident that something has gone wrong” and that it was made worse by Islamist extremists and the far right, which were “feeding off each other”.It was “a lie” that Britain was a racist country, Sunak said, citing Javid’s career and his own, and adding that his successor as Tory leader is “a Black woman who grew up in Nigeria”.Sunak was speaking after a speech by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, earlier in the week in which he addressed themes including “British values” and warned against allowing migration policy to be exploited “by people who think whiteness is the same thing as Britishness”.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakRaceFar rightConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Milan simultaneously delivered a three-hour love letter to Italy, and a plea for hope and harmony in a fractious world.But not everyone in the 60,000 crowd at San Siro was listening. As the United States team, led by the speedskater Erin Jackson, made its way across the stadium it was loudly applauded. But then the TV cameras panned to the US vice-president,JD Vance, and his wife, Usha, and the cheers turned to loud boos.Few here would have been surprised. All week Milan has echoed to the sound of loud whistles and rancour, ever since it heard that US immigration and customs enforcement officials (ICE) would be accompanying Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Winter Olympics Team GB skier targets ICE with graphic message written in snowRead moreHours before the opening ceremony, a thousand protesters also held anti-Ice banners, set off flares and chanted: “Fuck Ice, let’s take back the city.” Of course, some of them were going to stick it to the man when the world was watching.And it was perhaps Vance that the International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, had in mind when she gently promised that these Olympics would see “the best of humanity shine before the world”.“This is why we all love the Games,” she told the athletes. “Because through you, we see the very best of ourselves. You’ll show us that strength isn’t just about winning – it’s about courage, empathy, and heart.“You remind us that we can be brave. That we can be kind. When we see rivals embrace at the finish line, we are reminded that we can choose respect.“When we see grace, courage, and friendship – we remember the kind of people we all want to be. The spirit of the Olympic Games is about so much more than sport. It is about us – and what makes us human.”View image in fullscreenItalian flag bearers Arianna Fontana and Federico Pellegrino lead out their team.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a powerful message during a ceremony that was otherwise determined to party. The music was spectacular and the athletes and crowd revelled in every moment.In the buildup, the creative director, Marco Balich, had promised that his team of artists and performers had devoted 700 hours of rehearsals to ensure everything would be perfect. They delivered – and then some.The show began with 70 dancers from Accademia del Teatro alla Scala, twirling and spinning in perfect time, across a background of classical statues. Soon there were also nods to Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, food and fashion, literature and design.There were also genuflections to Verdi, Puccini, Rossini and Armani. There were supermodels in red, green and white, the colours of the Italian flag, walking down a catwalk before the Italian national anthem was played. There was even a surreal section devoted to hand gestures – although none of the ones that are usually seen in Milan rush hour.Unsurprisingly for such a lavish ceremony, 70 hairdressers and 110 makeup artists were involved on the night. Not all of them were for the personal use of Mariah Carey, who had the crowd eating out of her hand early in the evening by singing Volare (“Nel Blu, dipinto di Blu”) in Italian.View image in fullscreenMariah Carey charmed the Milan crowd.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesLater, the crowd were out of their seats again for Andrea Bocelli, who sang a neck-tingling version of Nessum Dorma, the Chinese pianist Lang Lang, a Brazilian athlete who did a backflip in the snow and the Ukrainian and Italian teams, who were given storming reactions when they were introduced.But the ceremony carried a deeper message too: that sport, in its own small and insignificant way, can sometimes unite a divided world. The theme of the night was armonia – or harmony in English – whose original meaning means bringing together what is different.Intimate and enormous: Milano Cortina opening ceremony tries something differentRead moreMeanwhile, Coventry, who took over as IOC president last year, also drew on her background growing up in Zimbabwe to stress how much the world was interconnected.“In Africa, where I’m from, we have a word: ubuntu,” she said. “It means: I am because we are. That we rise by lifting others. That our strength comes from caring for each other. No matter where you come from, we all know this spirit – it lives and breathes in every community.“I see this spirit most clearly at the Olympic Games. Here, athletes from every corner of the world compete fiercely – but they also respect, support and inspire one another. They remind us that we are all connected, that our strength comes from how we treat each other, and that the best of humanity is found in courage, compassion and kindness.”That was a message stressed by members of the US team too. Before the ceremony, the freestyle skier Hunter Hess admitted he had mixed emotions when asked what it meant to wear Team USA gear and the American flag.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry said: ‘We rise by lifting others. That our strength comes from caring for each other.’Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of,” he replied. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”At the end of the night, the president of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, officially declared the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 open to giant cheers. All told, it was a triumph. Even if this ceremony will be remembered for one particularly visceral reaction earlier in the night.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJD VancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

TheElectoral Commissionsaid the omission was a matter for the police, stressing that failing “to include an imprint in candidate election material is an offence”.Dozens of voters in the Gorton and Denton constituency reported receiving letters from a pensioner written in a handwriting-style font on Friday. The letters do not include an imprint saying who they have been funded and distributed by, as required by electoral law.The author of the letter, Patricia Clegg, describes herself in the mail-outs only as a “local pensioner, 74 years old”.When contacted by the Guardian, Clegg confirmed she was a member of Reform UK and had been asked to write the letter by the party.In Gorton and Denton, I found a long-festering sense of fury that Labour has no idea how to tackle | John HarrisRead more“I was asked to support Reform; would I be willing to do a letter and put my name to it? And I said, ‘Yeah’, and I left the rest to them,” she said, when asked if she had written the letter.Asked if she was aware that the letter did not have the legally necessary imprint saying it was backed by the party, she said no one had talked to her about that issue.A Reform spokesperson said the campaign had commissioned the letter which was given to its print contractor “with the full and correct legal imprint, fully compliant with election law” but “an error occurred during the printing process”. Subsequently the legal imprint was “inadvertently removed at the point of printing” without the party’s knowledge.“At no stage did the campaign know about, authorise or intend the distribution of material without a legal imprint,” the spokesperson said. Hardings Print Solutions, in Middlesex, which printed the letter, said it “took full responsibility” for the error.A spokesperson forGreater Manchesterpolice confirmed it had received a report about the breach of electoral law on Friday evening. “We will be investigating this,” they said.The Electoral Commission said all printed material promoting a candidate at an election is required to include an imprint identifying the promoter and printer. “Enforcement of imprint requirements for candidate material is a matter for the police,” a spokesperson said.Labour accuses Reform candidate of ‘toxic politics’ after Tommy Robinson endorsementRead moreThe letter stated that the author had previously “voted Labour because Keir Starmer told us things would change for the better. They haven’t.” It added that tax rises “have cost pensioners like me an extra £160 that we cannot afford”.The author also says they “understand why some neighbours have had enough of Keir Starmer and are thinking of voting Green. But I do not believe the Greens have answers to our problems. They have extreme policies likelegalising drugsand letting men use women’s changing rooms. What good would that do people like us?”Several copies of the letter were posted on local Facebook and WhatsApp groups, with people saying they received them on Friday morning.One voter, who said they were not affiliated to any party, said they had reported the matter to theManchestercity council’s elections office.Thebyelectionis expected to be tightly fought between Labour, the Greens and Reform, with all three claiming they are on course to win.On Friday, a Green party spokesperson accused Reform of “playing dirty”.“With Reform raking in millions from crypto billionaires and fossil fuel giants, you’d think they’d be able to afford to follow the law,” they said. “But instead they’re playing dirty – because they know te Greens are coming for them in Gorton and Denton.“The only way to stop Reform’s politics of division and hate is to vote forHannah Spencer– to elect a Green MP who will fight to lower bills, protect the NHS and rebuild our public services.”View image in fullscreenHannah Spencer, the Green party candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLabour’s campaign political lead Andrew Western MP said: “Campaigns are responsible for what they put through people’s doors.

He was in his second year at university, and we were so proud of him.“One of his main passions was football and he had played since the age of four. He was an Arsenal supporter and we believe he was on his way home to watch the game later that night when he was stabbed and killed.“We want to thank the members of the public who stopped to try and help Khaleed and the ambulance service and hospital staff who did all they could to try and save him.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only Norton, in fact, but the stars from the guest lineup who sat alongside Swift when she appeared in October 2025: actors Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith, and fellow chart-topping musicianLewis Capaldi.The whimsical, fantastical video, produced with a retro 90s aesthetic, is written and directed by Swift. Her lonely character befriends a pet rock, while Gleeson’s equally lonely character has a similar friendship with a cactus, before a magical substance – the spray-on Opalite – brings the two together. Norton appears as a salesman hawking a reverse serum, Nope-alite, while Turner-Smith plays a fitness instructor, and Lee mimes along to Swift’s song as a fictional singer-songwriter on MTV. Capaldi plays a mall photographer, while the final guest that week, Cillian Murphy, does not act in the video but appears as a billboard image and provides a voiceover.“The thrill of a lifetime and the hardest secret I’ve ever had to keep!! Thank you thank you,” Norton wrote on Instagram.Introducing the video, Swift called Norton “insanely charismatic and lovable” and said of the October show: “I remember thinking I got ridiculously lucky with the group I was paired with … I was instantly struck with an *idea*.“And so a week later [Gleeson] received an email script I’d written for the Opalite video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn’t mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90’s with us and help with this video.”‘Tickets have become status symbols’: from Harry Styles to Taylor Swift, why is live music bigger and more expensive than ever?Read moreSwift is a relatively regular guest on Norton’s long-running BBC chatshow, appearing five times since 2013, sitting alongside the likes of Bono and John Cleese. Her casting of Norton is a demonstration of his growing transatlantic cachet: clips from his show frequently go viral in the US, and he has himself appeared on Seth Meyers’ US talkshow.Opalite had already reached as high as No 2 in the UK charts when it was first released, but it is likely to shoot up again in next week’s chart from its current position of No 15.The video is available on Spotify and Apple Music, and will appear on YouTube on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftGraham NortonTelevisionLewis CapaldinewsShareReuse this content"

According to the mint’s website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 pieces, all of which are collector’s items and will not enter general public circulation.The backs of the coins feature a portrait of the queen’s son, King Charles, in profile.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyQueen Elizabeth IInewsShareReuse this content"

Armstrong will be involved in the film but will not have a producing credit.The hope is for the film to be a cross between F1 and The Wolf of Wall Street.Brad Pitt’s smash-hit racing drama recently scored four Oscar nominations, including a surprise best picture nod.Armstrong became an international star after winning the Tour de France on seven consecutive occasions between 1998 and 2005. But an investigation in 2012 took away his titles when he was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs. He received a lifetime ban from the sport.His story was previously told in Stephen Frears’ 2015 drama The Program, where he was played by Ben Foster. The film was a box office disappointment and received mixed reviews. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshawcalledit “workmanlike” in a three star review.Since receiving a best actor nomination for his role in Elvis, Butler has starred in The Bikeriders, Eddington, Dune: Part Two, and Caught Stealing. He has beenattachedto play Patrick Bateman in Luca Guadagnino’s take on American Psycho and will next be seen in the crime thriller Enemies withJeremy Allen White.Berger followed up the critical and commercial success of the papal thriller Conclave with the Netflix dramaBallad of a Small Playerstarring Colin Farrell. This week, he started filming an adaptation of Tim Winton’s acclaimed novel The Riders starring Brad Pitt.As well as writing the Oscar-nominated script for King Richard, Baylin’s credits include Creed III, Gran Turismo, Bob Marley: One Love and recent Netflix seriesBlack Rabbit.Explore more on these topicsAustin ButlerBiopicsLance ArmstrongUS sportsCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

If he wins, it would be the crowning glory of an already superlative 12 months for the musician, who turns 60 a week after the Oscars ceremony in LA.Last year, his 2015 album Sleep surpassed 2bn streams across all platforms, becoming the first classical record to do so. Awarded a CBE in the new year honours list, his work will be celebrated with the Berlinale Camera award at the Berlin film festival, which starts next week, and from Monday a Richter-scored ballet inspired by the works of Virginia Woolf will be livestreamed in UK cinemas.The only thing that might check Richter’s ascent at this stage is his own success. Hamnet once again relies on On the Nature of Daylight to pull the heartstrings, and the piece of music has become so ubiquitous on screens big and small that it has invited a backlash among critics, with the Guardian’s Tom Servicerecently dismissing itas “the go-to cliche for moments of serious contemplation or emotional intensity” on film.Classical Mixtape: A Live Takeover review – one queue after another mars orchestral jamboreeRead moreYet in terms of his musical origins, there was nothing predictable about Max Richter’s meteoric rise. Born in Hamelin, Lower Saxony, but raised in Bedford, he was introduced to minimalist music at the age of 12-13 by the local milkman, an avid new music fan who delivered him records by Terry Riley, Philip Glass and John Cage with the daily pint and inspired an epiphany. “Until then, I thought ‘new music’ was Stravinsky,” he told the German newspaper Die Zeit in a recent interview.An ability to walk across the invisible divide between “high” and “low” music became a career-defining skill. Though classically trained, Richter has never hidden his enthusiasm for the early electronica of Kraftwerk or the snarling punk of Stiff Little Fingers.Before making his breakthrough as a composer in his own right, he worked with electronic hippies the Future Sound of London in the mid-90s and contributed strings to Roni Size & Reprazent’s 2000 album In the Møde.Christian Badzura, the vice-president of A&R at Richter’s label Deutsche Grammophon, recalled being startled by his 2002 debut album Memoryhouse and its 2004 follow-up The Blue Notebooks. “He clearly had these classical pen-and-paper skills, but he managed to create tonal music that never sounded thin. There was a lot of emotional intensity.”These albums have retrospectively been recognised as landmarks of the genre variously known as “neo-classical”, “post-minimalism” or “new repertoire”, but one curious factor about Richter’s career is that he has managed to gain a profile mainly through collaborations.“The first thing about Max is that he’s really, really good with deadlines,” said the Royal Ballet’s director, Kevin O’Hare, whose company has performed three collaborations between Richter and the choreographer Wayne McGregor. “In ballet, you commission a work two or three years in advance, and the person who really gets it going is the composer. So you’re reliant on Max, and he always delivers.”McGregor’s ballet productions, like 2015’s Woolf Works and 2022’s MaddAddam, eschew linear narratives in favour of snapshot storytelling. O’Hare said Richter’s music had proved especially pliable to sudden changes of mood or setting. “It’s not that everybody’s sobbing all the time, but he has that ability to just hit the right emotions at the right moments.”In the world of film, Richter has been a sought-after collaborator ever since his synth-led score for Ari Folman’s 2008 animated war documentary Waltz with Bashir.On the Nature of Daylight, in particular, has proven irresistible to film-makers, featuring in fantasy romances (Stranger than Fiction), noir thrillers (Shutter Island), post-apocalyptic dramas (The Last of Us) and even the 35th anniversary episode of EastEnders. Chloé Zhao employed the track in the final minutes of Hamnet even though Richter had already written original music for the scene, later saying it “could not be replaced, spiritually” after a choral version had been used during rehearsals.The piece starts with an almost ecclesiastical 24-bar chord progression on lower strings that is then layered in a minimalist fashion with circling, repetitive melodies on the violins. Yet what On the Nature of Daylight lacks in variation, it makes up for in its use of harmonies.The piece’s inner voices – the melodies situated between its soprano and bass parts – are such that they will be as familiar to pop fans as they are to classical devotees, said Jono Buchanan, a TV composer and music lecturer at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. “You are just as likely to find similar harmonic shapes in Coldplay’s Fix You as in Barber’s Adagio for Strings”.Rhiannon Giddens and Francesco Turrisi review – big, generous, provocative music-making on a small stageRead moreThe piece achieved a feat of being bright and dark, warm and cold at the same time. “It doesn’t nail its emotional colours to the mast, so you can nail it to any mast you like.”That same chameleon-like adaptability, its algorithmic efficiency at delivering big emotions, is what has irritated some critics. The New Yorker’s Alex Ross wrote: “What troubles me about Richter’s enterprise is, ultimately, its inoffensiveness. The music is impassive, deferential, anonymous.”To the question “what is art good for”, Richter’s music provides a confident, if perhaps too answer-oriented response: it amplifies our emotions and calms our nerves. Richter’s record-breaking eight-hour Sleep album is engineered to facilitate a full night’s slumber and comes with an app “to create your personalised musical sessions to better meditate, focus or sleep”.Sam Jackson, the controller of BBC Radio 3 and the BBC Proms, insisted Richter’s music was more than a highly functional wellness tool. “Contemporary composers who embrace melody, like he does, are sometimes dismissed as making music to ‘lean back to’; to have on in the background to serve your mood. But his music also inspires people to lean forward.”He pointed to Richter’s 2020 project Voices, made with his creative and life partner, the visual artist Yulia Mahr, which weaves words from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into music. Every time Radio 3 played On the Nature of Daylight, Jackson said, listeners wrote in because they wanted to find out more about the work: “They really do engage with the music and the message behind it.”Explore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicHamnetprofilesShareReuse this content"

It’s terminally dull stuffJack SealeFri 6 Feb 2026 16.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 16.01 ESTShareIt is the world’s largest military alliance but, in reputational terms at least,Natois currently vulnerable. For an organisation so dependent on US stability and generosity, Donald Trump’s shredding of the so-called “rules-based order” is a potentially existential threat. So Nato could use an easy PR win right now and, with Frontline: Our Soldiers Facing Putin, Channel 4 tries to provide one.This two-parter’s premise is that, after four years of war in Ukraine, we must plan for what comes next. IfRussiais emboldened by the outcome of that conflict, it might invade another ex-Soviet border state, Estonia – which is a longstanding Nato member, so Nato would be at war. Are we prepared? Any worries about which side the present US administration would cheer for are put aside, as the results of exclusive behind-the-scenes access to Nato’s past year of manoeuvres are, breathlessly, presented. The answer to the question about Nato’s readiness is a stern affirmative. Putin ought to think on.We open at what Jonas Armstrong’s heroically over-the-top voiceover describes as “the very edge of Europe”: the Estonia/Russia border. Here, a guard named Peter is “staring directly at the Russian threat”, which on the day of filming consists of a Russian border patrolman appearing on his side of the barbed wire and pacing up and down a bit. It doesn’t feel like a reminder of “just how close danger lies”, as the narration claims, but it is the nearest the first episode of Frontline: Our Soldiers Facing Putin comes to showing us either a frontline or soldiers facing Putin.What follows is an advertisement for Nato’s hypothetical prowess that will interest viewers with a fetish for military jargon and an aversion to serious analysis. If you experience strange tinglings upon hearing phrases like “Enhanced Forward-Presence Battle Groups”, this is the show for you. The EFPBGs in question contain 1,300 British troops permanently stationed in Estonia: we watch as they practise trench warfare. This would be “a war in which men have to fight brutally, face to face,” says Nato’s former deputy supreme allied commander in Europe, General Sir Richard Shirreff, who does not sound as if he would be disappointed were this to occur in reality. “This is total war, a war of absolute utmost brutality.”But as Shirreff points out, 1,300 guys could not resist a Russian invasion for long. Reinforcements would be needed pronto, and to find out who’s in charge of that, we must be whisked elsewhere. “Welcome to Joint Force Command Naples,” says Armstrong, in a tone designed to provoke a mix of terror and arousal in the goggling, flag-hugging viewer. “To enter this building requires high-level security clearance. Cameras are rarely allowed inside.” Ooh! Cynics might say the interior is a quiet, unremarkable office block – look closer, however, and someone’s printed and laminated a sign on red A4 that says: “SENSITIVE AREA.” We are about to enter a “highly secure command hub”! OK, so it’s just a meeting room with a big map in it, but a place like this saw the conception of Nato’s largest operation of 2025: Exercise Steadfast Dart. (A documentary including footage of the meetings where they come up with these names is one I would prefer to watch.)Steadfast Dart is the dress rehearsal for moving troops to a new eastern front line. Phase one sees a big army ferry complete its voyage from Southampton to Alexandropoulis, Greece, where unloading its cargo of men and machines promptly will, we are told, be paramount in the event of Putin going berserk. We embed first with Sergeant Heath of the Nato Allied Reaction Force, a cheerful man in a hard hat and hi-vis who points khaki trucks with extra-big wheels in the right direction, and then with Craftsman Peters of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, another jolly type who checks the vehicles over. They both complete their tasks without incident, as does the chef in the mess tent at the convoy support centre in Romania, where large numbers of hungry travelling soldiers must swiftly be fed. The programme tries to inject all three with reality-TV jeopardy – it’s a race against time! Can they do it?! – but it’s hopeless. Peacetime logistics are terminally mundane.Frontline has serious business to conduct: it ends with both Shirreff and the programme itself nakedly advocating for an expansion of British military capabilities, but viewers who do not already fervently agree with the sentiment probably won’t have made it that far. Most likely, the only casualty here will be the Russian military analyst, in a chilly bunker somewhere, who has to study this programme in case it contains useful intel. They are about to have a rather dull day at work.Frontline: Our Soldiers Facing Putin is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMilitaryRussiaNatoBritish armyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

In an interview, Nelini Stamp, one of the organisers, said: “We need every part of civil society to speak up. We need our artists. We need our entertainers. We need the folks who reflect society.”TikTok is awash with tutorials on how to make button badges, while sellers on marketplaces such as Etsy have been quick to offer their own takes. The pins aren’t just restricted to US-based wearers. In the past week, the UK sellerRad Badgeshas sold more than 30 packets of a set of four pins that read “Abolish ICE” and “Nobody is illegal”.Despite assurances, residents and officials prepare for possible ICE operations during Super BowlRead moreKomina Guevara,a beadwork artistbased in Missouri who makes “ICE out” and “FCK ICE” charms that can be attached to a pin, worn on a chain or on a phone strap, describes the act of wearing one as “a small, intimate protest. They offer a confidence that a lot of people are afraid of.”T-shirts rebuking ICE are also gaining traction. Just hours after Bad Bunny collected his Grammy for album of the year, tees featuring text from his speech – “ICE out. We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans” – appeared online. The Puerto Rican pop star and fans are expected to use his half-timeSuper Bowl performanceon Sunday to amplify his message.The term ICE is ripe for riffing, with tops and sweaters featuring graphics of cocktails captioned with “I like my ICE crushed” and “Remember ICE melts”. Other slogans include “Stay salty, melt ICE” and “ABCDEFUCKICE”, while some feature a graphic of a single giant melting ice cube.Last week during Copenhagen fashion week, Ella Emhoff, an artist, model and the stepdaughter of the former US vice-president Kamala Harris, wore a T-shirt from the online brand Chnge, featuringan illustration of a polar bearstanding on a glacier with the slogan “The wrong ICE is melting”.View image in fullscreenMark Ruffalo wears a ‘Be Good’ badge at the  Golden Globes in California.Photograph: JC Olivera/2026GG/Penske Media/GettyIn a post on Instagram, Emhoff wrote: “Fuck ice and anyone who thinks anything they are doing is OK,” adding a list of immigrant resource centres.Elsewhere, nail artists are championinganti-ICE manicuresthat include tiny nail art designs such as ice cubes and lettering such as “FCK ICE”.The trend taps into a wider “craftivism” movement. Donald Trump may have updated his signature red baseball cap to read “America is back!” in a shouty white font, but it’s a knitted, red tasseled hat opposing ICE that is dominating the attention of “rage knitters”. Known as “Melt the ICE” hats, they are inspired by the rednisselue(woolen caps) worn in the 1940s by Norwegians to signify their resistance to Nazi occupiers. Needle and Skein, a yarn store in Minneapolis, has so far raised more than $650,000 (£478,000) for local immigrant organisations by selling the pattern and through protest stitch-alongs.While pin badges and slogan T-shirts havea long history in resistance dressing, critics say much of this new wave of celebrity activism is performative. Unlike, advocating for Palestine or Iran, decrying ICE is seen as a widely accepted liberal mainstream idea. Similar to 2017’s pink pussyhats, there are concerns that anti-ICE badges and clothing is virtue signalling.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny accepts an award on stage at the Grammys. T-shirts appeared online just hours later using elements of the Puerto Rican singer’s speech.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/GettyHowever, Betsy Greer, the author of Craftivism: The Art of Craft and Activism, argues that projects such as the Melt the ICE caps offer a sense of connection that can lead to action. “Speaking out can be scary,” Greer says. “But once you start talking to and learning from others also doing communal projects, it can become easier to take other steps that feel right for you.”Greer describes knitting and making badges as a “step toward action” and believes it can encourage people to attend a protest, call politicians or volunteer in their local community. “It can be a galvanising thing. We need more galvanising things that help people take action toward the good.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)CelebrityGrammy awards 2026GrammysGolden GlobesGolden Globes 2026ProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re getting them whether we wanted them or not: the modest resources had been spent, and so we now arrive at the last knockings which comprise this year’s most dutiful carnage. The mistake is to expand a morally gloomy universe that was better off self-contained; the more light Harlin and collaborators let in, the more their set-up presents as generic runaround, hopelessly out of place amid the recent horror renaissance.Hamlet review – Riz Ahmed’s tortured prince drives chilling modern take through London’s streetsRead moreWe’re deep into Strangers lore now, but last girl standing Maya (Riverdale graduate Madelaine Petsch, who surely hoped this was her Neve Campbell moment) continues to scurry about a devout woodland community like a bloodied fieldmouse with resting iPhone face; the masked thrill-killers – previously three, now two – have now gained ulterior motives for pursuing her. Also present: tatted survivor Gregory (Gabriel Basso, who must have been hoping for more to do) and ever-shifty Sheriff Rotter (Richard Brake), whose link to the killers is finally made explicit. New blood arrives in the form of Maya’s sister Debbie (Hollyoaks alumna and recent short-film Oscar-winner Rachel Shenton) who comes to town seeking answers, only to be drawn into another round of humdrum stalk-and-slash.Somewhere in the background is the unnerving (and not untimely) idea of an all-American community that tolerates killers in its midst as long as they prey on outsiders. Yet Harlin ties up his loose ends in characteristically leaden and workmanlike fashion, with scene pacing that would have seemed antiquated circa Wes Craven’s Scream; a full 30 minutes of pregnant pauses hardly shake the suspicion there wasn’t enough plot in play for a trilogy. The2008 originalwill probably endure as a solid, sleepover-ready example of American ordeal cinema, but this final chapter, like its immediate predecessors, falls somewhere between footnote and outright detritus, like a plastic bag being blown through the multiplex by a stiff breeze.The Strangers: Chapter 3 is out now in Australia, the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time, an Olympic opening ceremony in effect happened across multiple live venues all at once, with Milan, Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo linked into one narrative structure. It felt less like a show in a stadium and more like watching a country performitselfin real time. The organising concept – “Armonia”, the idea that different elements can move together without losing their identity – isn’t just branding. It shapes how the ceremony actually functioned. Sitting in San Siro, you’re constantly aware that somewhere else, at that exact moment, another piece of the story is unfolding. It created a strange sense of scale: intimate and enormous at once. In an era when global attention is fragmented across screens and platforms, Italy staged the opposite – a ceremony built on simultaneity, connection and shared rhythm.‘We are all connected’: Winter Olympics opening ceremony stresses harmony and showcases ItalyRead more2A tapestry of four small ceremoniesInstead of the usual slow-motion lap of a single stadium – the emotional endurance test that most ceremonies turn into – the parade here was deliberately fractured. Ice athletes appeared in Milan, freestyle and snowboard athletes in Livigno, Nordic athletes in Predazzo, and sliding and biathlon athletes in Cortina. Logistically, it reduced travel. Emotionally, it changed the rhythm. You lose the slow, building crescendo of delegations marching into one space, but gain something more intimate and modern – almost like watching four opening ceremonies stitched into one broadcast. It also felt unmistakably Italian in execution. The visual design leans hard into aesthetics: banners styled to resemble blocks of ice, uniforms pulling as much from fashion logic as sports tradition. The result is less “march of nations” and more curated visual sequence. It didn’t have the overwhelming, wall-of-flags impact of a single stadium parade, but it replaced it with something arguably closer to how global sport actually is now: distributed, simultaneous and networked.View image in fullscreenA firework display at the Arco della Pace after the lighting of the Olympic cauldron to open Milano Cortina 2026.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/Getty Images3Parade delivers big fashion statementThe Olympics always deliver two specific pleasures: the dopamine hit of suddenly caring about sports you didn’t know existed and the spectacle of athletes walking out in national kit that doubles as soft power. On Friday night, you could feel the second one happening in real time. Italy’s team drew one of the loudest reactions, the snow-white EA7 Emporio Armani uniforms – among the last projects tied to Giorgio Armani, whodied in September aged 91– catching the stadium floodlights. The US followed in Ralph Lauren’s polished winter Americana: flag knits, winter whites, instantly recognisable. Mongolia’s opening-ceremony looks, designed by Goyol Cashmere, were among the most buzzed-about: heavy ceremonial silhouettes rooted in traditional deels, fur-trimmed and historic rather than technical. Haiti’s Stella Jean-designed uniforms drew more curiosity and conversation, the original concept featuring revolutionary leader Toussaint Louverture before Olympic rules barring political symbolism forced a redesign around his galloping horse. It’s the second straight Olympics to be staged in a fashion capital and brands are not shying away from the ridiculously high bar set at the Paris Games two years ago.4Olympic unity collides with real-world politicsThere had been quiet concern all week that the American delegation – or the politicians attached to it – might draw a hostile reception, after reports of US security analysts linked to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operating around the Games collided with broader tensions over Washington’s foreign policy posture. For most of Friday night, those fears looked overblown. The US athletes received a full-throated welcome when the enormous delegation entered San Siro, the kind of roar reserved for medal favorites and host nations. But moments later, a routine cutaway to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance drew an unmistakable wave of boos from large swaths of the crowd. The shot lasted barely three seconds before returning to the athletes below, but it was long enough to change the temperature inside the stadium. Earlier, a smattering of boos met Israel’s four representatives, amid calls in some quarters for Israel to be banned over the Gaza war that followed Hamas’s deadly October 2023 attack.The Olympics sell the promise of unity. The crowd, briefly, sounded unconvinced.5Peaceful protests hit the streetsA few blocks from the choreography, a different kind of gathering was taking shape. In a square near San Siro, a few hundred demonstrators – including public-housing tenants, student activists and campaigners fromIl Comitato Insostenibili Olimpiadi(Unsustainable Olympics Committee) – staged a protest aimed less at the ceremony itself than what it represents. Some carried banners accusing the government of prioritising Olympic spending over affordable housing and public services, alongside an “anti-Olympic torch” parodying the official relay. Others focused on broader geopolitical grievances, with chants critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinians cutting through whistles and flares. The mood felt organised rather than chaotic: more civic rally than flashpoint, with the march proceeding peacefully despite heavy security and street closures around the stadium. The protests are part of a wider drumbeat that has followed the Games into Milan, from environmental demonstrations targeting Olympic sponsors to marches opposing reported US security coordination and the presence of American immigration agents tied to athlete protection. For most fans heading toward the stadium, it was background noise. But it was a reminder of a constant Olympic truth: the ceremony tells one story about a host city. The streets usually tell another.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, I am a child.”Kenworthy’s comments are particularly notable given that ICE agents are here in Milan as part of the security detail for the US vice president JD Vance, who was attending the opening ceremony. Protesters in Milan carried banners reading “ICE out”, “Fuck ICE”.However, Kenworthy will not be punished for violating Rule 50.2 of the Olympic Charter which states “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas,” as he made the post on social media.An International Olympic Committee media spokesperson confirmed: “During the Olympic Games, all participants have the opportunity to express their views as per theAthlete Expression Guidelines. The IOC does not regulate personal social media posts.”1:58Why are ICE agents going to the Winter Olympics in Italy? – video explainerKenworthy, who was born in Chelmsford but moved to Colorado when his family emigrated while he was two years old, competed for Team US in 2014 and 2018. He then switched his allegiance to Team GB for the last Winter Games in Beijing, finishing eighth, but still lives in the US.It is not the first time that Kenworthy has spoken out. Before the 2022 Games, he was openly critical of the decision to host the Games in China, citing the country’s human rights record and treatment of the LGBTQ+ community.Team GB did not comment directly on the post. However, it is understood that they are not concerned as they believe it is a personal opinion on a subject outside of the Olympic Games, and Kenworthy doesn’t invoke Team GB in any way, shape or form.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

He spent the best part of two decades lobbying, politicking and organising before he finally got the first summer Games up and running in Athens in 1896. Its winter sibling though, well, “the great inferiority of these snow sports …” De Coubertin once wrote, “is that they are completely useless, with no useful application whatsoever.” He allowed ice skating and ice hockey, the two stadium sports, to be part of the roster for the early summer Games, but it was another two decades before he was persuaded to hold a separate winter event.Winter Olympics 2026: Anti-ICE protests before opening ceremony, Vonn completes training run – liveRead moreThat was in 1924, in Chamonix. The 100th anniversary fell midway between the last winter Games in Beijing and this one in Milano Cortina. It’s an interesting event to look back on. It was described at the time as a 10-day “winter sports week”, an “appendage” De Coubertin called it, to that year’s summer Games in Paris. There were 16 countries competing in five sports, with four more, including “military patrol”, added as demonstration events. It was only later, after the International Olympic Committee had become more interested in burnishing its own history, that this knockabout event was officially designated as the very first Winter Olympic Games.A century later, this Winter Olympics, like every Winter Olympics before it, will be the largest yet – 3,500 athletes, 93 countries, 19 days of competition, 16 different events, and everywhere an irrepressible sense that, like a party thrown by a teenager while their parents are away, this has all got a little out of control. All of a suddenMariah Carey has turned up,ski jumpers are injecting acid into their penises, and the hosts are running around trying toplug the leaks in the €270m ice hockey arenathey were compelled to build in the middle of 110 acres of brownfield south of Milan, which will only ever be needed for the next two and a half weeks.View image in fullscreenThe Santagiulia ice hockey arena has continued to resemble a building site in the run-up to the Games.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThese Milano Cortina Games are, in many ways, an attempt at retrenchment, an effort to redress grotesque excesses, which spiralled so madly out of control thatSochi in 2014 became the most expensive Games in history, and Beijing in 2022 required theChinese to fabricate an entire winter sports resortout of concrete, steel and phoney snow. The IOC has found it increasingly difficult to get anyone sensible to want to take them on at all. In the past 12 years, Calgary, Innsbruck, Krakow, Oslo, Sapporo, Sion and Stockholm all dropped bids because of a lack of public enthusiasm.Which is why this edition of the Games is being shared across northern Italy, rather than rooted in one city. In one way it’s made them more feasible, in another it now means that it takes at least 11 hours, and a lot of good luck, to get from the curling venue to the men’s downhill.The next one, which is being spread out across the French Alps, will be similar. The IOC is also trying to ground the Games in countries that actually have a culture of winter sport. This won’t last long. Saudi Arabia have sent two skiers here this year, an advance guard for the $500bn winter sports resort city they are building in the desert, which was – until plans changed this week – due to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029, and, no doubt, a Winter Olympics beyond it.Even here, in a country that has hosted the Winter Olympics twice already, it is hard to avoid the feeling of just how ersatz and unsustainable this all is. Cortina has plenty of snow. But it’s not necessarily the sort athletes like or TV schedulers can rely upon. So the organisers are using approximately 100m litres of water to make something like 50,000 tonnes of the stuff for these Games. They had to build an entire reservoir just to service it. Cortina already has an ice track, too, the one they built the last time they had the Olympics here in 1956. It was shut in 2008 because no one used it and has been derelict ever since.Now they have a second, cut, at huge expense, right through a forest of ancient larch trees.According to analysis done by the World Wildlife Foundation of Italy, which is part of the Open Olympics movement,60% of the construction works for these Games have been done without any environmental impact assessment, under the cover of this mega-event. All this at a moment when almost200 ski resorts have already been forced to close in the French Alpsalone because of a truncated winter season caused by global heating and declining snowfall. All these resorts, and the towns around them, are in a position where they now need to fake it to make it.View image in fullscreenThe streets around Milan’s famous cathedral get the Winter Olympics treatment.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe IOC makes great play of its environmental credentials. But slapping the word “sustainability” on a brochure listing how much printed paper you’re saving by sticking everything online doesn’t add up to much when the bulldozers out back are chopping down a forest to make way for a bobsled run you need to provide for a fortnight of sliding competitions.De Coubertin changed his mind about winter Games in the end, but he wasn’t wrong about any of this. A lot of these sports don’t have any utility beyond recreation. With the exceptions of Nordic skiing and the skating events, many of the rest were literallyinvented by British aristocrats on holiday in St Moritzas something fun to do during the winter. And away from the handful of countries across the northern hemisphere that have their own indigenous cultures of skiing and skating, they still exist largely as a privilege for the increasingly small band of well-resourced tourists who can afford them.You might say that recreation is all the reason anyone needs. Going fast is its own reward, and watching other people do it makes for great TV. The Games is going to be one hell of a show, full of twists, flips, turns, dashes and crashes, last-minute-winners and late-breaking stones sliding right on to the button during the 10th end. It is a gloriously silly business, and one which, even after the IOC’s attempts to roll it back, has an increasingly serious cost as it continues to grow out of all proportion.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a real belonging in putting on the T-shirt or jacket with your country’s flag on, and of course with the Olympic rings – a symbol of hope and peace and togetherness.When I arrived in Sochi, my firstWinter Olympicsin 2014, I went into my room and I remember collapsing on to the bed with huge pride but also an overwhelming initial feeling of loneliness. I remember being emotional, crying. There was the relief that I had finally made it to the Games, but also a question of “what do I do now?” Fortunately, I didn’t dwell on that for long and dragged myself to the Team GB food hall.‘Penisgate’ at the Olympics: why inject acid into your penis, and what are the health risks?Read moreIt sounds simple but every day the team designated a base colour for all our clothes – blue T-shirt day, then red and white – and in the communal areas of the athletes’ village, that made everyone from Team GB feel more connected. That helped me shift from feeling overwhelmed into focus and a mindset of: “This is the Olympics and I’m here to do my job and win.”I’m based this year in Cortina, where many of the events are being held, and even though I am not staying in the village any more, there is a huge buzz here. Visiting Livigno last week, down the road is the Big Air jump, a gigantic structure with hundreds of steps. It looked like the landing zone was in the town itself. There were blue flashing lights outside my hotel room as the Olympic torch went past, people scrambling wildly to follow it. The Games are incredibly special.For the athletes, this is the pinnacle of their sporting lives. So for them, it’s about trying to lock in and focus as much as they can. Avoiding distraction is key. I’m not fearful about a ban on theBritish team’s new aerodynamic skeleton helmets. I don’t think it will have a massive effect on them. Team GB are already the best in the world without the new helmet, with Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt among the favourites to take the gold. They won’t really care too much which helmet they use.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn, who is skiing with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, in practice for the downhill.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesI remember much was made of thecustom-made aerodynamic suitsthat were brought in just before the 2018 Olympics, but I don’t even remember if I used those new suits for my runs! The rules are loose with their wording for this helmet and there are no diagrams or measurements in the regulations.British Skeleton has innovated the aerodynamic design and pushed on the performance level, which is totally normal and expected in high-performance sport.I’m in awe of what some of the athletes have had to do to reach these Games. It’s phenomenal thatLindsey Vonn is still due to competein the downhill skiing despite completely rupturing an ACL and is even to consider going down an Olympic course with a knee brace at the age of 41. It’s going to be an emotional Olympics for her – this week Vonn posted two pictures of her mother, who died in 2022, when mentioning the support she has received. The American has already won everything, she has nothing to prove, but I can’t wait to watch her compete, regardless of what happens.My experience is different from that of Lindsey but, in the lead-up to my second Olympics in 2018, I was also dealing with injury and illness. The first issue was a lump in a knee. We didn’t know what type of tumour it was at the time (thankfully it turned out to be benign) but I decided not to have surgery before the Games. I didn’t tell any of the wider team, just informing the medical team and promising the surgeon I would have it removed after competing.Next, I had a chest infection. It was about -20C in Pyeongchang and dusty and the soreness in my chest got worse and worse. On the first day of the race, I was coughing up huge lumps of rock-hard phlegm. Instead of warming up, I’d go to the little room next door and shove my head under a towel and some steam. I couldn’t breathe through my nose and I could barely breathe through my mouth.Quad God and the Blade Angels: is the new USA Dream Team a group of figure skaters?Read moreThen I had the vestibular issue, which affected my balance. My right ear sustained damage in my early career so sometimes when I was sliding down the track, the inner-ear system was compromised. Very occasionally, my neck became overworked as I flew into a 5G corner, which is more G-force than a fighter pilot often experiences. The vestibular symptoms, dizziness, sometimes blacking out completely, used to come on immediately. Imagine being incredibly drunk, wandering down the street and going sideways. It’s a level of complete physical disorientation and not ideal when travelling at 90mph down a skeleton run.Unfortunately it did happen to me in Pyeongchang, halfway down the track in my first run. I just had to hold on to the saddle. I was a rag doll, trying to stay on the sled. I didn’t know where I was, didn’t know where to steer. At the bottom of the run, my teammate Jen helped me up, and we hooked arms and styled it out.After I’d done that first run, I remember trying to call my husband but I couldn’t see my phone. I said to the physio, “if I go again, will it kill me?” We did some checks and decided to continue, and to have the doctor waiting at the bottom for the second run. Luckily, the vestibular issue settled. And I was just then dealing with the chest infection – one last hurdle between me and that historic second Olympic gold.Athletes are very resilient. Resilience comes through responding to failure and building up that self-belief. That’s so important for these big career moments, and luckily for me it all came good in the end. So many of these Winter sports look dangerous and scary, but these athletes are professionals and these performances are their bread and butter, day in and day out, even if it is extraordinary. I just really hope that whether it be the issues of injury, illness, doping or wider political concerns, the athletes are safe to compete and do so in a fair environment.Lizzy Yarnold won gold medals in the skeleton at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics, making her Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian.

But do those lengths extend to ski jumpers injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid in order to fly further?That is the question theWorld Anti-Doping Agency will investigatesince such startling allegations emerged first in the German newspaper Bild in what has now been dubbed “Penisgate”.Bild has claimed that athletes have injected the acid into their penises to game the system when they are measured for their suits, which is tightly regulated to prevent any athlete having an aerodynamic advantage.While the result of that investigation is pending, other questions remain: why would a ski jumper want to tamper with their penis, is it safe, and what does it have to do with aerodynamics?What does injecting hyaluronic acid do to the penis?Hyaluronic acid is a common filler used in cosmetic surgery, including injections being used forpenile girth enlargement surgery, Prof Eric Chung, a urological surgeon, says.Injecting a penis with hyaluronic acid would make it bigger girth-wise, “but you would need to inject a lot of hyaluronic acid,” says Chung, who was previously the leader of the andrology specialty advisory group for the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.Hyaluronic acid is temporary in effect and needs a top-up every six to 12 months depending on absorption and migration of the particles, Chung says.How does penis size affect ski jumping?Before the start of the season, ski jumpers have to have their suits made up based on the measurements of their body length, including crotch height determined by an FIS-approved 3D body scanner in the presence of a doctor, stripped down to their underwear and with particular stipulations around posture.The dimensions of that suit is strictly regulated because the total size of the suit can have a “significant effect” on the amount of lift that you can generate, which allows them to jump further, saysAssociate Prof Dan Dwyer, from Deakin University’s School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences.Enlarging the penis with hyaluronic acid could provide a benefit when the athlete is subject to this standardised body measurement process, as the dimensions recorded of their body would be larger than they might have been otherwise, which then allows them to be permitted to have a slightly larger ski suit made, Dwyer says. “And that slightly larger ski suit has a larger surface area which can then generate a small amount of extra lift.”Sandro Pertile, the men’s race director for the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS),says“every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further. Of course, this is a competitive sport and everyone’s on the limit with the rules because everyone wants to win.”What are the risks?Chung warns injecting a penis with hylauronic acid carries significant risks both in the short and long term.“Poorly injected technique or incorrect dose would cause penile pain, poor cosmesis [disfigurement], deformity, infection, inflammation, sensory change, and sexual dysfunction. In rare instances, infection can spread to cause gangrene (tissue necrosis) and loss of the penis.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Olympic GamesWinter OlympicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

This weekend in America all roads lead to this year’sSuperbowl in California: the Seattle Seahawks v the New England Patriots . But as Wales’s 25-year-old prodigal son prepares for the contrasting vibes and smells of a sodden Twickenham in February, he insists he still has no regrets about the gridiron flirtation that removed him from Six Nations circulation for two years.My simple message for England: get the ball into Arundell’s hands early against Wales | Ugo MonyeRead moreThat might sound fanciful given the lightning-quick Rees-Zammit never started a regular-season NFL game. Having abruptlyleft rugby in January 2024, he had a few pre-season run-outs for the Kansas City Chiefs before being released to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Rees-Zammit made their 90-strong training squad only for a back injury and a coaching reshuffle to limit his opportunities. In August last year,he returned to rugby. When he calls the past two years “a whirlwind” he is underplaying it.At least his mother, Maxine, is pleased to have her boy home. “My mum didn’t really like American football too much – she was very happy to see me come back,” Rees-Zammit says. In his view, though, the experience made him a more versatile athlete and a better man. “I learned a lot about myself. It was a completely different culture, a completely different game. I think it’s matured me a lot.”He is also 6kg heavier, slightly quicker and, he believes, more explosive through contact: “I think my agility is a lot better. Now I feel like when I see half a gap I can properly go into it and use my footwork to get through. Previously I was very reliant on my pace. I feel like I’ve got more variety to my game. That’s only going to help me.”On a damp lunchtime at his club, Bristol, it is good to see a competitive glint back in his eye. No young player enjoys rejection, at home or abroad. And while Rees-Zammit’s iron-clad confidence remains a super-strength, he does now concede that breaking America was always an outside bet. “Essentially it was a shot to nothing. A bit of a punt,” he says. “But you’ve got to try and back yourself. It’s the same in life. You have to have confidence otherwise someone else is going to take your job.”View image in fullscreenLouis Rees-Zammit sprints clear to score Wales’s try during the 20-10 Six Nations defeat by England at the Principality Stadium in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe also now appreciates that being a diehard NFL fan is very different from the reality of playing it for a living. “I prefer watching it than I did playing it. It’s so different to rugby. To be able to get my hands on the ball and create something out of nothing … that’s my ability. You can’t really do that in American football.”On the plus side he gave it a good rattle. “If I’d never done it I would always have regretted it,” he says. “Although I didn’t make the roster I still got an experience you can’t really buy.” One memory, in particular, will never leave him. It was the March day he signed on the dotted line at the Chiefs’ HQ at Arrowhead Stadium and then headed into town with his family for a celebratory meal. “I was walking down the street and fans were shouting: ‘Good luck!’ and ‘Let’s go!’ out of their car windows. That was pretty crazy. It made me feel famous for a second.”While he is occasionally recognised in Cardiff – “Well, a little bit but it’s not the same, is it?” – not everyone rushed to welcome him back. “I haven’t really had anything from opposition players but you obviously get it from fans. Then again I was getting it from fans before I left!” The inevitable jibes – ‘Where’s your helmet?’ – have been accompanied by harsher online messages. “People trying to call you a failure because you tried a different sport. Just trying to put you down really.“Even when they’re trying to be offensive I find it quite funny. The fact is I went over and gave it a go. I’ve had a mad experience, met some amazing people and learned so much. You’ve got to be brave to back yourself and go and do something you love. I always loved watching American football but it didn’t work out.”So what is his primary motivation now? “To wake up every day and try to be the best rugby player in the world. I feel I have the ability and skill set to do that. It’s about performing consistently. Ultimately that’s what the best do.”View image in fullscreenLouis Rees-Zammit runs out for the Kansas City Chiefs in a pre-season game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in August 2024.Photograph: Courtney Culbreath/Getty ImagesFew would dispute Wales will benefit from his return. He has scored 16 tries in 35 Tests and the Six Nations suits him. As a 20-year-old hehelped Wales win the title in 2021, claiming the try of the tournament award with aglorious chip and chase score against Scotland. Last time he faced England there was also asmartly-taken interception try from halfwayat the Principality Stadium in 2023.After theSix Nationshe will be back there with Bristol for next month’s Big Day Out against Harlequins and his Bears coach Pat Lam believes that picking him at full-back, his position on Saturday, is definitely the way ahead for club and country. “He’s got a kicking game and the speed to get himself out of trouble,” Lam says. “He’s also an excellent communicator. And when he has drier conditions we know what he can do. His pace is ridiculous, it really is.”On that front, even Rees-Zammit would enjoy a sprint-off – “I’m up for it” – against the Prem’s two other speed kings, Adam Radwan and Henry Arundell. For now, though, his priority is to stand firm alongside his home-based teammates as the furore over the future of Welsh domestic rugby intensifies. While Rees-Zammit is not directly affected by the Ospreys’ potential demise he has plenty of sympathy. “I feel for the boys … they have to live it every day. I’ll stand by my teammates. You have to. It’s not on what they’re doing.”In that turbulent context, an uplifting performance against England would be helpful. While he was in the US he watched all Wales’s games – “It was obviously tough to see them losing” – and coming home has rekindled his passion for representing his homeland. “I was so focused on trying to make it over there that I didn’t miss it,” he says. “But I guess it has made me realise what it means to play for Wales.“Even when times are tough you want to play your best when it’s Wales v England. It’s one of those games you can always get up for. We haven’t really given our fans much over the past few years. We want them to see an identity in the way we play. Then I think results will come off the back of it. We’ve got good players and a good coaching staff in now. It’s just about putting it all together.”Given Welsh rugby’s present turmoil, a bolt or two of Rees-Lightning this weekend would be heaven sent.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Wales rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But on a rainswept evening in West Yorkshire, the collective response from everyone associated withLeeds Unitedfor each of their goals left you in no doubt that this had the whiff of a season-defining night.With Leeds andNottingham Forestsitting an advantageous but not decisive six points above the relegation zone before kick-off, and 18th-placed West Ham away at Burnley on Saturday, it felt like both these famous old clubs knew victory could dramatically shape the remaining three months of the campaign.Leeds v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreFor 20 minutes or so, it was unpredictable, end to end and pretty breathless viewing. But a four-minute period which encapsulated Forest’s season to date was decisive as they spectacularly fell apart and conceded twice midway through the first half before Dominic Calvert-Lewin settled this quintessential relegation six-pointer shortly after half-time.The consequences of this result will fully be known only by the time the weekend is out. If West Ham do slip up, this could well be the night that goes a long way towards securingPremier Leaguesurvival for Leeds. If they continue this sort of form at Elland Road – 22 of their 29 points have come at home – they will probably be fine no matter what.This venue somehow becomes even more intimidating under the lights, too. In Leeds’ past 22 league games at this venue that kicked off in the evening, they have won 19 and not lost a single one. “I’m very proud,” Daniel Farke, the manager, said. “Sometimes it feels like there’s a game where it’s just a bit more important than the others. This will do a lot for our confidence and belief. It’s a massive win.”It will be Sean Dyche and Forest who watch on nervously on Saturday . For all the good work they have done of late with eight points from their past four games, a West Ham victory at Turf Moor makes things fascinating once again. Not that Leeds, their supporters and Farke, who deserves immense credit for this mid-season turnaround, will care right now.View image in fullscreenJayden Bogle leaps in delight to celebrate his goal that opened the scoring for Leeds United against Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe game began at a frenetic pace despite horrendous conditions. Both sides clearly knew the importance of victory, both enjoying spells on the front foot inside the opening quarter. The first real chance came the way of Forest though, as Nicolás Domínguez forced a wonderful save from Karl Darlow after a counterattack before the visitors were stung at the other end.With the pitch heavy, the players covered in mud and Elland Road rocking under the lights, the game had a distinct early Premier League years feel. So perhaps it was fitting that the opening goal came from a simple, old-fashioned long ball over the top by Ilia Gruev, who picked the run of Jayden Bogle to perfection to allow the wingback to slot past Stefan Ortega for his first Premier League goal for Leeds.Four minutes later, Leeds doubled their advantage in far more intricate fashion. Some magnificent buildup play led to the tireless Brenden Aaronson threading through James Justin and, while his shot was saved by Ortega, he had the presence of mind to square the rebound for Noah Okafor, who tapped into an empty net for his first goal since October. Having more than held their own for almost half an hour, Forest were two goals behind in the blink of an eye. Dyche was furiously trying to instil some life back into his players from the touchline, shell-shocked by Leeds’ double.“They’re wise enough to know the basics and they didn’t do that,” Dyche said before offering a steadfast position on Forest’s prospects. “When we got here we were two points inside the relegation zone and now we’re six points out of it. My messages will stay the same.”Forest had to start well after the break but they did the opposite. More Leeds pressure led to the third goal, four minutes after the restart, as a curling cross from Gruev was chested out of Ortega’s path and into the net by Calvert-Lewin for his 10th top-flight goal of the season.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s new signing, Lorenzo Lucca, heads home to score on his debut and pull one back against Leeds.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThat is his best goalscoring return since 2020-21 when he was an England international. No Englishman has more goals in the Premier League this season – and Elland Road, clearly enjoying themselves by this point, serenaded their No 9 with chants about an international recall.Dyche rang the changes as the hour mark approached. Whether that was simply to stem the flow of Leeds’ attacking chances or try to haul his side back into contention, it did not have the desired effect.It was, in truth, a meek showing from Forest aside from that encouraging opening quarter. They at least grabbed some consolation when new signing Lorenzo Lucca scored his first Premier League goal by heading in an Omari Hutchinson cross but by then the damage had been done.Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedNottingham ForestPremier Leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 41-year-old has quickly become a figure of fun since his appointment as Chelsea’s head coach and was ridiculed after miscontrolling a dropping ball during his side’s defeat at Arsenal on Tuesday.It was the latest example of Rosenior facing online mockery because of his quotes and mannerisms. He has been referred to as “LinkedIn Liam” because of some of his comments in press conferences and compared to David Brent. One meme had him mocked up as Will McKenzie, the nerdy lead character from The Inbetweeners.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreRosenior is aware of the jokes at his expense but has made clear he does not take himself too seriously. He is not on social media so may not have seen another Premier League club poking fun at his clumsy attempt to trap a ball during Chelsea’sCarabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Asked whether he had been working on his touch before Saturday’s trip to Wolves, though, Rosenior was self-deprecating enough to reveal he has come in for stick from Chelsea’s 18-year-old Brazilian winger, Estêvão Willian.“The lads have played it back to me on the video and we’ve had a laugh about it,” he said. “Estêvão said he can’t believe that I was a professional footballer. This is a great job – I love this job. I am serious in many aspects and demanding in many aspects. Life is too short. You have to enjoy life. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. At the moment, a lot of people in this country have been laughing at me.”Rosenior, who has six wins from his first eight games, has placed a big emphasis on creating the right culture at Chelsea. His players are holding pre-match huddles in the centre circle. The influence of Willie Isa, Chelsea’s player support and development officer, is felt.“That’s a group thing,” Rosenior said. “Willie is a top guy. He comes from New Zealand, where the culture of togetherness and spirit is crucial. He’s spoken with the leadership group about different things we do. There are many, many things that aren’t seen, and that’s one of the many things that has been seen. For me, everything is psychological, everything starts with the mind. If your mind is in a good place, the rest takes care of itself.”Rosenior defended Alejandro Garnacho, who was taken off at half-time during last week’s3-2 win over West Ham. He denied that Garnacho, who has one league goal sincejoining from Manchester Unitedlast summer, lacks the confidence to take on full-backs. He said that “ceiling is limitless in life” when asked how far the winger could go in his career.Explore more on these topicsChelseaPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

That ship has sailed. Instead it is of how far Arne Slot’s side have truly progressed since their title defence was holed.Slot feels Liverpool’s displays have warranted defeat only occasionally this season – late lapses, set-piece failures and wasted chances have been more common explanations than the overall performance – and the3-0 reverse at the Etihad Stadiumin November was certainly one of them. The controversy over Virgil van Dijk’s disallowed header at 1-0 still lingers for the Dutchman but does not prevent him holding his hands up.Arne Slot admits things will be ‘more difficult’ if Liverpool sustain any further injuriesRead more“In the first half we were outplayed for large parts,” he reiterated this week. “We have shown we are able to compete with any team except for large parts of the first half against City. But it also helped [them] that the goal was disallowed for the wrong reasons in my opinion and they got a penalty. But they were the better team. We want to show a different side of us [on Sunday].”That defeat, in the 1,000th match of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career, was Liverpool’s seventh in the sequence of nine losses in 12 games that derailed their league campaign and undermined support for Slot. As the response to the subsequent 13-game unbeaten run anddefeat at Bournemouthshowed – misgivings accompanying almost every performance before erupting after another set-piece calamity on the south coast – neither team nor coach has fully recovered. Belatedly, however, there are at least signs of a recovery being under way.Liverpool have heeded Slot’s call for improvement in both boxes in their past two outings; the6-0 rout of Qarabagthat secured a place in the last-16 of the Champions League and the ultimately convincing4-1 comeback against Newcastlelast weekend.The team’s pressing game and work rate were superior, there were fewer chances conceded, and the form of summer signings Hugo Ekitiké, Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez continued an upwards trajectory. Repeating the levels in thePremier Leaguethree days after a Champions League fixture, having been unable to build on victory over Real Madrid against City in November, brought further encouragement for Slot. Hence why he considers the return meeting with City an accurate gauge of Liverpool’s recent development.“In that game [against City] it was obvious where we struggled,” said Slot, who saw Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah miss clearcut chances in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. “I prefer to keep that to myself because, as you know, I always prefer to protect my players. They had the ball much more than we wanted them to, we struggled to bring the ball out from the back, they didn’t even create that many chances, but it was 2-0 at half-time and they had a penalty that they missed.“We couldn’t press them and I was very curious to see that. In that time I was not happy with how much intensity we had in our pressing as a team. For me that is the biggest difference between this season and last season. Last season our pressing was much better than it was at the start of this season, but I do see a good development in that.View image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitiké are leading Liverpool’s recovery in the second half of the season.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images“And I see our players are able to run more, press more and press better, and combine that with offensive quality. That is why it will be interesting to see, against probably the best or one of the best teams in ball possession, if we have that progression in our work rate off the ball.”Slot highlighted Wirtz’s work off the ball as the biggest factor in his improvement. After a difficult start to his Premier League career, the 22-year-old Germany international is beginning to exert the influence thatLiverpooland City envisaged when the two clubs moved for him last summer. Wirtz and Ekitiké shared the pitch for 56 minutes in that City defeat but Sunday might be the first time Guardiola’s team have experienced the devastating understanding between the pair.Liverpool have left themselves little margin for error in the race for a top-four finish and need to rebuild momentum, form and confidence in a campaign that could yet be decorated by glory in the Champions League and FA Cup. Their 200th meeting in all competitions with City, who have won only once at Anfield under Guardiola and that behind closed doors, could have implications for the remainder of the season, even though it lacks the title consequences of previous episodes.“I think we are a better team [than City] and we improved quite a lot from that [3-0] game,” Alexis Mac Allister confidently declared this week. “But now we need to show it.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolManchester CityPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The championship is likely to be decided by the smallest marginsOliver ConnollyFri 6 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareWhat is the plan for Jaxon Smith-Njigba?The Seattle Seahawks’ run game came alive during the second half of the season and postseason. But it’s still the passing game that makes the offense sing. Almost all of that flows through Smith-Njigba.The wide receiver has played out of his mind this season. He roasts every defensive coverage and has morphed into a three-level threat: beating man-coverage quickly off the snap, showing fearlessness to attack the middle of the field and stretching away from deep coverage. Klint Kubiak, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, has channeled the entire Seattle offense through his star receiver. Smith-Njigba lines upeverywhere: out wide, in the slot, in the backfield. From any of those looks, he’s a matchup nightmare. His dominance has meant that the Seahawks can send fewer receivers out in the route, allowing them to keep extra players in to protect Sam Darnold. Only the Rams sent out all five eligible receivers at a lower rate than Seattle this season.In the NFC championship against the Rams, Seattle’s rushing attack dried up after an explosive opening. But they continued to convert on third-and-longs thanks to Smith-Njigba, either because of his catches or due to the gravity he creates for other targets.Butler did it: 11 years on, was the NFL’s most criticized call actually the right decision?Read moreSolving the Smith-Njigba riddle will be the Patriots’ biggest challenge. They could look to double-team him and force the ball elsewhere, or plant their own star player, cornerback Christian Gonzalez, in a one-on-one matchup and hope for the best.Whose pass protection holds up?The best way to stop an effective passing attack? Relentlessly pressure the quarterback. Darnold has struggled under heat this season. The Seahawks’ passing game ranks sixth in EPA/dropback when there is no pressure and drops to 22nd when there is pressure.New England’s best pass rushers – Milton Williams and Christian Barmore – play inside. Both have been outstanding during the team’s playoff run, and it just so happens they match up nicely with Seattle’s two weakest links. Seahawks right guard Anthony Bradford has struggled all season. On 10% of plays, he looks like a Hall of Famer, blasting open holes in the running game. On the other 90%, he’s a mess. Bradford will torpedo his own linemen in the run game and has conceded the highest pressure rate of any starting lineman in this year’sSuper Bowl. Next to Bradford is center Jalen Sundell, who hasn’t looked the same since returning from a mid-season injury.If the Patriots can craft one-on-one matchups preying on Seattle’s weakness, life will be uncomfortable for Darnold. When Darnold is uncomfortable, he plays erratically. To have a shot against a more talented team, the Patriots need to force turnovers. And the clearest path to that is isolating and attacking Bradford and Sundell.But the Patriots have protection problems of their own. The left side of their line features two rookies: tackle Will Campbell and guard Jared Wilson. Each has looked wobbly in the playoffs. There is no team you want to face less than the Seahawks when you have a compromised line.Seattle’s pass rush is merciless. They have high-end quality and depth. The Seahawks had six different players record at least 35 pressures this year – no other team had more than four players get to that total. They don’t blitz a lot, but when they do, they’ve been the most effective blitzing team in theNFL. For the Pats rookies, there will be no reps off.An offense can work around having one sinkhole along the offensive line. Working around two is tough. And working around two who stand next to each other is almost impossible – you can ask last year’s Chiefs about that. Drake Maye has been extra vulnerable to pressure in the postseason, too, with his pressure-to-sack rate jumping to an eye-watering 48%. The Patriots quarterback also has a bad case of fumble-itis. Sacks (and turnovers) kill drives – and drives will be at a premium on Sunday.Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels will need to find a solution. During the playoffs, the plan has been to keep extra players in the backfield to help out the rookies. But that compromises the menu of plays he can get to in the passing game, and will play into the hands of a Seahawks unit that swamps the field with bodies in coverage.All eyes should be on the matchup between Campbell and DeMarcus Lawrence, who will be the best pass rusher on the field. The Seahawks move him all around the front, but they’re likely to try to get him matched up on Campbell as often as possible. If Campbell can hold up Seattle’s best edge rusher, New England will have a chance to move the ball. If not, Lawrence will wreck the Patriots.View image in fullscreenDrake Maye and Sam Darnold will start in a Super Bowl for the first time in their careers.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPACan the Patriots find explosive plays?The Patriots led the NFL in explosive play rate during the regular season, recording a 10+ yard rush or 15+ yard pass on 15.8% of their plays. In large part, that’s been thanks to the brilliance of Maye. He is a dynamite thrower down the field and an effective scrambler. But he’s facing a unit that refuses to allow chunk yardage. Seattle’s entire defensive doctrine is to force quick, short throws before flying downhill to create carnage. And they do that better than any defense in recent memory.Trying to rip the Seahawks cornerbacks over their heads will be a challenge. The Rams found a path in the NFC championship game by focusing on cornerback Tariq Woolen, a hyperactive player who hunts big plays when there is no play to be made. Expect the Patriots to match up Stefon Diggs, their most reliable target, with Woolen as often as possible. And keep an eye on Kyle Williams, the Patriots’ most electric receiver. He only plays a handful of snaps per game, but is put on the field solely to chase big shots.Failing that, the Patriots will need to force missed tackles. Maye will have to check the ball down to his running backs against the Seahawks’ deep, shell coverage. Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson force a ton of missed tackles. If they can scamper away from Seattle’s defenders, they will have a chance to turn rough drives into scoring ones.The coaching matchupWhat makes this matchup so intriguing is that it features strength on strength all over the field. The Seahawks do their best work running the ball from heavier personnel groupings. That just so happens to be where the Patriots do their best workslowingrushing attacks. The Patriots are an explosive, vertical offense. The Seahawks stifle big plays.The difference between the two teams will be on the margins. Who handles the occasion best? Who makes the right fourth-down decisions? Who makes the correct on-the-fly adjustments when their pass protection is caving in? Who has saved a handful of bespoke, payoff plays for this opponent? Which kicker holds his nerve on field goals?Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel has been here before, as a player. Mike Macdonald, Seattle’s head honcho, has never coached in the Super Bowl. Macdonald is a defensive savant whose unit significantly improves as the game progresses. He figures out what’s working and ditches what isn’t. In fourth quarters this year, the Seahawks defense leads the league in EPA/play, pressure rate and sack rate. Macdonald can decode how an offense is trying to break down his unit and roll out counters of his own.But he’s going up against someone with bags of experience. McDaniels has been on six Super Bowl-winning staffs. His MO is saving something you haven’t seen before for the biggest possible moment. The Seahawks will need to be alert to a wonky formation or trick play as the Patriots look to steal a possession.Then there is Vrabel. His calling card is game management, aggression and his knowledge of the rules. His team is the underdog. What does he have under his vest to keep the matchup close late?In the modern era, Super Bowls have typically come down to one or two plays. The Seahawks have a kicking advantage, but the Patriots have a coach who has mastered the art of navigating one-score games. If the game turns into a slog, the Patriots have an edge. But they will have to find a way to limit the exposure to their offensive line, and that rarely works in championship games.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLSuper Bowl LXNew England PatriotsSeattle SeahawksUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After mystifyingly electing to field against South Africa on a searing hot afternoon, they effectively melted; Heinrich Klaasen scored a century,England chased 400 and were rolled out for 170. It is a grisly memory mercifully borne by only a few members of the current squad, which includes just three survivors of that side (Brooks, Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid).ICC braced for major financial hit if Pakistan v India World T20 game offRead moreA 3pm start (9.30am GMT), a shorter format and Mumbai’s pleasantly cool February evenings mean there should be no repeat of that particular torture when they get this World Cup under way against Nepal on Sunday, or in their second game, a 7pm (1.30pm) start against West Indies in the same venue three days later. But they are doing everything within their power to keep those heads cool as the intervening hours tick away.The team hotel is conveniently located a kilometre away from the Wankhede, a handy booking which appeared to guarantee they would avoid commutes through the notoriously snarled-up streets of Mumbai. But then they were allocated training facilities at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, a separate city entirely and requiring a potential three-hour round trip. The team management decided the inconvenience of this journey was even worse than not training at all, particularly when sessions on the eve of matches are often of reduced length and intensity.So Friday’s training, in which Phil Salt took part three days after suffering a back spasm – his fitness for the opener will be decided on Saturday – was rearranged for the evening at the Wankhede (which the USA helpfully vacated, instead putting on a voluntary session in Navi Mumbai). With that stadium busy on Saturday hosting India’s fixture against the Americans, England have cancelled their final training session altogether.It seems a sensible decision in every way but one. Their last game in Sri Lanka wason Tuesday, and this is hardly a team short on match practice or impetus. “It’s not so much momentum, it’s more team unity and feeling strong within ourselves and having that confidence,” said all-rounder Will Jacks. “We’ve built up a lot of trust in each other and I think the performances we put in there, not just winning but how we did it, it really bonds the group. At times in the World Cup we’re obviously going to be put under pressure and that’s something we can look back on and try to replicate.”View image in fullscreenEngland will not have great memories of playing in Mumbai after being thrashed by South Africa there in the 2023 World Cup.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty ImagesBut the fact is that before those back-to-back white-ball series victories England had won little this winter except a reputation for taking anextremely relaxed approach to all things cricket. Opting to complete their World Cup preparations around the pool of their luxury hotel leaves them exposed to further criticism should Nepal, who had Friday off but will train in Navi Mumbai on Saturday, spring a surprise by extending their own impressive form on Sunday.Nepal have won 10 of their last 12 official T20 internationals, beating West Indies (twice), Scotland andthe Netherlandsalong the way, and come into the tournament having recorded victories in both of their warm-ups in Chennai, albeit against Oman and Canada. Rohit Paudel, their captain, is the only player to have appeared in all 42 of their games across the last two years but eight of the XI have played in 30 or more and form an experienced core. Sunday’s game is reported to be close to selling out, with Mumbai’s large Nepali expat community, estimated at more than 200,000 people, likely to make up the majority of what England may find a hostile crowd.“We know lots about every team but they’re a team we don’t see as much, so I think that’s a challenge in itself,” said Jacks. “You can never take anything for granted. I think we have to prepare as well as we can and we have to turn up and be 100%. You can’t go easy in any game and expect to bring it up later in the group stage. Every single game is critically important.”The relatively early start means England avoid one issue that may assist underdogs across the tournament: dew, which had a huge impact on the 2021T20 World Cupand may do so again.“It’s a difficult one to predict. You play on days when you’re expecting it to be dewy and then it’s not and vice versa,” said Jacks, who was sporting an eyecatching, freshly bleached haircut (“I’ve had the Eminem jokes, asking me to rap a bit. Some guys say it’s good, some say it’s awful. I’ll probably have my hat or helmet on most of the time”). “But we know in T20 unless it’s very obviously a bat-first scenario most teams are looking to chase and dew is obviously a part of that.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamT20 World CupCricketTwenty20featuresShareReuse this content"

The 45-year-old completed a domestic season unbeaten during her first year and won a treble, as well as reaching the Women’s Champions League semi-finals.News of her new deal comes despite the defending champions having slipped to third, 12 points behind the Women’s Super League leaders, Manchester City. According to sources the extension was agreed before Chelsea’s recent back-to-back losses against Arsenaland Cityand both parties retain full belief in one another.Having lost consecutive league games for the first time in her managerial career, Bompastor spoke on Thursday about her belief that her team will bounce back when they travel to Tottenham in the WSL on Sunday. “We work hard with intensity,” she said. “We are facing a tough moment because we are not used to losing games but we also trust the quality we have in the squad, and I know it’s small tweaks for us to be in a better position. I’m confident from what I saw this week in our training sessions, we’ll be able to bounce back on Sunday.”Formerly the head coach of Lyon – now OL Lyonnes – with whom she was a Champions League winner as a coach in 2022, Bompastor was Chelsea’s preferred candidate to pick up the baton from Hayes, who had been in charge for 12 years and oversaw a dominant, trophy-laden era.This season Bompastor has guided Chelsea to another League Cup final, in which they will face Manchester United at Ashton Gate in March. Her side are also through to the Champions League quarter-finals, having been the highest-finishing English side in this season’s league phase, and in the fifth round of the FA Cup.“I am delighted to extend my stay here,” the former France international told Chelsea’s club channels. “I want to thank the club for their unwavering support and the trust they have shown in me. It’s a privilege to lead this team and I could not be prouder to represent Chelsea.“Our success as a team is built on grit, resilience and intensity and we do not settle for anything less than winning. We have so much left to fight for, we are competing on four fronts, and we will give everything, every single day to make our supporters proud. My focus is firmly on bringing more success to this amazing club.”In a joint statement, sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said that Bompastor was integral to their long-term plans, adding: “Since the day Sonia joined Chelsea, she has delivered a level of excellence that has elevated our women’s team on and off the pitch.“Her impact has been immediate and significant, and the standards she sets embody exactly what we want this club to represent. Sonia is not only a key part of driving our success today, but also an integral part of the long-term future we are building.“Renewing her contract reflects our belief in her leadership, her vision and the stability she brings to the club.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The ­British No 1 beat Oleksandra ­Oliynykova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in a tough semi-final to take her place in Saturday’s Transylvania Open final in Cluj.She now has a shot at winning her first title since her incredible success at Flushing Meadows in 2021 when she announced herself as a real force on the WTA Tour.Emma Raducanu begins latest search for coach after parting company with RoigRead moreTwo British women will compete in different WTA Tour finals on the same day for the first time, withKatie Boulterreaching the final of the Ostrava Open.What sort of physical or mental condition Raducanu, the top seed, will be in for the final against Sorana Cirstea remains to be seen after she came through one of the toughest matches of her career. It was an attritional match for Raducanu against the Ukrainian, who adopted some frustrating tactics, including heavy use of the moon ball and slices and the Briton was left physically shattered after a near three-hour battle.“What an incredible match,” ­Raducanu said. “I think all props to my opponent today. She played incredible, makes it so tricky to put any ball past her. You think it’s past her, and then the ball is on your baseline or on your sideline, so it’s so difficult.“I’m just most proud of how I competed, how I came back in the third set, how I managed the match. I honestly don’t know if I could have done it without everyone’s support.”The world No 91 adopted her infuriating tactics especially well late in the first set after Raducanu had broken to go 5-4 up. It paid off as she broke back, but Raducanu stayed strong to claim another break in a mammoth game at 5-5 and then served out the set with relative ease.View image in fullscreenKatie Boulter is into her fifth WTA final after beating Katie Volynets in straight sets in OstravaPhotograph: Lukas Coch/AAPThe British player then broke in the opening game of the second set to raise hopes of a more comfortable route to victory as she opened up a 3-1 lead.

She missed two match points on Oliynykova’s serve, but finally finished the job behind her own serve.Earlier, the British No 4, Boulter, beat the American Katie Volynets 6-1, 6-3 to secure a place in the Ostrava Open final.Boulter, now No 120 in the world, broke in the opening game and then the fifth to establish a 4-1 lead, before taking the set as Volynets’ serve faltered again. Volynets, the world No 96, forced an early break in the first game of the second set, but the Briton responded immediately to level at 1-1.Boulter then went on the offensive with some power hitting across the court. Another break in game eight left her serving for the match, which she closed out after recovering from 0-40 down to hold her nerve and progress to a fifth WTA final.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuKatie BoulterTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Manchester City’s manager spoke out earlier in the week and is refusing to be silenced.“I didn’t say anything special. I don’t feel that. Why should I not express what I feel? Just because I’m a manager,” said Guardiola. “I don’t agree but I respect all opinions. What I said basically is how many conflicts there are right now all around the world. I condemn all of them. If innocent people are killed, I condemn them all – not this country being more than the other one.”On Tuesday Guardiola named Sudan, Palestine and Ukraine when talking about the killing of innocent victims in conflict. “The genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened all around the world – in Sudan, everywhere. What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problem as human beings,”the 55-year-old said.He also gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity event in Barcelona. Yet in a statement posted on X and its website the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region said: “We have repeatedly asked for prominent individuals to be mindful about the words they use given how Jewish people have had to endure attacks across the globe. Pep Guardiola is a football manager. Whilst his humanitarian reflections may be well-intentioned, he should focus on football.“Manchester City is being let down by him repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs. This is the second time in a week he has decided to offer his controversial views on the Middle East conflict.“It’s especially galling given his total failure to use his significant platform to display any solidarity with the Jewish community subjected to a terrorist attack a few miles from the Etihad Stadium or the Barcelona community reeling from anti-Semitic violence close to where he once engaged in remarks we believe to be provocative.”Guardiola takes City to Liverpool for Sunday’s late kick-off with Erling Haaland having scored just once from open play in 10 appearances. Haaland was dropped for Wednesday’s 3-1 Carabao Cup semi-final win over Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium, again failing to score as a late substitute. Omar Marmoush, who replaced him, scored twice yet Guardiola has backed Haaland, saying: “Erling is the best striker in the world.” He added: “I don’t know if he plays at Liverpool but I always say Erling is the best.”Antoine Semenyo is aiming to extend his scoring sequence of four goals in six appearances since joining from Bournemouth in January. The forward has scored 14 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions this season and wants to be as prolific as Haaland.He said: “I have expectations for myself so coming here I knew there was going to be that pressure of scoring the same goals as Erling, but I feel like I’ve given myself those goals at the start of the season to compete with players of his stature. Being on the same team [as him] is a blessing. It’s [goalscoring] something that is in my blood and my DNA and I just want to keep going.”Bernardo Silva is facing a fitness test before City face Liverpool at Anfield.Jamie Jackson2.Arteta says sorry for crossing the lineMikel Arteta has apologised to Liam Rosenior for any disruption caused to Chelsea’s warm-up before their Carabao Cup semi-final and insisted he will not be drawn into a war of words with any managers who might try to derail Arsenal’s title challenge.Rosenior was shown on television launching a tirade against an unidentified member of Arsenal’s staff who he felt had strayed into Chelsea’s half of the pitch during the warm-up at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Chelsea’s head coach later said his team notbeen shown respectand that there were “certain etiquettes in football” to observe.“I don’t know, it’s his opinion and obviously we respect everybody,” said Arteta when asked about the incident. “If at any point one of the staff members went through that, we apologise and that’s it. It’s very common in football, especially with the keepers because they have to keep long balls and all that, so nothing left to comment.”View image in fullscreenChelsea manager Liam Rosenior (right) and his Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta shake hands but tempers frayed in their Carabao Cup semi-final.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockBukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard are still doubtful for the game against Sunderland on Saturday when Arsenal have an opportunity to move nine points clear at the top before second-placed Manchester City face Liverpool 24 hours later.Last week, Arteta dismissed suggestions that Pep Guardiola could try to affect his side with “mind games” and he once again insisted it is important not to listen to any outside noise if Arsenal are to achieve their objective. “I would engage with the things that, in my opinion, are relevant for the team, and what is the best for the team and the club,” he said.Arteta was booked against Chelsea for contesting a decision by the referee – only the second time he has received a yellow card this season. Asked whether it is important to keep your emotions in check if you are a Premier League manager, he said: “I don’t know. Sometimes it’s difficult because you cannot be aware constantly about everything, and we are human beings, and we react to things, so I think it’s normal. I try to be the right example always, and if that’s the intention, that’s OK.”Ed Aarons3.Howe: ‘My future isn’t relevant’Eddie Howe has moved to quell speculation he could walk away from Newcastle at the end of the season following a dispiriting run of results. The Carabao Cup holders’ defence of their first major domestic trophy in 70 years ended on Wednesday night when Manchester City completed a 5-1 aggregate semi-final victory over Newcastle, and they head into Saturday’s Premier League fixture with Brentford sitting in 11th place in the table.However, after social media went into overdrive in the wake of a disappointing first-half performance at the Etihad Stadium to suggest the 48-year-old has taken the club as far as he can, with further speculation that he could replace England manager Thomas Tuchel this summer despite Newcastle chief executive David Hopkinson’s claim this week that the two parties remain happy with each other, Howe was in defiant mood.“That’s a surprise to me,” Howe said: “I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff. I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games. That’s my only thought. I don’t tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense.“My individual future isn’t really relevant. Who knows? I don’t know my length of time here, I’ve got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe and his Newcastle players applaud the away fans after the Carabao Cup defeat at Manchester City.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe loss of £130m striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool during the summer has had a lasting impact, and Howe acknowledges that the £219m they spent on Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa, Anthony Elanga and Jacob Ramsey is yet to pay full dividends.“For me, it’s too early to make strong conclusions from that transfer window. At this moment in time, I’d probably say let’s see where we are at the end of the season, and then even six months into next season, too. I think you’ll have a clearer idea then because you can look back at Lewis Hall’s transfer and go: ‘Well that didn’t work initially,’ but for me that was always a long-term signing.“That’s also true of various other players we’ve signed through the years – Anthony Gordon also took time to become the player that he is now. Patience is needed, although it’s a rare commodity these days with transfers. I understand that with the outlay, people will go, ‘You shouldn’t need patience and understanding’. But I’d say with most transfers these days, I think there has to be an element of that.”PA Media4.Carrick pleased with Mainoo impactMichael Carrick has praised Kobbie Mainoo’s impact at Manchester United and challenged the club’s youngsters to follow in the midfielder’s footsteps. Mainoo has played every minute of the interim head coach’s three matches, having not started any of the first 21 Premier League games under his predecessor Ruben Amorim.Mainoo will start again when United host Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime, as Carrick looks to maintain his 100% record. Despite being handed the job only until the end of the season, Carrick has incorporated a number of academy prospects in training to show there is a pathway to the first team, after Amorim was reluctant to select homegrown products.“I’ve known Kobbie to start with, and what he can bring to the team,” Carrick said of the academy graduate. “It was just my thoughts to put him into the team and I thought he would give us an awful lot. From the club’s point of view, it’s an ideal scenario to bring players through the academy and have them in the team and have them go through their career at this club and stay in and around it.”Carrick called up the 15-year-old JJ Gabriel to take part in training this week alongside Jack Moorhouse, Yuel Helafu and the brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher. They are working under the assistant coach Travis Binnion, who was the Under-21s manager until Amorim’s departure and has overseen the development of the club’s best talent in recent years, including Mainoo and Shea Lacey.“I’m not putting everything on Kobbie’s shoulders,” Carrick said. “He’s doing terrific at the moment and I’m sure he’ll continue to be that way. We want more of that; we want more players to come through the system and to get into the first team. For me, there’s no better feeling than giving younger players a chance.”The new backroom staff was built at short notice but Carrick said: “It feels like we’ve been together an awful much longer than just these three weeks.” The most noticeable appointment was the former Chelsea and England assistant Steve Holland, who – like Carrick – spent time working under José Mourinho“I learned a lot from José in the five months when I was coaching, even in that, when you see how he works, how he thinks and how he sees players and things and they end up coming off like he predicted at certain times,” Carrick said. “He had a real good eye for that, so there’s certainly that connection.” Carrick said of Holland: “There’s definitely the common kind of factors that help us work together.”Will Unwin5.Moyes urges Dibling to ‘get angry and make an impression’David Moyes has said the arrival of Tyrique George at Everton should prompt Tyler Dibling to think “I better get my finger out” and fight for a starting place. Dibling has struggled to make an impression after a £35m move from Southampton last summer and now faces competition from his fellow 19-year-old George, who was signed on an initial loan from Chelsea on deadline day.George could replace the injured Jack Grealish on Everton’s left but can play across the front line. Asked how Dibling should react to George’s transfer, the Everton manager said: “I’d be thinking: ‘I better get my finger out and show the manager what I was really all about.’“Tyler is young and he is a quite a quiet boy who might take more time to settle in. Might. But he needs to show when he gets the opportunities. There are little glimpses of him just beginning to get angry, which I am enjoying, just beginning to be someone who might have to get angry to show what he wants to do.“What we want from him is being direct, taking people on, committing people or the way Jack Grealish does it where he drags the ball and brings people to him and finds a way of not releasing. Are you going to get us some assists, are you going to score some goals? He is just showing little signs that he is heading towards that a bit better.”Dibling was taken off at half-time on his last start, the 4-2 home defeat by Brentford, and has been mainly restricted to brief substitute appearances. “I think he is more angry with himself,” Moyes said, “because he is realising that ‘If I don’t get my finger out than I am going to get pushed aside here.’ He has more competition but that is what happens in football. If you want to be at the elite end of football then the competition is stiff and you have to live with that.”Andy Hunter6.Watkins in Villa frame for VitalityUnai Emery says Ollie Watkins is back available after a hamstring scare as Aston Villa look to get back to winning ways at Bournemouth. The 30-year-old, who has scored eight goals in 33 appearances in all competitions this season, limped off 35 minutes into last Thursday’s Europa League match against RB Salzburg.Watkins missed the surprise 1-0 home defeat to his former club Brentford but the England international could lead the line at Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon.

The Cherries lost Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City last month but brought in Alex Toth, Rayan and Ademide Solanke as well as goalkeepers Fraser Forster and Christos Mandas.With the club continuing to build a young core, Iraola was asked before Saturday’s match against Aston Villa if they would make it more difficult for him to potentially walk away in the summer. “You are making it sound like I am like almost testing the club, sign very good players so I can stay,” Iraola said in response.“And from my side, it’s not like this. I think I try to help the club to sign the better players we can. And we’ve tried to do this in the winter market. Some players we haven’t been able to sign, others yes, like in every market. And now the market is not the important thing for me. The important thing is the performances, how we build a team, how we play games, how we can continue getting points.

As far as I am able, I will play my partFormer prime minister ‘deeply regrets’ bringing Mandelson into his governmentFri 6 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareIn Jeffrey Epstein’s wider circle, women and girls were treated as less than human by powerful men acting far beyond the law. The sexual trafficking plotted by him and his fellow criminals is the most egregious example of a global network of wealthy and powerful men that thinks it can act with impunity. Nothing less than a century-defining rebalancing of power and accountability is equal to this moment and the trauma of the victims. This scandal is primarily about them and their pain.But as I digest the details of what has emerged, I also find it hard to find words to express my revulsion at what has been uncovered about Epstein and his impact on our politics. During the financial crisis, I wanted every moment of every day to be spent doing everything that could be done to save people’s homes, savings, pensions and jobs. That a member of the cabinet at the time was thinking more of himself and his rich friends is a betrayal of everything we stand for as a country. That theleaks of sensitive informationwere going to someone we now know was the ringmaster of a cabal of abusers and enablers sickens me.In the weeks and months to come, we must find ways to rebuild trust. Yet trust in politics, once dented, is difficult to repair. And so, as thepolice investigate Peter Mandelson amid allegationsof financial and political misconduct, indeed criminality, politicians have a herculean task to persuade people that they act in the public interest and not only self-interest. Already,two-thirds of the British publicbelieve that politicians are out primarily for themselves. The grim truth is that unless something fundamental changes, this week’s revelations will be acid in our democracy, corroding trust still further.We in Britain must face uncomfortable facts. Every few years, our country has suffered a major scandal that shakes us to the core but from which lessons are never fully learned: the Profumo affair of the 1960s, the “brown envelopes” sleaze of the 1980s, the MPs’ expenses affair of the 2000s, the Boris Johnson Partygate excesses of the early 2020s and now the Mandelson affair.I have to take personal responsibility for appointing Mandelson to his ministerial role in 2008. I greatly regret this appointment. I made it at the end of his four years as the UK’s European commissioner on trade. I was informed that his record in the role was unblemished and there were no reports of a relationship with anyone named Epstein. No one could say I promoted him out of favouritism. I did so in spite of him being anything but a friend to me, because I thought that his unquestioned knowledge of Europe and beyond could help us as we dealt with the global financial crisis. I now know that I was wrong.He seems to have used market-sensitive inside informationto betray the principles in which he said he believed, and he betrayed the people who believed in them – and him.His activities, which his own emails have brought into the public arena, do not only show his duplicity. They force us to examine how easy it is in our country to trade secrets – for wealth to gain access to power, how backdoor routes to decision-makers can be covered up, how lobbying for financial gain can circumvent well-meaning but insipid rules and how our laws seem tohave failed to catch up with corruption. The case is now unanswerable for comprehensive and immediate action to clean up our politics with new rules for politicians and public servants, as well as powerful new institutions and checks to enforce them.Just after the Johnson scandals, at the request of Keir Starmer,I chaired a review of our constitutionwhose report included recommendations on standards in public life. And because he commissioned and subsequently approved all of it, the prime minister is in the best position to lead its full implementation.To his credit, some of its recommendations are already being put in place –tightening the codeon ministerial behaviour, reforming electoral laws toban foreign moneyand reducing thesuffocating overcentralisationof Whitehall – but he will be the first to agree that we must now move much faster and further.First, we need an independent anti-corruption commission to be appointed by parliament, with the commissioner given the remit and power in law, as our review promised, to root out any criminality in UK political life by detecting and punishing it wherever and whenever it occurs. And to remove all doubt as to our determination, parliament should be quite specific in naming “corruption” a new statutory offence, as theLaw Commission has proposedand Transparency International has sought in the public office (accountability) bill going through parliament. The anti-corruption champion, Margaret Hodge, has done her best with a limited remit, but the commissionershould have statutory powers of search and seizure and access to bank records, and all public bodies should be required to fully cooperate.Australia has led the wayin introducing such an agency and that can be a blueprint for rapid reform.Proper behaviour in public life is, however, more than simply the absence of suspicious money.The Nolan committee in 1995laid down the underlying principles that should govern public life and public service, but the mechanisms for enforcing these have proved seriously wanting.We needthe new ethics and integrity commission– which replaced the committee on standards in public life in October 2025 – to be placed on a statutory basis, as it supersedes the current hotchpotch of standards commissioners and ethics advisers. At the moment, it is only advisory andhasno powers to investigate individual cases, impose penalties or enforce its conclusions. It should be empowered to take a proactive role in investigating all alleged breaches of the various codes for ministers and MPs. An updated MPs’ code of conduct, which should also have a statutory footing, should include a general prohibition on MPs’ second jobs – with only a few exceptions required to maintain professional memberships, such as inmedicine. Through the innovation of citizens’ juries – as promised by the Labour manifesto – there should be a greater role for the public in deciding and enforcing the rules to be followed by politicians.Questions have been raisedabout the awarding of contracts, not just in the wake of the many Covid PPE scandals, but in relation to lobbying by a company co-founded by Mandelson, Global Counsel (whose overseas activities led to newadvice on transparencybeing issued in 2025), and other firms. Transparency International reports that less than 4% of lobbyists are covered by the hastily concocted 2014 Lobbying Act. A report,No Rules Britannia, in April 2025 stated that we are the western world’s least transparent country. Conventions about commercial confidentiality should no longer prevent public service contracts delivered by private companies being subject to reasonable freedom of information requests.It is no accident that in both theMichelle Moneand Mandelson cases, the spotlight has fallen on the House of Lords. Its membership contains many good and great public servants beyond reproach. But without greater accountability and a fully adequate statutory lobbying register akin to those in Germany, Canada, the US and France, the Lords’ 50 known lobbyists and the 91 memberswho are paid for their political adviceform a section of our lawmakers that reminds me of the old rotten boroughs. Too many peers have second, third or fourth jobs, some of them employed under the radar because of a suspiciously lenient system for the declaration of conflicts of interest. I believe that we are one false declaration away from yet another scandal. Reform of the Lords, therefore, cannot stop at removing a few hereditary peers and expelling those guilty of crime.In the absence of the most desirable outcome that I and the Labour commission support – the replacement of the Lords by an elected second chamber – we need immediate action to exclude lobbyists and to mandate rigorous standards of disclosure. Proper declaration of interests should be required also by those appointed to the privy council, and five years is a more appropriate delay than the currenttwo yearsfor former ministers lobbying or doing private business in areas where they clearly have inside knowledge of undoubted commercial value.This week’s events show why it is also imperative that the government bring in a fully accountable system for vetting major appointments such as those of Mandelson, and one that allows public scrutiny. Before the first world war, an incoming minister had to immediately put himself up for re-election as a constituency MP as a condition of taking up government office. A minister making executive decisions was seen as different from a legislator scrutinising them. It is because we have had since then no satisfactory means of vetting ministerial or other major appointments that mistakes are so easily made.The way forward is to hold parliamentary hearings, similar to those in the US Senate, for newly appointed ministers to ensure the right questions are asked and answered in public about present and past interests and conduct. We already have formal parliamentary hearings for new members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. It is a system of formal vetting that should extend at a minimum to senior ambassadors. If it had been in place last year, it would have led to a very different ambassadorial appointmentNone of these changes can be guaranteed to prevent a determined individual from betraying our country. But we owe it to the victims of abuse, whose moving accounts have triggered current investigations, that our every action is now determined by the effort to prevent the powerful acting with impunity against the powerless. Without delay, the prime minister can do what he has always wanted to do: legislate for a new era of transparency, putting in place the strongest possible safeguards to prevent misbehaviour and to ensure proper accountability if misconduct happens. The time is overdue to let in the light – and send the princes of darkness on their way.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And that’s for the best, isn’t it guys?Fri 6 Feb 2026 08.36 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 15.29 ESTShareFair play to Bill Gates’s ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, a woman who fronted up to appear on a podcastthis weekwhile so many of the men who feature in the latest Epstein files drop found that their diaries had them scheduled to stay hiding under their rocks. Melinda was asked about Jeffrey Epstein, obviously, and executed a very graceful drive-by. “Whatever questions remain there of what I don’t – can’t – even begin to know all of it, those questions are for those people, and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me. And I am so happy to be away from all the muck that was there.” Oof. Yet she also said, more generally: “I think we’re having a reckoning as a society, right?”Cards on the table, I don’t think we’re having one at all. Look at the headlines, or what’s dominating all the news bulletins. We’re talking about anything but the things that most need to be reckoned with. In the UK, we’re talking round the clock about Peter Mandelson, the one guy in this we at least know wasn’t making sexually abusive use of Epstein’s trafficked women and girls. Even if he did offer Epstein image rehab advice, which, asdiscussed here in depth on Tuesday, was a foray into the moral abyss. (Again.) But the frenzied and remorseless focus on political fallout – and not the male-on-female debasement that is theentire heart of this story, and always has been – is weird, isn’t it? I had a mirthless laugh at the New Statesman’s cover this week, which characterised the Mandelson affair as “the scandal of the century”. Guys, it’s not even the biggest scandal of the scandal.9:37Marina Hyde on Epstein’s enablers: will they get away with it? – The LatestLet me be clear. I think all the bits of the fallout we’re focusing on now are a mass displacement activity, driven subconsciously or consciously by men so we don’t have to reckon with the fact that we now have searchable records of the way some of the most powerful guys in the world, who have huge sway over our lives, talk and think about women. And about girls.In some ways this is the dark switcheroo we should all have been prepared for. There really is no bad vibe/criminal abuse operation that a properly enterprising scumbag can’t just buy up and take ownership of, and then flip into the appearance of do-gooding. There is anincredible clipof Epstein being interviewed in some wood-panelled, gentleman’s club-style room, shot in either late 2018 or early 2019. “I made my living from old thinking,” Epstein reflects expansively in it. “But the future is for the way women think.” We pan out to see that the interviewer is his buddySteve Bannon. “Is that a sop because of all the depravity you’ve done against young women?” asks Bannon. “Your new sop is that women’s thinking is the future?” “No,” smirks Epstein. “… I’m a firm believer and supporter of Time’s Up.” I wonder if he literally donated money to this #MeToo-era charity. I bet he did.Anyway, all shapeshifters gotta shapeshift. A couple of years after Epstein’s death, Bannon repackaged this footage into a documentary called The Monsters (producer: Stephen K Bannon) and now calls Epstein “a globalist child molester”. Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? But oh look – what do we have here? Also included in a recent file dump was some correspondence where Bannon spitballs a survival strategy for Epstein. “What about establishing THE major center for human trafficking, teenage prostitution etc etc etc – global problem, needs to be solved”.You laugh – again, mirthlessly – but I firmly believe that only accelerating events, most pertinently the July 2019 arrest and incarceration of Epstein, deprived the world of TheJeffrey EpsteinUnderage Sex Trafficking Foundation. Sure, it sounds like an off-colour Saturday Night Live sketch idea that never makes it to air. But sex abusers creating fake philanthropy ventures that bring them closer to vulnerable victims? Let’s face it, we’ve seen it before, everywhere from the church to aid charities. And if these files show us anything, it’s that there would have been so, so many mega-rich male donors. So many fathers-of-daughters who are quite happy to to turn a blind eye to the use and abuse of other fathers’ daughters.Maybe the foundation’s lavish fundraising brochure could have been shot by “arthouse” bondage photographer Andres Serrano. “I was prepared to vote against Trump for all the right reasons,” Serrano moans to Epstein in one 2016 email. “But I’m so disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote.” Elsewhere, Epstein reckons the way to deal with any Senate hearing into his activities would be to ape Trump’s successful supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation hearings notably featured him denying allegations of sexual assault. “I guess I can mimic kavanaugh. ‘Yes senator I like pussy, pussy yes. Don’t you senator’”. Well, why not? For the benefit of the lawyers, I should clarify that those weren’t Kavanaugh’s words and he majored on how much he liked beer … But, his approach famously worked, and Justice Kavanaugh will have huge influence over American women’s lives for the rest of his. And even more famously, the pussy-grabber became president – twice.So really: spare me the half-arsed elite pearl-clutching over Epstein’s crimes and look at what is actually happening. What has anyone in power, at all, done to attack the structures and attitudes that allowed them to happen? We’ve known about Epstein’s world for so long. As Julie K Brown, the brilliant Miami Herald journalist whose watershed 2018 investigation into Epstein was built on the back of years of her meticulous reporting, stated baldly: “Epstein got away with his crimes because nearly every element of society allowed him to get away with them.”I agree. And years on from that investigation, we can see that the reaction to every file dump is born of the same look-the-wrong way impulse that allowed it all to happen. From Noam Chomsky toSteve Bannon, from Bill Gates to the former Prince Andrew – this is nothing to do with left or right, or new money or old. There will always be something more important than grappling the roots of misogyny – money, power, access, information, a political project, “how the world works”, whether you can use Mandelson to bring down Keir Starmer, “philanthropy”, realpolitik … . A million other priorities. The abused women and girls are nothing but a plot device, just like they always were. It’s the pussy-grabbers’ world – we just live in it. The only difference is you can now see it laid out in black and white.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionPeter MandelsonMelinda French GatesBill GatesSteve BannonSex traffickingUS crimecommentShareReuse this content"

Now that’s in dangerNosheen IqbalLed by women, queer-friendly, diverse: this model can break so many boundaries. But if we lose spaces to meet in, it can't happenFri 6 Feb 2026 08.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 08.43 ESTShareSomething quietly profound happened last Ramadan. In a year when the war on Gaza hardened public debate into camps, when half the UK was found to believe that Islam – and therefore Muslims – to beincompatible with British values, when the general volume of Islamophobia was ratcheted several notches higher by Reform UK’s rise in the polls, hundreds of Muslim Londoners gathered every night to build the kind of community and connection we were told had been decimated. Lost to whatever the flavour of blame is at the moment: doomscrolling, the telly streamers, individualism promoted by late-stage capitalism, a society fractured by the cost of living.For a month, Muslims came together in the capital and put on iftars, the evening meal that breaks the day’s fast, that reflected the world we want to live in: inclusive, often female-led and queer-friendly, properly diverse, rooted in generosity. A community without judgment, formed outside mosques, free from the performative piety Olympics. Which all sounds deeply earnest, but believe me when I tell you that these were some of the most vibey events I went to last year.Communities such asRamadan Space, grown on WhatsApp, negotiated a venue in Shoreditch and put onsold-out nights all month long. These became regular rituals for some, a wholesome bit of eat-pray-love that, as one hijabi student told me, felt “like oxygen” at a time when it felt difficult to come up for air. TheInclusive Mosque Initiativeput on feminist prayers in a south London church. A friend launchedShukr, bringing together London’s Muslim creatives at the top of180 The Strand. (In attendance: rappers Krept and Konan, and the mayor of London.)Another friend hostedFaith & Flow, a wellness workshop mixing movement with meditation.Palestine Housequickly became a central destination for everything from political solidarity to spiritual Sufidhikrs.Hulm Club, a Muslim coworking space for techies, opened its doors in Farringdon.Rumi’s Cavein north-west London, a hub like no other, fed hundreds of vulnerable, homeless and isolated members of the local community via Rumi’s Kitchen. Buzzy new interfaith ideas and venues –Karrom Club,Kismet Cafe– were born from that energy. And through it all: charity, fundraising, volunteering. Allcentral tenetsin a month that’s about compassion and empathy.It doesn’t take a sociologist to point out the importance of third spaces like these, and the social and cultural benefits of spontaneous meet-ups, of breaking bread with people from different backgrounds. There is a hunger for meaning and purpose among young Muslims who are doing things differently from their elders in a way I find far more inspiring and encouraging than what much of my generation did. To be clear,Ramadanhas always been about community coming together, about family iftars and leaning into your most spiritual, introspective self. But last year was different. Breaking from traditions, it felt fresh, open – and desperately necessary.London can often feel harsh and transactional but,like New York, its dynamism and creativity comes from the margins. From people pulling it out of the bag with the DIY punk spirit that has always been key to influencing the wider culture.This is Muslim New York: artists, thinkers and politicos on defining a new era for the cityRead moreWhich is why news that Ramadan Space’s venue has pulled out this year feels so crushing. At the time of writing, the physical space to gather won’t happen this year. Its founding committee is desperately trying to secure a different spot – any generous benefactors please step forward – but it’s a huge blow for those of us trying to create something at the grassroots.Does this matter? Perhaps it’s tempting to view the cancellation as a logistical hiccup or an admin problem for a minority of Muslims who make up a scene on the fringes. But that misses the point that what comes under threat is a model of belonging that so many from all backgrounds say they want to see, and that Londoners desperately need.There is endless talk about cohesion and resilience, about mental-health crises andloneliness epidemics, about us living in polarised, divided times. What sense does it make to allow the very spaces that soften those hard edges to disappear?Ramadan is coming again, we’re less than two weeks out, and I know what kind of Ramadan I want. Community doesn’t just happen. It is made, night after night, by people choosing to be together. On any day, in any month, we should be doing everything we can to make space for that, not the polar opposite.Nosheen Iqbal is the host of the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcastDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But with Starmer at the helm? I can’t see itFri 6 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 05.08 ESTShareThe smell of death is in the Westminster air. Labour’s King Rat Peter Mandelsonhas again cast hissulphurous odour of villainyaround the palace, and contamination may drag a decent, well-intentioned Labour leader down with him.That’s the tragedy. Nothing about Keir Starmer’s life purpose, attitudes, tastes, morals or values resembles Mandelson’s and his venal world of corrupted power, where mega-billions buy anyone anything. Not friends; they had nothing in common. For all Mandelson’s pedigree, reaching into the party’s past, he never seemed to have a single Labour value or egalitarian instinct. Labour was a vehicle.But even if the men were never close, Mandelson worked to cast his mantle over Starmer’s team, just as he had exerted his malign and worldly influence on Labour for decades. Morgan McSweeney washis young protege, learning the Mandelsonian way of political cynicism; others in the cabinet, too, were surely seduced by that aura of “grownup” reckoning with the “real world”.McSweeney was widely reported to bethe onepushing Mandelson’s appointmentto Washington, a clever idea to plant a man without scruples to schmooze a president with even fewer. Clever, that is, if you can skip past the minor irrelevance of his intimate friendship with a man who trafficked young girls for influence with the mighty. All the great and bad whose names tumble out of the newly released files –Noam Chomsky! – shrugged it off. Somehow, the grooming gangs of Rotherham cause more visceral disgust and outcry than exploitation of these equally vulnerable victims procured for the lusts of the wealthy.Labour forced into humble pie address over Mandelson disclosures | John CraceRead moreThe end for Starmer is nigh: that was signalled by the sheer nakedoutrage from Labour’s own side, not point-scoring but shocked to the core, not plotting but erupting right, left and centre of his party. Misjudgment has been the mounting charge against their leader, andhe gave a wretched display of it in the Commons with a fatal attempt to hold back some vital documents onMandelson’s vetting and appointment. Never mind that it was for sincere security reasons – mainly fear of what abuse of the US president the papers might contain – Starmer failed to measure the ferocity of the storm on his own benches, last-minute U-turning yet again. Vetting? We shall now see if this was no more than a “good chaps” chat, wherein the already installed ambassador’s notoriously unreliable word was taken by people who are now shocked (shocked!) that Mandelson lied and lied again: he was fascinating, yes, but he was never a good chap.Mandelson’s betrayalis beyond the comprehension of Starmer, his MPs and the rest of us. At the height of the bankers’ crash, a Labour business secretaryrushed to give away extremely sensitive market information to a foreign financier. At a time when the country was reeling from the subsequent recession and crying out for punishment of the perpetrators, Labour’s own business secretary sent a message via Epstein to JP Morgan’s hugely powerful CEO, Jamie Dimon, asking him to “mildly threaten” his own chancellor, sitting across the cabinet table, to stop him imposing tax on bankers’ bonuses. We don’t yet know if that was illegal, but it stinks of old-fashioned, send-him-to-the-Tower treachery and treason. Alas, that good chancellor,Alistair Darling, is no longer here to know who instigated a call from Dimon, but his memoir,Back from the Brink, records JP Morgan’s CEOcalling him, “very, very angry”, with a not-so-mild threat. “He said that his bank bought a lot of UK debt and he wondered if that was now such a good idea,” Darling wrote. The chancellor resisted intimidation andimposed a 50% supertaxon bank bonuses over £25k.This one episode risks justifying the wildest conspiracy theories zipping round the ether about the Bilderberg group, thenew world order, Freemasons, Davos and a thousand others. There is indeed an illuminati controlling money, governments, AI and everything. “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices,” wrote Adam Smith, in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations. His famous dictum is even truer now that such a tiny cabal of billionaires controls most of what the world needs, with no concern for what’s belowtheir flying palacescircling the globe.On the smaller matter of the survival of Britain’s prime minister, the question is only “how long?”. If the vetting papers reveal a near-wilful neglect of Mandelson’s best-pal relationship with Epstein as twin fixers and manipulators, MPs look ready to act fast. A spontaneous uprising would be the neatest end, forcing a resignation by sheer weight and breadth of MPs’ indignation, with no need for plots and challenges, orfor collecting 81 MPs willing to back a stand against him before they see the field. But never underestimate Labour’s ability to dither, to put faction before party, choosing inevitable failure over victory for the other wing. Losingthe Gorton and Denton byelectionon 26 February might be the trigger. Or they may wait for the expected wipeout in May in Scotland and Wales, plus English councils, so a new leader doesn’t take the blame.I still don’t understand the reason for this level of public dislike for a good and serious man, but it’s hard to find MPs who think Starmer can revive his own or his party’s fortunes. The cut-through over this affair is phenomenal in a population not over-bothered by the news: YouGov finds an astonishing95% of British adults knowabout the Mandelson/Epstein scandal. There is no escaping public disgust.This local scandal on our little island lifts the edge of the global carpet that hides the cockroaches of power. “Take back control” never sounded hollower. But the glimpse we saw of the real way of the world should spur us all on to shore up our own weak democracy. Look how easily, under Mandelsonian guidance, the likes ofPalantir is paid to rundeep into our defence and NHS systems. This affairshould have jolted out of complacency all those responsible for these contracts.Soon, anelections billwill arrive in the Commons that risks exposing the utter inadequacy of this government’s response to all the above. Good things include votes at 16 and easy ID at polling stations. But where is the great electoral reform to ensure never again a result like last time –34% of the vote winning 63% of seats? Where isLords reform? With three years still on the clock and a massive, if unearned, majority, it’s time for Labour to start all over again – this time with more humility and an understanding that the public is revolted by transactional politics conducted in ways they don’t understand. This time as an enterprise ready enough and competent enough to deliver real change.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of May elections join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much of a threat is Labour from both the Green party and Reform and whether Keir Starmer can survive as leader of the Labour party?Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonOpinionKeir StarmerJeffrey EpsteinLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

But as a dead medium, DVDs make a more abstract statement: a collection suggests an ongoing commitment to physical media – the film equivalent of a record collection – but DVDs have come and gone, superseded in quality and accessibility.Yet even with the world of streaming at our fingertips, if offered a DVD shelf we will happily peruse it like in Blockbuster stores of yore, whether it belongs to a friend, parent or a total stranger from Airbnb. The limitations of a finite collection offer more choice than an endless scroll. They’re recommended, not by an algorithm, but by the person who thought these films were worth keeping. Putting on a DVD, or a CD or LP, requires a physical action and stopping or changing it requires another – you have to commit to your choice.Do we need Imax? 70mm? VistaVision? All I need to watch movies at the cinema is darkness and quiet | Larry RyanRead moreIt might seem strange to lump DVDs and CDs in with other obsolete technologies, since these digital formats signalled the beginning of the end for physical media. They might not be welcome at its funeral, but they have their place in the pantheon of obsolete technologies; forgotten but not quite gone. And as many of us head to the final resting place of outdated tech (our parents’ houses), these dead technologies deserve their day in the sun.My affection for outdated technologies go well beyond media: the stovetop coffee maker, the old Sunbeam MixMaster and the phone simply used to make a call. As the world becomes more atomised there is comfort in the familiar. There’s also the inevitable, “they don’t make them like they used to” argument (and they don’t), but for me the appeal of older gadgets is all about tangibility. As the world is streamlined into integrated touchscreen devices, there is a joy to the clunky, tactile process of using technological unitaskers.There is satisfaction in pressing a button or cranking a dial that no touchscreen will ever replicate. There is also certainty; if I reach for my car’s temperature control, I know it will be there, without taking my eyes off the road to click through six sub-menus. If I want to watch a film, the DVD can’t disappear from my shelf without notice. And as neat as a Switch is, can it really compare to smacking a cartridge into a Nintendo 64 and grappling with the unwieldy three-pronged controller?View image in fullscreenGoldeneye 007 was a popular game in the 1990s used in the Nintendo 64 – or N64 – video game console.Photograph: Maurice Savage/AlamyBrian Eno wrote in his diary in 1995 that, “whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature …these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided”. In an era of frictionless digital experiences, it is friction itself that becomes precious. The act of loading a record on to a turntable, lowering the needle and being forced to listen all the way through, no matter how badly you want to skip. When you have to sit through a song you hate, you have to think about why you hate it, rather than just breezing by.That very difficulty is the point – we’ve made a world so seamless that to have to get up and flip a record or fiddle with a radio dial makes you into part of the process. A broken piece of analogue tech can usually be fixed with a tape, WD-40 or physical violence, but a dead digital gadget is beyond salvation.And for all its promises of frictionless-ness, the Screen Era has also invented its own unique frustrations. The pain of typing search terms into a smart TV with a remote, one agonising letter at a time. We have all the music available in the world, but it’s harder for new artists to break through. There are also far more serious concerns that replacing physical buttons with touchscreen in cars distracts drivers, andsome researchers estimatethat using a car’s touchscreen is more distracting than drink-driving.The landline may be having a renaissance – but it’s to a world in which the art of phone calls has changed | Paul DaleyRead moreIs older tech easier to use? No. Can the quality compare? Usually not. Is it reliable? No, but it’s unreliable in a predictable way – my mother’s 40-year-old soldering iron bravely solders on, provided it’s plugged into a dimmer switch to control the temperature.In our endlessly updated age, there is also a sense of rest that comes with obsolescence. There are no new Walkmans, or Game Boys or landline phones, so the ones that cling on haven’t changed. If you knew how to use it once, you know how to use it now.Sure, the friction of older technology is still friction – but at the heart of friction is interaction. There is victory in getting life out of a CD or button mashing your way to a Mario Kart triumph.It may take a physical action to crank the volume of your car stereo, but that action is satisfying as hell.Tansy Gardam is a writer, critic and podcasterExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionAustralian lifestyleCollectingBlu-rayFilm industryMusic streamingcommentShareReuse this content"

He died on 3 February 2026Fri 6 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 03.13 ESTShareDear reader, for the first time since I became a journalist, I have to tell you I wish you weren’t reading what I’ve written. Because if you’re reading this, it means I’m no longer in this world – or any other. I’ve died. Shit, it’s hard to write this, but that’s the way it is. I’ve died, and I don’t want to leave without saying goodbye and sharing a few final thoughts.I’ve been a very fortunate person. I was fortunate to have been born in a European country that, although still under the yoke of Franco’s regime, very soon afterwards began to progress economically, socially and politically. Luck, and it was only luck, made my destiny infinitely easier than that of hundreds of millions of children who are born in regions of the world ravaged by hunger, poverty and war.Even in this difficult moment I’m going through, I don’t think I have the right to complain or to moan about my lot. How can I play the victim knowing these historical inequalities and injustices? How can I lament my fate when we see what is happening even now, in Africa, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Yemen, Iran or in Palestine? I can’t say for sure, but I imagine that my last thought – the last image that passes through my mind before I shut down – will be of the children massacred in Gaza and of the surviving Palestinians who face a terrible future. What I do know is that I will leave this world without understanding why the international community chose to remain impassive while Israel perpetrated a genocide right before its eyes, broadcast live, minute by minute, massacre by massacre.View image in fullscreenCarlos Hernández de Miguel in 2015.Photograph: ChernandezdemiguelI decided to become a journalist because I truly believed that by reporting rigorously and honestly, we could improve this world. I still believe it now. I know that in my professional career I have made mistakes, I have put up with things (I hope only a few) that I should have rejected, and I have not, by any means, been a perfect journalist. Despite all that, I can look back and what I see doesn’t trouble me. I can say I have never, ever lied, manipulated, or concealed information. In all my reporting, whether from Madrid, Bilbao, Seville, Kabul, Jerusalem or Baghdad, I have tried to hold those in power to account, I have tried to relate what was happening, and I have tried to give a voice to those who lacked one. Voices for the victims; criticism for the perpetrators. No neutrality. No ambiguity. And that’s why I’m especially proud of not having risen as high as I could have. I was even fired for trying to remain true to my principles.I learned, from veteran colleagues, what I consider to be the two principles of journalism. The first is that objectivity is not the same as neutrality. If there is an aggressor and a victim, a liar and an honest person, a corrupt individual and an honourable one, then your task is to describe all that clearly and forcefully. I’m sick of those who believe that being a journalist means reporting both sides’ versions, without filters, without challenging their veracity, especially – and this is worse and all too common – when you know that one side isn’t telling the truth.The second principle is that to be a good journalist, it’s vital that you’re a good person.I always add a third. Journalism is not just another profession. Society’s right to be well informed rests on our work. Freedom, equality and democracy depend on our work – albeit not exclusively. So there are no excuses for lying or concealing information. If we do, we should be held professionally, and even criminally, responsible.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises in Gaza after an explosion, 7 July 2025.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersI’ve been fortunate to have experienced politics from both the inside and the outside. If there’s something I’ve learned, it’s that no, not all politicians are the same. There are men and women who truly believe their mission is to improve the quality of life of all citizens, regardless of whether those citizens voted for them.Obviously, there are also other politicians – far too many – who are driven by corruption and an insatiable thirst for power. We must fight against them, change countless things, and improve the entire system, but we must do so from within politics itself. We must do so because everything in life is politics or is conditioned by politics. So let us beware of those who attack politics, political parties, trade unions and democracy. The alternative to democracy is dictatorship, whatever the attractive euphemism some may use. The alternative to political parties and trade unions is a single-party system and a state-controlled union. There is much – so much – room for improvement, but the path is not the one the global far right is showing us.I have been fortunate to dedicate the last stage of my professional life to researching and disseminating the recent history ofSpain. Meeting survivors of Nazi and Francoist concentration camps, as well as their families, has been one of the greatest gifts that life has given me. The victims of nazism and other dictatorships never stopped repeating that fascism had not died, that it was still lurking, waiting for the moment to resurface. That is why it was, is and will be so important to be aware of history. Looking back is the best way to face the present, to avoid repeating mistakes and to be prepared for future threats. Looking back shows you that freedom, life and democracy are never guaranteed, and that we must fight every day to preserve them.I’ll finish now. A young, much-loved person, who was aware that her end could come at any moment, told me: “Life is a privilege.” At the time, I didn’t appreciate her words. But, dear reader: savour life, be happy, value what truly matters, flee from toxicity and show empathy … lots of empathy.I’d like to wrap up this article by saying that I’m going to be reunited with all the friends and family members I have lost over the years. I’d like to say it, but I don’t believe in any god. As I write these last lines, I am aware that all I have ahead of me is a fade to black. A fade to black that, paradoxically, is what gives meaning to our existence.I wish you all the best and hope you enjoy yourselves because, yes, life is a huge privilege.This article is an edited version of aposthumous columnwritten by the Spanish journalist and writer Carlos Hernández de Miguel and originally published in elDiario.es.

But its reflections on men in prison are valuableFri 6 Feb 2026 13.25 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 13.37 ESTShareDennis Kelly, the author of the BBC’s six-part drama Waiting for the Out – now on iPlayer, with its final episode to be broadcast on Saturday – told an interviewer thatfear is the secrethidden inside his latest series. The drama, about a man who takes a job teaching philosophy to a group of men in a prison, is based on Andy West’s memoir The Life Inside, which describes his real-life experiencesteaching in prisons.Visiting jails for his research, Kelly picked up echoes of the debilitating shame that marred his own youth and early adulthood.In his thirties, Kelly tackled his alcohol addiction, and began to write and recover. He is now the author of highly regarded TV series including Utopia and Pulling, and won a Tony award for his script for the smash-hit musical version of Roald Dahl’s Matilda.Waiting for the Outis far quieter in tone thanNetflix’s Adolescence,although it tackles similar themes of male anger and violence. The boy in the story is seen in flashback as the main character, Dan (played by Josh Finan), struggles with memories of growing up in the frightening shadow of his volatile, aggressive father. Kelly shows Dan trying to do something useful in the world, by supporting prisoners to think, while confronting his own buried demons at the same time – and becoming thoroughly confused in the process.Prison education is a highly unusual subject for television – and philosophy teacher Dan is an original character. While prisons are a regular topic for British documentary makers, original dramas are a rarity (although athird series of Time, set in a young offender institution, was recently confirmed). Waiting for the Out lacks the shock-factor of Adolescence – which depicts the murder of a teenage girl by a teenage boy, and its aftermath, from several angles.But it finds a different kind of power in its quietness. The scenes focused on Dan’s solitary struggles with his mental health are just as compelling as those involving his recovering-alcoholic brother, or inside the prison. And while drama scripts should not be confused with policy papers, there is food for thought here about the violence that results in so many men ending up incarcerated – and how their aggression is dealt with once they are sentenced. One point that Kelly makes with eloquence is the importance of supporting prisoners’ relationships with their children.The health and addiction issues that are common among men in the criminal justice system are referenced in the government’s recently launchedmen’s health strategy. So is the shocking fact thatsuicideis the leading cause of death in men under 50 – another topic touched on in Kelly’s drama. In politics and in society too, the sense is growing that there are challenges facing men and boys that require dedicated attention. In areport last year, the all-party parliamentary group on men and boys argued that schools should find ways to “address their unique needs without disempowering girls”.Waiting for the Out is fiction, not factual television. But in the themes it chooses, and its central character’s struggle with his identity as a man and as a son, it is a welcome contribution by the BBC to this period of reflection about masculinity. Strong recent dramas focused on women’s lives in Britain includeSally Wainwright’s Riot Women. Both kinds of stories are valuable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Accountability to victims must mean testimony abroad and scrutiny at home, not palace containment tacticsFri 6 Feb 2026 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 13.37 ESTShareWhen Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titleslast October, it was presented as a final act: a disgraced royal cut loose to protect the monarchy. TheEpstein filessuggest otherwise.Photographs and emailsreleased by US authorities place Mr Mountbatten-Windsor deep inside Epstein’s network of favours. And they reveal an intimacy that goes far beyond poor judgment by the former prince.This is no longer about salacious gossip or constitutional niceties, but about providing accountability to victims of sexual abuse. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor insists on hisinnocenceyet refuses to cooperate with investigators. The USCongresscontinues to pursue Epstein’s connections. In Britain, parliament still averts its gaze. This looks untenable.The details are jaw-dropping. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor engaged with Epstein’s offer of a “friend” for dinner, described as“26, Russian, beautiful, trustworthy”, despite the financier’s conviction forsoliciting prostitution from a minor. He ispicturedon all fours, looming over a woman lying on the floor. Other emails imply that the king’s brother proposedBuckingham Palaceas a discreet meeting place with Epstein. He appeared to ask the financier how to dodge personalinvestment restrictions. As UK trade envoy, he apparentlylobbiedforeign states on Epstein’s behalf.The former prince’s claim that he broke with Epstein in December 2010 collapsed last year. Fresh emails now suggest that warm, regular exchanges followed. Such confidence in asserting a provable falsehood only makes sense if Mr Mountbatten-Windsor believed himself untouchable. The allegation that he sexually assaultedVirginia Giuffrewhen she was 17 was denied, but resolved through a reported£12m settlementwithout any admission of guilt. Now a second alleged victim has told theBBCshe was flown to Britain by Epstein to provide sexual services to Mr Mountbatten-Windsor at Royal Lodge in 2010. Legalrecordsalso cite an exotic dancer who says she was pressured into sex acts involving both men in 2006. He denies any wrongdoing.These files expose an influential elite that believed itself beyond the law. That is why they matter politically. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor should testify to theHouse of Representativesoversight committee. His apparent closeness to Epstein after his conviction means he could help identify accomplices and institutional failures. Does Mr Mountbatten-Windsor not want to help Epstein’s victims?Publicangeris brewing against the monarchy – a keystone of a political order in urgent need of radical reconstruction, along with the electoral system and the upper house. It would seem absurd for theprime ministerto ask Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to give evidence to US lawmakers, but not to MPs. The monarchy is not accountable to parliament. Commons rules bar “reflections” on the royals, rendering meaningful debate taboo. In 2011David Cameronrelinquished MPs’ oldest check on royal power: control of the purse. His government replaced annual scrutiny of palace finances with an automatic transfer of crown estate revenues.The royal family’s defenders claim that they were once the country’smoral anchor. That was rarely, if ever, true. But the Epstein files reveal where entitlement without restraint, and privilege without responsibility, can lead. Parliament could act toreintroduce accountability and demand transparencyof royal activity if it chose to. It should not take Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s failings to see that deference is a choice; impunity is its consequence.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our mother lived with vascular dementia for many years, but she wasn’t “dead” or “as good as dead”. Far too many people believe this, even people whose loved ones have had dementia, and it’s a dangerous belief that undermines the rights of people who are already extremely vulnerable.Mum was alive and herself right to the end, even when she had become bedbound and crippled, even when somebody who could once have chatted for England barely spoke any more. But in those last few years, when she could no longer read for herself, Dad or I (or my brothers when they visited) read to her every day, and even when she didn’t say much, I could tell by the expression on her face whether she was enjoying it or not.We read to her even in her last four days after she’d been taken to hospital when she’d choked (vascular dementia can cause dysphagia, trouble with swallowing as well as speech) and had a heart attack, and never spoke again, and even then we could still tell what she was enjoying and what she wasn’t.In the hospital, as we had done at home, we even managed to play her some music, even though the overworked but wonderful hospital staff couldn’t get a separate room for her. And once the staff had got her painkilling medication right, she stayed peaceful right to the end. People with dementia are still people, and they deserve to be treated as people, not as some kind of zombies.Rowan AdamsDilwyn, HerefordshireJo Glanville’s insights on her parent’s enduring love of stories deep into dementia truly resonated. After his 2017 Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia diagnosis, Dad’s lifelong love of reading seemingly ceased. Instead of accepting it, I thought it would make a difference to change the format rather than the activity. I began to write short, illustrated rhyming books with optional audio with music. Exercises, based on cognitive stimulation therapy, were added to stimulate conversation.Working with Alzheimer’s Society, unlike Glanville’s experience of shared reading, we found that people with mild to moderate dementia could still read independently, while others could enjoy stories with a partner, in groups or through audio. The results have been extraordinary. We’ve helped thousands. My father might not be able to remember breakfast, but he can recite from memory passages about the Beatles or the 1966 World Cup. And when he does, I get to tell him “I wrote that” and watch the joy and pride on his face once again.Matt SingletonGerontologist and director, Cognitive BooksJo Glanville’s sensitive piece about the power of reading to her parents, who both had forms of dementia, reminded me of the small success I had through music during lockdown, with my sister who had Alzheimer’s. As three sisters growing up, our party piece was the song Sisters, sung by the Beverley Sisters. So on FaceTime with my sister in her nursing home, I would play our song and sing along, and she, whose memory had been shot to pieces, amazingly joined in, smiling and being released for a short while from her illness. Just wonderful.Catherine RoomeStaplehurst, KentWhat an interesting piece about the hidden thoughts and perceptions of people with dementia. When my mother was in the last stages of dementia, we both enjoyed looking through a book of photographs of Victorian children. She had been a teacher. And she liked getting letters. She had been a lifelong letter writer. Jo Glanville is right: people like this are not “dead”. The proponents of “assisted dying” deny that their bill is the thin end of the wedge – but we clearly see the wedge in the hands of the novelist Ian McEwan, who, as Glanville says, has advocated for itsextensionto people with dementia.Jane LindenDarsham, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For some women, it’s not just wanting to scream into a pillow every now and again, it’s feeling suicidal every day, having intrusive thoughts of harming yourself or your child, fearing sleeping in case they die in their cot and it’s your fault, or not leaving the house because you simply cannot put one foot in front of the other.Following the traumatic birth of my first child and a neonatal intensive care unit stay, I developed post-traumatic stress disorder and other complex mental health issues that still plague me. AccessingNHSperinatal mental health care was nigh on impossible, and it stops when your baby turns one.The NHS often farms you out to third-party providers, who will then “triage” you from the minimal notes from your 10-minute GP consultation, which can either get lost in the system or so delayed that you give up chasing them because you’re so depressed, alongside trying to keep another human alive, that it feels impossible. It is a stain on our country that from prenatal to postnatal care, we seem to fail women at every point of their motherhood journey.We owe women greater awareness of the full extent of birth, motherhood and everything in between, that extends beyond meaningless expressions such as “motherhood is like going to the moon”, so we can equip ourselves, our partners, the NHS and wider government policy as a whole.Name and address suppliedI do not seek to discount other women’s experiences of motherhood. But there seems to be precious little balance in what you publish from those of us who found it the best and most fulfilling and worthwhile thing we ever did. When I had my first child in 1990, I felt profoundly angry with my teachers from the 1970s who continually told us that we didn’t want to be “just” a wife and mother. Many women don’t. But many do. Please stop giving the unrelenting impression that being a mother is difficult and a challenge to be endured. For some women it is, but for many like me, we embrace it and love it.Fiona BerryMarket Rasen, LincolnshireIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted onfreephone116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Lessons are carefully planned and delivered using a screen as a tool, by a teacher, just like they were delivered using a blackboard before screens were a “thing”.The use of this technology saves time to teach more efficiently, with the added benefit that video clips, photographs and sounds can be used to enrich children’s education and experiences. Children are encouraged to contribute orally in the majority of lessons, particularly in those schools that are taking part in theVoice 21oracy programme, which embeds oracy throughout the curriculum.Hands-on exploration occurs during science, art, IT, history and geography, as well as subjects like maths, where children are taught using a variety of manipulatives.Then there is theOpal(outdoor play and learning) programme, which is becoming more widespread, giving children access to exciting and varied child-initiated play opportunities to replace those that society and parents have gradually taken away from them. This gives children agency to collaborate, solve problems, manage risk and create, in play that is freely chosen and intrinsically motivated.Some schools offer forest school, which is play-based learning with minimal resources in a natural, outdoor setting, enabling children to use their imaginations as well as learn practical skills and use tools.Children are valued as part of the school community and put at the heart ofeverythingthat a school does. There are things wrong with the education system, but screens, and the staff who nurture our children, are not among them.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The projects include an upgrade to a detector on the Large Hadron Collider at Cern near Geneva, and an electron-ion collider under development with researchers in the US.While the cost overruns are driven by facilities, the cuts are landing on physics grants as the science funding body UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) seeks to “do fewer things better” and prioritise applied research over more fundamental science.Menstrual blood test could offer alternative to cervical screening for cancerRead moreIn anopen letterto Prof Ian Chapman, the chief executive of UKRI, more than 500 researchers write: “The present combination of uncertainty, delay and re-prioritisation in early career pathways risks the loss of a generation from the UK research and industrial ecosystem.”Dr Simon Williams, a 29-year-old postdoc at Durham University, studies quantum computing applications in theoretical physics and is looking for a second postdoc position. “The only options I’ve realistically had are overseas,” he said. “As things stand, it is increasingly likely that I will take up a position in Germany rather than remain in the UK. There are simply far more viable and stable opportunities abroad.”Dr Claire Rigouzzo, a 26-year-old researcher at King’s College London, has accepted a post in Europe after finding nothing in the UK. Early career scientists faced one of the harshest job markets in years, she said, but the knock-on effects were broader. Senior academics were worried because they cannot attract the best researchers, she said. “Even students can sense that science is no longer a priority,” she added. “Morale is extremely low across the board.”UKRI has nearly £9bn to distribute through research councils this year, covering physical sciences and engineering, biological sciences and medical research. The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) funds physics research as well as major facilities such as the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.The STFC needs to make £162m in savings by 2030 after seeing electricity costs spiral at its national facilities and subscriptions to international projects such as Cern and the European Space Agency rise with foreign exchange rates. The funder also committed to projects it can no longer afford.Another King’s researcher, Dr Lucien Heurtier, 37, will come to the end of his contract in September and has started looking for jobs in China. “It is clear that no UK university will want to open lecturer positions in curiosity-driven research if such lecturers would not be able to attract much national funding,” he said. “My wife and daughter will have to follow.”View image in fullscreenThe Rubin observatory in Chile.Photograph: Javier Torres/AFP/Getty ImagesThe loss of grants means the UK faces a situation where it has spent hefty sums on overseas projects such as the groundbreaking Rubin Observatory in Chile, which will swing into action this year, but could have no UK astronomers to work on it. “The timing of these proposed cuts, just as the telescopes start to deliver, could not be worse,” said Prof Catherine Heymans, Scotland’s astronomer royal.Prof Mike Lockwood, the president of the Royal Astronomical Society, urged the government to step in to prevent a “catastrophe” in science. “You lose a whole generation,” he said. “The facilities side is overcommitted and it’s young researchers that are taking the brunt of that. As a nation, we can’t afford for that to happen.”Speaking to reporters, Chapman defended the moves. “When you make choices there will be some things that miss out, but when you don’t make choices, everybody misses out because you choke everybody and nothing then can be internationally competitive because it’s all underfunded,” he said.Explore more on these topicsScienceScience funding crisisPhysicsResearch fundingResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

His mother [Nicole Smith] and I are devastated,” the statement said.Lil Jon described his son as an “amazingly talented young man” who was a music producer, artist, engineer and New York University graduate.“Thank you for all of the prayers and support in trying to locate him over the last several days. Thank you to the entire Milton police department involved,” the Snap Yo Fingers rapper added.Nathan Smith, known professionally as DJ Young Slade, left his home in Milton “under unusual circumstances” early on Tuesday morning, police said.“Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet,” Lil Jon’s statement reads. “He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted – he loved his family and the friends in his life to the fullest.”Smith, 27, “ran out of his house and has been missing since”, police said on a missing person poster they circulated on social media.He “left on foot and does not possess a phone”, police said. “He may be disoriented and in need of assistance. Family and friends are concerned for his safety.”Milton police immediately began searching for Smith, police said. After being unable to locate him, police and other agencies expanded the search to include a pond near Smith’s residence. Shortly before noon Friday, Cherokee county fire department divers found a body in the pond.“The individual is believed to be Nathan Smith, pending official confirmation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office,” police said in a statement. The medical examiner did not immediately respond to inquiries about the case on Friday.“Based on the investigation to date, there is no indication of foul play,” police said. “However, the Milton Police Department Criminal Investigations Division will continue to treat this as an open and active investigation.”Police said no further details would be released until the cause and manner of death were determined by the medical examiner.Milton is a suburban town about 30 miles (48km) north of Atlanta.Lil Jon, born Jonathan Smith, is an Atlanta rapper and producer who was a central figure in the crunk subgenre of hip-hop.

But for patients with suspected cancer it is particularly dangerous [as] each month’s delay to starting cancer treatment can increase the risk of death by around 10%.”He blamed the hiring bans onthe “reset” of the NHS’s financesthat the chief executive of NHS England, Sir Jim Mackey, ordered last spring to tackle a looming £6.6bn overspend in 2025-26. That forced all NHS trusts to make substantial savings.Most of the freezes uncovered by an RCR workforce census were imposed on units inEngland.“In England, NHS finances are under particular pressure following efforts to rein in spending, and that has led many trusts to look for rapid savings, including by restricting recruitment. But shortsighted recruitment freezes don’t save money in the long term,” Harden added.The RCR’s disclosures follows the launch this week of the government’splan to improve cancer care in England. It includesproposals to increase the number of cancer doctorsin rural and coastal parts of England, which often struggle to recruit enough specialists in the disease.Smaller cancer centres and radiology departments in the UK, which mainly serve rural communities, were much more likely than bigger ones to be banned from hiring doctors, the RCR found.Across the UK 60% of cancer centres in rural or deprived areas experienced a recruitment freeze, compared with 48% in urban and better-off areas.In 2023 Cancer Research UK (CRUK)estimatedthat the NHS in England would need to hire 16,000 more staff to work in cancer services by 2029 to ensure they keep up with rising demand, including 8,300 diagnostic radiographers, 4,600 radiologists and 790 medical and clinical oncologists.Underthe new planfor England the workforce tackling the disease will grow over the next few years, with “higher numbers of staff in professional groups integral to cancer care”.The plan also stressed that technology would play a key role in making cancer professionals more productive and their working lives easier. It proposes that “AI will be the assistant in the pockets of the oncology workforce, supporting better treatment planning and cutting down admin to create more ‘time to care’.”Harden said that unless the problem was addressed, persistent understaffing of cancer units would undermine Wes Streeting’s aim to improve early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.“It’s encouraging to see the government set out ambitious plans to improve cancer care in the new NationalCancerPlan for England,” he said. “But hiring bans in radiology departments and cancer centres sit in clear tension with commitments to diagnose cancer earlier and treat it faster, and they need to end.“With cancer diagnoses expected to rise in the coming years, the NHS will need these highly skilled clinicians more than ever.”The importance of tackling cancer means that “radiology departments and cancer centres should not be subject to recruitment freezes. The UK needs almost 2,000 more radiologists and nearly 200 more clinical oncologists just to meet current demand,” he added.The RCR found that hiring bans contributed to the NHS across the UK spending a record £325m in 2024 on locums to help plug rota gaps and on private firms – some based abroad – to analyse scans when NHS radiology departments did not have the capacity to do so.Menstrual blood test could offer alternative to cervical screening for cancerRead moreCRUK backed the RCR’s call for cancer services to be fully staffed. Holly Norman, the charity’s head of health systems engagement, said: “Radiologists and oncologists are vital for ensuring people affected by cancer are diagnosed and treated quickly. With more people in England being diagnosed with cancer every year, it’s essential that the forthcoming 10-year workforce plan lays out steps to ensure our health service is able to train and recruit enough of these and other specialist staff to meet rising demand.“The UK government has set out welcome ambitions this week to improve early diagnosis and to improve cancer waiting times, but these promises will only be met if the NHS is properly resourced with enough staff and equipment.”NHS England did not respond directly to the findings. A spokesperson said only: “Having grown both radiology and oncology workforces by around 5% in 2024, the NHS will transform cancer care through our new national cancer plan, rolling out new specialist training places in underserved areas and designing new care models around people’s lives.“NHS England is rightly supporting local systems in financial deficit to live within their means and continue improving productivity, to help the NHS treat more people for cancer than ever while delivering value for taxpayers.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian intelligence agencies have targeted dozens of Russian military officers and Russian-installed officials since the start of the war, accusing them of involvement in war crimes.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called the shooting a “terrorist attack”, claiming without evidence it was intended to derail talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US to end the war. “This terrorist attack once again confirmed the Zelenskyy regime’s focus on constant provocations, aimed in turn at derailing the negotiation process,” Lavrov said in Moscow.The Ukrainian-born Alekseyev is a deputy director of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, a unit in the defence ministry known for organising covert operations abroad, including assassinations, sabotage and espionage.He was one of the top officers providing Vladimir Putin with intelligence for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.He has also been widely described as a major figure overseeing the country’s private military companies and was among the senior officials dispatched to negotiate with Yevgeny Prigozhin during theWagner group’s brief mutinyin the summer of 2023.After Prigozhin’s revolt, Alekseyev was widely believed to have fallen out of favour in Moscow and was reported to have been briefly detained over his links to Wagner, yet he ultimately retained his post.s.Alekseyev is under sanctions from Washington for his alleged involvement in efforts to interfere in the 2020 US presidential election. The UK also placed sanctions on him over thedeadly 2018 novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.View image in fullscreenA police vehicle in Moscow near the scene of the shooting.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockWithout explicitly claiming responsibility, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, wrote on X that if Alekseyev survived the attack, he would “never sleep peacefully again”.“No war criminal who has killed and tortured Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, destroyed Ukrainian cities, abducted Ukrainian children, or committed other crimes against the Ukrainian people will ever feel safe,” Prokopenko added.The timing of the shooting was striking, coming a day after Russian and Ukrainian delegations – including Alekseyev’s direct superior, Igor Kostyukov –met in Abu Dhabi, where both sides spoke of apparent progress in the peace talks.Previous peace efforts have broken down over Russia’s maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine, with Moscow repeatedly rejecting Kyiv’s calls for an immediate ceasefire.Ukraine has targeted at least three Russian generals in the Moscow region over the past year, though such operations have typically involved explosives.View image in fullscreenA citizen walks past the residential building in Moscow where the shooting took place.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockLittle is publicly known about the clandestine networks believed to be behind assassinations and attacks on military infrastructure inside Russia and in Russian-controlled territories.Alekseyev’s shooting will be seen as the latest failure of Russia’s security services to protect senior military personnel deep inside the country. While details of who carried out the attack and how it was organised remain unclear, Russian military bloggers have criticised apparent security lapses, questioning how a gunman was able to enter the apartment building undetected.Andrei Soldatov, an independent expert on Russia’s security services, called the attack “incredible sloppiness”. “One would have expected them to scale up protection for top military brass,” he wrote on social media.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is not just fruit and veg, with a “massive” increase in sales of organic meat. Organic chicken was up 13% year on year, despite costing three times as much as other birds.Riverford sales rise 6% as UK organics market enjoys biggest boom in two decadesRead more“People are still concerned about the cost of living but health is also really important, and for the last two years organic has been outperforming non-organic,” said Clare Hadway-Ball, the senior commercial manager at the Soil Association.“Organic poultry is about three times more expensive but it’s in massive growth,” she said. Sales of organic birds are up 15% by value and 13% by volume year on year. For salmon it is 21% and 18% respectively. “People are still buying them.”View image in fullscreenOrganic chicken sales are up 13% year on year, despite costing three times as much as other birds.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe UK organic food and drink market grew nearly 8% in the year to 27 September 2025, according to Soil Association figures. The growth was not just down to price hikes, with volume of sales up 2.5%, which is five times the rate of the overall market.While empty nesters and retired people are still the biggest spenders, in a sign of its broadening appeal, it is middle-income families that buy the most often. “Although they do not spend the most they are buying essentials, such as fruit and veg, tinned goods and staples like pasta and rice,” said Hadway-Ball.Earlier this week Rob Haward, the Riverford chief executive, told the Guardian he had “not seen the market grow as much as this for 20 years” as it reported a 6% bump in annual sales. The rapid growth seen in 2024 had continued in 2025, amid greater awareness of healthy diets and increased concern about “where you can go to get food you can trust”.View image in fullscreenRob Haward, Riverford’s chief executive, says he has ‘not seen the market grow as much as this for 20 years’.Photograph: RiverfordDuring the financial crisis, “retailers just lost confidence and delisted products”, Hadway-Ball said of2009’s 13% drop in sales. With two-thirds of organic food and drink sold by the big supermarkets, their backing is vital to its success.There is no sign of that mindset today. Tesco recently revamped its organic own-label range of more than 100 products. Tesco’s John Constantinou, whose responsibilities include the organic label, said being able to find “quality, great‑tasting organic food really matters” to its customers.Waitrose has invested heavily in the expansion and relaunch of its Duchy organic brand, which runs to 250 products. Hannah McDonald, the retailer’s own-brand manager, said that during 2025, sales of organic food increased in both value and volume terms. The year to 31 January delivered big volume increases in this area, including berries and bananas up by 15% and eggs 9%.An issue for many households is that organic food just costs too much. “Organic food costs more to produce generally so it costs more for the consumer,” said Hadway-Ball. The premium charged varies a lot, but the recent inclusion of organic foods in Clubcard and Nectar promotions means it is sometimes possible to buy everyday items such as butter, carrots and apples for the same price.Analysts also point to gen Z’s enthusiasm for organic food. A recent poll found 42% of 18- to 24-year-olds buy organic at least once a month. That makes them 92% more likely to buy organic fruit and veg than millennials.“One in three households are concerned about ultra-processed foods and moving to cleaner products,” said Tor Crockatt, the head of marketing at yoghurt-maker Yeo Valley. With a turnover of £230m the company has benefited from a40% increase in demand for natural and Greek yoghurtsin the last three years as customers go back to basicsto avoid processed food.“Gen Z are particularly interested in organic and making sustainable choices,” said Crockatt. “They have been brought up in an era where they have heard a lot about the health of people and the planet, and the impact we are having. There’s a lot of scepticism from consumers [about the food industry] so it feels like now is the time for organic to shine.”Explore more on these topicsOrganicsFood & drink industryRetail industryFoodEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Analysts say the oil-rich country’selectric vehicle boomis the result of high carbon taxes, generous EV subsidies and the lack of a powerful lobby to oppose the transition.The secretary general of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, Christina Bu, said the data for 2025 “certainly doesn’t mean the job is over”.“Two out of three people still drive fossil-fuel cars,” she told the Norwegian public broadcaster, NRK. “If they are to have the opportunity to choose electric cars, we must be just as ambitious in 2026.”There are signs that the shift away from vehicles that burn fossil fuels has also trickled into Norway’s secondhand car market. Sales of used electric cars increased by 22.7% compared with January last year, according to the OFV, with electric vehicles making up one in four cars on the used-car market.“Electrification is now clearly taking hold in the used car market as well,” said Stokke. “This makes the electric car a more accessible alternative for far more buyers than before.”Norway has long led the uptake of electric vehicles, but other countries are gaining pace. Denmark has witnessed explosive growth, with BEV sales soaring from 2% to 68% in the last decade. BEV market share has also surpassed 33% in the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium and Sweden.Small and wealthy northern nations have led Europe’s transition to cleaner transport, but they are being joined by populous emerging markets such as China and India. Data published last month shows that Turkey has alsocaught upwith the EU in its adoption rate for BEVs, and in absolute terms its electric market is bigger than Norway’s.China’s sales of electric cars, including hybrids, have surpassed those of internal combustion engine cars.Explore more on these topicsNorwayAutomotive industryGreenhouse gas emissionsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The results come froma studythat looked at air pollution experienced by primary schoolchildren in Wales.Fifty-three children from two primary schools in Anglesey (Ynys Môn) were given backpacks equipped with air pollution sensors. They took the packs home and carried them during their journeys to and from school.Dr Hanbin Zhang, from the University of Exeter and part of the study team, said: “One thing that stood out was the home environment. This was the largest contributor to children’s daily particle pollution​ exposure – more than school or commuting. This was mainly due to indoor sources such as wood burning and indoor smoking.”Short peaks in particle pollution were linked to home cooking and secondhand tobacco smoke. Home heating with a fire or stove was linked to longer exposures. In some cases, these persisted overnight in children’s bedrooms as fires remained lit or smouldering with poor ventilation.Prof Zhiwen Luofrom Cardiff University, who led the study said: “During home hours, the average particle pollution in non-smoking homes with wood burners was about 13 micrograms per cubic metre compared with 3.5 micrograms per cubic metre in non-smoking homes without wood burners.“The study is small, but the contrast was consistent and supports the conclusion that wood burning can substantially increase indoor particle pollution.”One school was in Holyhead, and the other was in a rural area. We often think of towns and cities are being the most polluted places, but on average, researchers found urban children experienced less particle pollution, compared with those at the rural school.The study took place in winter, and researchers attributed these differences to contrasts in wood burning. This took place in 21% of homes for the urban schoolchildren and 53% in the rural school.Arecent study in New Zealandpointed out the asthma risk for children in wood-burning homes. A previousstudyof 50,000 US women also considered the risks from burning wood at home. They found that the women who used a stove or fireplace at home had a43% increased risk of lung cancer. The women were studied for an average of 11 years and the extra risk was seen in tobacco smokers and those who had never smoked.Working with the children was an important part of the Anglesey study.Dr Shuangyu Weifrom Cardiff University, who was also involved in the study, said: “Children were helped to understand their own data, which prompted conversations and, in some cases, behaviour change. Schools told us that parents began discussing the results spontaneously and trying to work out what might be causing pollution inside their homes.”Cooking added to the measured air pollution, especially when the backpacks were left close to the kitchen in the children’s homes. Short pollution peaks were also measured when children walkedpast bakeries and restaurantson the high street.Particle pollutioninside the schoolswas much lower than during travel and at home.Children who walked to and from school experienced less pollution compared with children who were driven.Parental smoking while drivingproduced the highest concentrations measured in the study.The UK government isconsultingonhealth warnings for new stoves and solid fuels.This article was amended on 6 February 2026 to clarify that the study of 50,000 US women related to the use of fireplaces or wood stoves. An earlier version had said it related to the use of wood burners.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPollutionwatchPollutionChildrenWalesHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Grazalema, in southern Spain, more than 700mm of rain has fallen since Wednesday, roughly equivalent to the country’s average annual rainfall.Across Andalucía, about 3,500 people have been evacuated, with roads and schools closed, and transport networks disrupted. Spain’s state meteorological agency, Aemet, issued its highest red alert for heavy rainfall in Cádiz and parts of Málaga, where around 150mm was recorded in only 12 hours on Thursday.1:25Storm Leonardo devastates southern Portugal and Spain – videoIn Málaga province, a girl has been reported missing after being swept away by the Turvilla river, with emergency services continuing search efforts.Portugal, still recovering from Storm Kristin, which killed at least five people last week, has also been badly affected. Fresh downpours have triggered flooding, landslides and falling trees, forcing more than 200 people to evacuate. On Wednesday, another death was reported in the southern Alentejo region after a man’s car was washed away by flood waters.The storm’s effects extend beyondEurope. In northern Morocco, flash floods caused by overflowing rivers and reservoirs have forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate, with the city of Ksar El-Kebir in the Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region among the worst-affected.The extreme rainfall is being driven by an unusually southward-shifted jet stream, allowing Leonardo to intensify and stall over the region. The storm has also merged with an “atmospheric river” carrying tropical moisture from the Caribbean, continually replenishing the rainfall. With soils already saturated and rivers swollen after weeks of wet weather, the risk of further flooding and landslides remains high, particularly in southern Spain.Leonardo is expected to linger near the north-west of the Iberian peninsula into early next week, bringing continued unsettled conditions. Northern and central Portugal could receive an additional 150-250mm of rain by the end of the week.Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Penha developed from an area of low pressure over the Philippine Sea late on Tuesday and tracked westwards towards Mindanao. By Thursday, the system was producing wind gusts of up to 45mph before making landfall in Surigao del Sur on Thursday.Storm surges of up to two metres are expected across coastal areas, and warnings for heavy rainfall have been issued farther inland, with 200-300mm of rain expected within 24 hours. Sustained winds of 38-55mph are forecast, increasing the risk of damage to buildings and vegetation. After landfall, Penha is expected to weaken as it moves across northern Mindanao and Negros island, before dissipating near Palawan island.Explore more on these topicsEuropeWeather trackerAfricaExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

Her father described her as having been a happy, loving child. She spent hours on the phone to her best friend, she was studying for her A-levels, she had a part-time job and loved to go out dancing,” he said.“For reasons only you know, and most people will never start to comprehend, you snatched Victoria away and you crushed her young life.”View image in fullscreenVictoria Hall was abducted by Steve Wright just 300 metres from her home.Photograph: Suffolk constabulary/PAWright had been due to go on trial at the Old Bailey for her murder and the attempt to kidnap Doherty, but changed his plea at the last minute this week. It is the sixth murder for which he has been convicted – but the first to which he has admitted.On Friday, the prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC outlined the facts of the case as Wright appeared for sentencing. She said Wright had been “on the prowl” in Felixstowe,Suffolk, on the weekend of 18 and 19 September 1999 in his burgundy Ford Granada Scorpio.“Almost undoubtedly sexually motivated, he was a predator stalking for his prey: looking for a young woman to kidnap,” she said.In the early hours of 18 September, Doherty had become separated from her friends. Ledward said Wright made a mistake and allowed her to see him from several yards away.Her “instincts” alerted her to the danger and she escaped unharmed by running, hiding and frantically knocking on the door of a couple, who by “great good fortune” answered and “probably saved her life”.Doherty’s description of her attacker’s car later led police to identify 56 vehicles, with Wright’s among them.Wright struck again the next night. “He did not allow Victoria Hall, aged 17, to escape his predatory clutches,” Ledward said. “Having separated from her best friend, Gemma Algar, only 300 metres from her front door, she never made it home and seemingly vanished; the only clue to what happened to her, a scream in the night on the small housing estate where she lived in the village of Trimley St Mary – not 2 miles from where the defendant made his attempt on Emily Doherty.“But Victoria had not simply vanished into thin air. The defendant had abducted and, within a very short time, murdered her – as well as sexually violating her in some way.”He then “callously discarded her body, stripped naked of everything except for her jewellery”, in a farm ditch 25 miles away, “as if she were no more important than a disposable commodity”, the court was told.Before or after, Wright headed to a petrol station and, the following day, returned to his work at the Felixstowe docks “as if nothing had happened”, the prosecutor said. Ledward said the way Hall was left caused “untold” distress to her family, including for her mother who died before Wright was brought to justice.The night Hall was murdered, she and Algar had walked most of the roughly 2 miles back to their homes from the Bandbox nightclub in Felixstowe, singing and sharing a bag of chips as they went. At about 2.20am, they parted, with Victoria saying: “I’ll ring you when I get up tomorrow.” Algar replied: “You’ll hear me saying ‘ouch’ as I walk home.”Algar later heard “two female high-pitched screams” as Victoria was snatched by Wright and bundled into his car.In 2001, Wright was charged with a series of thefts, which he admitted, and his conviction led to his DNA being added to the national database, eventually leading to his identification as a suspect.Five years after Victoria’s murder, on 30 October 2006, Tania Nicol, 19, vanished from Ipswich’s red light area, followed by Gemma Adams, 25, around two weeks later. In December, the body of Anneli Alderton, 24, was found in woods at Nacton, and sex workers were urged to stay off the streets. But the bodies of Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29, were later discovered.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Anneli Alderton, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls.Photograph: Suffolk constabulary/PAWright was eventually sentenced for those five murders in 2008.

He was arrested last July after eight children and one adult fell ill at the camp.Ruben used the dark web to buy what he thought was temazepam to sedate his victims, the court heard. But one of the victims tested positive for liquid Xanax, the prosecution said. Ruben took Viagra to assist in his offending, the court heard.Susan Ruben told the court she felt “completely betrayed” by her husband. She said: “He spent decades trying to paint a picture that he was a righteous, honourable man, when he was actually a sadistic, monstrous paedophile.”Ruben was a member of the church council at St Peter’s in Ruddington where he worked as a volunteer with young people.After Ruben’s guilty plea in November, Paul Williams, the bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, said he was “profoundly shocked”. He said in a statement: “The abuse of trust and harm to the vulnerable is horrific in any setting, but it is especially shocking when it happens in a context that should have been safe and nurturing.”Janine McKinney, the chief crown prosecutor for the East Midlands, said: “Jon Ruben posed as a leader in his faith community and a dedicated Christian volunteer. The reality was that under the respectable veneer was a relentless predator, using the positions he had secured for himself to gain access to children.”Temporary DCI Neil Holden, from Leicestershire police, said: “Our ongoing investigation continues to focus on Ruben’s background and making contact with the schools, agencies and organisations we know he has been involved in to provide help, advice and support, and to investigate any further information which we receive.”A statement read outside court by the victims’ families said: “Jon Ruben portrayed himself as a good Christian man and someone who we could trust to be in charge of the care of our children. Our children themselves admired and respected Jon, but what we have found out is that Jon is a devious child sexual predator.“There are no words to describe how much Jon’s actions anger us and horrify us. He took away our children’s right to be children, to be safe and protected.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeLeicestershireNottinghamshireEnglandShareReuse this content"

They gave the two governments 60 days to respond and on Friday published their letter.It contains detailed case studies documenting the treatment of people placed in detention in preparation for being forcibly removed to France under the scheme. They include asylum seekers from Sudan, Gaza, Eritrea, Yemen and Iran, many of whom are survivors of torture and trafficking.The experts said the detention of torture survivors for the scheme “may in itself amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment”, similarly raising concerns that there is a failure to protect people who are suicidal.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron agreed the deal last July.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThe concerns expressed by the UN experts echo those raised by asylum seekers themselves.The Guardian previously revealedthat one man who was returned to France came back to the UK due to fear of smugglers, while those detained issued aseries of reportsabout their treatment in detention and staged a peaceful protest against the scheme while detained, which was responded to by Home Office contractors withriot shields, teargas and dogs.According to the letter, a man from Eritrea was not allowed to wear shoes for his removal, had a hood placed over his head and was forced to the ground with guards’ boots placed on his neck. A woman from Yemen, who said she had been enslaved since the age of three, was told by the Home Office that her account was not credible because she had not immediately disclosed her trafficking history on arrival in the UK.One of the case studies quoted was a man from Gaza who lost his family in Israeli shelling. A family member he escaped with was shot by smugglers who took pictures of all the people in the group and threatened them that if they informed anyone of the death or if they were ever seen back in France they would be killed.The letter states: “We are deeply concerned that the agreement between the [UK and France] … may result in serious violations of international human rights law,” saying they had received information concerning human rights violations of “children and those in vulnerable situations”.The letter poses a series of questions to the two governments relating to unpublished information about the scheme, such as the apparently arbitrary nature of who among small boat arrivals is selected for detention and forced to return to France and who is allowed to have their asylum claims processed in the UK.The experts also ask about protection from onward refoulement once people are sent back to France. The letter says: “We therefore respectfully call [the UK] government to end this agreement with France and ensure that migration governance measures respect, protect and fulfil human rights and not create new situations of vulnerability or exacerbate existing ones.”Home Office says nearly 60,000 people deported from UK or left voluntarily since 2024 electionRead moreBella Mosselmans, the director of the Global Strategic Litigation Council for refugee rights, backed the UN experts’ call for the scheme to be scrapped. She said: “People directly affected by these policies have stood up for themselves, speaking out about the fear, detention and harm they have endured.“The UN has now echoed those lived experiences with a clear and urgent alarm. These UN experts have documented detailed, credible cases showing that this agreement exposes people to serious human rights violations – including threats to life, torture and other ill-treatment, and the denial of due process. Continuing to implement it despite those warnings is indefensible.“We are already aware of dozens of children caught up in this scheme, despite being explicitly excluded from it, many of whom are survivors of trafficking. This letter from nine human rights experts sounds a clear alarm. The UK and France must listen, act now, and stop the harm they are causing.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are confident of the legal basis for this pilot which complies fully with domestic and international law.”A UNHCR spokesperson said: “We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with both the UK and France on the pilot arrangement. This includes sharing concerns and observations directly with the relevant authorities for them to address.”The French interior ministry has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceUnited NationsEuropeHuman rightsInternational lawnewsShareReuse this content"

Between the trailer’s release and the end of the year, Penguin sold 28,257 copies in the UK, compared with 12,134 over the same period in 2024.Jess Harrison, publishing director for Penguin Classics, said: “I can’t remember the last time a film adaptation generated this much excitement for the book.Wuthering Heightsis one of our evergreen bestsellers, but I do think the film is coming out at the perfect moment.“There seems to be a real yearning among readers for intense, maximalist, tragic love stories,” Harrison added. “We’ve seen huge demand for similarly angsty classics likeDostoevsky’s White NightsandSabahattin Ali’s Madonna in a Fur Coat. But Wuthering Heights stands apart in being so wild and unhinged – an extreme book for extreme times.”Fennell’s A-list adaptation, which starsMargot Robbieas Catherine Earnshaw andJacob Elordias Heathcliff, premieres in the UK on 13 February. TheSaltburndirector’s modernised take is set to be an intense, visceral reimagining of Brontë’s gothic romance, complete with contemporary costumes, and a soundtrack by Charli xcx.The promotional materials havesparked backlashfrom Brontë fans and online commentators. Some critics have voiced scepticism about its overt sexual tone,as well as the casting choices: Robbie, 35, plays a character who is 19 in the novel, and Elordi’s casting as Heathcliff has revived debate over the racial identity of the character, who is understood to be of Romany heritage in Brontë’s text.“I don’t think an adaptation needs to be completely faithful to the book: many of the best ones – likeCluelessriffing on [Jane Austen’s]Emma– aren’t,” Harrison said. “But what you hope for is that an adaptation will capture the spirit of the original. With Wuthering Heights, it’s the extreme intensity of emotion that matters the most.”Reviews of the film are embargoed until Monday, butthere has been some early reaction from critics on social media.Courtney Howard called the film “intoxicating, transcendent, tantalising, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic,” and a “god-tier new classic”.Film writer Anne Thompson was similarly effusive, praising it as a “rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd-pleaser,” adding that “audiences will fall for Emerald Fennell’s garish visuals and unrestrained direction. Everything is BIG.”Explore more on these topicsBooksWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordinewsShareReuse this content"

It is the latest in a series of deadly storms to have hit Portugal and Spain in recent weeks, killing several people.1:25Storm Leonardo devastates southern Portugal and Spain – videoAuthorities in Andalucía, where more than 7,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, evacuated residential areas near the Guadalquivir River in Córdoba overnight and pedestrian traffic was halted on the city’s Roman bridge.“We expect 30mm [of rain],” Andalucía’s regional president, Juan Manuel Moreno, said on Friday. “In other circumstances that would be little water but right now it is a lot as the soil is unable to drain and the rivers and reservoirs are full.”About 1,500 residents have been ordered to leave their homes in Grazalema, a mountain village popular with hikers, as water seeped through the walls of houses and cascaded along steep cobbled streets.Moreno told Cadena Ser radio that aquifers in the Grazalema mountains were full and could provoke landslides owing to pent-up pressure. “This could cause large holes or ditches. If this happens under a house or street, the result could be dramatic,” he said.He added geologists were assessing the situation in Grazalema to determine when people would be able to return to their homes.During a visit to a coordination post in Andalucía’s Cádiz province on Friday, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, warned that “complicated days” lay ahead and appealed for caution and calm. He said that 10,000 emergency personnel had been deployed to help across the region, adding that the central government was coordinating the response with the Andalucía regional government.View image in fullscreenA man looks at the Alqueva dam discharging water in Moura, in Portugal’s Alentejo region.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/GettyThe heavy rains are also affecting the olive harvest. Francisco Elvira, who leads the Coag farmers’ association in Jaén province, put losses so far at €200m (£174m).Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet, issued orange weather alerts on Friday for coastal areas of the north-western region of Galicia and yellow alerts for other parts of the northern coast, and for southern and eastern coastal areas, as well as for the Balearic islands.Rubén del Campo, an Aemet spokesperson, said more heavy rain would fall on Saturday. “Following a slight letup on Friday, Storm Marta will arrive, bringing heavy rain and very strong winds on Saturday to areas that have already been very adversely affected by the heavy rains of recent days,” he said.“Once Storm Marta moves off on Sunday, further weather fronts will arrive bringing less intense, but still significant, rainfall to most parts of the peninsula apart from Mediterranean areas.”In Portugal’s second-biggest city, Porto, the River Douro overflowed in the early hours on Friday, causing minor flooding at riverside cafe terraces. In the country’s south, large parts of the town of Alcácer do Sal, by the River Sado, remained semi-submerged for a third day.View image in fullscreenEmergency services evacuate an elderly man of Grazalema, Spain, during Storm Leonardo.Photograph: Ramon Rios/EPAThe commander of Portugal’s ANEPC civil protection service, Mario Silvestre, said six rivers, including the Tagus, were at risk of significant flooding, adding that Portugal was facing the worst flood threat along the Tagus in nearly three decades.The damage and uncertainty brought by the storm has given rise to calls to postpone Sunday’s second round of the presidential election.André Ventura, the leader of thefar-right Chega party, said the vote should be delayed by a week as the poll was “a matter of equality among all Portuguese”.But the national electoral authority said the vote would go ahead as scheduled. “A state of emergency, weather alerts or overall unfavourable situations are not in themselves a sufficient reason to postpone voting in a town or region,” it said.Scientists say human-driven climate breakdown is increasing the length, intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as the floods and heatwaves that have struck both countries in recent years.Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsExtreme weatherFloodingPortugalSpainEuropeEurope weathernewsShareReuse this content"

She was joined byCanada’s Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon.France’s foreign ministry said Jean-Noël Poirier would take up duties as the country’s consul general, making it the first EU country to establish a consulate general in Greenland.Poirier would be “tasked with working to deepen existing cooperation projects with Greenland in the cultural, scientific and economic fields, while also strengthening political ties with the local authorities”, the ministry said.Canada had promised to open a consulate in Greenland in 2024 – before Trump’s recent talk of a takeover – and the formal inauguration was delayed from November because of bad weather.Arctic Fever: new exhibit finds 19th-century parallels to Trump’s Greenland obsessionRead moreAnand met her Danish counterpart, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, inDenmarkon Thursday and posted on social media that “as Arctic nations, Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark are working together to strengthen stability, security and cooperation across the region.”France says the decision to open its diplomatic outpost was taken when its president, Emmanuel Macron, visited in June.Donald Trump, the US president, announced in January that he would impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his calls for a US takeover of Greenland, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a “framework” for a deal over access to the mineral-rich territory had been reached with the help of the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte. Few details of that agreement have emerged.Last week, technical talks started between the US, Denmark and Greenland to put together an Arctic security deal. The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland had agreed to create a working group during a meeting with the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, before Trump made his tariff threats.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandFranceCanadaDenmarkNatoUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2025,protesters turned their backs on government ministersand twice removed a microphone from David Seymour, the Act party leader and architect of the divisive treaty principles bill that sought to radically alter the way the treaty was interpreted.A year earlier, the rightwing coalition governmentfaced record crowds and heated protestsover their policies that many fear are undermining the treaty and rolling back Māori rights.From ‘terrorist’ to national treasure, renowned Māori activist finally tells his own storyRead moreThe absence of protest does not necessarily mark a shift of sentiment in favour of the coalition government, which faces an election in November. Rather, it signals fatigue within the Indigenous population, a breakdown in trust in the government, and a desire to refocus attention towardsMāoricommunities, visitors to the grounds tell the Guardian.“People are tired,” says Edward Ellison, an esteemed leader from the southern tribe Ngāi Tahu. “We’ve been beavering away on submissions, select committees … and the pace, rate and persistent aggressiveness on the treaty – it hasn’t lowered the passion – but there is that exhaustion.”View image in fullscreenNew Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon (2nd left), foreign minister Winston Peters (c), deputy prime minister David Seymour (2nd right), and fellow parliamentarians attend a ceremony commemorating Waitangi Day in Waitangi on 5 February.Photograph: Ben Strang/AFP/Getty ImagesNgāi Tahu chose to forgo its usual celebrations in the South Island to attend Waitangi for the first time in years as a mark of solidarity and unity with northern iwi, or tribes.“It was the events of this government, the impact they are having on the treaty and our people, the divisive approach they are taking and pitting New Zealanders against New Zealanders,” Ellison says.Kassie Hartendorp, the director of community campaigning organisation Action Station Aotearoa, says protests have partly subsided because the government had already shown Māori “exactly who they are” and Māori were sick of their time and energy being taken up.“This coalition government largely doesn’t care what Māori think of them … if they did, we wouldn’t have had this absolute onslaught of anti-tiriti [treaty] policies.”The treaty, signed by Māori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840 is considered New Zealand’s founding document and is instrumental in upholdingMāorirights. It has been commemorated as a public holiday on 6 February since 1974, with events around the country, and a formal multi-day celebration held at the Waitangi grounds.On Thursday, prime minister Christopher Luxon acknowledged the atmosphere surrounding Waitangi Day had “sometimes been very heated”.“New Zealand must continue to evolve in a way that empowers iwi and Māori while steadfastly protecting the unity of the country,” he said, while listing the articles of the treaty and how his government’s policies were fulfilling its promisesThe leader of the opposition, Labour’s Chris Hipkins said the prime minister’s speech was “a missed opportunity … to speak specifically to the theme that we were given, which was working together and bringing people together”.‘Time for us to celebrate each other’Ellison, meanwhile, found the politicians’ speeches were mostly “underwhelming”.“I was disappointed with the kōrero (talk) from the politicians – it didn’t inspire confidence that they had a way forward or a clear path that unites us or brings the best out of us,” Ellison said.On Friday, the mood shifted from muted to celebratory at the treaty grounds as tens of thousands descended torevel in the festivities.It is as much a time for celebration, music, food and community as it is a forum for political discussion about sovereignty, equality and history.View image in fullscreenA waka ceremony in Waitangi on Friday 6 February 2026, as part of Waitangi Day commemorations.Photograph: Ben Strang/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the dawn ceremony, thousands of visitors nursing hot drinks and wrapped in rugs, spilled over the peninsula. Some held tino rangatiratanga flags – symbols of Māori sovereignty – while otherstook the chance to boo Seymour, as he delivered a prayer. Later as the sun broke over the bay and the formalities gave way to festivities, the attention turned elsewhere – to music, community and a celebration of Māori culture.As Hartendorp spoke with the Guardian, waiata (traditional song) rang out from a large forum tent behind her. Stalls selling traditional food, woven bags and carved jewellery heaved with customers. Children darted between their family members and elders fanned themselves in the shade of gazebos. In the bay, thousands lined the banks to watch waka – traditional canoe – slip through the water.“That’s the beauty of Waitangi, we can come here and be exactly who we are and not have to fight and question it,’ Hartendorp said.“We’ve already had hundreds of thousands of people hīkoi [march], we’ve already broken historical records of submissions, we are a political force … and right now is a time for us to celebrate each other.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandNew Zealand politicsMāoriAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Police said they were investigating whether the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.There were fears the death toll from the blast at the Khadija al-Kubra mosque in Islamabad could rise as some of the injured were reported to be in a critical condition. Television footage and social media images showed police and residents transporting the injured to nearby hospitals.Rescuers and the injured described a harrowing and chaotic scene, with bodies lying on the carpeted floor of the mosque.Hussain Shah said he was praying in the mosque’s courtyard when a sudden, loud explosion occurred. “I immediately thought that some big attack has happened,” he told Associated Press.When he entered the mosque, many of the injured were screaming and crying out for help. Shah said he counted about 30 bodies inside, while the number of injured appeared to be significantly higher.Another person in a clip shared on social media said there were at least two attackers and that they had fired at people before detonating bombs. “People were lying in the pool of blood. I saw people’s heads and limbs separated from their bodies.”Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on its Telegram channel. It has been blamed for previous attacks on Shia worshippers, who are a minority in the country. Militants often target security forces and civilians across Pakistan.Though attacks are not so frequent in Islamabad, there has been a surge in militant violence in Pakistan in recent months, blamed largely on Baloch separatist groups and the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is separate from, but allied with, Afghanistan’s Taliban.Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, condemned the attack in separate statements and extended condolences to the families of those killed. They instructed that all possible medical assistance be provided for the injured.“Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,” Zardari said. “The nation stands with the affected families in this difficult time.”Sharif said he had ordered a full investigation. “Those who are responsible must be identified and punished,” he said.Pakistan targets Balochistan separatists after ‘unprecedented’ assaultsRead morePakistan’s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, also condemned the attack, and asked authorities to ensure the best medical care was provided.Friday’s attack occurred while Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is on an official two-day visit, was attending an event in Islamabad with Sharif. The event was several miles from the mosque.A top Shia leader, Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri, expressed deep sorrow over the attack.“Such a terrorist act in the federal capital is not only a serious failure in protecting human lives but also raises significant questions about the performance of the authorities and law enforcement agencies,” he said. He asked for people to donate blood as the hospitals in Islamabad were in urgent need of supplies.Pakistan’s mainstream media faced a backlash after they initially failed to report the attack.Nadir Gurmani, a journalist with Dawn TV,wrote on X: “Those who don’t understand why people are losing trust in traditional media should just look at the media’s role in today’s coverage of suicide blast in Islamabad. News was circulating on social media, but TV channels did not carry even a single ticker.”One of the deadliest attacks in Islamabad took place in 2008, when asuicide bombing targeted the Marriott hotel, killing 63 people and injuring more than 250. In November last year, a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Islamabad, killing 12 people.The latest attack comes nearly a week after the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army carried out attacks in the south-western Balochistan province, killing about 50 people. Security forces killed more than 200 “terrorists” in response, according to the military.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The government has committed to the licence fee for the remainder of this charter period.“To support the public with the cost of the TV licence, we will also continue to support the simple payment plan to spread payments through smaller instalments. Free licences remain available for over-75s on pension credit, with reduced fees for care home residents and blind individuals.”The annual cost of a black and white TV licence is also going up, by £2 from £58.50 to £60.50, for 2026-27.It comes as the government continues the charter review green paper and public consultation on options forBBC future funding.How might the BBC be funded if the licence fee is scrapped?Read moreThe Welsh language channel S4C, which receives all its public funding from the licence fee, will be allocated about £100m in 2026-27, which the DCMS says will “support the growth of the Welsh creative industries”.Reports last week suggested the BBC was working on ways to use its iPlayer streaming service to find households that have not paidfor a TV licence. The move could result in up to 40m online BBC accounts being linked with home addresses for the first time.A BBC spokesperson said: “The licence fee ensures the BBC has the financial stability it needs to deliver for audiences and support the creative industries across the UK. It funds the full range of BBC services and helps us deliver trusted news, the best homegrown storytelling, and unmissable content that brings people together.“The government is currently considering the BBC’s next royal charter and future funding arrangements beyond 2027. We welcome this debate and have been clear we want reform so we can continue to deliver a public service BBC that is independent, sustainably funded for the long term, and meets audience needs for generations to come.”Explore more on these topicsBBC licence feeBBCTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 11 motorway schemes that were evaluated over a five-year period since opening and given a financial assessment, only two were rated positively.Smart motorways, which were rolled out widely in England from 2013, were designed to increase capacity relatively cheaply, by converting the hard shoulder into a live lane and using electronic overhead signs to manage traffic and close lanes in emergencies.But surveys show many motorists fear driving on them, with a number of fatal collisions occurringafter breakdowns– even if official statistics maintain that smart motorways are relatively safe, particularly after a series of works since 2020 to add more emergency laybys and improve monitoring.The 11 schemes with five-year assessments, completed between 2017 and 2019, cost a total of £2.3bn at 2010 prices. In a foreword to the reports, the National Highways chief customer officer, Elliot Shaw, said the schemes were “on course to deliver benefits, but will not deliver all the originally expected benefits within the 60-year appraisal period”.He said value for money had been affected by lower traffic growth than expected since the 2008 financial crises, but also as “traffic on some smart motorway sections is not travelling as quickly as was forecast”.However, the reports argued that other sections would have been unable to cope with increased traffic volumes had they not been upgraded.The reports showed a mixed safety record, with a slight increase in the numbers killed or seriously injured on the M3 and on the M1 between junctions 29 and 42. National Highways said nearly all the schemes had met their safety objectives, although it has since carried out further work to improve safety on smart motorways, including 150 more emergency areas and more technology to detect stopped vehicles.One scheme to exceed original projections for economic benefits, as well as improving safety, was between junctions 16 to 23 of the M25, a stretch that was widened and turned into a “controlled motorway” – with gantries and monitoring technology installed but retaining a hard shoulder. With faster journey times and an improved safety record, it was rated high value for money.The AA said such controlled motorways should be the standard bearer for motorway improvements – but the reports showed most smart motorways were not easing traffic and costing the economy.Edmund King, the AA president, said: “This has been a catastrophic waste of time, money and effort. Many of the schemes have slower journeys which causes traffic jams, loses the country cash and worsened the safety record of motorways.“Motorways which have been widened, the hard shoulder kept and safety technology added have proved the most successful.”He said drivers were increasingly fearful to use smart motorways, and recent AA polling found 47% felt anxious or nervous using them. He added: “We need the return of the hard shoulder to help give confidence to drivers, both now and in the future.”Chris Todd, the director of Transport Action Network, said: ““The reports display a remarkable lack of curiosity over how the danger has increased from vehicles stopped in live running lanes … they raise more questions than they answer.”A National Highways spokesperson said: “Our latest analysis continues to show that overall, smart motorways remain our safest roads. They are also providing much-needed extra capacity for drivers, helping to reduce congestion and lower carbon emissions.”A DfT spokesperson said: “These reports show that smart motorways can make journeys reliable and increase road capacity, so more vehicles can travel safely.”Explore more on these topicsTransportTransport policyAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

On an annual measure, prices grew 1%.Halifax, which is part of Lloyds – Britain’s biggest mortgage lender – estimates that the average price of a UK home hit a record £300,077.Santander offers 98% mortgage for first-time buyers – with strict rulesRead moreHowever, Nationwide, which also releases monthly estimates on house prices, puts the average cost of a homeat a much lower £270,873.The growth marks a significant bounceback after a sluggish run-up to Christmas, when the average price of a UK homefell by 0.5% month on month. Halifax has revised this figure down from 0.2%.“The housing market entered 2026 on a steady footing,” said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. “While [£300,000] is undoubtedly a milestone figure, and activity levels show a resilient market, affordability remains a challenge for many would-be buyers. All in all, we still think house prices are likely to edge up between 1% and 3% this year.”Last month, Nationwide predicted that the average UK house price wouldrise by between 2% and 4% this year.Homebuyers have been buoyed up by a string of cuts to the base rate by the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, with themost recent coming in December.On Thursday, the bankmaintained the rate at 3.75%over concerns of persistent inflation, which rose for the first time in five months in December,to 3.4%.However, the narrow 5-4 vote split has led analysts to factor in further cuts in the coming months. The committee has cut rates six times since mid-2024.House price graphicOn a regional basis Northern Ireland continues to show the strongest house price in the UK, with average prices rising at 5.9% annually to £217,206.In Scotland, the rate of growth is running at 5.4%, with the average price of a property at £221,711. In Wales, there has been only 0.5% annual growth, with the average home costing £228,415.In England, the strongest growth is in the north-west, at 2.1%, where an average home costs £244,329.“Looking ahead, much will depend on whether the expected rate cuts later this year materialise,” said Karen Noye, a mortgage expert at Quilter. “If they do, the impact is more likely to be gradual support for affordability rather than a sudden jump in prices.“Stability has returned, but enthusiasm has not and that is likely to keep price growth contained over the months ahead.”Anthony Codling, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “While housing affordability is stretched for many, rising wages, falling mortgage rates and the easing of mortgage lending limits have all contributed to rising house prices at a national level.”While the average price of a UK property has topped the £300,000 mark for the first time, in part fuelled by sharp rises during the Covid pandemic, growth in recent years has been modest.Property prices have risen by 5.7%, or about £16,000, over the last three years as higher interest rates and affordability issues have contributed to slower growth.However, between 2020 and 2023 house prices climbed almost 19%, over £44,000, as ultra-low borrowing costs and the pandemic-driven “race for space” led to homeowners looking to relocate.There are a number of factors that contribute to the difference in average UK house price estimates produced by Nationwide and Halifax.Both produce the estimates based on their own mortgage approvals, about 15,000 a month for Halifax and 12,000 for Nationwide.Cash transactions are also not included, with 30% to 40% of sales in cash. Nationwide also does not include buy-to-let transactions.eExplore more on these topicsHousing marketHouse pricesPropertyReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

However, it added: “That journey continues at a pace that needs to be governed by demand rather than command.”Stellantis also plans to sell its 49% stake in its battery joint venture in Canada with NextStar Energy to South Korea’s LG Energy Solution.“We have gone deep into every corner of our business and are making the necessary changes,” Filosa said. “In 2026, our unwavering focus is on closing past execution gaps to add further momentum to these early signs of renewed growth.”Despite the scale of the announcement, analysts believe that Stellantis will still have to consider factory closures and a reduction in output.“Given that this announcement does not include any factory closures we do not think the news yet resets fully the cost base at Stellantis, which is likely necessary on the reduced market shares,” said analysts at Citi in a note to investors. “We think any upside to Stellantis most likely features capacity reductions to fully reset the North America and European businesses.”Last month, the rival Fordannounced a $19.5bn charge, while General Motors recently reported a $6bn hit.In 2022, Carlos Tavares, the former chief executive of Stellantis, set a goal for 100% of sales in Europe, and 50% in the US, to be of BEVs by the end of the decade.On Friday, Stellantis said its push into the EV market needed to be “governed by demand rather than command”.“The success of companies like[China’s] BYDsuggests there are plenty of people willing to take the leap,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “That begs the question as to whether Stellantis’s frustration over its EV sales is linked to market issues or that drivers simply don’t like its vehicles.”The company is set to present an update of its long term strategy to investors and analysts at a capital markets day in May.Last year, Stellantis made what it called the largest ever investment in its US operation, $13bn over four years, introducing 10 new products and creating 5,000 jobs.Explore more on these topicsStellantisAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropePeugeotCitroënJeepnewsShareReuse this content"

But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect peopleKeza MacDonaldFri 6 Feb 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 09.41 ESTShareWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in thePokémonWorld Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.It is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.Over the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.Like The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.The developer nearly went bust several times, taking on outside projects to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salaryPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.The idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.View image in fullscreenClick and collect … Competitors at the 2019 Pokémon World Championships in Washington DC.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.But the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.Pokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.Time magazine called Pokémon 'a pestilential Ponzi scheme', describing the 'delinquent' and ‘criminal' behaviour of young fansToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.Now that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children.

Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.July 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.There’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.The 10 most anticipated video games of 2026Read moreAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.Dr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

Why not do the same for classical music?It began in the Royal Festival Hall, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra “playing the unforgettable ‘da-da-da-dum’ of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony”. And, indeed, the opening movement was brisk and the da-da-da-dums were present and correct. Vogue Williams, media personality, model and presenter ofSend Nudes: Body SOSwelcomed us to the event. “Wasn’t that incredible,” she gushed after the six minutes of the symphony’s first movement. “You must be wrecked,” she told an orchestra who routinely perform 90-minute Mahler symphonies and four-hour operas, but conductor Ed Gardner smiled gamely and moved on to a short medley of Howard Shore’s Lord of the Rings film music.The finale from Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony followed, whose lurches of mood made little musical sense divorced from the rest of the work. Still, the LPO played it at full throttle and impeccably.Thereafter the audience was free to choose one of the four other orchestras (in fact, small groups of musicians from each) playing short sets in vastly smaller Southbank spaces. Each set was repeated three times over the next 75 minutes, meaning in theory you could catch most of the music on offer, but did no one do the maths or visualise how the audiences would move through the site? The Royal Festival Hall (which seats 2,700) was full. Disgorge that many people simultaneously into four smaller spaces, whose combined capacity is nowhere near sufficient to cope with such a crowd, and you will inevitably leave much of your audience stuck in bottlenecks. Catching up with friends happened mostly in queues, and too often involved the question, “Have you managed to actually hear anything yet?”When you did, the results were uneven. Members of the Chineke! Junior Orchestra were arrayed around the Clore Ballroom on individual podiums like exhibits in a gallery, with Yshani Perinpanayagam bravely keeping her disparate troops together to perform the moving Montgomery Variations by Margaret Bonds while the audience wandered between players. Some of the younger performers looked distinctly uncomfortable; a more experienced orchestra and a less intricate piece would surely have been a happier choice here.In the undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall, a handful of musicians from the London Sinfonietta performed three extracts from Steve Reich works. Those lucky enough to squeeze in found the industrial space lit like a nightclub, and in what felt rather polite accounts, Reich’s music still wove its hypnotic magic.View image in fullscreenThe sound of music … Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at Classical Mixtape.Photograph: Pete WoodheadMeanwhile, in the Purcell Room (with a capacity of about 300), players from the Aurora Orchestra were on a musical adventure inspired, apparently, by Gustav and Alma Mahler’s time in the Alps. Audience members “are free to move between stages as they wish” went the blurb, but that was easier said than done: none but the most dedicated of queuers were able to see what musical peaks the Aurora scaled. Still, in the foyer you could enjoy a brass and percussion band from theOrchestra of the Age of Enlightenmentwearing lederhosen, alpine caps and dirndl dresses (and yes, with the instruments of 19th-century Bavaria) doing a Sound of Music medley and having a whale of a time using beer glasses as percussion and proving they are most definitely game for a laugh.The Barbican’sSound Unbound festivalshowed that classical music in bite-size chunks with an audience free to explore can work incredibly well. There, the music was spread across 19 venues and an entire weekend. Here, mystifyingly, the centre’s second hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall (capacity about 900) was not being used as a performing space, and there were no duos, trios, quartets or quintets in the vast public spaces on any of the six Royal Festival Hall floors. The audience profile was noticeably younger and more mixed than a usual classical one, but they were poorly served by unambitious programming and abysmal planning.As everyone was ushered back towards the Royal Festival Hall to hear the finale – the Philharmonia performing two movements of Holst’s The Planets and the Star Wars theme, I decided less was definitely more and fled this dispiriting vision of classical music’s future.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSouthbank CentreLondon Philharmonic OrchestraAurora OrchestraChineke!

So why isn’t there more depth to this documentary?Sarah DempsterFri 6 Feb 2026 03.01 ESTShareJudit Polgár won her first chess tournament in 1981 when, at the age of six, she marmalised a string of middle-aged Hungarians and toddled off with a swanky Boris Diplomat Bd-1 Electronic Chess Computer. “I was a killer,” says the amiable 49-year-old inNetflixdocumentary Queen of Chess. “I wanted to kill my opponents. I would sacrifice everything to get checkmate.” Archive footage captures the bloody aftermath of Polgár’s inaugural victory; a roomful of solemnly jumpered victims looking on, dazed and ashen-jowled, as the vanquishing Hungarian scowls at photographers from beneath a bowl cut that could confidently be described as “ferocious”. The triumph put paid (at least temporarily) to Polgár’s painful shyness, making her feel “exceptionally powerful. After this, it was so obvious for me that I’m going to be a chess player. And if you want to become the best,” she says with a wry smile, “it’s very important to have the challenges.”Ah, yes. The challenges. But with which to start? Queen ofChess– a rhapsodic account of the life of the greatest female chess player of all time – is spoiled for choice. There is the punishing chess-training regime, designed as an experiment by Polgár’s educational psychologist father László to prove “geniuses are made, not born”. (School and weekends were banned so “every day was a working day.”) There is the communist regime so threatened by the family’s ambitions to compete in the west that it confiscated their passports.There is the relentless sexism that trailed the tiny trailblazer and older chess-playing sisters Susan and Sofia, outraged at the temerity of their insistence on taking on the male-dominated sport’s grandmasters while delivering pronouncements of the “women lack the pure mental ability needed to understand chess” variety. It’s all here, and Queen of Chess throws its arms wide in an effort to capture the frequently depressing reality of Polgár’s experiences. Not quite wide enough, though. There is throughout the documentary’s 90 minutes the persistent sense that there’s more to Polgár’s story; that if only Emmy-winning director Rory Kennedy had been steadier with her magnifying glass the results might not feel so emotionally underdeveloped. Instead, we get a garish, skittish account of Polgár’s youthful ascent to chess superstardom, with grainy scenes of strategic prowess accompanied by jarring neon graphics and an aggressively irksome soundtrack by various female-fronted post-punk types.At its heart, however, is Polgár’s rivalry with revered former world championGarry Kasparov.View image in fullscreen‘She delivered’ … Polgár playing against Garry Kasparov.Photograph: Javier Bustos Lozano/Courtesy of Netflix“The way she played chess was not compatible with the best way to handle Garry Kasparov,” rumbles the Russian grandmaster, flapping a meaty paw dismissively. And yet, ultimately, it was: after 14 fraught games (the most notorious of which, in 1994, saw Kasparov violate the “touch move” rule), Polgár finally, at the age of 26, defeated her idol. At the time, the record-breaking feat was greeted by the Russian with a desultory handshake.And now? “She delivered,” he harrumphs.“I had to prove myself 10 times more than if I’d been born as a boy,” says Polgár with the weariness of one long aware that no matter how extraordinary her achievements, they will never be enough for some.Enter, sighing, László Polgár. “I never scolded [the girls] for not winning a game. Still, losing is a very bad thing,” tuts the combatively bearded septuagenarian, slumped in his huge chair like a deposed lion.It is only in its dying moments that Queen of Chess touches on the complexity of Judit’s relationship with her father. “How do you feel about being the subject of that experiment?” asks Kennedy. Uncomfortable laughter, then silence. Polgár’s gaze drifts off. “Of course, in one hand it is not a nice way of being part of an experiment,” she says, moist-eyed, over a montage of bowl-cutted early victories. “But my father was the one who showed me the beauty of chess …” she continues, before wandering into a thicket of platitudes about self-improvement.“Judit Polgár was a guinea pig,” says one contributor. “The fact that she achieved all these things that her father dreamed of and still remains a very normal and pleasant person, that’s … some sort of a miracle.”This is not, you suspect, the half of it.Queen of Chess is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewChessDocumentaryNetflixGarry KasparovFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The point of this one: if we’d listened to the king, there would be no climate crisis – even if some of his ideas are a bit woo-wooStuart HeritageFri 6 Feb 2026 00.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.26 ESTShareWe find ourselves at an interesting moment in the streaming wars; one where Amazon’s programming policy has apparently shifted to simply giving a massive platform to authority. Last week saw the release of theMelaniaTrump film (a grating vanity project it paid $75m for) and this week it’s our turn, with the platform releasing the King Charles documentary Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision.Why Jeff Bezos would want to curry favour with the most powerful people on the planet by paying to air uncritical profiles of them is anyone’s guess. Either way, as a film, Finding Harmony is intensely frustrating to watch. It is ostensibly a relatively important climate crisis documentary, undone by its own innate sense of chippy entitlement. Perhaps a better title would have been King Charles: Needless to Say I Had the Last Laugh.Running to 90 minutes – but feeling much longer, like the sort of thing designed to run on a loop in the background of a conference – the core message of Finding Harmony is that the world is in trouble, but only because we didn’t listen to the king. He is, we are told via Kate Winslet’s awestruck narration, “a man who has spent a lifetime building harmony”, which might come as a surprise to anyone who has read Prince Harry’s book.The fawning tone continues, with Charles telling us that he saw environmental collapse coming as long ago as the 60s, and interviewees pointing out that “people dismissed him as crazy”. We see him champion organic food, and headlines calling him a lunatic, before we’re reminded that his once-fringe beliefs have now become fully mainstream.View image in fullscreenAwestruck … Kate Winslet narrates.Photograph: The King’s Foundation & Courtney Louise PhotographyThis is the key frustration. Because, ultimately, he is right. Even with all the undeniable scientific evidence at our disposal, it is still impossible to make people take the climate crisis seriously. Had we all possessed the king’s foresight four or five decades ago, there is every likelihood that the world would be in a better state than it is now.However, the film carries the thrumming sense that King Charles was out on a limb by himself, which does rather discount the influence of Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson and the founders of Earth Day. This is only exacerbated when the film tries to expand the other threads of the king’s nebulous “harmony” philosophy.These include the restoration of Dumfries House, which we’re told has helped to train the local community in traditional pursuits (and neglects to mention that it was at the centre of a cash-for-honours scandal). We’re also shown how the king has paved the way in the field of teaching prisoners to bee-keep, and told how he helped to rebuild Kabul by educating liberated locals about art.If the latter sounds familiar, it’s because it formed part ofBitter Lake, the Adam Curtis Afghanistan documentary, which had a clip of women reacting incredulously to an image of Duchamp’s urinal. In fact, Finding Harmony often resembles one of Curtis’s films, in the way that it tries to link a bunch of disparate claims with a churning array of stock footage.‘I wasn’t going to be diverted,’ says King Charles about campaign on the environmentRead moreAmong these claims: walking through forests is good because pine particles enter your blood; the housing crisis is down to people not wanting to live in ugly tower blocks; and the universe is filled with patterns that repeat throughout space and time in a demonstration of harmonious mathematics that affects our emotions and wellbeing. This last one, it has to be said, comes a little out of the blue, as if King Charles dropped a sneaky tab of acid then spent the afternoon staring at the back of his hand.Perhaps this is why the film ended up on Amazon. The BBC, you sense, would have pushed back on some of the more ostentatiously woo-woo elements. Plus, as a corporation so nervy about the climate emergency that even David Attenborough has to go elsewhere when he needs to drive a point home, it might have tried to undercut the king’s environmental warnings with footage of Jordan Peterson calling it hooey. And that really wouldn’t do, especially in a film that feels precision-engineered to underscore the king’s legacy.Either way, it will be fascinating to see how this does on Amazon. Twenty years ago, a film with this level of access to a British monarch would have aired on a terrestrial channel, and people would have watched in their millions, if only for the fact that nothing else was on. Here it will find itself nestled in a submenu alongsideMrBeastand an Italian brainrot cartoon. Who knows if the king of the United Kingdom can compete with that any more.Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision is on Prime Video now.This article was amended on 6 February 2026.

Drums skirmish with frighteningly efficient, jackhammer velocity; synths and guitars buzz and ring like fire alarms; the bass rumbles like a jammed freighter engine. Grote Geelstaart’s clinical chaos goes hand in hand with vocalist/guitarist Luuk Bosma’s primal punk dramaturgy, reminiscent of Nick Cave, James Chance and underrated Dutch punk thespians De Kift. This MO translates wonderfully to Grote Geelstaart’s Zeelandic roots, a place where an intricate network of dykes is built and maintained to keep the unforgiving North Sea at bay: human ingenuity v lawless elements.Even within a surging landscape of bizarro rock upstarts, Bosma, Jesper Rottier (guitar, drums, vocals), Jeppe Rottier (bass), Danny Rottier (synths, saxophone), and Finley Nijsse (drums, vocals) are total outliers. Not just because of the high-density confluence of ideas and odd tempos within each track, but also because of their insistence on performing their lyrics exclusively in Dutch. Grote Geelstaart is a bit of a family affair too: Jesper and Jeppe are brothers, and Finley and Danny are their nephews. Frontman Bosma, a friend from school, rounds out the five-piece.Perhaps the one constant of Grote Geelstaart’s perplexing shows is that they don’t stay in the same place for very long: avant garde noise chicanery of Naked City and Boredoms variety can shift at any second towards oddball poetry. With tracks such as Spookrijden (meaning Ghost Driving, about a person forced to drive on the wrong side of the road), Barch – both from the 2025 EP Van Reijnst – and now the hyper-frenetic new single Maalstroom, the band’s bold inversion of rock music feels primed to swallow up anything entering its orbit.Jasper WillemsThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenMind-expanding … Gnod.Photograph: Jon PerryGnod – Shadow MirrorThe Salfordian psych-rock unit are celebrating 20 years in the mind-expansion game with an album trilogy this year, and this is the first track from it: a slow ritualistic groove worshipping a huge jangling riff.BBTPicture – TyyyyyyyyyIssued on UK label of the moment Short Span, this is a sleekly functioning techno machine with an exquisite touch of Roulé-style filter house scuffing up the polish – and the bass drop is pure eyes-closed joy.

His 14 records since 2015’s debut Dança do Tempo include everything from a tender duets album with saxophonist Sam Gendel, The Room,to the electronic-influenced Aquàticos with producer E Ruscha V, and the percussive tabla textures of Cavejaz. On Vila, Nascimento is leaning into orchestral composition, featuring alongside the 16-piece Vittor Santos Orquestra.View image in fullscreenVila.Photograph: Brian CrossEmploying his signature combination of finger-picked melodics with percussive strumming, Nascimento’s performance across Vila’s 11 tracks showcases his ability to weave seamlessly through the orchestra’s dynamic range rather than playing a single role. On Spring Theme, he establishes a simple lead melody that guides the ensemble and is anchored through swells of strings and soft shaker rhythm, while on Tema em Harmônicos his fingerpicking mirrors thrumming hand percussion as a muted trumpet takes the lead instead; Plateau’s intricate picking answers the staccato tones of the brass section, simultaneously leading and following. Conductor Vittor Santos’s arrangements reference the luscious, bossa-influenced orchestrations of fellow countrymanArthur Verocai, producing enveloping, overlaid harmonies on Valsa and Floresta Dos Sonhos.It’s imaginative mood music that never quite reaches its full dramatic and explosive potential. Instead, the album luxuriates in gentle, sweeping viola and violin lines, and alternates between metallic picking and warm strumming on the guitar. Nascimento is virtuosic in his dexterity and he reaches a peak on the sprightly O Tempo (Foi o Meu Mestre), where he switches from a double-time swing to a half-time, yearning sway, which proves that even without an attention-grabbing crescendo or solo, he can still move listeners to his soft melody.Also out this monthGhanaian singerLamisi’s Let Us Clap (Real World) combines a fierce activist message on women’s rights with thumping production that features traditional Ghanaian folk rhythm and electronics. The sparse handclaps and processed vocals of No Orgasm in Heaven are a highlight. A rediscovered gem from the 1970s,Tilaye Gebre’s Saxophone With the Dahlak Band (Muzikawi) features the Ethiopian psych-jazz saxophonist at the height of his powers, anchoring everything from reggae rhythm to organ-driven funk and slow swing in the husky tone of his saxophone.

It is billed as Danny L Harle’s debut album, which it definitely isn’t – his actual debut album,Harlecore, came out in 2021, although in at least one sense, Cerulean is markedly different from its predecessor. It’s the weighty guestlist, featuring Clairo, Caroline Polachek, PinkPantheress, MNEK and more, a reflection of Harle’s ascension into the major leagues of pop production: he’s worked with Polachek before, as well as Florence + the Machine and Dua Lipa (who also features on Cerulean), among others.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for CeruleanBut in another way, it’s markedly similar. As with Harlecore, its chief source material is the kind of pop-trance big on BBC Radio 1 in the early 00s and the speedy, cheesy, Eurodance music on which the wildly successful Clubland brand was founded in the same era. This it presents with high seriousness. “This album is my message,” offers Harle in the accompanying blurb. “I hope it is received.” A press release suggests that he is drawing on “a particular strain of Italian artistry that encompasses the Renaissance composer Monteverdi and the Y2K club bangers of Eiffel 65”.It has to be said that the impact of the authors of Blue (Da Ba Dee) is more noticeable than that of Monteverdi on an album that contains tracks called Laa, Te Re Re and Island (Da Da Da). It also has to be said that if you start talking about the artistic continuum between Monteverdi and Eiffel 65, and indeed the message inherent in Euro pop-trance, you lay yourself open to accusations that you’re smarmily taking the piss. Such a thought also crosses one’s mind when confronted by, say, Laa – which features a hook not unlike that of Sandstorm by Darude, only played on synthesised panpipes – or indeed, Island (Da Da Da), which melds banging trance with the sound of a jaunty accordion.Danny L Harle: Azimuth ft Caroline Polachek – videoAlternatively, Harle may be performing an entirely earnest salvage operation on music he genuinely loved during his youth, as suggested by Azimuth, which features a striking vocal courtesy of Polachek and feels like a melding of two distinct hit tropes from twentysomething years ago: the aforementioned pop-trance and the melodramatic gothy hard rock of Evanescence, a cocktail that turns out to sound exactly like a latterday Eurovision entry fielded by a former Soviet republic.Watch me work it, I’m perfect! The return of electro-house, pop’s trashiest, brattiest soundRead moreElsewhere, there are beatless instrumentals both lengthy and interstitial (the closing Teardrop in the Ocean executes a skilful shift from ambience to intensity). A 75-second track involving a vocal by Clairo starts out unaccompanied and ends up backed by cinematic strings, and a track featuring PinkPantheress iss so wilfully plasticky it makes PinkPantheress’s own oeuvre sound like Mahalia Jackson at Newport.What it doesn’t have is a pop melody or hook as undeniable as that of N-Trance’s Set You Free or Toca’s Miracle by Fragma or Ultrabeat’s Pretty Green Eyes, something built to at least temporarily disarm anyone unconvinced by the fluoro flimsiness of Harle’s influences. It all means that Cerulean’s appeal is likely to be dictated by how fondly you recall them. If you view the days when Cascada, Kelly Llorenna and the Trance Nation compilations bestrode the charts as a nonpareil high point in pop history, fill your boots. For the rest of us, it’s an experience that’s sugary and intense, the kind that may cause you to involuntarily grit your teeth.Released 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicCaroline Polachekalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The music is by no means all Dowland – in fact, the recording takes its title from a song by Purcell, and one of its most memorable tracks is a spellbinding version of the Corpus Christi Carol as set by Britten – but everything is steeped in the delicious Elizabethan melancholy that Dowland distilled so very effectively.View image in fullscreenAmidst the ShadesPhotograph: BIS RecordsHughes’s voice retains a natural quality, for all its refinement, which has been skilfully captured – the recording is close enough for her to be able to be soft and confiding, but there’s still a sense of space around the sound. She’s more vocally demonstrative than some, colouring each word individually: when in Dowland’s Flow, My Tears she sings of “fear, and grief, and pain”, we’re left in no doubt that these are three different but equally terrible emotions. And yet she, Nordberg and Brinkmann hold all this in balance, maintaining a persuasive sense of line and focus so that the expressivity registers not as indulgence but as communication. This is just as evident in the music by Dowland’s contemporaries and in Purcell as it is in the four new or recent compositions based on Shakespeare’s song lyrics at the end, by Deborah Pritchard, Errollyn Wallen and Cheryl Frances-Hoad.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

When I was eight, I’d hide them under my pillow and read by the hallway light when I was supposed to be asleep.My favourite book growing upRoald Dahl’s Matilda. I felt woefully misunderstood by the world and longed to be adopted by a very pretty teacher with only cardboard for furniture. I spent a lot of time trying to make a pen move by concentration alone. Sometimes I still try.The book that changed me as a teenagerI read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath when I was 16 and it was a shocking and disorienting introduction to mental illness in young women. A couple of years later, when I experienced a serious bout of mental illness, The Bell Jar helped conceptualise what was happening.The book that made me want to be a writerScoop by Evelyn Waugh is a brilliantly funny satire of war journalism that still rings disturbingly true. It inspired me to write a comedy about a bonkers UN programme in Iraq – which turned into my debut novel, Fundamentally.The book or author I came back toI had Donna Tartt’s The Secret History on my shelf for 10 years without ever reading it. Then I found myself alone and unwell one Christmas and I disappeared into its enchanting, atmospheric world. Sometimes a book is there for you at just the right time.The book I rereadIn moments of grief, I return to Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking. It is a word-perfect exploration of the insanity brought on by loss, and it helps me feel less alone in the darkest times. I always have a big, cathartic cry when I read it.The book I could never read againPortnoy’s Complaint by Philip Roth. I’m sick to death of reading about hypersexual misogynists obsessed with their own victimhood. I don’t find it clever or interesting.The writer who changed my mindI was 19 when I read The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan and it totally reframed how I thought about the role of marriage and children in my life. The book depicts the suffocating impact of expectations on women to prioritise caring roles over all else. It made me commit to achieving my own dreams, rather than expecting a child to do it for me.The book I am currently readingSlumberland by Paul Beatty. It’s a little tough going, but he has some genius one-liners and brutally cutting observations about the racism experienced by an African American musician living in Berlin.My comfort readWhenever I want to be cheered up, I read David Sedaris. At heart, I’m an older gay man with health anxiety, obsessed with picking up litter and controlled by my Fitbit.Fundamentally by Nussaibah Younis will be published by W&N in paperback on 12 February.

His subjects range from social and political justice to meditations on poetic heroes such as Elizabeth Bishop and sonnet sequences elegising the writer’s sister. The interwoven specificity and occasional nature of the poems is captivating: one feels their movement, “in the flesh, / in his memory / and in the words”, as they unspool with control and purpose. “I’m still capable of being in love.” This is a poet clearly still in love with life.View image in fullscreenInto the Hushby Arthur Sze (Penguin, £12.99)This first UK publication introduces readers to the current US poet laureate’s bold vision of the world’s fragility: one of unceasing iridescence and glimmer, even in the face of ecological destruction and dilapidation. While the title suggests a sonic organisation, it may be more apt to understand the poems as painterly brushstrokes. “When you’ve / worked this long your art is no longer art / but a wand that wakes your eyes to what is.” Single-line stanzas that decrescendo to em dashes recur, illustrating the silence into which Sze feels both world and body disappearing: “you have loved, hated, imagined, despaired, and the fugitive colours of existence have quickened in your body -”. Even in its continual replenishing beauty, the collection is eerie, as though these poems were a last attempt to bring order to the disorder of living. “What in this dawn is yours?” asks one. Perhaps nothing, because “once lines converge, lines diverge”.View image in fullscreenUnsafeby Karen McCarthy Woolf (Bloomsbury, £12.99)“This is how you learn to stay alive – / sunlight streaming / through branches – / all young girls must remain / alert.” McCarthy Woolf’s taut new book reflects both the semblance of wholeness and the opacities of erasure. Alongside the poems, which broadly meditate on the capitalistic impressionability of bodies and landscapes, are photographs of blasted doll heads, metallic and shattered borders, surveillance cameras sutured to palm trees. “How do we claim / the nothing / that is space?” Photography, maybe. Poetry, most definitely – though the collection also contains essayistic explorations of tattoos: “I started to think a tattoo was a way to reclaim agency over the body…” Juliana Spahr encouraged poets to pay attention to the bulldozer as well as the beautiful bird; McCarthy Woolf extends this ecological ethic to the human and the architectural in this playfully sparse and hypnotic collection.View image in fullscreenOnly Singby John Berryman, edited by Shane McCrae (Faber, £12.99)Babe, wake up – 152 new Dream Songs just dropped! Readers meeting Berryman via Only Sing are not encountering the poems that weren’t good enough to make the first cut in his 60s classic; rather, they’ll discover a poetics of fierce vernacular, meticulous sonics, a consciousness unwilling to partition the demotic from the highly conceptual. “Let’s think of his nature as a kind of mist.” The “he” here is Henry, anthero of the Dream Songs, a prejudiced, nervy, white American man who, beyond the idiosyncrasy of situation, wholly resists classification. Berryman is a master of the line and like no other poet produces a page with variable technical tectonics that can stun or quake, often both: “Drink & sing seems all our fate obliges, / sleep feed make love between whiles, till we die, / & what does then our fate oblige?” A treasure trove for Berryman fanatics and new readers alike.View image in fullscreenLamping Wild Rabbitsby Simon Maddrell (Out-Spoken, £11.99)Loss and candour categorise Maddrell’s debut collection. The speakers feverishly recall desires often accompanied by the contrapositive of shame: “how their smooth twigs age and develop warts / there I go again talking about shame”. While the subjects include memory, life with HIV and the transformation of innocence, the language is steeped in a poetics of interpenetration, observed with a rich descriptive eye: “Polaroid of people gone, re-faced for posterity, / white-powdered cheeks, dust marks death on my pants.” The prize of age is wisdom – “the captive live longer than the wild” – and moments here silence the reader to introspection.View image in fullscreenDream Latitudesby Alia Kobuszko (Faber, £12.99)“Often, I felt I was / on the precipice of some great / feeling,” declares one of 11 poems titled “X”. The letter X? The Roman numeral? Or have the titles been cut away? Approximating a climax that never arrives, Dream Latitudes is a strange debut – strange like waking up in the afternoon’s “armfuls of light”. Kobuszko’s poems are songs littered with accidentals, changing the timbre of their music, sometimes line by line. “There is nothing to do but sleep. There is nothing but sleep. How to exhaust the inexhaustible?” Fields, dreams, songs, birds, green, light, horses, pain – a poet can save these words from cliche if, like Kobuszko, they “unspool” them in a haunting music that neither entices nor repulses. “Tell me you can hear me when I say / in the fields of our dreams I will find you.” This collection breaks many rules, and is all the better for it.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

From its very first paragraphs, however, this debut novel feels different. Madeleine Dunnigan immediately takes us inside the head of her rather scary protagonist, and makes his adventures in teenage lust and self-awareness as involving as they are immediate. The writing is constantly surprising, as unafraid of sensuality as it is of the story’s repeated eruptions of brutality.We first meet Jean, our eponymous hero, as he is about to take his O-levels. He is sitting them at the unusually late age of 17; later, we will find out that this is because he has a history of violence, and has been excluded from every school he’s ever attended. To the despair of his teachers, Jean seems completely unable to learn. He is also a Jew in a school full of gentiles, the lone child of a single mother, a county-funded scholarship boy whose friendship group is unanimously monied and privileged. This is not, however, the story of a queer outsider battling to find himself in a setting of dreary conformity. Perched high on the Sussex Downs, Jean’s school specialises in colourful nonconformists; known to its pupils as The House of Nutters, its regime mixes high-risk bohemianism with the occasional dash of old-school protocol. Crucially, it is isolated, and its pupils are all male. It is a classic microcosm; a petri dish alive with potentially dangerous experiments in masculinity.Built into the opening of the story are two neat and effective tricks of timing. The action takes place in the summer of 1976; by setting her novel across months when this country and its cultures felt as though they were on the verge of explosion, Dunnigan makes her story rich with larger implications, both personal and political. And because Jean is still trying to achieve something he ought to have got out of the way when he was a child – his O-levels – his fumbling attempts to get to grips with his desires seem realistically out of sync with the more freewheeling sexual lives of his classmates. Jean experiences those desires as both aggressively infantile and disturbingly adult, and Dunnigan brilliantly embodies this duality in the shifting registers of her prose. Like Jean’s body, her sentences are wonderfully alive to physical fact; like his mind, they are in cool pursuit of what those facts might actually mean.Jean’s story will speak to anyone battling to understand themselves as the owner of a queer body in a treacherous worldClearly, Jean is a firework, waiting to ignite. The spark that lights his fuse is so small and fleeting that Jean himself almost misses it: a single ambiguous look exchanged with a fellow schoolboy called Tom. However, it turns out that Tom has been in the crosshairs of Jean’s sexual attention for some time, and the explosion soon begins. As it ripples out, Dunnigan is especially good at using a slow-burn disclosure of her narrative’s backstory secrets. Death, abandonment and sexual abuse have all helped to educate as well as damage Jean, and his journey from incoherent lust to self-knowledge is charted in a series of powerfully written set-pieces. His first head-turning experience of actual sex forms a diptych with the gory butchering of a carcass; his most essential childhood memory is spliced with the systematic destruction of a whole houseful of glass.Like all good coming-of-age stories, the book has two opposing narrative drives: one towards disillusion, the other towards discovery. The disillusion comes when Tom, the boy with whom Jean falls powerfully in love, turns out to be a betrayer. The betrayal then enables the retrieval of that lost but crucial childhood memory, one that finally explains to the reader and to Jean himself his long history of self-sabotage. In that memory’s wake, Dunnigan allows the music of her hero’s internal musings to lift off into a major key, bright with the possibility of sunlight. This provides a genuinely moving conclusion.This is an impressive and accomplished debut. Jean’s and his story will speak to any reader who is battling to understand themselves as the owner of a queer body in a treacherous world. It will also speak to anyone who can remember how glorious – and dangerous – it once felt to find yourself in possession of a fully functioning heart.Jean by Madeleine Dunnigan is published by Daunt (£10.99).

With his marriage and career in meltdown, a man tries to get back to nature in this thought-provoking fableJo HamyaFri 6 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareThere has never been a better time than now for Man, the protagonist of Helen of Nowhere, to be a neo-transcendentalist. As a university professor, the lessons he imparts involve encouraging his students to remove themselves from the politics of the city and “the tools of human construction” to pursue the purity of nature. In doing so, Man muses, they might invoke an “innate ability to engage in simplybeing” outside arbitrary institutions of knowledge, such as the university.Man is a good person, or so we hear. He is observant, he listens. And of course, “I [love] women,” he tells us. “I’d worked hard for women my entire life.” But “the fact was that war had been declared against me [by] … a faction of women … They were hysterical … and maybe evil, words I could only bring myself to whisper … for I knew the politics behind their deployment.”Despite his inducements to kindness, fun and joy, Man is let go from work: his views are no longer compatible with the university’s. Later still, Wife, his spouse and also a professor at the university, leaves him. This might be because they met when he was her teacher and have since outgrown a dynamic where she is subordinate. Or because he speaks casually of hitting her during sex and of hitting her dog. Or simply because she is no longer as beautiful as she was when she was young (not that Man believes telling women they’re beautiful “is good for them”). It’s difficult for him to say – all the same, he is depleted of self and purpose, and it’s clear a return to Nature is needed.Man views a house in the countryside owned by Helen, about whose bucolic way of living he is taught by Realtor. Although she is now in a care home, Helen used to farm her land self-sufficiently. In doing so, she became attuned to a world of “natural” rather than human-made systems: “[t]here’s contentment outside of all that,” explains Realtor, now the dominant narrative voice. She can see the appeal this kind of ahistoricity or asociality might hold for Man. Still, she says, Man needs to restructure his ego and “come to terms withlove” to truly heal. Helen could help. Man, somewhat aroused, agrees. At which point Helen’s spirit enters Realtor to discuss with him where his work and marriage went wrong. Reality dismantles.Beyond its themes of misogyny and supplanted power, Goodman’s writing asks worthwhile questions of us allDespite how fabular Helen of Nowhere seems in its progression, these kinds of narratorial shifts between Man, Realtor, Helen and ultimately Wife are dexterously, meticulously performed. They help enact a carefully negotiated dialectic: doing v taking, buying v selling, the individual v community, man v nature, dominance v support, masculine v feminine. Beyond its more obvious themes of misogyny and supplanted power, Goodman’s writing also asks worthwhile questions of us all. How much of living is predicated on a reliance on – if not exploitation of – others? To what extent is this bearable? How far does it delegitimise individual pleasure? Whatshould“good” living look like? Where does the knowledge such a pursuit requires come from? Can it be, at once, wholly ethicalandpersonally pleasurable? Each answer, naturally, depends on the privileges afforded a person.“I think a lot about fires, floods, the end of the world, don’t you?” chirps Realtor during the house tour. In a sense, so does the entire novel – to scale. And Goodman is wonderfully fastidious at avoiding neat moral binaries when analysing such daily catastrophes. “To do the work of being awake,” her novel points out, “one has to live in a dual space.” So naturally, although Man points out (not incorrectly) that empirical and structuralist thinking hamper free, individual thought, those are the very tools with which his female colleagues are liberating themselves. When Man desires community, he is driven to leave a city full of people. But he does so in pursuit of a rural existence that decades of teaching transcendentalism in the city have left him ill-equipped for. Hence, when he imagines a “simple” existence, more in tune with nature, his easiest option is to seek out the country house of a rich woman with a “life like the inside of a golden egg”.“It was either a shrewd, self-aware intelligence I had achieved that kept me in synch with the darkness of life, or a kind of illogical, misanthropic paranoia … which held me back from happiness,” Man reflects in a semi-hallucinatory state towards the end of the novel. The extent to which his fate is a highly ironic comeuppance or a beautiful kind of salvation very much depends on the reader’s own sensibilities. At a mere 152 pages long, Goodman’s book is a perfect fairytale for our times.Helen of Nowhere by Makenna Goodman is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

Well, as far as Mewgenics is concerned, you can forget it – and you can also forget the idea that a game about cats has to be in any way cute. These kitties are red in tooth and claw, prone to strange mutations, and strictly limited to just the one life, which often ends swiftly and brutally.Such is the nature of roguelike, a format that has spawned some of the biggest indie hits of the past 20 years. In these games, failure is permanent; dying sends you back not to the last checkpoint but back to the beginning, the game reshuffling its elements into a new shape for your next run. And so it goes in Mewgenics. You gather a party of four felines and send them out on a questing journey, from which they return victorious or not at all.Down in the sewers, Joyce, the tabby mage, gets trampled to death by a blob-monster. Shortly afterwards, Fulbert, with his Bagpuss-like markings and full beard, is exploded from within by maggots that have infested his guts. That’s the last you’ll ever see of either of them. But the pair enjoyed one magical evening together before shipping off to war, leaving behind a kitten with that telltale pink-and-white patterning (and some promising stats), ready for the next go-around.These emergent family sagas are told in the second of Mewgenics’ two modes: a pet sim – think Tamagotchi meets Love Island – where you furnish your cutaway-diagram home and grab cats by the scruff to drag them between rooms. As well as matchmaking partners who may produce the next generation of warriors, you’re trying to separate love rivals – whose scraps are yet another way these cats can meet their end – and members of the same family.View image in fullscreenA post-South Park teenage edgelord aesthetic …  Mewgenics’ cats in between battles.Photograph: Edmund McMillen/Tyler GlaielIf you find the title’s pun distasteful, be warned that it’s an accurate indication of the profoundly tasteless humour that awaits within. Expect an awful lot of poop, undeveloped foetuses and pussy-related single entendres, as well as sections where you watch cats in flagrante (the humping animation can, at least, be turned off). The game’s real shock value, though, is subtler and sharper: it’s in how quickly you grow accustomed to checking the litter from last night’s romantic encounters, then dumping any kittens with subpar stats or inbred birth defects.The game’s developers, Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, came up through the early 00s Flash game scene, the heyday of Newgrounds and Happy Tree Friends, and never really grew out of it. Coming to their work, you have to be willing to accept the post-South Park teenage edgelord aesthetic as part of the package.All that may put you off Mewgenics, and fair enough. But beneath its icky surface you’ll find a game of rare depth and variety. The pet sim is a sideshow, really, to the turn-based battles, which play out like a mashup of chess, D&D and Pokémon. You move your cats around a 10x10 board, looking for ways to leverage the particular combination of abilities and obstacles in front of you. Say you’ve got one cat with a lightning attack, another with a hosepipe, and a third who likes to be electrocuted. With careful positioning, and a basic understanding of water’s conductive properties, in a single turn you can zap multiple enemies and charge up your electrophilic moggy for the next turn.View image in fullscreenPokémon meets chess … a battle scene in Mewgenics.Photograph: Edmund McMillen/Tyler GlaielThese eureka moments are frequent, because Mewgenics is constantly throwing new things at you: locations, enemies, classes, abilities, weather conditions, one-off events. McMillen’s previous game, The Binding Of Isaac, launched in 2011 – one of the forerunners of the modern roguelike sensation – and is still being updated and expanded today. At launch, Mewgenics feels as if it has already benefited from years’ worth of tinkering.What’s impressive is not just the quantity of content but how elegantly it all interlocks. I’ve recently unlocked two new classes, the nature-loving druid and the meat hook-slinging butcher. An unlikely partnership, perhaps, but experimenting yields a discovery: a synergy between the former’s ability to talk to other creatures and the latter’s ability to spawn flies from the rotten meat they carve off their enemies. For the rest of the run, my cats can sit back and let their insectoid-plague army do all the hard work.These stars may align on your 100th run, or your 1,000th, or never. According to the save screen, after 60 hours, I’ve seen less than athirdof what this game has to offer. Mewgenics is built to fill every moment you’re willing to give it.Mewgenics is out 10 February; $29.99/£24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who wouldn’t want to see the formerBake Offstar, after “30 years in our living rooms”, put on such a show? But it’s not quite what Perkins delivers. Like Dawn French before her, ina touring setpurporting to show what a “huge twat” she was, The Eternal Shame of Sue Perkins compiles a series of perky professional and personal anecdotes only loosely connected to that theme, and is judicious with its intimacies.It is stronger in its second half, which cleaves more tightly to the theme and affords more glimpses behind our host’s brisk demeanour. Act one begins with Perkins alluding to her shame at being middle-aged and tired in an industry dedicated to youthful vigour. The ensuing anecdotes have nothing to do with that whatsoever, as she relates an inconclusive tale about local drug dealers cloning her car registration, and a literal shaggy dog story, more suggestive of pride than shame, about rescuing a wounded pup on a trip to Bolivia.In neither instance, one senses, does Perkins let truth get in the way of a lively comic yarn. And she certainly tells them well, embroidering each with lurid details of her own ineptitude. See for example the bilious tale, all sobs and dry heaves, of a drug-addled trip for telly to a South American shaman. That skit is not alone in parlaying Perkins’ public life into comedy: another fineDave Gorman-esque routine, about a story she wrote for a celebrity anthology, obsesses over the statistical likelihood of “being bummed by a Dyson”.But, away from the showbiz world, the show’s most striking passage is about the breakdown Perkins experienced a decade ago courtesy of a benign tumour on her pituitary gland, pitching her into “a posh One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” scenario, vividly outlined here. The rest of the show, all jaunty tales of skin-deep self-abasement, is entertaining enough. But here alone are her protective Russian-doll shells stripped away, and something more meaningful revealed.AtLeeds Playhouseon 6 February.

Beware of the silhouetted hands!Arifa AkbarFri 6 Feb 2026 11.09 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.38 ESTShareThere is a twinkling irony to the setup of Tim Foley’s ghost story: an out of work actor is enlisted to play the role of a ghost for a week, only to become haunted himself. Joe (George Naylor) is employed by David, a handsome stranger, to circle the grounds of Paragon Hall in order to perpetuate the myth of the country estate’s resident restless soul.What a great gig – he can pay off at his debts with what he earns and exercise his actorly muscles. Of course, Joe gradually begins to wonder if he is the only ghost walking through the woodlands surrounding Paragon Hall, but this drama by touring company ThickSkin does not go the way you think it may. It blends the gothicism of a 19th-century literary haunting with modern horror film jumps and bumps.View image in fullscreenBringing the tingle … It Walks Around the House at Night.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThe storytelling is channelled largely though Joe’s narration, although there is also prerecorded omniscient narration by Paul Hilton, and you savour it for its atmospheric eloquence. The gothic gloom of Paragon Hall looks like “the ancient valley howled and spat out this house”, he says, and later reflects on why ghosts persist in wandering the Earth: “Some say it’s because they hurt so much. I think it’s out of spite.”It is phrases like these that bring the tingle in award-winning writer Foley’s script, alongside the jump scares, of course. Deftly directed by Neil Bettles, these are created by stabs of sound, light and projection (sound design by Pete Malkin, and lighting and video design by Joshua Pharo). The stage features a back screen of bare tree trunks that shift and shake with shadows (set design by Bettles and Tom Robbins).There are some genuinely spine-tingling moments, from Joe’s creepy somnambulism to a scuttling creature in his room and a bigger “thing” whose silhouetted hands resemble Freddy Krueger’s.This entity is more of the natural world, though, with a Pan-like mythology around it. The story becomes excitingly twisty, but revelations towards the end come thick and fast and you cannot always keep up. The Dancer (Oliver Baines) emerges from the woods to tell Joe his story; Joe’s friends turn up; and David brings his own storyline, as does an ex-boyfriend.A lot is fit into 90 minutes without enough unpacking of the supernatural “hurt” here, or the bigger themes of class privilege and exploitation that run through the play. But the show is certainly worth experiencing for its thrills and spills, which stay with you, and follow you home.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 7 February.

Centred on a group of teens who have decided that tonight is the night their sex lives finally get moving, it’s a tornado of growing pains and pretence at pleasure.It’s a Friday night, and best friends – and virgins – Chloe (Anushka Chakravarti) and Jess (Ella Bruccoleri) are getting ready to go “out out” for the first time. Joined by their gossip-hoarding friend Phoebe (played by a hysterical Molly Hewitt-Richards), who panics at even the mention of physical contact, they brush their teeth and straighten their hair in anticipation of Anya (Zoë Armer) from the year above arriving to teach them all they need to know. Even better, Chloe’s brother Joel (Ragevan Vasan), who practically shrinks when a girl enters, and his “really, really fit” friend Mel (Alec Boaden) are next door playing video games. With no parents at home and vodka mixers at the ready, the night is a recipe for success.Battye’s script has each room discussing the other as if it contains strange wild animals. The girls gather in the doorway, gawping and gasping at the boys staring at the TV screen, while Anya hands out advice in an effort to assert her power. Sexual experience is currency here, and Chakravarti’s perfectly judged Chloe works hard to impress Anya with fabricated stories and artificial confidence, shunning her true friends in the process. Elsewhere, Joel follows Mel’s advice as if it were drawn from a golden rulebook.View image in fullscreenUnfolding like a horror film … the cast of The Virgins.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe threat of men is never far from view: Phoebe can barely summon words when a boy enters the room, and the girls plan signals to alert one another if they find themselves in uncomfortable situations. Still, desire bubbles beneath their half-open conversations. Watching them perform at adulthood is a queasy, stomach-churning experience.Directed by Jaz Woodcock-Stewart, the play unfolds like a horror film in short, sharp bursts. Between scenes, the stage drops into darkness as dramatic orchestral music blares. When the lights return, each moment feels poised on a cliff-edge, even if some key elements – the rumours surrounding Anya, or the roots of Mel’s speech about feeling let down by women – are left unexplained.Still, Battye’s strength lies in writing scenes that feel utterly authentic. If you’ve lived through the awkward choreography of nights like these, The Virgins lands uncomfortably close to home.AtSoho theatre, London, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The keenness of these two perceptual windows is one reason to believe this really is the self-portrait of the artist who put observation at the centre of painting for the first time in history. No one before had ever painted real faces with the clarity Van Eyck here gives his own. We see not only his lucid eyes but the wrinkles under them, together with the stubble on his chin, flare of his nostril, a shadow under his nose, the pursed lips – all these stark fleshy facts decorated and set off by the magical red swathing of his extravagant headdress that proclaims pride in his success and fame. Van Eyck even adds a motto, “As I can”, and in an age when artists rarely signed their works he does so with bold emphasis: “Jan van Eyck made me on 21st October 1433.” That’s nearly 600 years ago.

Best picture and best actor, for its star Wagner Moura (who recently won a Golden Globe), are two of the four categories in which it will compete at next month’s Oscars.The nominations haven’t yet been announced when I meet Moura in a London hotel room, but it is unlikely they will have turned the head of this seasoned 49-year-old. He has years of experience: he headlined the Elite Squad thrillers, played Pablo Escobar in the streaming hitNarcos, and joined Parker Posey as husband-and-wife assassins in the TV version ofMr & Mrs Smith. He exudes relaxed, matinee idol charisma, as well as the same air of decency and humility as Armando, his character in The Secret Agent. A widowed academic hiding out in a refugees’ safe house in Recife at the height of the dictatorship in 1977, Armando is plotting to flee Brazil on a fake passport. To do so, he will need to outrun the hitmen hired to kill him by a vengeful industrialist.If Moura is ice-cube-cool, that goes double for the film’s unexcitable 57-year-old director, Kleber Mendonça Filho. Seated beside his leading man today, he has the shrewd gaze and thin, amused lips of Peter Sellers. “Yes!” agrees Moura when I draw the comparison. Filho responds with a nod and a perfectly unimpressed, Sellers-like murmur: “I’ve heard that before.”View image in fullscreen‘In the film, you’ve got an honest man who doesn’t follow the script’ … Wagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: 2025 CinemaSco’pio/MK ProductionBoth men have already amassed a fair few trinkets between them, beginning with best actor and director at last year’s Cannes festival. The roaring success of The Secret Agent must feel to them as much like a vindication as a victory. Though historical in one sense, it is also a response to a turbulent and harrowing decade in Brazilian politics, and the personal bruising that they have sustained: professional prohibitions, smear campaigns, even death threats.Their friendship stretches back two decades, to the days when Filho was a film critic. He and Moura got on famously at Cannes in 2005, and kept chatting once their interview was over. “My wife took a picture of him,” Moura says.They bonded over their shared origins in the beleaguered north-east of Brazil, a region mocked and belittled by those in the south-east. “There’s still a lot of prejudice towards us. As an actor, if you go to work in Rio or Sao Pãulo with this accent, you get relegated to playing the funny guy or the doorman. My attitude, and Kleber’s too, is: ‘Fuck this. Fuck you.’” There is a cost to speaking out, especially where politics is concerned. “The Secret Agent is a result of something that we both …” He weighs up his words. “I don’t want to say, ‘the price we paid’, but it wasn’t easy to be vocal about Bolsonaro.”The actor and director lost touch. But years later, when Filho’s short films trickled out into the world, followed byNeighbouring Sounds, his itchy, unnerving 2012 debut feature about class tensions in a residential Recife suburb, Moura’s ears pricked up. “Neighbouring Sounds had such a sense of danger. There might just be a scene of two people talking, but you feel something terrible is about to happen, as if the roof might fall in. I was like: ‘Hey, I know that guy!’” The friendship was reignited.Kleber and I are being attacked in Brazil right now. There are stories saying we received millions of dollars from the governmentIn subsequent years, the waters grew choppy for both men, as well as for their country. Filho was pilloried at home after he and the cast of his second feature,Aquarius, brandished signs at its 2016 Cannes premiere to protest againstthe impeachment of Brazil’s then-president, Dilma Rousseff. That protest, Filho says now, “was one of the proudest moments of my life”. The director’s masterpiece, Aquarius concerns an indomitable ageing writer (Sônia Braga) standing her ground against rapacious property developers; no wonder it played at the time like a metaphor for the unspooling crisis. The movie was duly blocked from being Brazil’s official entry at the Oscars.Around the same time, Moura wrote a newspaper article warning of an impending coup d’état and taking aim at the judge Sérgio Moro, whom the UN human rights committee later confirmed had been biased in his rulings. “I was attacked for that article,” Moura says gravely. “I received death threats. It was hardcore.”View image in fullscreenA scene from The Secret Agent.Photograph: 2025 CinemaSco’pio/MK ProductionIn 2019, Moura made his own directorial debut withMarighella, a film about the Brazilian revolutionary Carlos Marighella, who the CIA considered the new Che Guevara before being killed by the military dictatorship. After premiering in Berlin 50 years after Marighella’s assassination, the film was kicked into the long grass by Bolsonaro’s government; it remained unreleased for more than two years. “It was cynically and unofficially sabotaged,” says Filho. “And Wagner will never get an explanation. That’s where Kafka comes in.” Bewilderment flickers across Moura’s face: “You can’t fight it because you don’t exactly know what’s happened.”Out of this friendship, and a mutual experience of persecution, emerged The Secret Agent. “In the film, you’ve got an honest man who doesn’t follow the script,” the director explains. I had earlier described the campaign against Armando as “low level”, at least until the hitmen get involved, but Filho takes issue with that. “It may not yield a car chase. Or someone turning the ignition and a car blowing up. But the persecution is incredibly destructive. Some people have the pleasure of making you lose sleep by planting things in newspapers.”He is speaking from experience. “Stories, say, about the use of public funding for a film you have done. Even though funding for the arts is in the Brazilian constitution.” Moura explains: “Kleber and I are being attacked in Brazil right now. There are stories saying we received millions of dollars from the Brazilian government to support them.”Facts are beside the point. The intention is to suggest corruption. “If you express yourself in a time when democracy is running on fumes, the attacks can be pervasive, brutal and cruel,” says Filho. “They’re not low level at all. I could have shown Wagner’s character being taken to the police precinct and given electric shocks to his genitals all night.” Moura raises a finger: “I’ve done that film!” he laughs. Filho continues: “But the dictatorship manifested itself in many ways.”View image in fullscreenSurrounded by friends or enemies?Some are comically grotesque. In the 1970s, an urban legend circulated in Recife about a disembodied leg attacking people at night. A scapegoat for the violence meted out by the military police, it started being mentioned in the press as a kind of countercultural code. If you were in the know, it would be clear when reading these stories in the morning paper that the “hairy leg” referred surreptitiously to the regime’s violence. Rendered in jerky stop-motion in The Secret Agent, the hairy leg has been a runaway – or hop-away – hit. Nine months on from Cannes, it is still being mentioned. This leg has legs.The sounds we record, the pictures we take – this is all time travel to people who find it in the futureDid he foresee that it would become a kind of shorthand or symbol for his movie, much like the bunny in Fatal Attraction or the semen hair gel in There’s Something About Mary? “It is oneof the things people mention,” he concedes, then points out that attention has also been paid to the opening sequence, in which Armando steers his yellow VW Beetle into a dusty petrol station only to find a corpse, several days old, lying in the forecourt. “Many have also praised Wagner’s amazing performance,” he reminds me, exercising a special skill he has of upbraiding you without doing so explicitly; it is more that he invites you to feel disappointed in yourself. I apologise to Moura for suggesting that his work had been eclipsed by a hopping limb, but the actor laughs it off. “It’s like: ‘What the fuck?’ That leg is crazy. It’s crazy and it’shairy. So hairy.” He’s not wrong.Why a T-shirt in a hit movie is trending with Brazilian progressives: ‘Almost every day they sell out’Read moreIn mixing political commentary and meticulous period detail with these B-movie-style touches, Filho is working in the spirit of John Sayles, the US indie pioneer who was equally adept at exploitation shockers (he wrote Piranha, Alligator and The Howling) and conscientious liberal dramas (directing Matewan, City of Hope and Lone Star). Sayles, a friend of Filho’s, is thanked at the end of The Secret Agent, but the difference is that Filho doesn’t demarcate his impulses. They’re plaited together in his films – especially the new picture and his grisly modern western, Bacurau (co-directed by Juliano Dornelles). His all-time top 10 may include masterpieces by Chantal Akerman and Werner Herzog but it also makes room for Mad Max 2, a scuzzy fly in the arthouse ointment.Cinephilia and politics are vital to The Secret Agent, but nothing is more integral to its character than an alertness to history, a determination to memorialise struggle and injustice. Some way into the film, there is a flash-forward to modern-day researchers transcribing recordings of Armando’s voice. “That gives the story a different point of view, and amplifies its power,” Filho explains. “It’s the whole idea of making a time-travel film without a time machine. You go in the time machine and sparks come out and you’re back in, say, 1927. But we’re also travelling through time right now as people. The sounds we record, the pictures we take – this is all time travel to people who find it in the future. My mother was a historian and I think she implanted this feeling in me.”‘I hope he goes to jail’: Brazil’s Cannes-winning director on Bolsonaro and political amnesiaRead moreIn an era when governmental lies and misinformation have grown too routine to be shocking, The Secret Agent could not feel more relevant. “The way these autocrats are discrediting journalists, people getting information from social media,” says Moura, “it scares the shit out of me.” More crucial than ever, then, to not be muzzled. “I don’t think you can be a serious artist and go through life without exposing your views on things,” Filho says. “If you keep quiet, you will not have my respect.”Aren’t actors discouraged from speaking out? “They are,” says Moura, more sympathetic to those who don’t than his friend. “It’s not easy. I don’t like it when actors are pressured to say shit. Not everybody is ready. I’ve been advised not to say certain things.” Would he be discouraged from speaking out today against, say, the actions of the current US president? “Yes. Right now, I’m being very discouraged.” A twinkle. “But I’ll keep saying it, right?”The Secret Agent is in UK cinemas from 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmOscars 2026BrazilinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, selling out justonenight there might seem a bit underwhelming. Raye and Olivia Dean will play six nights apiece at the 20,000-capacity hall this year; Dave is playing four, Ariana Grande is playing a whopping 10. Harry Styles, never one to be outdone, last month announced a staggering 30 dates at New York’s Madison Square Garden, with more than 11 million people applying for presale access, as well as a record-breaking 12 nights at Wembley stadium: the most on a single leg of a tour.Taylor Swiftmanaged a mere eight.Swift’s Eras tour, which made more than $2bn (£1.6bn), doesn’t seem a complete outlier any more: Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour has lasted four years and made $1.5bn, and the Weeknd’s After Hours Til Dawn tour is also four years deep and has crossed the $1bn mark. It’s even de rigueur for world leaders to get involved in the fight for tickets, with the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, asking the South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, to help book more BTS shows in her country, just as the then Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, publicly asked Swift to come to Canada. Meanwhile, the Singaporean governmentpaid for Swift’s six showsin the country to be a south-east Asia exclusive.Styles and Swift now have generations of ultra-devoted fans who will come and see them each time they tour. But that doesn’t fully account for the scale of the demand. Why is it that the big stars feel bigger than ever, and are they in danger of overshadowing the rest of the live music industry?View image in fullscreenEye-popping … Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball at the O2 Arena, London, September 2025.Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Live NationEmma Bownes, senior vice-president of venue programming at AEG – the world’s second largest events company after Live Nation – says that “post-Covid, there was so much pent-up demand that when arenas and stadiums could open, there was this surge of people who wanted to experience that again”. Last year was the busiest ever for the AEG-operated O2 Arena, which hosted 239 shows, and Bownes doesn’t anticipate any slowdown. “We’re looking at a really busy 2026, and we’re booking 2027 right now.” Because of demand, she says “agents and promoters are booking their tours a lot further in advance than they used to, and they’re utilising parts of the calendar that they didn’t previously. Artists used to play festivals in August, but in August this year we have 10 shows with Ariana; we have Summer Walker, A$AP Rocky.”Archie Marks, a 20-year-old university student from Birmingham, is one of those driving the demand: he says he goes to “most of the big arena pop concerts that a lot of gays attend”, and estimates that he went to about one arena show a month in 2025, as well as a few stadium shows over the course of the year. Going to concerts is expensive, of course, and Marks says he “doesn’t really spend much money on clothes or anything and I keep my food shop to bare essentials”, with nearly the entirety of his disposable income from hospitality and teaching work goes towards tickets. He suggests that the increase in these events’ popularity “has a lot to do with TikTok”, particularly because clips of artists bringing out special guests, or debuting new songs, tend to go viral on the platform, “creating fomo”, which leads to more demand for tickets.Marks uses his younger sister as an example. “I love her to death, but she has like, no music taste – she’ll listen to musical theatre albums, and that’s it,” he says. But when Sabrina Carpenter toured the UK in 2025, his sister wanted to go to the show, despite being “really tuned out” from Carpenter’s actual music. Same goes, he says, for Styles’s forthcoming tour. “It’s that social media thing of having access to something that no one else has, or wanting to be the first person to have access to it,” he says.One artist manager I speak to on condition of anonymity – whose background is in live events and works with an arena-selling artist – says a sought-after ticket has become “a status symbol: to say you were at the Eras tour or Beyoncé, that’s huge.” While she feels that the demand for tickets “is good for the music industry”, she worries about smaller artists on her roster, who are still playing theatres and clubs, and whose gigs fans might forgo in order to attend higher-priced arena shows. “Some of those tickets are like $600. It just takes money out of people’s pockets, and in the US, there’s only so much money to go around.”View image in fullscreenHarry Styles plays the MGM Grand Garden arena, September 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Photograph: Anthony Pham/via Getty ImagesMore artists such as Styles are opting for residency tours, in which they might settle at one arena or stadium for a few nights at a time, just asAdele did with 10 consecutive dates in Munich in 2024. Residency shows require slightly less muscle, as a show’s elaborate staging and production only has to be set up and packed down once. Such shows move the cost of travel on to the consumer, rather than the artist’s own touring production, meaning further financial outlay for fans.Because of those costs, Marks says that when artists are playing arenas and stadiums, and charging “triple figure” prices, “I would expect a budget” – meaning high production values, with dancers, costuming, stage sets and more. Last year, he was impressed by Lady Gaga’s eye-popping, ornate Mayhem Ball, but felt somewhat shortchanged by a Lana Del Rey stadium concert in Cardiff. “I paid a bit more for Lana, and you couldn’t see where the budget had gone necessarily – the staging wasn’t very impressive, the setlist was a lot shorter,” he says. “I felt like my money wasn’t going towards something, whereas with Gaga, I felt that.”The artist manager says that the arena-sized band she works with feels this pressure from fans. “People are so easily distracted these days – you actually have to put money into production. There’s an expectation of more than just a band putting on a tight show.” This isn’t always easy, she adds, especially because costs of touring have remained high post-Covid, and require a team that can sometimes balloon into the hundreds, with specialist lighting techs, managers, stagehands and more required to navigate bespoke production. “Even at a huge scale, if your tour is grossing millions of dollars, these production costs are insane. It’s not like these [artists] are getting super rich off it.” She says the high-level, social-media-friendly spectacle of these shows is putting pressure on indie artists to up their production, too: “People aren’t coming in expecting to see just a band any more.”View image in fullscreenTaking a stand … Olivia Dean called out the policies of the big ticket-selling platforms.Photograph: Daniel DeSlover/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockAriel King, a reporter for the live music trade publication Pollstar, says that in the US, the industry-wide demand for concerts has actually “tapered off” of late, and suggests there are more stadium and arena shows because big artists “are the people that can afford to tour consistently”. It’s tough for mid-level artists touring theatre venues, who are “not getting quite as much of a gross, have limited production, but the costs are still high” – whereas economies of scale kick in at the arena and stadium level.Even if bands do pull out all the stops, there’s no guarantee fans are going to be happy. There was a marked backlash to Styles’s tour announcement, with some fans complaining that there was an unreasonable jump in prices compared with previous tours: for Wembley Stadium, standing tickets were at least £144, and while some seats were as low as £44, others cost more than 10 times that.Olivia Deantook Ticketmaster, Live Nation and AEG to task late last year after tickets to her US tour, which sold out in minutes, appeared on resale outlets at massively inflated prices (a practice the UK government announced in November it planned to make illegal). The artist manager says that it’s “damn near impossible” to mount large-scale shows without using a large ticketing service such as Ticketmaster, because of the contracts venues have with certain providers. “I was so happy to see Olivia Dean standing up to ticketing services,” she says. “I think it’s going to take more and more artists speaking out and coming together and boycotting these services, because they have a monopoly.”Screen and heard: is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?Read moreNevertheless, fans are still trying their hardest to secure tickets to certain shows; Marks says his mother was “somewhere around 300,000th” in the queue for tickets to see Styles in London. But just because a show boasts a global superstar, it doesn’t mean it’s necessarily better. “I went to see Perfume Genius for like, £15 in Manchester,” Marks says, “and it was one of the best gigs I’ve ever been to,” he says. “It was just him, and his band, and a chair. And it wasimmense.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryHarry StylesTaylor SwiftBTSOlivia DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Right-wing critics raged over the musician’s gender-nonconforming style, Spanish-language music and anti-Maga politics. Donald Trump, after saying he had never heard of Bad Bunny, called the headlining choice “absolutely ridiculous”.Fans race to learn Spanish before Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showRead moreIn response, Erika Kirk and her Turning Point USA conservative advocacy group turned the controversy into its own counter-programming event: the All-American Halftime Show. After its Nashville-heavy lineup, led by Kid Rock, was announced on Monday, vice-president JD Vance was first among conservatives to enthusiastically spread the word.In the main, the alt-cast is meant to be Turning Point’s most defiant gesture yet, a massive middle finger to leftist values – and perhaps it would be if one of the Blackest shows on TV hadn’t pulled it off first and best. “We stole the audience,” the actor Marlon Wayanssaid recently. “And the next year, they were like, ‘Y’all are never doingthatagain.’”In 1990 a new sketch comedy called In Living Colorsplatteredon to the then fledgling Fox network. Riding the momentum of a film career that included writing and producing credits on Eddie Murphy Raw, In Living Color creator Keenen Ivory Wayans set the show in SNL’s blindspot, bringing Black culture, ethnic nuance and queer sensibilities to the fore with a fearless, streetwise edge. The In Living Color cast was a photo negative of the typical SNL lineup – a mix of future stars (Jamie Foxx, David Alan Grier), Wayans family members (Marlon and Damon, an SNL castoff) and DEI hires (Jim Carrey); Jennifer Lopez got her showbiz start on the show as a Fly Girls dancer.View image in fullscreenDamon Wayans as Homey D Clown (center) on season two of In Living Color.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn Living Color sketches didn’t just land; they became national refrains that echoed across break rooms and schoolyards, perhaps none more inescapable than Damon Wayans’ angry-clown punchline: “Homie don’t play that.” The show was a rap vanguard, booking Public Enemy, Queen Latifah and more hip-hop acts at a time when the big three networks were still cagey about young Black performers.Keenen’s bizarro SNL quickly became as big as its inspiration, drawing 12 million viewers a week on Sunday primetime – a major TV night in those days. But of course it wasn’t as watched as the NFL, a TV property that Fox honcho Rupert Murdoch desperately wanted for his young network.I don’t know anyone who likes half-time except for the parents of the children marching on the fieldKeenen Ivory WayansDuring In Living Color’s first season, a marketing impresario named Jay Coleman approached Fox with an idea that would draw even bigger ratingsandstick it to CBS, the NFL rights holder andSuper Bowlcarrier that Murdoch had in his sights: a special episode of In Living Color that would air opposite the Super Bowl intermission.The Super Bowl half-time spectacular was ripe for the picking back then – “the time that everybody went to pee”, as Keenenput it to ESPNin 2021. “They create a half-time show for the 100,000 people in the stadium that I don’t think translates that well to the small screen,” Coleman said in 1991. Even worse, the performances were deathly dull – a hodgepodge of dusty nostalgia acts and earnest marching bands, preceded by a monotone speech from the NFL commissioner. “I don’t know anyone who likes half-time except for the parents of the children marching on the field,” Keenen said in a 1992 LA Times interview ahead of his warring broadcast.The theme for the 1992 Super Bowl half-time was “Winter Magic” – an ode to the forthcoming winter Olympics in Albertville, France. The showstopper was a figure skating routine between American sweethearts Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano set to live music from – wait for it –Gloria Estefan. “Why would you feature a singer from the Miami Sound Machine in a show called ‘Winter Magic’?” a Hartford Courant reviewer wondered afterward.In Living Color not only promised a friskier production – live and taped sketches, Color Me Badd singing their monster R&B hit I Wanna Sex You Up – but also cut-rate prices for advertisers. Frito-Lay paid $2m forexclusive rightsto In Living Color’s Super Bowl Halftime Party, money that would have barely covered a 75-second ad on the CBS telecast. “Cute” was how George F Schweitzer, a senior flack for CBS,describedFox’s Super Bowl subterfuge, believing it would only “appeal to the people who watch In Living Color”.The country found out just how wrong Schweitzer was on 26 January 1992, when Buffalo met Washington at the Metrodrome in Minneapolis for Super Bowl XXVI. As the teams trudged off the field for the opening of Winter Magic, In Living Color went live on Fox, its full cast cramming on to the stage and turning SNL’s closing curtain on its head. Carrey started by revealing a 26-minute countdown clock at the left bottom corner of the screen that would let viewers know when to switch back for the second half. “You won’t miss any of the senseless brutality!”In Living Color carried the football theme through its Homeboy Shopping Network and Fire Marshal Bill parodies. But nothing shocked like the Men on Football sketch: playing a flamboyantly gay Siskel and Ebert style culture critic alongside Grier, Damon improvised jokes that amplified damaging sexual rumors about Richard Gere as well as Carl Lewis, slipping past the censors’ five-second delay. (The joke was quickly scrubbed from future versions of the episode.) And while some viewers took offense – “We are angry but not surprised,” Glaad’s Chris Fowler said – the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. “It made me forget how much money my husband was losing [on the game],” one New York woman said in a letter to Syracuse’s Post-Standard newspaper.We [at the league] said, ‘This isn’t going to ever happen again’Jim SteegBut the final ratings were the big headline. Altogether, 22 million people switched from CBS to Fox for the In Living Color alt-cast, outdrawing Winter Magic and cratering ratings for the second half. Washington dominating the game didn’t help.The NFL was shook. “We [at the league] said, ‘This isn’t going to ever happen again,’” Jim Steeg, formerly the NFL’s senior vice-president of special events, told ESPN. “We had identified who we wanted to go after [for the next half-time show] by March. And we met with Michael Jackson’s agent.” At the very next Super Bowl in Pasadena, when Buffalo and Dallas ducked inside, the king of pop appeared at the 50-yard line and soaked in the adulation from the capacity Rose Bowl crowd before breaking into his jock anthem, Jam. A record 133 million viewers tuned in from the US alone.Bald eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd: is Budweiser’s all-American Super Bowl ad serious?Read moreThe Super Bowl half-time has been appointment television ever since. And after Kendrick Lamar’s politically charged half-time topped Michael Jackson’s record-setting viewership last year, it will take a whole lot of fireworks from Kirk and Co to compete with Bad Bunny – athree-time winner at last Sunday’s Grammys(his Spanish-language record Debí Tirar Más Fotos took album of the year) who headlined one of the world’s top tours in spite of his decision to not perform inside the continental US in protest of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. All the while the NFL has held firm in its choice.“Listen,Bad Bunnyis one of the great artists in the world,” commissioner Roger Goodell said in his annual pre-game news conference on Monday. “That’s one of the reasons we chose him. But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that.”THE LINEUP FOR THE ALL-AMERICAN HALFTIME SHOW IS HERE! 🔥Watch Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett THIS SUNDAY 🇺🇸pic.twitter.com/xwurEhdB13— Turning Point USA (@TPUSA)February 2, 2026Ultimately, the In Living Color half-time show was a one-and-done. The series itself didn’t last much longer, going off the air in 1994 after five seasons. Not even Chris Rock joining the cast in season five, fresh off being fired by SNL, could save the show that had become a cultural touchstone. Most of the stars had moved on: the entire Wayans family departed by the end of season four, with Keenen citing business and creative control as his reasons. But Fox, which would slowly pivot from theBlack-led shows that built the networkto chase broader viewership, had already lined up programming to more than make up for any Sunday ratings slack.In 1993 Fox wrested CBS’s NFL broadcast package in a $1.6bn deal. Four years later, the Super Bowl landed on Bart Simpson’s network; in 2020 Fox carried the game again, with Shakira co-headlining alongside Jennifer Lopez – the original Fly Girl. No doubt for hardcore In Living Color fans, the show’s heavy hand in shaping that entire spectacle was unmissable.Turning Point is hardly the first to crib a page from In Living Color’s Super Bowl playbook. Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, the pay-per-view Lingerie Bowl and even SNL have all tried to snatch viewers orbiting the big game. But only In Living Color has managed to pull off the greatest audience heist in American television history. Kirk and Kid Rock have their work cut out.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionSuper BowlUS sportsTV comedyComedyTelevisionBad BunnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brands such asFalke,HeistandSwedish Stockingsshould last longer than a supermarket three-pack.Take care when putting them on, avoiding rough shoes and sharp nails, and for washing put them in a “mesh laundry bag, always on a cold, gentle cycle”, says Sargent, and never tumble-dry – “heat weakens the fibres and causes ladders”.If tights do ladder, clear nail polish is OK in the moment. Then, for a loved pair,Karen Bentley-Brown, founder ofSimply Repair South Lakes/Kendal repair cafe, thinks darning is worth the effort. “Be sure to pick a very fine yarn to match the tights,” she says.How do I keep my whites white?As someone who often sneaks striped tops into the whites wash, I needed to hear this and maybe you do too: “Wash your whites only with other whites,” saysRajiv Surendra, who shares his skills in “the domestic arts” with his 380,000-plus YouTube subscribers. “You have to be strict about that.” A white T-shirt with a “decal or something ironed on … that’s tricky,” he says. “I assess the ratio of white to anything else. If it’s more than half, I’d put that garment in the lights.”When washing, Surendra suggests the hottest water possible; historically, he says, people boiled whites. Idriz Ade fromHaywards, a dry cleaner in Belgravia, London, says overusing detergent can cause greying, so stick to the amount stated on the packaging.If your whites need brightening, Surendra cautions against bleaching. He recommendsMrs Stewart’s Bluinginstead to maintain that boxfresh blue-white.Iwan Carrington, the cleaning guru on the BBC’sSort Your Life Out, has a separate laundry basket for his whites and uses lemon juice for a pre-soak, as well as half a cup of white vinegar, which you can “chuck in your wash”. For upcycler and fashion activistOrsola de Castro, “there is nothing better than the sun. I sunbathe anything that is white.”If underarms look grimy, Surendra recommendsShout Advanced Ultra Concentrated Gel, and Sargent suggests an old tailoring trick: sewing a cotton or linen “sweat shield” into the armpit. If you have some sewing skills, you can do this yourself, perhaps with the help of anonline guide. ButEtsyis full of ready-made sweat pads that you could either handstitch or safety pin inside garments. These work well inside jackets, but might not be right for flimsy T-shirts. She also likes white vinegar “as it breaks down deodorant residue and neutralises odours.” She advises “adding it to the fabric softener dispenser occasionally and washing shirts inside out so detergent reaches the underarm”.Surendra advises pre-empting problems: “Start these practices when you acquire something new … it’s very difficult to reverse bad habits.”How do I stop my darksfading?Do yourself a favour from the get-go, says De Castro, and buy quality blacks. It’s a tricky pigment and, she says, a bad black can be spotted even in the shop.“Over-washing is the main cause of fading”, says Sargent, so instead “spot clean marks with a damp cloth and steam clothes in the bathroom to refresh”. When you have to wash them, she advises “turning garments inside out, using a detergent for dark colours and a cold cycle, and avoiding tumble-drying”.For Surendra, separating laundry is as important for darks as it is for whites, because light fibres can fade darks just as dark fibres can dull whites.How do I getrid ofreally tough stains?“Timing is of the essence,” says De Castro, who always carries a little sponge with her. It’s about getting there early and treating it as best you can in the moment.If you’re on the go, dabbing water on it is a great start, but Carrington advises against rubbing, which can spread the stain, and says ideally you’d take the garment off and rinse it under the tap.As to treating stains, Sargent trots through the big ones: for oil and grease (food, makeup), “sprinkle bicarbonate of soda or cornflour to absorb oil, then gently spot wash with washing-up liquid”; for red wine, blot “immediately, then flush with cold water and apply diluted white vinegar or an oxygen-based stain remover”; for sweat and deodorant marks, as well as the white vinegar trick, you can use “bicarbonate of soda paste directly on the stain. Let it sit for 20–30 minutes, then put the garment straight into a cool wash without removing the paste”; for blood, “rinse with cold water only – never hot – then treat with mild soap”; and for ink, “dab carefully with rubbing alcohol or hand sanitiser, placing a cloth underneath to absorb transfer”. Carrington, whose new book,Clean in 15, is full of this type of wisdom, has an “if all else has failed tip”: applying toothpaste. “That can have some really surprising results,” he says.If you truly can’t get a stain out, Smulders-Cohen recommends covering it “creatively through embroidery … or discreetly with a patch”. For Sargent, “If a stain has set or the fabric is delicate, professional stain removal is the safest option.”How do Isave a saggyneck?Ade from Haywards recommends washing delicate garments on cold, gentle cycles, never wringing and drying flat, while Sargent says to “avoid hanging heavy knits and never tumble-dry stretch fabrics”.If clothes do become misshapen, “A hot steam and careful reshape while damp can help,” says Sargent. For a “bacon neck” – when the collar of your T-shirt gets all stretched and crinkly –Toast repairspecialistJessica Smulders-Cohensays “You can sew a very fine elastic into the neckline seam to gently draw it back into shape, but this is best seen as a life-extending measure rather than a perfect fix.”What can we learn from the clothes we buy but never wear? | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashionRead moreDe Castro advises inspecting clothes “as if your life depended on them” before you buy. Aim for quality fabric and take a good look at seams. Turn garments inside out and look for wonky stitches or loose threads.How do Imend holes in socks?Prevention, prevention, prevention. “If socks are wearing thin, it’s always better to darn them before they fully hole,” saysrepair artist Gay Bennett.Luckily, darning is easy to learn and the great thing about socks is “it doesn’t have to be ultra-neat”, says Bentley-Brown. YouTube is rife with helpfulvideosand Bentley-Brown reassures that it’s realistic for someone to watch a few videos and give it a go: “Every YouTube video you look at is slightly different, which tells me there’s no right or wrong way to do it and it’s just about finding your own way.” For a larger hole, an iron-on patch will make more sense. “Reinforcing from the inside is usually more durable than stitching over it,” says Sargent.Then there’s the question of whether mending is worth it. Surendra doesn’t think it is in the case of socks, advising that we should ringfence our finite energy for garments that matter more.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martina Lang/The GuardianHow do I fix holes in knitwear?Knitwear is different. To prevent holes, anti-moth measures are crucial. Sargent says cedar blocks or balls are the most effective natural deterrent (“lightly sand them every few months to reactivate the scent”), while lavender sachets are “nice-smelling but milder; best used alongside cedar”, and mothballs should be avoided as they are toxic and leave a lingering smell.Surendra makes his ownlavender wands. Plus, on sunny, dry days, he opens up his wardrobe and drawers because “clothes moths hate light”.If you do find a hole, “stop wearing immediately to prevent enlargement, and never cut loose threads,” advises Ade. Then, you could try to darn it yourself or seek out a professional.How do I stopmy shirt collarsbecoming worn?Carrington cites a cabin crew hack: hairspray. “The trick is to spray a little on the collar moments before you put it on to stop sweat being absorbed.” Also avoid over-washing and tumble-drying.In terms of storage, Carrington says there’s nothing to stop you putting the collar inserts they are often sold with back in when you hang them, “to maintain shape and structure”. Sargent champions doing up the top button “so the collar sits naturally”. If a collar is looking bedraggled, she says, a tailor can replace it. At Kendal repair cafe, they often do an over-stitch to reinforce tired collars. Or collars can even be flipped, says Smulders-Cohen – “carefully unpicked, turned over and reattached, so the unworn side faces out”.How do Iremove pilling on woollens?Again, prevention is queen.Sargent advises washing wool inside out on a cold cycle and minimising friction from bags and coats, while Bentley-Brown recommends hand-washing when possible.When bobbles do arise, Sargent suggests using “a fabric shaver or wool comb gently, always on a flat surface”. While lots of affordable tools are available, she warns “they can easily cause holes on fine or lightweight knits. When in doubt, go slow, use light pressure, or opt for a wool comb rather than a shaver.”How do I stop zippersbreaking?“Keep zips clean,” say Ade, and to lubricate, “occasionally rub the teeth with graphite or candle wax”, or De Castro recommends soap.Always do up zips before putting clothes in the wash, says Bennett, which “prevents the teeth from getting damaged or catching on other garments”.For a broken zip, it might be worth trying pliers – in Kendal, they have a “magic zip man” who works wonders. “It tends to be that they just get twisted, so they need straightening.” If that fails, a broken zipper can be replaced by your local mender or repair cafe.How do I mend a split seam?“Stop wearing immediately,” say Ade. Simple seams can be hand-stitched, Sargent says: “Turn the garment inside out and stitch along the original seam line using a strong thread, then reinforce the start and end points.” “A simple backstitch works really well,” says Bennett.Be discerning. If your split seam is on a high-street skirt, De Castro says, “go ahead, mend it – no one will notice the difference.” But with top quality clothes, it’s best to go to the experts.How do I remove strong smellsfrom vintageclothes orsports kit?“Soak in a cool solution of water and white vinegar or bicarbonate of soda to break down bacteria,” says Sargent, “and avoid fabric softener, which traps odours.” It may take a couple of soaks as “polyester is particularly good at trapping oils. If the smell lingers, an enzyme-based detergent can be very effective on vintage synthetics.”Carrington advocates for popping things in the freezer in a plastic bag with a bit of bicarbonate of soda. On removal, shake the soda out and then “just chuck in the washing machine”. He also champions spritzing musty clothes with vodka. “Make sure your bottle is on the mist settings,” he says, “so you’re not splattering it with vodka”.How do I stop leather jackets and shoes getting cracked and dull?“Leather, like our own skin, requires some TLC,” saysHus Zekayiof expert cleaners Ace of Suedes. That means regular cleaning and conditioning. The best advice is to never let leather get too wet. If it does, “the most important thing is to let it dry naturally. Never expose it to a heat source as this will immediately cause it to dry out and damage the texture.”Sargent recommends using a leather conditioner or cream because, “while polish is useful for restoring colour and shine, especially on shoes, it doesn’t replace conditioning. And avoid olive and coconut oils – they can darken leather permanently and attract dirt”. Carrington recommendsSaddle Soap, which he applies with a damp cloth or soft brush.Careful storage will also help. As Sargent counsels: “Store away from heat and sunlight – dryness is what causes cracking”.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleRecyclingUnderwear for menUnderwearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s able to hold your packed lunch, flask and book, as well – at a push – as your gym kit. The high street retailer is calling it theIntentional tote bag.According to Carrie Cooper, John Lewis’s senior footwear and accessories designer, it’s “an all-day bag – you can fit your spare shoes, snacks and water bottle in but, rather than a more practical and functional tote, this feels more ‘intentional’ and a decision rather than a basic shopper”. It is, she says, “oversized but not structured”.These “good intention” bags, often deeper and less wide than totes of yore, focus on what they can hold rather than the space they take up. They are everywhere.Marks & Spencer has a suede equivalentandone that comes with ruching and a drawstring. Jigsaw callsits iteration a “shopper”. Me+Em, the brand favoured by the working women of the Labour party, has a 36.5cm-long“soft day bag”.The California climbing brand Gramicci offers a gorpcore version: a 40-litre ripstop tote that would happily hold your mason jar of overnight oats as well as a packable mac. The LA-based, Roman Coppola–founded Pacific Tote Company makes cult sturdy canvas versions beloved of big names such as Anthony Hopkins and Alexa Chung. According to co-founder and creative architect Duffy Culligan, they don’t think of them as “shopping bags” – “they’re more like the co-conspirator of an unplanned adventure”.The good intentions bag is an antidote to the need to carry two receptacles – a handbag for show and a tote for the actual stuff you need. And they might just be the final nail in the coffin for the flimsy totes cluttering up hallways up and down the country. Once hailed as a sustainable alternative to the plastic bag, the average cotton tote, according to theUN environment programme, needs to be used between 50 and 150 times to offset its production, yet in reality less than 10% of totes are used more than three times.“I think there’s a real ‘tote fatigue’ happening right now,” says Culligan. “Everyone’s cities are flooded with flimsy promotional bags – there’s a certain irony to carrying a repurposed grocery tote, but most of those are churned out cheaply in mass factories, and they fall apart in a month.”More often than not conspicuously branded, trumpeting Daunt Books, the New Yorker, or Paris’s Shakespeare and Company, these totes were once understood in the mainstream to semi-innocently signal a cultured outlook. But now, read more performative than quietly impressive.Even the tote 2.0, reinforced, more genuinely reusable and best summed up by theperplexing Trader Joe’s phenomenon– the US grocer’s totes go for about $2.99 at home but thousands on resale sites globally – is arguably on its way out.According to Bridget Dalton, a semiotician and cultural analyst atTruth Consulting, the old fabric totes had obvious practical limitations. They “may indicate your cultural allegiance, but they slip off your shoulder and they’re basically quite rubbish,” she says. By contrast, good intention bags indicate a “dedication to practicality”.Bags have always been loaded with ideas of gender, class and power, and the bags winning in this new accessories dawn are no different.“Big bags are more gender-neutral,” says Dalton, referencingDavid Beckham and the enormous Hermès bag he was spotted toting in Paris last week. They are, she says, “a sartorial stride towards equality; men and women carry[ing] the same stuff”.View image in fullscreenThe ‘ludicrously capacious’ Burberry tote bag in Succession.Photograph: Succession/HBOIn terms of status, Dalton references the“ludicrously capacious” bag insult from Succession. “Even a few years ago, a capacious bag is a signifier of beingdéclassé, lower-class. It’s an embarrassment.”This, she says, is crucial to this notion of good intentions. “Carrying a lot of stuff around is a historically working-class requirement. So, therefore, you have the idea of a good intention as a peasant morality, which is about self-sustaining, self-reliance, but also a rejection of the frivolous.” It’s the opposite of thelate 2010s trend for the intrinsically impractical tiny handbag, barely big enough for a thimble let alone a flask.Unlike the small or non-existent bags of the chauffeured, often failing-upwards characters of Succession, the good intentions bag is, according to Dalton, “a statement that says my identity is not contingent upon other people doing stuff for me. I can be luxe, practical and unpretentious at the same time.”Explore more on these topicsFashionJohn LewisnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Flowers are such an easy win for the gift-giver, too. Whether it’s Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day or “just because”, there’s a plethora of online flower delivery services with a range of offerings. Some provide next-day delivery (great if you’ve forgotten an important date and are scrambling); some will deliver flowers monthly via subscription; some will even slip in a box of chocolates, a bottle of fizz or a candle in the delivery.But which flower delivery services are best? I’m here to answer that for you. I’ve tested dozens of bouquets and done a deep dive into flower freshness and the services’ sustainability, trying my best to find ones that offer British-grown flowers.Remember: if your recipient has pets, check whether the flowers are toxic before sending them (read more about which aretoxic for catsanddogs).At a glanceBest flower delivery overall:Marks & SpencerFrom £25 at M&SBest budget flower delivery:Scilly FlowersFrom £16.50 at Scilly FlowersBest flower subscription service:Freddie’s FlowersFrom £28 a box at Freddie’s FlowersBest same-day flowers:InterfloraFrom £34.50 at InterfloraBest letterbox flowers:Bloom & WildFrom £19 at Bloom & WildWhy you should trust meI’ve been in the product-testing game for four years now, and have reviewed more than 1,000 products in that time. I’ve tested everything from heated blankets to high chairs, and all my reviews are firm but fair.I’m a self-confessed anthophile, and this isn’t my first time testing flower delivery services. Of course, I love luxury flowers as much as the next person – I have a soft spot for a fussy arrangement or silk ribbon – but I also have a lot of time for budget flowers. In spring, I rarely go past a bucket of £1 supermarket daffodils without picking up a bunch. Whatever your budget, I’m determined to hunt down the best bouquet for your buck.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I needed to invest in several new vases.’Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianDuring testing, I received many bunches from the main British flower-delivery services. I first tested for Valentine’s Day, then again for Mother’s Day, and most recently I tested more season-agnostic offerings. In total, I tested 33 arrangements over the four testing periods. My regular courier drivers even asked if everything was OK, as they’ve been delivering enough flowers tosatisfy even Elton John’s needs. The flowers were counted and cut on arrival to condition them, and then arranged into vases and placed around my house. I followed the directions for each bunch where relevant – arranging them and adding flower food as suggested.I kept my eye on each bouquet every day, noting when any flowers began to fade. My house is a draughty Victorian number, and I did fire up the central heating and log burner intermittently to see how the flowers coped. I had all the flowers delivered over the course of two days so I could be sure they all underwent the same conditions (yes, I did need to invest in several new vases – charity shops are great hunting grounds for them).The best flower delivery services in 2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iaroslava Zolotko/Getty Images/iStockphotoBest flower delivery overall:Marks & SpencerMarks & Spencer£25£25 at M&SWhat we loveGreat quality of blooms that stay fresh for agesWhat we don’t loveNot as sustainable as some others in this lineupPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £25 at M&SBouquet tested:roses, lisianthus and antirrhinum bright bouquet (£45)Marks & Spencer has overhauled its flower business and now offers afive-day freshness guaranteeon its bouquets. I’ve tested multiple bouquets throughout my process, including an extravagant Valentine’s Day bouquet, a more modest Mother’s Day and these bright flowers, which are more of an “every occasion” bouquet.Why we love itM&S flowers are undeniably premium quality. The most recent arrangement I tested was made up of 25 stems of bright pinks, reds and corals, and was lovely and fresh, bursting with colour. It also included plenty of deep-green foliage. Every time I’ve tested M&S flowers, many of the blooms have arrived in bud, slowly revealing themselves. This means they last much longer – this particular bouquet stayed fresh for two weeks, providing much cheer on my kitchen island.M&S says it sources as many British flowers as it can, depending on what’s in season. It also uses sustainable packaging. The flowers I tested came in a cardboard box, and the bouquet was wrapped in kraft paper with a form of cellophane wrap over the top.It’s a shame that…there aren’t guaranteed to be more British flowers in the arrangements.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noMarks & Spencer£25£25 at M&SWhat we loveGreat quality of blooms that stay fresh for agesWhat we don’t loveNot as sustainable as some others in this lineupBest budget flower delivery:Scilly FlowersScilly Flowers£16.50£16.50 at Scilly FlowersWhat we loveCheery and sustainable blooms that are grown in the UKWhat we don’t loveThe range of choice is pretty limitedPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £16.50 at Scilly FlowersBouquet tested:five bunches of spray carnations (£28.50)Before you read “carnations” and scroll on, I implore you to stop and think. Often cast as the “filler” in bouquets, Scilly Flowers makes whatever flowers you pick the star of the show. And these flowers are such incredibly good value that I keep having to check that the price is right.Why we love itAll Scilly Flowers stems are grown naturally outdoors without artificial light or heat on the Isles of Scilly. This means that the bouquets on offer often change. While I tested carnations, sometimes you might find different flowers available on Scilly Flowers’ website. I’ve tested enough bouquets from Scilly Flowers to know that whatever you get, it won’t be a disappointment.At Scilly Flowers, the whole farm is making strides in sustainability with low-irrigation initiatives, a solar-powered cold store and postal plane and boat shipping.The flowers themselves are low-effort, maximum joy in flower form. You don’t need any special skills to arrange them because they’re so gloriously simple. Many of the stems came as buds and gradually opened up over the week, which spread the joy for longer.It’s a shame that…Scilly’s flowers tend to sell out fast and aren’t available all year round, but this is understandable on both counts.Fastest delivery: 1st class Royal MailDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noScilly Flowers£16.50£16.50 at Scilly FlowersWhat we loveCheery and sustainable blooms that are grown in the UKWhat we don’t loveThe range of choice is pretty limitedBest flower subscription service:Freddie’s FlowersFreddie’s Flowers£28£28 at Freddie’s FlowersWhat we loveModern and stylish, and something you can make your ownWhat we don’t loveThe flowers are often grown abroad, racking up air milesPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £28 at Freddie’s FlowersBouquet tested:showstopper (£41)– seasonal arrangements change on four-weekly cyclesFreddie’s Flowers started as a subscription-only business, but it has since grown to offer one-off deliveries too, and I’ve tested both. The showstopper flowers arrived in a flat-lay box, bundled in recyclable paper along with instructions on how to create your arrangement.Why we love itI love taking the time to arrange the blooms. It’s a chance to get creative, even if only for five minutes. And it’s simple enough to follow the instructions, even if you’re not particularly artistic.I loved the variety of blooms, too: it was clear that thought had gone into creating something dramatic, with even the filler flowers adding dimension and spectacle. In the box I received there were huge gladioli alongside roses and kangaroo paw.Some deliveries contain lilies. Although gorgeous, lilies aren’t ideal for everyone, as they’re poisonous to pets; the subscription boxes can be made lily-free for that reason (although you still need to be cautious around other kinds of flowers, as noted at the top of the article).It’s a shame that…you don’t have much control over your delivery days, and although good value, the one-off arrangement I tested didn’t have as many stems as the showstopper bunch.Fastest delivery: subscription flowers are variable – delivery days are set depending on your postcode;one-off bunchesare available next dayDelivery cost:for subscription flowers, £4; for one-off deliveries, next day £5, standard freeB Corp certified:yesFreddie’s Flowers£28£28 at Freddie’s FlowersWhat we loveModern and stylish, and something you can make your ownWhat we don’t loveThe flowers are often grown abroad, racking up air milesBest same-day flowers:InterfloraInterflora£34.50£34.50 at InterfloraWhat we loveThere’s a big “wow” moment on deliveryWhat we don’t loveInterflora’s pledge to sustainability is somewhat lacklustrePhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £34.50 at InterfloraBouquet tested:luxury pink bouquet (£115)Interflora is effectively a floral matchmaker. You choose from a huge menu of flowers and then it matches you with a florist local to your delivery address. The florist then creates and delivers the arrangement. For testing, I received the luxury pink bouquet – which is exactly what it was. It came in a cardboard vase, hand tied in a cellophane pool of water.Why we love itI love the more personal feeling of receiving a bouquet from a local florist – especially because, as luck would have it, mine came from my favourite florist. Interflora guarantees that arrangements are made to order, and my arrangement certainly seemed fresh. Some of the flowers were lightly scented but not overpowering, which is always a joy.Throughout my tests, Interflora has consistently brought drama and luxury to my front door, and I’m not complaining. The luxury pink bouquet was made up of frilly pink blooms, including roses, lilies and lisianthus. Interflora’s website is somewhat vague on what flowers you’ll receive, probably because it depends on what each florist has available, and my bouquet didn’t include as many roses as the one in the photo on the website. However, the flowers lasted well – perhaps because they hadn’t taken a few days to transport through a courier service; the florist delivered them direct. My arrangement was going strong 10 days after I received it. The lilies, which came in bud, slowly opened and revealed their colour and scent after a few days – a lovely bit of delayed gratification.It’s a shame that…the price isn’t inclusive of the delivery fee. Generally Interflora does stunning flowers, but they aren’t the most competitively priced.Fastest delivery:same day (order before 3pm)Delivery cost:from £10 for same-day delivery, from £7.50 for named-day deliveryB Corp certified:noInterflora£34.50£34.50 at InterfloraWhat we loveThere’s a big “wow” moment on deliveryWhat we don’t loveInterflora’s pledge to sustainability is somewhat lacklustreBest letterbox flowers:Bloom & WildBloom & Wild£19£19 at Bloom & WildWhat we loveDramatic, modern arrangements.

They come bundled up “sleeping” – so most flowers are in bud rather than big, blousy blooms. But this just means they unfurl over time, last longer and bring extended joy as you watch them blossom. I’ve tested various letterbox flower delivery services and rate Bloom & Wild as the best: for range, service and quality. It always offers new trend-led arrangements, too.Why we love itI was thoroughly impressed by Bloom & Wild’s the Maren. It arrived perky and bright, full of different textures and colours that had me smiling from ear to ear. For the sake of being thorough, I also quality tested Bloom & Wild’s pre-made bouquetthe Adeline(£80), as well asthe Scottie(£35) andthe Hope(£34) in previous testing periods. All bouquets were absolute knockouts. I wonder what Bloom & Wild has been up to behind the scenes: it’s seriously upped its (already strong) game recently. The bouquets not only looked completely stunning, but lasted about 16 days.It’s a shame that…there are no instructions on the best way to arrange the flowers.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:free, but up to £9 for specific day/morning deliveryB Corp certified:yesBloom & Wild£19£19 at Bloom & WildWhat we loveDramatic, modern arrangements.

It also plants two trees for every arrangement sent, and all of its packaging is recycled, recyclable or compostable. However, the flowers aren’t all British grown – many stems seem to be grown in Holland or Kenya. They’re Fairtrade, which is great – but the air miles will still rack up the carbon footprint.The arrangement I received was impressive, though. It was teeming with colourful stems, and tied with cotton “ribbon” that I could reuse for future gifts and wrapped in recyclable craft paper. The flowers themselves still looked good seven days later, having weathered the week in a fairly warm and steamy kitchen. There were roses, alstroemeria, stocks and dramatic veronica. If you want to give the gift that keeps on giving, Arena also offers a subscription. These come in a box rather than tied in an arrangement, but the package was generous (I tested theLuxury subscription, from £31) and the flowers lasted into a second week.It didn’t make the cut because…I’d love more transparency about where the flowers in each arrangement come from.Fastest delivery time:next day (order before 9pm);delivery cost:from £3.95;B Corp certified:noArena Flowers£35£35 at Arena FlowersWhat we loveThe stems are super fresh and last for agesWhat we don’t loveSome of the flowers travel continents to be with youFlowerbxFlowerbx£40£40 at FlowerbxWhat we loveGorgeous centrepiece flowers that add drama to any homeWhat we don’t loveIt still feels like you should get more for your moneyPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £40 at FlowerbxBest for:show-stopping flowersBouquet tested:sage blush hydrangeas, five stems (from £75; now out of season)Flowerbx specialises in single-variety bunches, but does it better than most contenders in the flower market. I’ve tested several Flowerbx samples over the past 12 months, and it’s always these bouquets that my guests comment on consistently. They’re always huge centrepiece-style flowers that are fresh and beautiful. The hydrangeas I received most recently didn’t disappoint: they lasted for weeks and became the focal point of my dining room. I was able to dry them easily afterwards too, which means I can keep enjoying them for months.Itdidn’t make the final cut because …they’re so expensive. For five stems, £75 is punchy – and delivery is £5 on top, too.

That means you’re not just giving the gift of flowers, but also donating towards the environment. Petalon grows many of its own flowers in Cornwall, and is transparent on the website about which bunches have some, or all, Cornish-grown flowers.The flowers grown on the company’s land are done so without pesticides or artificial fertilisers. Petalon also uses only renewable energy. If that’s not enough, it leaves more than half of its land as a wild habitat. When you go to pay, the website offers you a breakdown of where your money is going.I’ve tested the company’s arrangements several times now, and you can rely on it to be different from anything else on the market. The flowers come in hessian wrap, and the arrangements include flowers I haven’t seen in other bouquets – more of a wildflower meadow vibe than a finely manicured luxury bouquet.You can alsosubscribe to year-round flowersor just opt for when British flowers are in season. The flowers lasted well, but were definitely more modest than other arrangements in this roundup.It didn’t make the final cut because …Petalon still imports flowers, although it’s easy to see on its site which arrangements contain imported flowers.Fastest delivery:next day;delivery cost:£6.95;B Corp certified:yesPetalon£48£48 at PetalonWhat we loveUnusual blooms with a thoroughly wholesome vibeWhat we don’t loveThe rustic charm won’t be everyone’s cup of teaWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenBritish-grown and seasonal flowers are always best.Photograph: yacobchuk/Getty ImagesSustainabilityCut flowers don’t have a great reputation in the sustainability stakes, but many brands are working hard to improve practices. Look for British-grown flowers where you can, and go for those that are seasonal. Around Valentine’s Day, UK-grown tulips and early ranunculus are a far better choice than imported roses; by Mother’s Day, British spring flowers such as daffodils, narcissi and hyacinths are naturally in season. If you buy from UK growers/services early in the season, you may find you have more options with those based farther south – Scilly Flowers and Petalon are great for this. Peonies in January are just not a good vibe for the planet.Delivery timesNot all flower-delivery services offer next-day delivery. Check the delivery service offering on the website or underneath each entry above. And some can sneak in the cost on top of the flowers, which ends up making a fairly affordable bunch rather punchy.How to make your flowers last longer at homeCut flowers may last only five days at home, even with all the variables being in their favour. Roses and tulips especially don’t last long. However, other flowers, such as hydrangeas and chrysanthemums, can go for a lot longer.To make your flowers last longer at home, you’ve got to think about care and the environment. Only ever use a clean vase, then trim off a few centimetres from the end of each stem. Cut them at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area in the water. Remove any foliage on the stem below the water line, and then put them in cool water, mixed with flower food (all decent flowers should come with flower food).Pick the right spot for your flowers. Spring flowers don’t appreciate being near heat sources. Don’t put them too close to your fruit bowl, either: fruit releases ethylene gas, which makes your flowers wilt more quickly.12 affordable jewellery brands, worn and rated for style and qualityRead moreTips for buying seasonal flowersAs well as being more sustainable, seasonal flowers will last longer in your home. Knowing what’s in season is the best place to start. If you’re buying flowers in the depths of winter, this means no sunflowers or dahlias are coming your way.Buy your flowers from a local florist, or via an online flower delivery service that says it offers British seasonal flowers. It may take a deep dive to find out what that actually looks like. Flower subscriptions, such as Freddie’s Flowers above, are also a great way to get seasonal flowers that have been grown to order.For more, read thebest Valentine’s Day gifts for 2026and thebest Galentine’s Day giftsZoë Phillimore is ajournalistwith 20 years of experience.She’s tested everything from mattresses to makeup, and she’s slightly obsessed with finding small new businesses to spotlight.

Rather than building it in the glass with crushed ice, as for a traditional caipirinha, this is shaken so that the kiwi jam is mixed into the drink more thoroughly.Kiwi caipirinhaServes1For the kiwi jam3 kiwi fruit3 tbsp sugar3 tbsp lemon juiceFor the drink50ml silver cachaça50ml kiwi jam(see above and method)25ml fresh lime juice, plus a lime wedge to garnish1 splash 1:1 sugar syrup, to taste2 dashes 20% saline solution(that is, 1 part sea salt dissolved in 5 parts water)First make the jam. Peel the kiwis, then blend the flesh to a pulp. Scrape into a saucepan, add the sugar and lemon juice, then heat gently over a low heat for about 10 minutes, until jammy. Decant into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for about four days (use any excess to make more caipirinhas, or spread it on your morning toast).To build the drink, measure all the ingredients into a shaker filled with ice and shake hard until very cold. Single strain into a tumbler filled with fresh ice, garnish with a big wedge of lime (or, if you’re feeling fancy, a slice of dehydrated kiwi) and serve.Jake Garstang, restaurant manager and sommelier,Maré, Hove, East SussexExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"

Make one to share or two individual ones, depending on your mood. They can be made ahead, anywhere from an hour to a full day in advance, and will keep happily in the fridge. If they’ve been chilled for more than a couple of hours, let them sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before serving. They should feel cool against the spoon, but not fridge-cold, which dulls their luxurious texture. A slick of good olive oil and a pinch of flaky salt is a lovely contrast to the chocolate’s richness, but you could also top them with a few edible flowers or a scattering of grated chocolate and a raspberry or two.Valentine’s chocolate pots de creme for twoPrep5 minCook50 minCool/chill1 hr 30 minServes210g softened butter125ml double cream60mlwhole milk1 cinnamon stick½ tsp instant coffee powder75g dark chocolate(60-70% cocoa),chopped into small pieces1 large egg yolk1tbsp caster sugar½ tsp vanilla extract1 pinchflaky sea saltTo serveWhipped cream or creme fraicheGood olive oil1 pinch flaky sea saltBrush a 250ml ramekin (for sharing) or two 125ml ramekins with the softened butter and put them in a small, deep baking dish or cake tin.Combine the cream, milk, cinnamon stick and coffee powder in a small saucepan, then warm gently over a low heat until the mixture just begins to steam – don’t let it boil. Take off the heat, leave to infuse for about 10 minutes, then return to a low heat until hot again.Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Lift out and discard the cinnamon stick from the hot cream mixture, then pour it over the chocolate and leave to stand for a couple of minutes, so the chocolate softens. Whisk gently until melted and smooth.Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. In a second bowl, whisk the egg yolk, sugar, vanilla and salt until creamy. Gradually whisk a little of the warm chocolate mixture into the yolk mixture to temper it, then add the rest of the chocolate, whisking until smooth and glossy.Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a jug, then pour into the prepared ramekin(s). Put the baking dish in the oven and pour in enough just-boiled water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 20–22 minutes for two small pots, or 25–28 minutes for one larger one – the centre should quiver slightly when jiggled.Lift the ramekin(s) from the water bath and leave to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, or up to a day ahead.To serve, top with softly whipped cream or creme fraiche, and finish with a few drops of olive oil and a pinch of flaky salt.Explore more on these topicsValentine's DayThe sweet spotFoodDessertBakingChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

Full of exclusively female artists – from Berthe Morisot in the 19th century and Frida Kahlo in the early 20th to contemporary figures such as Tracey Emin – it houses an incredible collection of often overlooked art and artists. We visited on a rainy October day and it was remarkably quiet and calm. I particularly enjoyed the abstract works – well worth a trip up the hill.JamesSecret church in Amsterdam’s red light districtView image in fullscreenOns’ Lieve Heer op Solder church, Amsterdam.Photograph: Frans Lemmens/AlamyOns’ Lieve Heer op Solderis a bit of a mouthful, but it is the best museum I have ever visited. Our Lord in the Attic is a hidden gem in the centre of Amsterdam and well worth a visit. “Our Lord” is a clandestine church originating after the Reformation when Catholics were no longer allowed to hold public holy masses. It enabled Catholics to worship, but only in private; thus creating an incredibly intimate and secretive experience. The canal house feels like a Tardis as you move from what seems like a labyrinth of rooms, all leading to what appears to be a doll’s house church. A sliver of heaven in the middle of the red light district!RyanBerlin’s pioneering socialist artistView image in fullscreenKäthe Kollwitz museum.Photograph: Imago/AlamyI came across theKäthe-Kollwitz Museumonly because I was staying nearby, just off Berlin’s glamorous Ku’damm avenue. This small, intimate building houses probably the best collection of Kollwitz’s prints, drawings, posters, sculptures and woodcuts, inspired by and illustrating her lifelong socialist beliefs with real power and poignancy. Her life and work were profoundly shaped by inseparable personal and political tragedies.LeslieProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Having spent the previous four weeks hiking in the Italian Alps, it was the perfect end to our trip. The staff are knowledgable and there are some excellent exhibits exploring the history of our relationship with mountains along with displays of mountaineering gear and derring-do over the past 150 years. There’s also a rooftop terrace with a great view of the city and mountains beyond. A fantastic way to spend a few hours and a must for any lover of mountains.Samantha McGradyCaptivating artefacts from the far east, PortoView image in fullscreenSculptures in the Museo Nacional Soares dos Rei.Photograph: Hemis/AlamySet in a late 18th-century palace belonging to the Porto bourgeoisie, theMuseo Nacional Soares dos Reis, founded in 1833, is considered to be Portugal’s oldest art museum. It features an absorbing collection of Portuguese painting dating from the 16th to 20th centuries, but particularly captivating are the rooms displaying Japanese and Chinese artefacts, which arrived in Portugal off trading ships from the far east. Don’t miss the tranquil garden at the back of the museum.PeterHomage to Copernicus in KrakówView image in fullscreenThe Collegium Maius at theJagielloniandates back to the 14th century.Photograph: John Warburton-Lee/AlamyTheJagiellonian University Museumhas a wonderful collection for those interested in history and science. The university was founded in 1364 and a young Copernicus (who worked out that the sun was at the centre of the known universe rather than the Earth) studied there in the 1490s. Many objects related to its most famous student and his heliocentric theory are showcased, alongside quirky objects related to the history of the university, and the history of Poland. The guides are very knowledgable, the visit is affordable, and it’s conveniently located in Kraków’s beautiful historical city centre.Aline TMarinhoQuiet contemplation and wonder in BarcelonaView image in fullscreenCaixa Forum, Barcelona.Photograph: Kaprik/AlamyIn a stunningly restored mattress factory (La Casaramona) designed by Catalan modernist architect Josep Puig i Cadafach, you can find theCaixaForum, just up the road from the Plaça d’Espanya in Barcelona. There are some buildings that eclipse the art that’s inside it, but the Caixa specialises in having a revolving display of exhibitions from photography to sculpture to immersive art, in an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and wonder. It is near the Miró Foundation and so many visitors pass it by without realising how great it is. Within its curvy walls there is a cafe for a welcome cold drink.Liz Owen HernandezAn airship and Trump toddlers in PragueView image in fullscreenA steel and wood airship ‘floats’ over the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art.Photograph: Arazu/AlamyI would really recommendDOX Centre for Contemporary Artin Prague. It’s a little way out of the touristy city centre but is an excellent art gallery within a stunning feat of architecture – a steel and wood airship (built in 2016) seemingly floats out of a postwar factory building. In 2018 I saw a brilliant exhibit, which was a white room filled with giant toddlers with Trump faces.Katherine LParis’s ‘most enchanting’ museumView image in fullscreenA beautiful spiral staircase links floors at the ornate Musée National Gustave Moreau.Photograph: Jon Lovette/AlamyFor me, the most enchanting museum in Paris is theMusée National Gustave Moreau, located in the former home of the 19th-century symbolist artist. Stendhal syndrome is surely a real risk in this glorious space, as one staggers among the dizzying, gigantic paintings painted in elaborate, decorative detail. Classical mythology and intimate biblical scenes are presented in vast gilt frames alongside looser drawings and watercolours housed in cabinets with pivoting shutters for ease of browsing. A spiral staircase between studio floors adds to the magic and the fascinating private apartments offer insight into a brilliant mind. Truly inspiring.Petra PainterWinning tip: Bronze gods in PiraeusView image in fullscreenBronze statue of Artemis in the Archaeological Museum, Piraeus.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyTheArchaeological Museum of Piraeuscontains a wonderful collection of artefacts spanning 2,000 years of Greek history and is generally less hectic than bigger museums in Athens. In pride of place are the Piraeus bronzes, a truly staggering collection of statues (including the Piraeus Apollo and bronze statues of Athena and Artemis) that left such an impression on me that I now have tattoos of two of them. It’s only 20 minutes from the centre of Athens by train, and is a wonderful place to explore while you wait for your ferry connection to the islands.Ben HolmesView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsCultural tripsReaders' travel tipsCity breaksShort breaksTop 10sMuseumsEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week I took my newborn daughter to Peckham in south-east London, to meet a friend in a cafe I’d never heard of. When I turned up, I realised it used to be a regular haunt of mine, and suddenly I was both a tired woman in her late 30s with two kids, and also 22, unemployed and making the most of happy hour.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I bring this up because of what was on the table: a kokedama. If you’re unfamiliar, the word translates to “moss ball”. A decade ago, I saw them hanging outside the doorways of houses in deserted, snow-covered mountain villages in Japan, holding the tremulous fronds of overwintering ferns. The technique dates back centuries, a side-product of the art of bonsai that has become popular in its own right. Kokedama are a lot easier to create at home than bonsai trees: plants’ rootballs are removed from their pots and packed tightly with dense moss, before being bound with the string that can be used to hang them up with.I’d been familiar with the concept before I went to Japan. Kokedama were part of the mid-2010s houseplant craze, and at that time they often contained fussy plants such as maidenhair ferns oralocasias.There, among the miniature theatres of irises, crops of snowdrops rise from kokedama hanging in the treesPlant trees, bushes and evergreens now to give your garden structureRead moreThe ones in the cafe were a more contemporary version: the kokedama was a squat little mound, sitting quietly as if growing straight from the table. While the moss looked green and plump, it was home to a few artfully placed sprigs oflimonium(sea lavender) and driedsanguisorba– kokedama as a non-polluting answer to florists’ foam.It prompted me to think about how I could use them in and outside the house at this bleak time of year. On the other side of town, theChelsea Physic Garden’s Heralding Spring festivaltraditionally kicks off my gardening year in late January. There, among the miniature theatres of irises, crops of snowdrops rise from kokedama hanging in the trees; a welcome dose of magic at this time of year.Kokedama can be made at home with moss, soil, twine and a good bit of patience and practice. You’ll need to mix peat-free potting soil with bonsai compost or sharp sand (which encourages drainage) to make a mixture that feels mud-pie-ready. Remove the plant from its pot – hardier ferns are a good bet for beginners, or bulbs in the green – and make a coconut-sized ball from the compost mix around the rootball, squeezing out excess moisture. Wrap it in sheet moss, then crisscross the twine around the ball, tying and leaving some excess to hang it from.Explore more on these topicsGardensTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I first used Excel at university in Cork while studying maths and physics. We used a software programme called Mathematica but it was expensive, so at home I used Excel as a workaround to do the same tasks, using it to generate, say, a list of prime or Fibonacci numbers.After that, I worked at a consultancy company in London and started using it more conventionally. I soon became the go-to person for people who had random questions about the software, such as how to use it to figure out howmany trucks are needed to transport a certain amount of packages.Later, I moved to New York to work at a bank, and in 2013 a colleague told me about a competition called ModelOff, which used Excel to build financial forecasts. There were 16 finalists in a conference room in one of Microsoft’s offices, all sitting at desks. It was a closed event and not very interesting to look at – a world away from what it eventually turned into.I won ModelOff once before the competition ended in 2019. Then some new kids on the block launched the Financial Modelling World Cup in 2020, and I won that twice. They decided to make it more visual and fun, including hosting head-to-head battles with a real-time leaderboard on a giant screen. They started putting these on YouTube and some videos got hundreds of thousands of views.Experience: I’m Britain’s best gravediggerRead moreIt soon rebranded as the Microsoft Excel world championship. ESPN started broadcasting it live, and by 2023 the final was being held in Las Vegas in a proper esports arena with a live audience. That year more than 500 competitors took part in the “road to Las Vegas” qualifiers.There are lots of nerdy types, as you might expect – including me – but some less obvious ones: there’s a powerlifting champion and a few Ironman and ultramarathon finishers. It’s a niche thing in some ways but, then again, Excel is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. I’ve heard lots of people say they have watched the championships with a friend who wasn’t into Excel at all, but really enjoyed it because of the excitement from the commentators.View image in fullscreenDiarmuid walking down the ‘hype tunnel’ at the Excel World Championship.Photograph: Damian/-I find some of the theatrics a little odd. I wouldn’t have come up with giving a wrestling-style belt to the winner or asking players to walk down a glowing “hype tunnel”. But it seems to work: there’s more interest in it than ever. It’s now harder every year as a result, but the community is amazing.The mood for the 2025 final in Vegas was electric, with 500 people in the crowd cheering like crazy. People at the bottom of the board are in danger of being eliminated, so it’s always a really tense and charged atmosphere. I was nervous for the semi-finals and final. The quarters had gone well, but I have a track record of peaking too soon.When the semi-final went well, I was sure there was no way lightning would strike a third time. But when I saw the instructions for the final case – using Excel to fold a virtual sheet of origami – it felt like something I could do. I won, defeating a three-time champion, who’s an actuary from Australia. It was really exciting. I have been called the LeBron James of spreadsheets, but I try not to take myself too seriously.View image in fullscreen‘I find some of the theatrics a little odd’: Diarmuid Early with his trophy and wrestling belt.Photograph: -My prize was $5,000, which I donated to theAgainst Malaria Foundation. The organisers have big ambitions: its founder has a vision of handing over a $1m prize cheque. I mostly saw that as pie in the sky thinking – but I had also thought the idea of Excel becoming a popular esport was unlikely, too.You can have a lot more fun with Excel than people realise. I have built a model of a TV gameshow for a company to help them figure out how to budget their cash rewards. It didn’t get commissioned in the end, but they did build a set and film a pilot with Carol Vorderman. I also build models to help make my picks for betting in football. And I created an Excel file that can play Battleship better than most people. But the biggest thing that makes it fun, and keeps me coming back, is the people. They are smart, interesting, curious, friendly and welcoming – living proof that, despite its reputation, Excel is far from boring.As told to Daniel Dylan WrayDo you have an experience to share?

In the midst of massive national protests, the government shut down the internet, phone calls, and almost all communication out of the country. That evening a violent crackdown began. In some cities, government forces opened fire on crowds, killing thousands –according to some estimates, possibly tens of thousands – in two days of bloodshed. The internet blackout has meant that a clearer picture of what happened – drawn from witness reports, videos, photographs and testimony from hospitals – has taken time to assemble.When the violence began, there were demonstrations taking place in more than 200 cities, according to human rights groups. This is the story of what unfolded in one of them.Thursday 8 January5pmAt the moment the Iranian authorities shut down the internet, Ali*, 36, and his friends were already marching toward Shariati Street, which runs along the edge of the grand bazaar in Rasht, centralIran. By the time they reached the road, thousands of people were already there, chanting freedom slogans.The protests had been building since Tuesday, with people from smaller surrounding cities making their way to Rasht to join them. They flocked to the city’s grand bazaar: a vibrant, historic marketplace, sprawling across a hive of interconnected streets. The market’s location near the Haj Mojtahed mosque and at the intersection of arterial city streets made it the heart of Rasht’s bustling life – and a natural hub for the demonstrators. That evening, its narrow streets were packed. “I would estimate there were more than 20,000 people surrounding the alleys and the boulevards near the bazaar,” says Ali.View image in fullscreenThe grand bazaar in Rasht is a vibrant, historic marketplace at the heart of the city.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesPeople of every age were there, he says. “My friend brought along his wife and his two daughters, one nine and the other 12. We were all so happy and felt united to be together for freedom.” Even when they realised that the internet had been cut off, he wasn’t worried. “It didn’t matter if there was no internet or no calls. We were all in this together and didn’t feel any danger.”About a kilometre north-west of Shariati Street was Siamak*, 40. He had been cautious about joining the demonstrations, saying that the atmosphere had felt heavy as crowds swelled across the city. But he understood why they were there.“People were pushed to their limits. We couldn’t afford the basics,” Siamak says. He had been at the bazaar earlier that week, buying 2kg (4.4lb) of tangerines. They cost him 580,000 tomans, or about £3.40 – more than a day’s pay for Iranians on the minimum wage. “Everything just felt unaffordable. People just stood there, unable to buy food. That triggered the anger,” he says.As he drove through the city, Siamak saw old people, children, entire families joining the march. Groups of teenagers jumped out of cars and headed to the market. “I lowered the window of my car and told them, ‘May god protect you, I hope you are safe.’” But as the day wore on, he felt reassured that the people were strong in numbers. “By Thursday afternoon, the conversations changed,” he says. “People felt ashamed for staying home. Parents spoke about their children and still said, ‘Why shouldn’t we go?’ It was no longer about money. It was about dignity.” He, too, joined the thronging crowds.8pmAs night fell over the bazaar and surrounding streets, no one was going home. Making your way through the crowds took time. From Moallem Boulevard, about 15 minutes’ walk from the bazaar, Siamak had slowly wound his way through sidestreets to Rasht’s Municipality Square, which lies on the same block as the market. He climbed up to a rooftop to get a view. “The crowd was massive,” he says. Every street was packed.Map showing Rasht Grand Bazaar and the routes of Ali and SiamakOver on Shariati Street, Ali and his friends chanted slogans as they got closer to the alleys near the bazaar. The atmosphere felt jubilant, Ali says – when suddenly, he felt something shift. “The feeling of victory turned to fear,” he says, “I can’t explain the seconds before the catastrophe. I can’t explain how that felt. Our hearts were racing. We were being surrounded by security forces and plainclothes officers with masks.” He saw a set of white Toyota Hilux vehicles with machine guns making their way into the crowds. Even at this point, he says, he and his friends were not really afraid – they could not imagine what was to come next.From just outside the market, Siamak recognised the sounds of shooting.“I heard explosions and nonstop gunfire coming from the direction of the bazaar. People started running out toward the surrounding streets. Some were screaming. Some were bleeding. From them, we learned what was happening inside,” he says.Video footage showing a fire engine and people milling around as smoke billows against a night sky that is lit up with flamesCourtesy of mamlekateSoon, he smelled smoke and saw a red light in the sky. A fire was engulfing the market.8.30pmAli thinks it was probably about 8.30pm when he spotted that the market was burning. It is not clear exactly where, when and how the flames started, but “the fire spread rapidly”, he says. “People inside were in a dilemma, whether to run towards us or to save those in the fire. As soon as the smoke started to spread, and we were trying to make space, we saw huge crowds fleeing the fire and running towards the street.” Then, the security forces began to shoot.“The security forces began shooting at the fleeing crowds,” he says. “I saw people being shot directly in the head, with AK47, G3 and also Dushka guns. It was as if you could see how hell burns. I still can’t explain to you what I saw.” One group of guards started firing in his direction, and Ali and his friends ran for cover.Map showing the location of burned buildingsAs crowds poured out of the market and into surrounding streets, Siamak asked those fleeing what was happening. “They said the municipal market and bazaar had been set on fire. Firefighters were not allowed to enter. The bazaar’s narrow alleys trapped people. When the fire spread, people were forced to choose: stay inside and burn, or come out.“When they came out, they were shot.”Iran’s state media says the bazaar and one of its mosques were “burned down by foreign-backed rioters”. Outside the market, Ali says he was witnessing a massacre first-hand.View image in fullscreenSookhte Tekiyeh mosque, which was gutted by fire when Rasht Grand Bazaar burned down during Iran’s January 2026 protests.Photograph: undefined/Courtesy of Tavaana“I can’t, I really can’t find the words to tell you what I saw. People were trying to stop the fire, but there was a group of plainclothes people who attacked crowds trying to put out the fire and the same group stopped the firefighters from entering the bazaar. They had completely trapped people and also shot those who fled.”Ali says the bazaar was already on fire when he saw the Haj Mojtahed mosque engulfed by flames.“I still can’t analyse in my head what happened in front of my eyes. I saw kids being shot, women, old people … I can’t tell you. I saw lots of them shot in their head and blood pouring out on the streets,” he says. Security forces and armed, plainclothes men “went behind those fleeing, shot them – it was like they chased the ashes and burned the ashes down too”.“I will never recover from what I witnessed. Never again, do I want to see this in my life.”9pm-midnightFor Siamak, the aftermath was as catastrophic as the initial chaos. “I saw people collapsing on the streets leading away from the bazaar,” he says. “Shooting came from multiple directions. There were loud explosions, what people called sound bombs. White Toyota Hilux vehicles filled with masked forces were positioned under bridges and at exits.”Word spread that those who survived the first shots inside the bazaar were being “finished off” by men with guns if they got out. “They didn’t let the wounded live,” he says, overcome with emotion.View image in fullscreenHundreds of people are estimated to have died in the flames as the bazaar burned, while others were allegedly shot as they fled.Photograph: Courtesy of TavaanaA number of human rights groups have reported that authorities did not allow fire engines to access the bazaar to put out the flames until after midnight. As the shops and houses burned, Ali and Siamak retreated from the chaos, but returned later that night to see what remained.2amView image in fullscreenIt has been reported that fire engines were not permitted proper access to the bazaar until after midnight.Photograph: Courtesy of TavaanaIn the early hours of the morning, Ali and his friends went back to check on the streets surrounding the bazaar. It looked like about 500 shops had been burned and patches of flames were still burning, he says. “It looked like the city was burning to ashes. It was like a bad dream.” Some bodies had been carried from the ruins and lay on the streets, burned beyond recognition.“I don’t think there’s any way [families could identify their loved ones], other than a DNA test,” he says.At the city’s hospitals and clinics, the injured were flooding in. According to a doctor [not named due to fear of reprisals] who compiled reports from emergency department doctors in Rasht, the hospitals received “hundreds of burn victims from the Rasht bazaar area, including bodies recovered with partial charring and patients with extensive third- and fourth-degree burns who died in subsequent days”. They also reported “hundreds of patients presenting with combined gunshot and burn injuries, consistent with individuals being shot while fleeing the burning area”.Someone walking with a video camera shows burned buildings, some taped off but with flames still burning, and thick smoke hanging in the air.Courtesy of AliThe pattern of injuries and fatalities documented by medics, the doctor says, “resembles what might be expected in urban combat scenarios rather than conventional crowd-control”.DawnWhen Ali went back to look again at about 5am, the bodies on the streets had been removed.What happened in Rasht “leaves no doubt about the authorities’ intentions,” says Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights. “The city was turned into a killing field; people were hunted in alleys, shot in the streets, burned out of hiding places, and executed when wounded. This was a clear example of a crime against humanity under international law.”For Siamak, who has since fled the country, the memory of what happened – and what families faced in the following days – is agonising. “Families were forced to pay large sums to retrieve bodies,” he says. “Those who couldn’t pay lost them.” Some families hid bodies in cars overnight. Others buried loved ones secretly – sometimes in gardens, sometimes in unmarked graves.“After the massacre, the city felt destroyed,” he says. “No internet. No communication. Everywhere I went, I heard that someone else had died. It felt like prison – total isolation.”*Names have been changed to protect identities"

In Grazalema, in southern Spain, more than 700mm of rain has fallen since Wednesday, roughly equivalent to the country’s average annual rainfall.Across Andalucía, about 3,500 people have been evacuated, with roads and schools closed, and transport networks disrupted. Spain’s state meteorological agency, Aemet, issued its highest red alert for heavy rainfall in Cádiz and parts of Málaga, where around 150mm was recorded in only 12 hours on Thursday.1:25Storm Leonardo devastates southern Portugal and Spain – videoIn Málaga province, a girl has been reported missing after being swept away by the Turvilla river, with emergency services continuing search efforts.Portugal, still recovering from Storm Kristin, which killed at least five people last week, has also been badly affected. Fresh downpours have triggered flooding, landslides and falling trees, forcing more than 200 people to evacuate. On Wednesday, another death was reported in the southern Alentejo region after a man’s car was washed away by flood waters.The storm’s effects extend beyondEurope. In northern Morocco, flash floods caused by overflowing rivers and reservoirs have forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate, with the city of Ksar El-Kebir in the Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region among the worst-affected.The extreme rainfall is being driven by an unusually southward-shifted jet stream, allowing Leonardo to intensify and stall over the region. The storm has also merged with an “atmospheric river” carrying tropical moisture from the Caribbean, continually replenishing the rainfall. With soils already saturated and rivers swollen after weeks of wet weather, the risk of further flooding and landslides remains high, particularly in southern Spain.Leonardo is expected to linger near the north-west of the Iberian peninsula into early next week, bringing continued unsettled conditions. Northern and central Portugal could receive an additional 150-250mm of rain by the end of the week.Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Penha developed from an area of low pressure over the Philippine Sea late on Tuesday and tracked westwards towards Mindanao. By Thursday, the system was producing wind gusts of up to 45mph before making landfall in Surigao del Sur on Thursday.Storm surges of up to two metres are expected across coastal areas, and warnings for heavy rainfall have been issued farther inland, with 200-300mm of rain expected within 24 hours. Sustained winds of 38-55mph are forecast, increasing the risk of damage to buildings and vegetation. After landfall, Penha is expected to weaken as it moves across northern Mindanao and Negros island, before dissipating near Palawan island.Explore more on these topicsEuropeWeather trackerAfricaExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

The increase will apply only to lean beef trimmings, which are blended with domestic supplies to make hamburger meat, according to the proclamation.“Instead of imports that sideline American ranchers, we should be focused on solutions that cut red tape, lower production costs, and support growing our cattle herd,” said Republican US senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a major cattle-producing state.Washington and Buenos Aires signed a broader new trade and investment agreement that will give preferential market access to US goods in Argentina.Economists have said increased US imports of Argentinian beef will likely be too small to significantly lower costs for grocery store shoppers, but the shipments could help improve margins for food companies.The US imported about 33,000 metric tons of Argentinian beef in 2024, representing 2% of total imports, according to government data.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationMeatBeefArgentinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She was joined byCanada’s Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon.France’s foreign ministry said Jean-Noël Poirier would take up duties as the country’s consul general, making it the first EU country to establish a consulate general in Greenland.Poirier would be “tasked with working to deepen existing cooperation projects with Greenland in the cultural, scientific and economic fields, while also strengthening political ties with the local authorities”, the ministry said.Canada had promised to open a consulate in Greenland in 2024 – before Trump’s recent talk of a takeover – and the formal inauguration was delayed from November because of bad weather.Arctic Fever: new exhibit finds 19th-century parallels to Trump’s Greenland obsessionRead moreAnand met her Danish counterpart, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, inDenmarkon Thursday and posted on social media that “as Arctic nations, Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark are working together to strengthen stability, security and cooperation across the region.”France says the decision to open its diplomatic outpost was taken when its president, Emmanuel Macron, visited in June.Donald Trump, the US president, announced in January that he would impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his calls for a US takeover of Greenland, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a “framework” for a deal over access to the mineral-rich territory had been reached with the help of the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte. Few details of that agreement have emerged.Last week, technical talks started between the US, Denmark and Greenland to put together an Arctic security deal. The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland had agreed to create a working group during a meeting with the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, before Trump made his tariff threats.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandFranceCanadaDenmarkNatoUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The situation is complex, and at this stage we are unable to provide a timeframe of when this may be.”Local residents, including owners of dive schools operating nearby, have raised concerns about the impact of the spill.Dave Drane, owner of Dive Wellington,toldthe Otago Daily Times: “It’s going to affect us financially in lots of ways. Even the bad advertising from it, where people think: ‘Well, I’m not going to learn to dive in Wellington,’ but also the bookings that we’ll have to cancel.” He said up to 30 students had already been forced to cancel planned dives in the nearby reserve.One local resident, Angus,expressedhesitation to surf, telling RNZ: “I didn’t want to go there because it looked like I don’t know… toilet paper or jellyfish, so I was like I don’t really want to go in on either of those.”Commentingon the leak, New Zealand’s department of conservation said it was “extremely concerned,” with its principal marine science adviser Shane Geange saying: “Raw sewage and wastewater entering a marine environment poses an immediate and severe threat to a wide range of ecological functions and species, but I think the primary concern is around the public health concern which Greater Wellington health authorities are actively managing.”Geange added that the department was working with local authorities to determine how far the sewage has spread.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the deaths were among people who fell while trying to clear snow from their roofs or around their homes.Perilous conditions created by heavy snowfall have also affected foreign travellers.

It hadlost a parliamentary majorityfor the second time in 15 months; its MPs were implicated in a long-runningslush fund scandal; the then prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, was the target of factional plotting.But as voters prepare to brave freezing temperatures in this Sunday’s lower house elections, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) is expected to pull off a momentous victory. And the party’s recovery from the disappointment of last year is largely down to one woman.Black and white and sent back over: end of panda diplomacy as Japan returns bears to ChinaRead moreWhen the LDP’s conservative wing forced a leadership election to replace the embattled Ishiba in October last year, many expected his allyShinjiro Koizumi– the young, telegenic son of aprevious prime minister– to win.Instead,Japan’s party of government for most of the past seven decades took a gamble on his ultra-conservative rival, Sanae Takaichi, installing her as the country’sfirst female prime minister. If opinion polls are correct, that gamble is about to pay off in ways even her strongest allies could not have imagined.In an eventful four months, Takaichi hasmet Donald Trump– who this week offered an endorsement and an invitation to the White House in March – as well as Xi Jinping and South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung. She sparked an unresolvedrow with Beijingover the future of Taiwan, spooked bond markets with promises of sweeping tax cuts, and faced fresh scrutiny over her links with thedisgraced Unification church.Despite the ups and downs, she has emerged as the LDP’s most effective weapon, the object of a personality cult revolving around everything from her choice of outfits and train journey snacks to the pink pen she uses to take notes in parliament.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung (L) and Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, play drums in Nara, Japan.Photograph: JAPAN’S GOVERNMENT PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE/JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty ImagesOpinion polls this week suggested that the LDP and its minor coalition partner, theJapanInnovation party, will win more than 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house, enough to give them a two-thirds majority and control of parliamentary committees. The main opposition Centrist Reform Alliance, by contrast, is bracing for heavy losses.An admirer of Margaret Thatcher, the 64-year-old Takaichi is hardly a natural ally of Japanese feminism or Gen Z aspiration. Sheopposesallowing female members of the imperial family to become reigning empresses, insists that married couples should use thesame surname– almost always the husband’s – andshows no interestin challenging centuries of tradition by stepping on to “sacred” sumo arenas to award trophies.Instead, she has ignited interest among young voters with a savvy social media campaign that emphasises what she is not: a hereditary, male politician of a certain vintage with an innate belief in his right to govern.“Until now, politics has been dominated by senior male figures,” Yuiko Fujita, an associate professor at Tokyo University, told the Nikkei. “The fact that the prime minister is now a woman, someone with a different background from what people are accustomed to, creates a feeling that something is shifting.”Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer and father a car company employee, has cited Thatcher, the daughter of a shopkeeper, as her inspiration.At a recent campaign speech in Tokyo, Takaichi referred to her modest upbringing and touched on issues fromcontrolling immigrationto the cost of visiting a hair salon. Unlike her male predecessors, she shuns late-night drinks and expensive restaurants, preferring home comforts andearly-morning meetingswith aides.“She has a clear, decisive way of speaking,” said Takeo Fujimura, a 24-year-old office worker who had volunteered to hand out paper Japanese flags at the campaign event. “She communicates in a bright, positive way and I think that energy resonates with young people.”The $900 black leather handbag Takaichi uses has sold out, and her favourite snacks are in demand. Voters say they are attracted to her easy manner – smiling and waving to US troops stationed in Japan,playing the drums with Leeto the hit song Golden from K-pop Demon Hunters, or singing “Happy Birthday” in Italian to Giorgia Meloni.‘There is almost no criticism of her’Japan’s “commoner prime minister” has harnessed the power of social media in a way no other Japanese politician can match. Her official X account has more than 2.6 million followers, dwarfing the 64,000 who follow Yoshihiko Noda, the co-leader of the centrist alliance.“Even though I’m not that much into politics, pro-Takaichi videos are recommended to me a lot on YouTube,” said Mana Suzuki, a 20-year-old Tokyo resident. “And there is almost no criticism of her in the comments section.”While there is little discussion of policy, her personal qualities have combined to create a wave of “Sana-mania” that should give Takaichi the political headroom she needs to confront the cost-of-living crisis, a volatile yen and security threats from China and a nuclear-armed North Korea.Themidwinter electionis not without risks, however. Many voters are unconvinced that her promise to suspend the 8% consumption tax on food for two years will help struggling families.“Prices are so high,” said Tomomi Kawamura, a Tokyo housewife who, while impressed by Takaichi’s social media posts, had yet to decide how to cast her vote. “I want something done about that.”And there is no guarantee that younger people, who are not known for turning out in large numbers at elections, will translate admiration for Takaichi into a trip to a polling station on what is forecast to be a frigid weekend throughout Japan.When shecalled a snap electionlast month, Takaichi said people must be given the chance to decide whether she was “fit to run the country”.On Sunday, Japanese voters are expected to respond with a resounding yes.Wires contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJapanSanae TakaichiAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Emergency services were called to the area about 800m west of Normanton airport about 8pm. Police were unsure about the injuries of those onboard as the crash site has been difficult to access.“At this time, emergency services have had difficulty accessing the crash site and injuries of those onboard are unknown,” Queensland police said.The AustralianTransportSafety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating both crashes.The agency said the fatal plane crash in Goolwa South involveda single-engine Cessna aircraft. Safety investigators were due on the scene on Saturday to examine the wreckage, interview witnesses and collect video footage or recorded flight tracking data. Officials have urged anyone with video of the aircraft in-flight, or of the incident, to contact them as soon as possible.Avideo publishedby Seven News Adelaide appears to show the plane spinning out of control before nose-diving into the ocean.“Police wish to thank other emergency services, including CFS, SES, Sea Rescue and commercial operators for their efforts and assistance in the search and retrieval operations,” SA police said. A report will be prepared for the coroner after the fatalities.The ATSB was also aware of the Normanton crash and was gathering more information.Goolwa South is about 70km south of Adelaide.

According to the mint’s website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 pieces, all of which are collector’s items and will not enter general public circulation.The backs of the coins feature a portrait of the queen’s son, King Charles, in profile.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyQueen Elizabeth IInewsShareReuse this content"

The warrant was issued after an application by British lawyers acting for Palestinian victims of the demolition.Almog has also been implicatedin theal-Daraj bombing in 2002, when a one-tonne bomb was dropped on a densely populated neighbourhood. The strike was targeting Hamas leader Salah Shehadeh, but also killed 14 others, mostly babies and children.The UK warrant has since been withdrawn and Almog has consistently denied the allegations. In a statement, the Jewish Agency for Israel said it was a “matter of public record” that no international authority attributes any violation of the law to Almog.Almog is chairman of the executive of the Jewish Agency for Israel, which encourages the immigration of Jews in the global diaspora to Israel, a practice known as Aliyah.Four legal organisations – the Australian Centre for International Justice, Al Haq, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights – have lodged a submission with the AFP, requesting that Almog be investigated over allegations arising from his time as Commanding Officer of the Israeli military’s Southern Command between 2000 and 2003.“Under his command, the Israeli military was responsible for countless and extensive human rights violations and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions inside the illegally occupied Gaza Strip,” the submission alleges.“UnderAustralian law, grave breaches are serious criminal offences and Australia is obligated to search for, arrest and prosecute those alleged to have perpetrated them.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe legal groups also insist Almog should be investigated for his actions as chair of the Jewish Agency, alleging “Almog participated in the authorisation, organisation or direction of the transfer of Israeli civilian population into the occupied West Bank, being territory illegally occupied by Israel”.The AFP has referred the Almog submission to its Special Investigations Command.Rawan Arraf, the ACIJ’s executive director, said Almog should not be allowed to enter Australia.“But given it is likely he will be allowed to enter the country, he must be arrested. He must answer to the credible allegations made against him. This impunity that Israel and its leaders enjoy, must end.”Almog has not been involved in the current Gaza conflict. He has been a prominent, but controversial figure, for decades. He was awarded the Israel prize in 2016 for his military service and his charity work, particularly as the founder of rehabilitation village for children with disabilities.In September 2005,Almog flew into London’s Heathrowairport for a series of fundraising and charitable events across the UK.Ahead of his arrival, in the Bow Street magistrate court, a private prosecution was brought before the senior district judge Timothy Workman, who issued a warrant for Almog’s arrest over war crimes allegations. The warrant alleged Almog committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip in 2002 when he ordered the destruction of 59 homes near Rafah.Detectives were waiting at the immigration desk to arrest Almog.But the police plans wereleaked to the military attacheof the Israeli embassy, who boarded the plane as Almog prepared to disembark, telling him he faced arrest.Almogstayed on the plane for two hoursas it sat on the tarmac, before it flew back to Israel. He told the Guardian the next day: “I don’t know how he [the military attache] found out but I am glad he did. It was also fortunate that I wasflying with El Alas they are loyal. I don’t know what would have happened if I had been on a British Airways flight.”He also said the allegations against him were without merit.“As a soldier and a generalI have never committed a crime. Many times I have saved Palestinian lives by risking my life and the lives of my soldiers,” he said.View image in fullscreenIsraeli president Isaac Herzog at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersHerzog, as president and head of state of Israel, was invited to Australia by the federal government after the antisemitic massacre in Bondi in December, when 15 people were killed by two allegedly Islamic State-inspired gunmen.The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said Herzog’s visit was intended to foster “a greater sense of unity”.But members of his own party have said they are “very uncomfortable” about the invitation. The former Labor minister Ed Husic said: “It’s really hard for me to reconcile the vision of him [Herzog] signing bombs that went on to be dropped on Palestinian homes … with the notion of social cohesion. So from that perspective, I’ve obviously got deep concerns.”In late 2023, Herzog was picturedsigning an Israeli artillery shellbeing prepared to be fired into Gaza, writing in Hebrew on the munition: “I rely on you.”‘I don’t think this was a good decision’: Labor’s Ed Husic holds ‘deep concerns’ over Israeli president Isaac Herzog’s visitRead moreIn September last year, a UN commission of inquiry alleged Herzog incited genocide against Palestinians in Gaza by publicly declaring all Palestinians in Gaza were responsible for the Hamas attacks of October 2023: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible,” he said. “It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians who were not aware and not involved. It is absolutely not true.” Herzog denies the allegations, saying he was taken out of context, and also said Israeli forces would adhere to international law.Herzog also enjoys immunity from prosecution as head of state, and there have been no arrest warrants issued for him. The international court of justice is trying a case in which Israel is accused of genocide.Chris Sidoti, one of the commissioners on the UN panel, wrote in the Guardian this week the invitation extended to Herzog was a “terrible mistake”.The Guardian has approached the AFP for comment.In a statement, the Jewish Agency for Israel told the Guardian: “The assumptions underlying the allegations against Doron Almog are incorrect and baseless, and the terminology employed is tendentious and self-serving”.“We will not engage in a debate over a factually flawed worldview and will simply state that no international authority attributes any violation of the law to Doron Almog, which is a matter of public record.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsIsraelAustralian lawGazaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

It is the latest in a series of deadly storms to have hit Portugal and Spain in recent weeks, killing several people.1:25Storm Leonardo devastates southern Portugal and Spain – videoAuthorities in Andalucía, where more than 7,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, evacuated residential areas near the Guadalquivir River in Córdoba overnight and pedestrian traffic was halted on the city’s Roman bridge.“We expect 30mm [of rain],” Andalucía’s regional president, Juan Manuel Moreno, said on Friday. “In other circumstances that would be little water but right now it is a lot as the soil is unable to drain and the rivers and reservoirs are full.”About 1,500 residents have been ordered to leave their homes in Grazalema, a mountain village popular with hikers, as water seeped through the walls of houses and cascaded along steep cobbled streets.Moreno told Cadena Ser radio that aquifers in the Grazalema mountains were full and could provoke landslides owing to pent-up pressure. “This could cause large holes or ditches. If this happens under a house or street, the result could be dramatic,” he said.He added geologists were assessing the situation in Grazalema to determine when people would be able to return to their homes.During a visit to a coordination post in Andalucía’s Cádiz province on Friday, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, warned that “complicated days” lay ahead and appealed for caution and calm. He said that 10,000 emergency personnel had been deployed to help across the region, adding that the central government was coordinating the response with the Andalucía regional government.View image in fullscreenA man looks at the Alqueva dam discharging water in Moura, in Portugal’s Alentejo region.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/GettyThe heavy rains are also affecting the olive harvest. Francisco Elvira, who leads the Coag farmers’ association in Jaén province, put losses so far at €200m (£174m).Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet, issued orange weather alerts on Friday for coastal areas of the north-western region of Galicia and yellow alerts for other parts of the northern coast, and for southern and eastern coastal areas, as well as for the Balearic islands.Rubén del Campo, an Aemet spokesperson, said more heavy rain would fall on Saturday. “Following a slight letup on Friday, Storm Marta will arrive, bringing heavy rain and very strong winds on Saturday to areas that have already been very adversely affected by the heavy rains of recent days,” he said.“Once Storm Marta moves off on Sunday, further weather fronts will arrive bringing less intense, but still significant, rainfall to most parts of the peninsula apart from Mediterranean areas.”In Portugal’s second-biggest city, Porto, the River Douro overflowed in the early hours on Friday, causing minor flooding at riverside cafe terraces. In the country’s south, large parts of the town of Alcácer do Sal, by the River Sado, remained semi-submerged for a third day.View image in fullscreenEmergency services evacuate an elderly man of Grazalema, Spain, during Storm Leonardo.Photograph: Ramon Rios/EPAThe commander of Portugal’s ANEPC civil protection service, Mario Silvestre, said six rivers, including the Tagus, were at risk of significant flooding, adding that Portugal was facing the worst flood threat along the Tagus in nearly three decades.The damage and uncertainty brought by the storm has given rise to calls to postpone Sunday’s second round of the presidential election.André Ventura, the leader of thefar-right Chega party, said the vote should be delayed by a week as the poll was “a matter of equality among all Portuguese”.But the national electoral authority said the vote would go ahead as scheduled. “A state of emergency, weather alerts or overall unfavourable situations are not in themselves a sufficient reason to postpone voting in a town or region,” it said.Scientists say human-driven climate breakdown is increasing the length, intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as the floods and heatwaves that have struck both countries in recent years.Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsExtreme weatherFloodingPortugalSpainEuropeEurope weathernewsShareReuse this content"

New trends such as baggy jeans and cinch styles, which can be adjusted around the waist, had also helped, as denim has found its way back into wardrobes.Denim lost out in the Covid pandemic era in favour of slouchy dressing for lounging at home. Closed high streets in many parts of the world also affected sales as most people prefer to try on jeans before buying in order to get a good fit.Louise Déglise-Favre, the lead apparel analyst at GlobalData, said sales of jeans were rising faster than the wider fashion market, at about 1.5% a year, as “denim was having a bit of a moment”.She said that denim brands with a certain level of trust and reputation for quality were benefiting from a shift towards value for money that was “not necessarily about low prices but getting your money’s worth”.Established labels such as Levi’s also have strong resale value on sites such as Vinted, while competition from brands such as Topshop, which once flooded the high streets with cheap and trendy jeans, has receded.View image in fullscreenLevi Strauss original jeans. Established labels have a strong resale value.Photograph: Ognyan Yosifov/AlamyDéglise-Favre added that Levi’s had been “slowly rejuvenating its image with celebrity tie-ups relevant to younger shoppers” in a way that was subtle enough that it had “slowly become cool again”.Susie Draffan, the senior denim strategist at the trends agency WGSN, said denim bands were also benefiting from expansion into a wider array of items, from jackets and shirts to skirts, as well as a range of fashionable jeans silhouettes, from wide leg to boot cut.She said denim was now “an important and versatile part of everyday wardrobes” adding: “Nostalgia for the 90s and 2000s, largely driven by gen Z, has boosted denim trends and supported the revival of double denim and complete denim outfitting.”Marcuzzo said sales growth had been led by strong sales online as well as via wholesale accounts and Levi’s own stores – of which it has more than 70 in the UK thanks to the brand being taken up by online influencers, musicians and trendsetters.Levi’s Haus of Strauss in London, a showroom aimed at VIPs, stylists and tastemakers, has helped drive new collaborations such as with Styles and the Japanese designer brand Sacai, the British brand Barbour and Rizzle Kicks’ Jordan Stephens.These local collaborations came on top of the brand benefiting from Beyoncé’s championing of double denim, including with the Levii’sJeanstrack on her Cowboy Carter album released in 2024 and Timothée Chalamet sporting vintage-style Levi’s in Complete Unknown, the 2025 Dylan biopic.Marcuzzo said Levi’s was “reinventing icons” such as the 501 as well as selling its classic fit.“It is about understanding what the customer wants and reinventing and reimagining yourself,” she said.Explore more on these topicsFashionRetail industryJeansEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian intelligence agencies have targeted dozens of Russian military officers and Russian-installed officials since the start of the war, accusing them of involvement in war crimes.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called the shooting a “terrorist attack”, claiming without evidence it was intended to derail talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US to end the war. “This terrorist attack once again confirmed the Zelenskyy regime’s focus on constant provocations, aimed in turn at derailing the negotiation process,” Lavrov said in Moscow.The Ukrainian-born Alekseyev is a deputy director of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, a unit in the defence ministry known for organising covert operations abroad, including assassinations, sabotage and espionage.He was one of the top officers providing Vladimir Putin with intelligence for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.He has also been widely described as a major figure overseeing the country’s private military companies and was among the senior officials dispatched to negotiate with Yevgeny Prigozhin during theWagner group’s brief mutinyin the summer of 2023.After Prigozhin’s revolt, Alekseyev was widely believed to have fallen out of favour in Moscow and was reported to have been briefly detained over his links to Wagner, yet he ultimately retained his post.s.Alekseyev is under sanctions from Washington for his alleged involvement in efforts to interfere in the 2020 US presidential election. The UK also placed sanctions on him over thedeadly 2018 novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.View image in fullscreenA police vehicle in Moscow near the scene of the shooting.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockWithout explicitly claiming responsibility, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, wrote on X that if Alekseyev survived the attack, he would “never sleep peacefully again”.“No war criminal who has killed and tortured Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, destroyed Ukrainian cities, abducted Ukrainian children, or committed other crimes against the Ukrainian people will ever feel safe,” Prokopenko added.The timing of the shooting was striking, coming a day after Russian and Ukrainian delegations – including Alekseyev’s direct superior, Igor Kostyukov –met in Abu Dhabi, where both sides spoke of apparent progress in the peace talks.Previous peace efforts have broken down over Russia’s maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine, with Moscow repeatedly rejecting Kyiv’s calls for an immediate ceasefire.Ukraine has targeted at least three Russian generals in the Moscow region over the past year, though such operations have typically involved explosives.View image in fullscreenA citizen walks past the residential building in Moscow where the shooting took place.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockLittle is publicly known about the clandestine networks believed to be behind assassinations and attacks on military infrastructure inside Russia and in Russian-controlled territories.Alekseyev’s shooting will be seen as the latest failure of Russia’s security services to protect senior military personnel deep inside the country. While details of who carried out the attack and how it was organised remain unclear, Russian military bloggers have criticised apparent security lapses, questioning how a gunman was able to enter the apartment building undetected.Andrei Soldatov, an independent expert on Russia’s security services, called the attack “incredible sloppiness”. “One would have expected them to scale up protection for top military brass,” he wrote on social media.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They gave the two governments 60 days to respond and on Friday published their letter.It contains detailed case studies documenting the treatment of people placed in detention in preparation for being forcibly removed to France under the scheme. They include asylum seekers from Sudan, Gaza, Eritrea, Yemen and Iran, many of whom are survivors of torture and trafficking.The experts said the detention of torture survivors for the scheme “may in itself amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment”, similarly raising concerns that there is a failure to protect people who are suicidal.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron agreed the deal last July.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThe concerns expressed by the UN experts echo those raised by asylum seekers themselves.The Guardian previously revealedthat one man who was returned to France came back to the UK due to fear of smugglers, while those detained issued aseries of reportsabout their treatment in detention and staged a peaceful protest against the scheme while detained, which was responded to by Home Office contractors withriot shields, teargas and dogs.According to the letter, a man from Eritrea was not allowed to wear shoes for his removal, had a hood placed over his head and was forced to the ground with guards’ boots placed on his neck. A woman from Yemen, who said she had been enslaved since the age of three, was told by the Home Office that her account was not credible because she had not immediately disclosed her trafficking history on arrival in the UK.One of the case studies quoted was a man from Gaza who lost his family in Israeli shelling. A family member he escaped with was shot by smugglers who took pictures of all the people in the group and threatened them that if they informed anyone of the death or if they were ever seen back in France they would be killed.The letter states: “We are deeply concerned that the agreement between the [UK and France] … may result in serious violations of international human rights law,” saying they had received information concerning human rights violations of “children and those in vulnerable situations”.The letter poses a series of questions to the two governments relating to unpublished information about the scheme, such as the apparently arbitrary nature of who among small boat arrivals is selected for detention and forced to return to France and who is allowed to have their asylum claims processed in the UK.The experts also ask about protection from onward refoulement once people are sent back to France. The letter says: “We therefore respectfully call [the UK] government to end this agreement with France and ensure that migration governance measures respect, protect and fulfil human rights and not create new situations of vulnerability or exacerbate existing ones.”Home Office says nearly 60,000 people deported from UK or left voluntarily since 2024 electionRead moreBella Mosselmans, the director of the Global Strategic Litigation Council for refugee rights, backed the UN experts’ call for the scheme to be scrapped. She said: “People directly affected by these policies have stood up for themselves, speaking out about the fear, detention and harm they have endured.“The UN has now echoed those lived experiences with a clear and urgent alarm. These UN experts have documented detailed, credible cases showing that this agreement exposes people to serious human rights violations – including threats to life, torture and other ill-treatment, and the denial of due process. Continuing to implement it despite those warnings is indefensible.“We are already aware of dozens of children caught up in this scheme, despite being explicitly excluded from it, many of whom are survivors of trafficking. This letter from nine human rights experts sounds a clear alarm. The UK and France must listen, act now, and stop the harm they are causing.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are confident of the legal basis for this pilot which complies fully with domestic and international law.”A UNHCR spokesperson said: “We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with both the UK and France on the pilot arrangement. This includes sharing concerns and observations directly with the relevant authorities for them to address.”The French interior ministry has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceUnited NationsEuropeHuman rightsInternational lawnewsShareReuse this content"

He’ll face charges related to murder, terrorism, arson, among others,” Bondi told reporters at a press conference at the Department of Justice in Washington DC.The director of theFBI, Kash Patel, added that he needed to protect the “integrity” of the investigation and could not expand on operational details, but noted the government carried out what is known as a “foreign transfer of custody” to bring the suspect to the US.Murdered son of Muammar Gaddafi was perceived as a threat to Libya’s eliteRead moreThe attack on the American government compounds was a political flashpoint of the Obama administration, triggering years of scrutiny and investigations into the government’s preparedness at the time and response to the attack on the consulate, with criticism by Republicans especially focused on Barack Obama and his then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.A Republican-led House committee report, released in 2016, found that Clinton was ultimately not to blame, but identified government security failures, heavily criticizing the then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, for a delay in deploying forces to respond to the attack. At the time, Democrats and critics of the investigation into the attack accused GOP lawmakers of pursuing a politically motivated examination of the tragedy, as Clinton pursued the Democratic presidential nomination.Bondi said that a plane carrying al-Bakoush in custody had landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, just outside DC, overnight.“We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” she said.The DC federal prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro, said that an eight-count indictment charged al-Bakoush with crimes including the murders of Stevens and the state department employee Sean Smith. It was unclear if al-Bakoush had an attorney representing him.On the night of 11 September 2012, officials have said, at least 20 Libyan militants armed with AK-47 assault rifles and grenade launchers breached the gate of the consulate compound in the northern coastal city of Benghazi and set buildings on fire.The resulting blaze led to the deaths of Stevens and Smith. Other state department personnel escaped to a nearby US annex.But a large group assembled for an attack on the annex, including a precision mortar barrage, which resulted in the deaths of the US security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.A Libyan militant suspected of being a mastermind of the attacks, Ahmed Abu Khattala, was captured by US special forces in 2014 and was brought to Washington for prosecution.Hewas convictedon terrorism-related charges, although found not guilty of murder, and is serving a prison sentence. His attorneys argued that the evidence was inconclusive and that he was singled out because of his ultra-conservative Muslim beliefs.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBenghazi attackLibyaUS justice systemUS crimeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He added that the continuance of talks depended on consultations in Washington and Tehran, but saidIranhad underlined that any dialogue required refraining from threats.The talks were the first to be held between Iran and the US since Washington and Israel launched devastating military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and political leadership last June.The US president, Donald Trump, has in recent weeksassembled a large fleetin the region built around the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group, after telling Iranian protesters in January that “help is on the way” during large-scale anti-government demonstrations.Iran, which has experienced intense internal unrest in which thousands of protesters have been killed in a bloody crackdown, had insisted that the talks be confined to guarantees about the civilian purpose of its nuclear programme, and not extend to human rights, its missiles, or support for proxy groups in the region including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. “Our talks are solely nuclear and we do not discuss any other issues with the Americans,” Araghchi said.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi (centre), arriving to meet Omani negotiators in Muscat on Friday.Photograph: Omani foreign ministry/AFP/Getty ImagesThe indirect talks in Muscat were mediated by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, in separate talks between the two sides. The US team was led by Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The US Centcom commander, Adm Brad Cooper, was also present, underlining how Trump has made US military leverage a central part of his diplomatic armoury.Al-Busaidi said in a statement: “These consultations focused on creating suitable conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations emphasising the importance of these talks and parties’ determination to succeed in achieving lasting security and stability.”Trust between Iran and the US has been minimal since the US backed the launch of Israeli military strikes on Iran only days before the two sides were due to meet for a sixth round of talks last June.“After eight turbulent months during which we went through a war, resuming a process of dialogue is not simple,” Araghchi said. “The deep mistrust that has developed on top of previous mistrust is a serious challenge. First we must overcome the prevailing atmosphere of distrust … If this trend continues, I think we can reach a good framework for an agreement”.Washington wanted to expand the talks to cover Iran’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups in the region and “treatment of their own people” – as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Wednesday. But, after days of speculation, Iranian negotiators were satisfied that only the nuclear dispute would be discussed, at least initially.Iran is betting that Trump does not have a plan for regime changeRead moreIran is seeking assurances that the US is not using the talks as a smokescreen to impose regime change.Before the talks, Tehran said the US had to drop its request for the negotiations to be held in Turkey in the presence of foreign ministers from Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.Iran says its right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil – a right it was granted in the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by Barack Obama – is not negotiable. The best source of compromise is that Iran agrees to suspend plans to enrich uranium for a fixed number of years, and a regional consortium is formed that enriches uranium, taking the region closer to an integrated civil nuclear programme.Iran is also seeking sanctions relief in return for a new inspections regime at its nuclear sites. The value of the rial against the dollar has halved since the Israeli attacks in June, and Iran’s plummeting standard of living, made worse by runaway food inflation close to more than 100%, was the spark for the demonstrations that broke out in late December.The talks were meanwhile being held against the backdrop of repeated warnings by Trump that he will strike Iran militarily from the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group if no progress is made. The US has been building up its naval presence in the region after the Iranian government crackdown on protests, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.Tehran has said it will not hesitate to attack Israel or US military bases in the region if it is attacked. Washington last month held back from attacking Iran partly because Israel and the US military did not feel they were fully prepared to withstand the likely Iranian reprisals.Explore more on these topicsIran nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationOmanMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I will discuss further and report back.”The date of the email coincides with Mountbatten-Windsor’s trip to the UAE alongside his mother, the queen; his father, Prince Philip; and the then UK foreign secretary, William Hague.Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was the crown prince of Abu Dhabi at the time.In 2022, he assumed the role of Abu Dhabi’s ruler and president of the UAE.Epstein appeared to respond to Mountbatten-Windsor’s email about his meeting with the UAE foreign minister by suggesting that they arrange a holiday together.“Ask Abdullah for a date when we can all go on vacation,” Epstein wrote.A separate emailappeared to show that Epstein himself met Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, just weeks earlier.“I met with both abdulla -aby dhabi, and mahammed -dubai [sic] today,” read the email, which was sent from Epstein to The Duke on 7 November 2010.A third email appeared to show Epstein guiding Mountbatten-Windsor on how to vouch for him during his meeting with Sheikh Abdullah.Epstein told the Duke to tell the UAE foreign minister about qualities including “trust”, “financial expertise”, “funder of extreme science”, and “fun”.The emails, released by the US Department of Justice, do not imply any wrongdoing by the UAE officials.All emails appear to have been sent when Mountbatten-Windsor served as special representative for UK trade and investment – a role he held from 2001 until 2011.In a separate exchange, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to discuss how to circumvent restrictions on making investments with Epstein while serving as a UK trade envoy.The emails suggest that the former prince considered himself barred from making personal business investments or taking seats on company boards while serving in the role. But the documents also show he discussed ways around the restrictions with Epstein.In one email exchange dated May 2010 – when Epstein was under house arrest after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution – Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to refer to an earlier phone call about potential investments and restrictions on making them.He wrote to Epstein: “So long as I delegate any responsibility to invest then there are no problems.“So Trusts are delegated responsibility as to [too] are any Banks or Investment Vehicles or for that matter Trusted individuals.”Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein’s crimes.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Police said they were investigating whether the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.There were fears the death toll from the blast at the Khadija al-Kubra mosque in Islamabad could rise as some of the injured were reported to be in a critical condition. Television footage and social media images showed police and residents transporting the injured to nearby hospitals.Rescuers and the injured described a harrowing and chaotic scene, with bodies lying on the carpeted floor of the mosque.Hussain Shah said he was praying in the mosque’s courtyard when a sudden, loud explosion occurred. “I immediately thought that some big attack has happened,” he told Associated Press.When he entered the mosque, many of the injured were screaming and crying out for help. Shah said he counted about 30 bodies inside, while the number of injured appeared to be significantly higher.Another person in a clip shared on social media said there were at least two attackers and that they had fired at people before detonating bombs. “People were lying in the pool of blood. I saw people’s heads and limbs separated from their bodies.”Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on its Telegram channel. It has been blamed for previous attacks on Shia worshippers, who are a minority in the country. Militants often target security forces and civilians across Pakistan.Though attacks are not so frequent in Islamabad, there has been a surge in militant violence in Pakistan in recent months, blamed largely on Baloch separatist groups and the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is separate from, but allied with, Afghanistan’s Taliban.Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, condemned the attack in separate statements and extended condolences to the families of those killed. They instructed that all possible medical assistance be provided for the injured.“Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,” Zardari said. “The nation stands with the affected families in this difficult time.”Sharif said he had ordered a full investigation. “Those who are responsible must be identified and punished,” he said.Pakistan targets Balochistan separatists after ‘unprecedented’ assaultsRead morePakistan’s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, also condemned the attack, and asked authorities to ensure the best medical care was provided.Friday’s attack occurred while Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is on an official two-day visit, was attending an event in Islamabad with Sharif. The event was several miles from the mosque.A top Shia leader, Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri, expressed deep sorrow over the attack.“Such a terrorist act in the federal capital is not only a serious failure in protecting human lives but also raises significant questions about the performance of the authorities and law enforcement agencies,” he said. He asked for people to donate blood as the hospitals in Islamabad were in urgent need of supplies.Pakistan’s mainstream media faced a backlash after they initially failed to report the attack.Nadir Gurmani, a journalist with Dawn TV,wrote on X: “Those who don’t understand why people are losing trust in traditional media should just look at the media’s role in today’s coverage of suicide blast in Islamabad. News was circulating on social media, but TV channels did not carry even a single ticker.”One of the deadliest attacks in Islamabad took place in 2008, when asuicide bombing targeted the Marriott hotel, killing 63 people and injuring more than 250. In November last year, a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Islamabad, killing 12 people.The latest attack comes nearly a week after the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army carried out attacks in the south-western Balochistan province, killing about 50 people. Security forces killed more than 200 “terrorists” in response, according to the military.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He was in his second year at university, and we were so proud of him.“One of his main passions was football and he had played since the age of four. He was an Arsenal supporter and we believe he was on his way home to watch the game later that night when he was stabbed and killed.“We want to thank the members of the public who stopped to try and help Khaleed and the ambulance service and hospital staff who did all they could to try and save him.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

And I think that that is just a concern of mine. It’s something that, sadly, we’re seeing a bit more frequently as a result.”Sunak returned topast commentshe has made about how he and his siblings had faced racism growing up in Southampton, adding: “I haven’t a brilliant memory on most things, but that is really seared in my memory, because racism stings in a way that other things don’t.”Referring to Javid, who has also addressed the issue inhis recently published memoirdescribing the racism he experienced in 1970s Rochdale, Sunak said they would agree such experiences were “less common” today.But he added: “There’s always more we can do. And I definitely wouldn’t want us to slip back into a world where racist language was heard regularly on the street, or considered permissible on TV.”The commission is being facilitated by the Together Coalition, founded by Brendan Cox, the husband of theLabour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right extremist.‘It could be a shoe or a stick’: Sajid Javid on being beaten by his father, petty crime – and turning his life aroundRead moreSunak, who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton in North Yorkshire, said: “We’re all British, and underneath that, or alongside that, you can have lots of different identities that don’t come into conflict with that. Of course you can.“I’m British, I’m British Asian, I’m British Hindu, English. Sotonian – what we call people from Southampton, and an apprentice Yorkshireman.”On immigration, Sunak said that, with hindsight, he wished he had implemented measures to bring down numbers sooner.On the tensions that spilled over into street violence in 2024, he said it was “evident that something has gone wrong” and that it was made worse by Islamist extremists and the far right, which were “feeding off each other”.It was “a lie” that Britain was a racist country, Sunak said, citing Javid’s career and his own, and adding that his successor as Tory leader is “a Black woman who grew up in Nigeria”.Sunak was speaking after a speech by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, earlier in the week in which he addressed themes including “British values” and warned against allowing migration policy to be exploited “by people who think whiteness is the same thing as Britishness”.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakRaceFar rightConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only Norton, in fact, but the stars from the guest lineup who sat alongside Swift when she appeared in October 2025: actors Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith, and fellow chart-topping musicianLewis Capaldi.The whimsical, fantastical video, produced with a retro 90s aesthetic, is written and directed by Swift. Her lonely character befriends a pet rock, while Gleeson’s equally lonely character has a similar friendship with a cactus, before a magical substance – the spray-on Opalite – brings the two together. Norton appears as a salesman hawking a reverse serum, Nope-alite, while Turner-Smith plays a fitness instructor, and Lee mimes along to Swift’s song as a fictional singer-songwriter on MTV. Capaldi plays a mall photographer, while the final guest that week, Cillian Murphy, does not act in the video but appears as a billboard image and provides a voiceover.“The thrill of a lifetime and the hardest secret I’ve ever had to keep!! Thank you thank you,” Norton wrote on Instagram.Introducing the video, Swift called Norton “insanely charismatic and lovable” and said of the October show: “I remember thinking I got ridiculously lucky with the group I was paired with … I was instantly struck with an *idea*.“And so a week later [Gleeson] received an email script I’d written for the Opalite video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn’t mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90’s with us and help with this video.”‘Tickets have become status symbols’: from Harry Styles to Taylor Swift, why is live music bigger and more expensive than ever?Read moreSwift is a relatively regular guest on Norton’s long-running BBC chatshow, appearing five times since 2013, sitting alongside the likes of Bono and John Cleese. Her casting of Norton is a demonstration of his growing transatlantic cachet: clips from his show frequently go viral in the US, and he has himself appeared on Seth Meyers’ US talkshow.Opalite had already reached as high as No 2 in the UK charts when it was first released, but it is likely to shoot up again in next week’s chart from its current position of No 15.The video is available on Spotify and Apple Music, and will appear on YouTube on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftGraham NortonTelevisionLewis CapaldinewsShareReuse this content"

APCO also sought to identify the journalists’ sources.Simons received a briefing from APCO on its final report, sources said, which included findings drawn from examination of the journalists who had investigated Labour Together.Labour thinktank close to Morgan McSweeney paid firm to investigate journalistsRead moreThe disclosures about Simons’ personal knowledge of the private investigation present another major challenge to Starmer and McSweeney, his most senior aide, after a week in which both havefaced calls for their resignationoverPeter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.Under McSweeney, Labour Together played a key role in Starmer’s victory in the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and remained closely allied to the Labour leader after Simons took charge.APCO’s work to investigate the journalists wasfirst reportedby the Substack publication Democracy for Sale. Downing Street has refused to say whether McSweeney also knew about the hiring of APCO.Two sources said he was intimately involved with the strategy of the organisation even after leaving. One said: “There was never any distance between Labour Together and Morgan, even after he left.”Earlier on Friday, there were calls from Labour MPs for an investigation and a “clear-out” in Downing Street after news of the thinktank’s relationship with APCO emerged. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the investigation into journalists “truly shocking” in a letter to Hollie Ridley, the Labour party’s general secretary.He added: “If the reports of [Labour Together’s] activities in surveilling journalists are accurate it is clear that this organisation and its operators and controllers are bringing our party into disrepute.”Ridley, who is close to McSweeney, has refused to launch an investigation, telling McDonnell in reply: “As there is no contractual or governance relationship between Labour Together and the party, any allegations regarding the activity of Labour Together as an entity fall outside our remit.”McDonnell called the refusal to investigate “appallingly complacent and ill-judged”. He added in a response to Ridley: “Given the seriousness of this matter and the report of the alleged direct involvement of Labour party members in this activity I would have expected you to have taken this matter more seriously.”The Labour MP Kim Johnson said that “what’s been exposed shows McSweeney’s operation is rotten to the core”. She added: “We’re told the adults are in the room. If this is their idea of leadership, No 10 needs gutting from top to bottom.”Questions over Labour Together’s fundingfirst emerged in February 2021after its interim leadership reported itself to the Electoral Commission for the late reporting of £740,000 in donations. The thinktank was later fined £14,250 in September 2021.In November 2023, the Sunday Timespublished an investigationthat alleged it was McSweeney who had failed to declare the donations between 2017 and 2020. The undeclared money is said to have paid for polling and campaigning that supported Starmer’s rise to the Labour leadership. McSweeney did not comment on the allegation.McSweeney formally left Labour Together in April 2020 when he became Starmer’s chief of staff upon his election as party leader. Sources close to McSweeney said he had not taken the decision to hire APCO and it was a matter for Labour Together.By the time of the Sunday Times investigation, Labour Together was being led by Simons. APCO was commissioned following concerns at the thinktank that the information published had been derived from a potential data breach, a source told the Guardian.Internal reports prepared by APCO for Labour Together named the Sunday Times journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, as well as the Guardian’s Henry Dyer, Declassified UK’s John McEvoy and journalists from other outlets as “significant persons of interest”. It sought to “identify the source of the information and to ascertain what additional information could be published” by journalists about Labour Together.APCO’s research included an examination of stories and social media posts written by the journalists. The work was led at APCO by Tom Harper, a former journalist at the Sunday Times. Harper provided briefings to Simons, sources have told the Guardian.Democracy for Sale has alleged Labour Together paid the PR firm at least £30,000 to identify the source of stories about its funding.The briefings supplied to the thinktank by APCO claim that one possible source of the Sunday Timesstory was a Russian or Chinese hack of the Electoral Commission.The contract shows that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the American journalist Matt Taibbi.Those close to the group said they were concerned that the information accessed by Holden and Taibbi originated from a hack of the Electoral Commission itself.They added that they did not intend for the probe to look into other journalists, even though the contract itself specifically mentioned the article by Pogrund and Yorke.Simons’ receipt of APCO’s research – which focused on the work of journalists carrying out public interest investigations into the finances of the thinktank that he led – has raised questions about his role as a Cabinet Office minister.Labour Together did not comment. One person who has previously worked with the group called the decision to hire investigators “bizarre”, adding: “I’ve never come across anything like it in my political life.” Another said it was “weird”.One Labour MP said: “If the prime minister wants to regain the support of the parliamentary Labour party, he has got to get Morgan the hell out of the party. Otherwise he will end up bringing it into disrepute.”Simons claimed on X on Friday night that the intention of the APCO project was to look into a suspected illegal hack “which had nothing to do with UK journalists at Sunday Times, Guardian or any other brilliant UK newspaper”.He added: “APCO’s investigation never fully got to the bottom of this. Those who know me know I think the work of journalists is vital to our democracy.”Simons and Harper did not respond to a formal request for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

TheElectoral Commissionsaid the omission was a matter for the police, stressing that failing “to include an imprint in candidate election material is an offence”.Dozens of voters in the Gorton and Denton constituency reported receiving letters from a pensioner written in a handwriting-style font on Friday. The letters do not include an imprint saying who they have been funded and distributed by, as required by electoral law.The author of the letter, Patricia Clegg, describes herself in the mail-outs only as a “local pensioner, 74 years old”.When contacted by the Guardian, Clegg confirmed she was a member of Reform UK and had been asked to write the letter by the party.In Gorton and Denton, I found a long-festering sense of fury that Labour has no idea how to tackle | John HarrisRead more“I was asked to support Reform; would I be willing to do a letter and put my name to it? And I said, ‘Yeah’, and I left the rest to them,” she said, when asked if she had written the letter.Asked if she was aware that the letter did not have the legally necessary imprint saying it was backed by the party, she said no one had talked to her about that issue.A Reform spokesperson said the campaign had commissioned the letter which was given to its print contractor “with the full and correct legal imprint, fully compliant with election law” but “an error occurred during the printing process”. Subsequently the legal imprint was “inadvertently removed at the point of printing” without the party’s knowledge.“At no stage did the campaign know about, authorise or intend the distribution of material without a legal imprint,” the spokesperson said. Hardings Print Solutions, in Middlesex, which printed the letter, said it “took full responsibility” for the error.A spokesperson forGreater Manchesterpolice confirmed it had received a report about the breach of electoral law on Friday evening. “We will be investigating this,” they said.The Electoral Commission said all printed material promoting a candidate at an election is required to include an imprint identifying the promoter and printer. “Enforcement of imprint requirements for candidate material is a matter for the police,” a spokesperson said.Labour accuses Reform candidate of ‘toxic politics’ after Tommy Robinson endorsementRead moreThe letter stated that the author had previously “voted Labour because Keir Starmer told us things would change for the better. They haven’t.” It added that tax rises “have cost pensioners like me an extra £160 that we cannot afford”.The author also says they “understand why some neighbours have had enough of Keir Starmer and are thinking of voting Green. But I do not believe the Greens have answers to our problems. They have extreme policies likelegalising drugsand letting men use women’s changing rooms. What good would that do people like us?”Several copies of the letter were posted on local Facebook and WhatsApp groups, with people saying they received them on Friday morning.One voter, who said they were not affiliated to any party, said they had reported the matter to theManchestercity council’s elections office.Thebyelectionis expected to be tightly fought between Labour, the Greens and Reform, with all three claiming they are on course to win.On Friday, a Green party spokesperson accused Reform of “playing dirty”.“With Reform raking in millions from crypto billionaires and fossil fuel giants, you’d think they’d be able to afford to follow the law,” they said. “But instead they’re playing dirty – because they know te Greens are coming for them in Gorton and Denton.“The only way to stop Reform’s politics of division and hate is to vote forHannah Spencer– to elect a Green MP who will fight to lower bills, protect the NHS and rebuild our public services.”View image in fullscreenHannah Spencer, the Green party candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLabour’s campaign political lead Andrew Western MP said: “Campaigns are responsible for what they put through people’s doors.

His mother [Nicole Smith] and I are devastated,” the statement said.Lil Jon described his son as an “amazingly talented young man” who was a music producer, artist, engineer and New York University graduate.“Thank you for all of the prayers and support in trying to locate him over the last several days. Thank you to the entire Milton police department involved,” the Snap Yo Fingers rapper added.Nathan Smith, known professionally as DJ Young Slade, left his home in Milton “under unusual circumstances” early on Tuesday morning, police said.“Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet,” Lil Jon’s statement reads. “He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted – he loved his family and the friends in his life to the fullest.”Smith, 27, “ran out of his house and has been missing since”, police said on a missing person poster they circulated on social media.He “left on foot and does not possess a phone”, police said. “He may be disoriented and in need of assistance. Family and friends are concerned for his safety.”Milton police immediately began searching for Smith, police said. After being unable to locate him, police and other agencies expanded the search to include a pond near Smith’s residence. Shortly before noon Friday, Cherokee county fire department divers found a body in the pond.“The individual is believed to be Nathan Smith, pending official confirmation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office,” police said in a statement. The medical examiner did not immediately respond to inquiries about the case on Friday.“Based on the investigation to date, there is no indication of foul play,” police said. “However, the Milton Police Department Criminal Investigations Division will continue to treat this as an open and active investigation.”Police said no further details would be released until the cause and manner of death were determined by the medical examiner.Milton is a suburban town about 30 miles (48km) north of Atlanta.Lil Jon, born Jonathan Smith, is an Atlanta rapper and producer who was a central figure in the crunk subgenre of hip-hop. He is known for songs including 2002’s Get Low with his group the East Side Boyz and 2013’s Turn Down for What with DJ Snake.He also has a daughter, Nahara, who was born in 2024.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsHip-hopCelebritynewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain,Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.Between the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the640,000-sq-ft, four-storywarehouse.Amazon offers tours to the public at28of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.Melania: Amazon’s $106m documentary takes $982 per screen in Australian opening weekendRead moreBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers havereportedhaving to pee in water bottles due tolack of time and access, and have even said theirbathroom breaks are timed.Zoe Hoffman, anAmazonspokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.None of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.Amazoncites 10 different robotsthrough its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.Several sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.The tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.The tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.Criticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the workerorganizing effortsat the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.The tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.Throughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.The second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room.Robotsresembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.The tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.Back on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.Not so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.Amazon tells workers it will cut 16,000 jobs worldwide in second big wave of layoffsRead moreTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics,told the Guardian in 2022he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”He said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”Now the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive,toldwhite-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.In October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, whichincludedplans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.Amazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.The companylaid off about 14,000 corporate employeesthe same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recentlyannouncedplans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazondeniedthat AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”Amazon isreportedlydeveloping “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.In November, more than 1,000 Amazon workerssigned an open letterexpressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.Staff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”They also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”An Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonGeorgiaRobotsE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What does it mean for the war – and for Putin?A wartime boom in Russia has given way to sluggish growth, tax hikes and squeezed public services. Will it affect the conflict in Ukraine?Alex ClarkFri 6 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareWestern leaders were bullish when they imposed sanctions on Russia after the invasion ofUkrainein 2022.“The Russian economy is on track to be cut in half,”saidthe then US president, Joe Biden, in March, a month into the war.“It was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion – and soon it will not even rank among the top 20.”His prediction was off the mark. After the immediate shock of sanctions in 2022, Russia’s military spending surged and the economy boomed.Rather than falling out of the top 20, Russia was the world’s ninth biggest economy as of 2025, overtaking Canada and Brazil to rank just behind Italy, France and the UK.But further climbs now seem unlikely. In 2026, there are clear signs that the Russian economy is finally running aground.While the dramatic collapse envisaged by the west may be off the cards, the Kremlin faces its most precarious economic position since its tanks first rolled into Ukraine.The Russian economy is starting to stagnateRussian Federation, year-on-year GDP growth (%) by quarter-4%0%4%8%West applies sanctionsafter invasion of UkraineRecessionBoomStagnationGuardian graphic. Source: Russian Federal State Statistics ServiceGrowth has slowed to a crawl amid falling oil prices – a key source of government revenue – and long-term demographic pressures that high defence spending previously masked.To bridge the fiscal gap, ordinary Russians face tax hikes and a state that has been rewired for war, with funding for welfare, education and healthcare crowded out.The cost of Russia's war economyPercentage-point change in share of spending in federal budget, between 2021 and 2025, Russian FederationGuardian graphic.

Figures for both years represent planned spendingMeanwhile, trade with key allies has become more muted, corporate bankruptcies are rising and labour shortages are severe.How the malaise will affect the conflict in Ukraine is, experts say, dependent on Russia’s recent macroeconomic manoeuvres – and whether global events continue to drive down oil prices.Growth downgrade as oil revenues dry upThe current outlook is unfavourable. In January the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its growth forecasts for Russia to an estimate of just 0.6% in 2025 and 0.8% in 2026.Outside the pandemic years of 2020-22, these are the lowest annual growth rates for Russia since a recession caused by sanctions over the 2014 annexation of Crimea.They are also lower than the IMF’s forecasts for economies in the west.Chart comparing growth in Russia to the westThis loss in economic momentum comes at the same time as falling oil and gas revenues – a key underpinning of Russia’s war machine.In 2022 the tax take from fossil fuels made up about 40% of funding in the Russian federal budget, more than enough to pay for the war.But preliminary estimates for the first three-quarters of 2025 show this share has dropped to 25%.Falling prices are partly behind this – the price of Ural oil has dropped from about $90 (£66) a barrel in early 2022 to $50 a barrel by the end of 2025 – amid aglobal glut of oil supply.But the west’s sanctions are playing a role too, despite Russia’s efforts to find new buyers.China, India and to a lesser extent Turkey all increased their purchases in the wake of the invasion, as exports toEuropefell off sharply.But as of 2026, their combined business pales in comparison with how much the countries that imposed sanctions were buying on the eve of war.Chart showing how current purchases of Russian gas and oil by its allies is smaller than how much sanctioning countries were purchasingIndia in particular has wound down purchases in recent months, amidthreats of trade tariffs from the US president, Donald Trump.Isaac Levi, a policy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said: “Russia’s fossil fuel export earnings in 2025 were 13% below prewar levels, squeezed by tougher sanctions, Ukraine’s drone strikes on energy infrastructure, the struggle to find new markets for its gas exports, and lower global oil prices.“These pressures are steadily draining the revenues Moscow relies on to bankroll its war – but Ukraine’s allies must go further to fully constrain the Kremlin’s war chest.“Targeting Russia’s shadow fleet, including detaining flagless vessels, would sharply constrain its oil export volumes as well as its earnings.”Long-term pressures still not solvedVladimir Putin’s problems with oil may be just a temporary setback, particularly if oil prices begin to recover in 2026.But there are also long-term demographic pressures that are now biting the Russian economy hard.The Russian population has fallen consistently since 2019, from 145.5 million to 143.5 million in 2024.A combination of falling fertility rates, casualties of the war and emigration are to blame.Although western countries have seen similar falls in their fertility rates, they have not been as large, and immigration has helped keep populations rising.Russia has a population problemPopulation by year, 1960 to 2024Guardian graphic. Source: World Bank except Germany, which is taken from Our World in Data“Russia doesn’t have the potential for rapid growth,” said Dr Marek Dabrowski, a fellow at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel.“The war-related business climate is, of course, part of the story, but the major story here is the long-term demographics. It hasn’t changed.”This means labour shortages are now commonplace in Russia – a fact that experts say can be seen in its unusually low unemployment rate of just 2%.The Kremlin has sought to shore up its fiscal position with several hefty tax rises.In 2025 it increased corporation tax from 20% to 25%, and introduced higher income tax bands.In addition, a rise in VAT came into force at the beginning of 2026 – from 20% to 22%, which is higher than in the US, the UK, France or Germany.Though the Russian government has exempted some essential goods, the VAT hike comes on top of persistent inflation in Russia that has driven up the price of basics.While much has been made of the impact of the war on inflation in the west, Russia has experienced far higher inflation for longer.Chart showing how inflation in Russia spiked more sharply and has been more persistentEfforts to combat this inflation have only added to the slowdown.Dr Vladislav Inozemtsev, an economist and co-founder of the Centre for Analysis and Strategies in Europe thinktank, said: “There is an irresponsible policy conducted by the central bank and the finance ministry that started to ‘cool the economy off’ in 2023 for fighting inflation.“For this, the central bank has raised its key rate up to 21%, the government abandoned its subsidised mortgage programme, and the banks started to cut loans and increase rates, most of which were not fixed but floating.“Why the Kremlin was supportive of such a policy is kind of a riddle for me.”Optimism softening as military spending slowsThere are signs this economic hardship is taking a toll on the morale of ordinary Russians.According topolling conducted in Russia by Gallup, the invasion of Ukraine initially increased optimism about the economy in Russia, amid the wartime boom.In July 2021, most Russians believed the economy was getting worse, but in November 2022 this situation had reversed, with most believing conditions were getting better.Yet as of August 2025, this optimism has softened, with 39% of Russians saying economic conditions are getting worse, up from 29% in 2022.Economic optimism is softening after four years of warShare of Russians who believe economic conditions are gettingbetter,worse, or staying thesame.Jul 2021%%%Russia invades Ukraine in Feb 2022Nov 2022%%%Jul 2023%%%Oct 2024%%%Aug 2025%%%Guardian graphic. Source: Gallup. Responses to the question: 'Right now, do you think that economic conditions in the city or area where you live, as a whole, are getting better or getting worse?''. 'Don't knows' are represented by white space.The key question for Ukraine is whether Russia will be able to maintain its surge in military expenditure.Over the course of the war, Russian military expenditure as a share of GDP has doubled to more than 7%.That is twice as high as the US’s spending of 3.4% of its GDP, and higher than any individual member of Nato.But the rise in spending in the first few years of war has now slowed, with only a 0.1 percentage point increase between 2024 and 2025.[ ][ ] Chart showing how Russia’s defence spending as a % of GDP is far ahead of NATO members’, but the recent surge has slowedHowever, Russia is in a unique position when it comes to options for maintaining its war chest.Borrowing is possible because Russia has a relatively low stock of debt – though access to international markets has been cut since the invasion and subsequent sanctions – and taxes could be raised again.And much is dependent on what happens to oil. Further falls in prices may mean increased precariousness, but equally, rises might mean stabilisation.Experts therefore conclude that Russia should be able to keep paying for the war, at least in the short term.“Putin will encourage the central bank to print money; he will continue to raise taxes, sell state property and nationalise business corporations,” said Inozemtsev.“This will allow him to get enough money to wage the war for 2026, and, most probably, for 2027.”There is also the question of whether growing economic discontent in Russia will translate into growing political discontent.But in the last few weeks, there is evidence the Kremlin’s thinking has changed.Russia has agreed to peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, with meetings led by the US taking place in Abu Dhabi this week.For Ukraine’s negotiators, a key factor is now in play: Russia’s war economy is showing signs of weakness, and cannot last for ever."

Potential clients included the Russian state investment firm Rusnano and the state-owned China International Capital Corporation, the emails suggest.The emails also showed that Wegg-Prosser met Epstein at his New York townhouse in 2010 to discuss the business. A person with knowledge of the situation said the meeting was at Mandelson’s request and only lasted 25 minutes.Wegg-Prosser resigned as Global Counsel’s chief executive on Fridayamid intense scrutiny.Boss of lobbying firm founded with Peter Mandelson quits after Epstein revelationsRead moreA huge trove of 3m files from the investigation into Epstein has laid bare the extent of the financier’s communication with a host of politicians, business leaders and royalty from around the world. Epstein served a 2008 jail term for child sex offences, but retained much of his influence until his arrest and death in custody in 2019.The revelation that Mandelson and Epstein were in close contact after his conviction has caused a political crisis for Keir Starmer. The prime minister isunder intense pressureafter he revealed that he appointed Mandelson to the role of US ambassador despite knowing about his friendship with Epstein.Mandelson did not respond to requests for comment.Global Counsel has tried to distance itself from the scandal, revoking Mandelson’s voting rights and pushing him to divest his stake in the business. A Global Counsel spokesperson said Epstein played no role in the foundation of the business.However, the emails give an insight into the work of Global Counsel, and reveal the efforts of Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser to secure lucrative work.The documents showed that Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser both individually met Epstein in March 2010, when Mandelson was still business minister, and before the formal foundation of Global Counsel. The meetings took place at Epstein’s New York townhouse, according to aschedulecontained in the files. Wegg-Prosser was described in a separateemailsetting up his meeting as “Mandelson’s friend”. Mandelson had emailed a few weeks earlier saying that: “Ben is coming to NYC to meet you and explain the business plan …”Mandelson left office after the general election in May 2010 when Labour lost power, although he remained a member of the House of Lords. Within days he had already startedpushing for jobs with mining company Glencore and oil major BP.However, Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser also pushed ahead with forming Global Counsel. In August Mandelson wrote in anemailthat the Russian state-owned Sberbank would be a potential target for business.By October 2010 Wegg-Prosser wrote in anemailto a healthcare chief executive that the company would “consider opportunities in Russia, principally via Rusnano, who we are in discussions with”. Rusnano is a technology investment fund owned by the Russian state. A person close to Global Counsel said the discussions happened before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at a time when the UK was attempting to deepen business relations with Russia.By January 2011 Global Counsel appeared to have its sights on another large state-backed target: China International Capital Corporation. Wegg-Prosser sent a list of “leads” to James Palumbo, a peer and businessman who appeared to refer to Mandelson as “Mr Grumpy”.In anemailresponse to Wegg-Prosser, Palumbo advised Global Counsel to offer expensive communications advice. He wrote: “It seems a pity to let a third party take care of a potential 5-10 year communications mandate worth £250,000 a year from CICC.”The email also appeared to suggest that another possible client for Global Counsel was “BAE”, likely a reference to BAE Systems, the UK’s largest defence manufacturer. Mandelson’s work as business secretarydirectly concerned BAE Systems. A BAE Systems spokesperson said: “We have never appointed Global Counsel as a strategic adviser to BAE Systems and we have no record of having contracted the company in any other capacity.”In May 2012, Mandelson was still chasing Russian connections. Before a World Economic Forum event in Istanbul, Mandelsonclaimedthat “I will email Putin” and other senior politicians to try to organise meetings. There is no evidence in the files that he received any response.By 29 May 2012, a Global Counsel employee prepared a pitch to a Greek state-owned development fund offering help “securing a very high level of political awareness of the fund and its role”. The fund, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, was set up in 2011 to oversee privatisations amid the chaos of the country’s sovereign debt crisis.The draft pitch, sent to Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser, advised a “strategy that seeks to establish links” with top-level policymakers across Europe, including the UK’s “No 10” and “the Treasury”.Wegg-Prosser held another meeting in February 2011 with the Iranian property developer Vincent Tchenguiz to discuss possible work by Global Counsel. The meeting happened three weeks before Tchenguiz and his brother, Robert, were arrested by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO later abandoned the botched investigation and paidTchenguiz £6m in damages and costs.In anemailto Epstein before the arrest, Mandelson described Tchenguiz as a “very interesting Iranian now in Park Lane” – after being informed by Wegg-Prosser that there were “wider reputational issues” because Tchenguiz could be described as a “corporate raider”.A spokesperson on behalf of Tchenguiz’s Consensus Business Group said: “Neither Vincent Tchenguiz nor Consensus Business Group have engaged the services of Global Counsel. Although we met with Global Counsel, it didn’t progress to any commercial, or further engagement.”A spokesperson for Global Counsel said: “Global Counsel was founded by Ben Wegg-Prosser with Peter Mandelson and with a founding investment from WPP plc in November in 2010. Epstein never played any role in the establishment or ongoing business of Global Counsel, in any form whatsoever.“Like Gordon Brown and many others we are only now being made aware of the full extent of Mandelson’s conduct.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonLobbyingnewsShareReuse this content"

The screentime management features were too easy to dismiss and parental controls were time-draining to install, the preliminary ruling added.The commission said its preliminary views did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and TikTok would have the opportunity to challenge its findings.Online safety campaigners have urged politicians to tackle features on social media platforms that encourage users to stay online. The crossbench peer and online safety campaigner Beeban Kidron, a leading voice in the UK debate, hasurged the British governmentto “detoxify the dopamine loops” of addictive social media platforms.Breaches of the DSA can result in a fine totalling up to 6% of a company’s annual turnover, as well as the imposition of remedies such as an app redesign. TikTok does not publish its revenues, but according to estimates from the World Advertising Research Centre it will post revenues of $35bn (£26bn) this year.TikTok said it rejected the commission’s findings. “The commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us,” a spokesperson for the company said.Last year Elon Musk’s X was fined €120m (£104m) for a breach of the DSA in the first-ever fine under the legislation. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue-tick verification badge given to users, and impeding research around what adverts the platform had hosted.Explore more on these topicsTikTokInternet safetySocial mediaEuropean UnionChildrenDigital mediaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Knicks and Timberwolves, meanwhile, made smart additionsFri 6 Feb 2026 09.31 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 10.02 ESTShareIt’s hard to match the absolute insanity that wasthe 2024-25 NBA trade deadline, and to the majority of the league’s credit, teams didn’t really try. But there was still some notable movement ahead of Thursday’s 3pm EST deadline – to varying degrees of success. Let’s do the early assessment of who came out on top, and who left us scratching our heads.WinnersWashington Wizards.I’m old enough to remember a season ago, before theblockbuster Luka Dončić trade, when Anthony Davis, bad injury luck and all, was regarded as a top-12 player in the NBA. To start this season, he was even garnering MVP buzz. The Dallas Mavericks were understandably eager to put the dark stain that was one of the most ill-conceived trades in NBA history behind them and focus on their exciting young Rookie of the Year candidateCooper Flagg, but in doing so, they moved on from Davis at the floor of his trade value. Enter stage left: the Wizards, whoacquiredboth Davis and fun-but-polarizingfour-time All-Star Trae Youngthis deadline. They gave up only two first-round picks in totality for both stars – neither of which will likely end up higher than the No 20s – and the players they shipped out, including veterans Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum, were hardly needle-movers. It’s a very low-risk and potentially high-reward move to embrace the ascent of young upstarts Alex Sarr and Kyshawn George, and raise a middle finger to the bottom dwelling. Add in a potential high lottery pick in a stacked draft, and Washington could be cooking with gas next season.Welcome to Duncanville: why the road to the NBA runs through DallasRead moreNew York Knicks.It’s often the smaller, less flashy moves at the deadline that end up being the most impactful for teams who fancy themselves contenders. See: the 2024 Mavericks trading for Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington in a series of small but savvy swings that ultimately sent them to the NBA finals. (Yes, they made some, shall we say, questionable deadline moves the following year, but we won’t get into those.) It’s my wager that the Knicks made one such move on Thursday, when they traded two second-round picks for Jose Alvarado, the workhorse guard who’s earned such a reputation for his sneaky on-ball defense that he’s earned the nickname “Grand Theft Alvarado”. The Knicks need his off-the-bench services more than it even initially seemed, as their current reliable bench guard Deuce McBride is sidelined indefinitely after abdominal surgery. But even on a fully healthy roster, Alvarado is a beautiful fit. The native New Yorker is tough and gritty, with a high motor and a flair for the dramatic: in other words, the perfect Knick.View image in fullscreenAyo Dosunmu is a deft addition to an already strong Timberwolves roster.Photograph: Morry Gash/APMinnesota Timberwolves.In the summer of 2019, the Los Angeles Lakers struck out on the belle of the free agency ball, Kawhi Leonard. While they were the butt of preseason jokes for missing out on Leonard’s services in favor of the neighboring Clippers, it ended up being the best thing that could have happened to them. They were forced, by necessity, to redirect their attention to assembling depth on the fly, and the result was an NBA championship the ensuing season. I predict a potentially similar fate for the 2026 Timberwolves, who, at least for now, struck out on their pursuit of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Minnesota made preemptive cap space for the move in the form of a Mike Conley salary dump, but wound up snagging Ayo Dosunmu from the Chicago Bulls to fill a dire need at the guard spot instead. Dosunmu is a sneaky-great get for this Minnesota roster, which is already a bona fide contender. They were served well by not blowing it up.Honorable mention: Indiana Pacers.It was a cruel twist of fate that separated two potential Pacers timelines: in one, they’re champions after one of the most remarkable Cinderella runs in NBA history. In the other, the one we’re living in, Tyrese Haliburtonruptures his achillesin the first quarter of Game 7 of the NBA finals, and the devastating loss sends them headfirst off a cliff into the tanking abyss. They’re handling that reality about as well as possible, though: they’ve executed a flawless tank in preparation for one of the most talented draft classes in recent memory. While they lost center Myles Turner to the Milwaukee Bucks in free agency, they replaced him at this deadline with stellar center and rebound machine Ivica Zubac, who made the All-Defensive second team just last year. In the trade for Zubac, the Pacers did send the Clippers their aforementionedveryvaluable first-round pick this coming year, which is a little risky, but they only ship it to Los Angeles if it lands in spots No 5 to No 9. They also parted ways with Bennedict Mathurin and one other future first. Assuming this year’s pick stays in their hands, Indiana could enter next season with a fully healthy Haliburton, a nicely retooled roster, and a blue chip prospect. Not too shabby.Giannis Antetokounmpo boos own fans during Bucks’ dismal loss to TimberwolvesRead moreHonorable mention: Los Angeles Clippers.Self awareness is an incredibly valuable, and yet all too rare, front office trait in the NBA. It can be difficult to take a clear-eyed look in the mirror and be honest with yourself about who you really are, and it’s worth commending the Clippers front office for doing that at this trade deadline. The hole they dug themselves to start the season was going to be too big to climb out of, and any aspirations of contention were fool’s gold. They allegedly didn’t knowJames Hardenwas going to ask for a trade until quite recently, but as soon as he did, they were willing to pivot, and did a commendable job. While Darius Garland’s nagging foot injury is worrisome, he’s a decade younger than Harden and has serious upside. And in the haul they got for Zubac, they may end up with a 2026 first-round pick in an absolutely stacked draft.LosersNew Orleans Pelicans.To be fair, the Pelicans sealed their fate as a loser this year way back in the summer when they inexplicably sent anunprotected 2026 first-round pickto the Atlanta Hawks for the rights to *checks notes* move up 10 spots in the 2025 draft. The absolutely incomprehensible miscalculation of their own status in the league and likelihood to be anything more than a bottom-dweller this year proved to be, predictably, too much to overcome. The Pelicans are 14th in the Western Conference, but instead of surrendering to their fate and having a firesale of their hottest commodities – the likes of Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones – they whimpered out of the deadline only having made one move: sending Alvarado to the Knicks for Dalen Terry and two second-round picks. The Pelicans need a long, hard look in the mirror: they’re going nowhere fast.Everyone invested in the Giannis sweepstakes.We all have that one friend who talks about how they need to break up with their spouse every time you see them. But, inevitably, if given an exit route from their relationship, this same friend always responds the same way: “Well, I love him, my family is close with his family, we have two years left on our lease …” This is the story of Antetokounmpo and the Bucks. It’sreally, really timefor them to break up, and for this reason, we all foolishly believed they would. Instead, they pumpfaked, and the Greek Freak is still a Buck. Among the teams left in smouldering ash in the wake of the fake-out: the Golden State Warriors, who had to settle for oft-injured Kristaps Porzingis, and the Miami Heat, who thought they were frontrunners for Antetokounmpo and ended up empty-handed at the deadline. The reward for the roundtable prognostication we collectively endured that resulted in absolutely nothing? Four more months of that, at minimum. We are all losers here.Honorable mention: 2026 Los Angeles Clippers fans.Their fans, on the other hand? They have my sympathies. They hadonegood month of happiness and cheer, and it was gone just as quickly as it came. Hang in there, Clippers fans: you still havethe NBA’s foremost arborist.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsWashington WizardsNew York KnicksDallas MavericksMinnesota TimberwolvesanalysisShareReuse this content"

For the first time, an Olympic opening ceremony in effect happened across multiple live venues all at once, with Milan, Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo linked into one narrative structure. It felt less like a show in a stadium and more like watching a country performitselfin real time. The organising concept – “Armonia”, the idea that different elements can move together without losing their identity – isn’t just branding. It shapes how the ceremony actually functioned. Sitting in San Siro, you’re constantly aware that somewhere else, at that exact moment, another piece of the story is unfolding. It created a strange sense of scale: intimate and enormous at once. In an era when global attention is fragmented across screens and platforms, Italy staged the opposite – a ceremony built on simultaneity, connection and shared rhythm.‘We are all connected’: Winter Olympics opening ceremony stresses harmony and showcases ItalyRead more2A tapestry of four small ceremoniesInstead of the usual slow-motion lap of a single stadium – the emotional endurance test that most ceremonies turn into – the parade here was deliberately fractured. Ice athletes appeared in Milan, freestyle and snowboard athletes in Livigno, Nordic athletes in Predazzo, and sliding and biathlon athletes in Cortina. Logistically, it reduced travel. Emotionally, it changed the rhythm. You lose the slow, building crescendo of delegations marching into one space, but gain something more intimate and modern – almost like watching four opening ceremonies stitched into one broadcast. It also felt unmistakably Italian in execution. The visual design leans hard into aesthetics: banners styled to resemble blocks of ice, uniforms pulling as much from fashion logic as sports tradition. The result is less “march of nations” and more curated visual sequence. It didn’t have the overwhelming, wall-of-flags impact of a single stadium parade, but it replaced it with something arguably closer to how global sport actually is now: distributed, simultaneous and networked.View image in fullscreenA firework display at the Arco della Pace after the lighting of the Olympic cauldron to open Milano Cortina 2026.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/Getty Images3Parade delivers big fashion statementThe Olympics always deliver two specific pleasures: the dopamine hit of suddenly caring about sports you didn’t know existed and the spectacle of athletes walking out in national kit that doubles as soft power. On Friday night, you could feel the second one happening in real time. Italy’s team drew one of the loudest reactions, the snow-white EA7 Emporio Armani uniforms – among the last projects tied to Giorgio Armani, whodied in September aged 91– catching the stadium floodlights. The US followed in Ralph Lauren’s polished winter Americana: flag knits, winter whites, instantly recognisable. Mongolia’s opening-ceremony looks, designed by Goyol Cashmere, were among the most buzzed-about: heavy ceremonial silhouettes rooted in traditional deels, fur-trimmed and historic rather than technical. Haiti’s Stella Jean-designed uniforms drew more curiosity and conversation, the original concept featuring revolutionary leader Toussaint Louverture before Olympic rules barring political symbolism forced a redesign around his galloping horse. It’s the second straight Olympics to be staged in a fashion capital and brands are not shying away from the ridiculously high bar set at the Paris Games two years ago.4Olympic unity collides with real-world politicsThere had been quiet concern all week that the American delegation – or the politicians attached to it – might draw a hostile reception, after reports of US security analysts linked to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operating around the Games collided with broader tensions over Washington’s foreign policy posture. For most of Friday night, those fears looked overblown. The US athletes received a full-throated welcome when the enormous delegation entered San Siro, the kind of roar reserved for medal favorites and host nations. But moments later, a routine cutaway to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance drew an unmistakable wave of boos from large swaths of the crowd. The shot lasted barely three seconds before returning to the athletes below, but it was long enough to change the temperature inside the stadium. Earlier, a smattering of boos met Israel’s four representatives, amid calls in some quarters for Israel to be banned over the Gaza war that followed Hamas’s deadly October 2023 attack.The Olympics sell the promise of unity. The crowd, briefly, sounded unconvinced.5Peaceful protests hit the streetsA few blocks from the choreography, a different kind of gathering was taking shape. In a square near San Siro, a few hundred demonstrators – including public-housing tenants, student activists and campaigners fromIl Comitato Insostenibili Olimpiadi(Unsustainable Olympics Committee) – staged a protest aimed less at the ceremony itself than what it represents. Some carried banners accusing the government of prioritising Olympic spending over affordable housing and public services, alongside an “anti-Olympic torch” parodying the official relay. Others focused on broader geopolitical grievances, with chants critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinians cutting through whistles and flares. The mood felt organised rather than chaotic: more civic rally than flashpoint, with the march proceeding peacefully despite heavy security and street closures around the stadium. The protests are part of a wider drumbeat that has followed the Games into Milan, from environmental demonstrations targeting Olympic sponsors to marches opposing reported US security coordination and the presence of American immigration agents tied to athlete protection. For most fans heading toward the stadium, it was background noise. But it was a reminder of a constant Olympic truth: the ceremony tells one story about a host city. The streets usually tell another.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With a few bends of her reconstructed knees, she snapped through the timing wand, charged through the Abyss (one of Birds of Prey’s steepest pitches) and kept carving her way through the 1.7-mile (2.7km) drop’s icy chop. Altogether, it was a solid run for Johnson, a 13th-place finish on home snow to restart her World Cup scoring streak. And just like that, America’s would-be standard bearer of the slopes was at it again.Skinning, boot-packing and downhill skiing: welcome to skimo at the Winter OlympicsRead moreAttention will be on Johnson again this weekend when she competes in the Olympic women’s downhill at the Milano Cortina Games. Since a 2020-21 breakout of four World Cup downhill podiums that rocketed her to second in the world rankings, the Wyoming-born, Idaho-raised Johnson – who legally changed her birth name, Breanna, to her nickname, Breezy – has been heralded a global threat, next in the succession line of scarily talented American skiers behind Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin.Johnson’s top-14 finishes in her Pyeongchang Olympics debut in 2018, at the ripe age of 22, only seemed to underscore the threat. But like many in her chosen profession, she would fall victim to the unavoidable hazards of her daredevil sport and suffer further for her undimmable aggression. But until recently, it was her body paying the steepest price.View image in fullscreenBreezy Johnson, the 2025 world champion in the downhill, is chasing her first Olympic medal at the Milano Cortina Games.Photograph: François-Xavier Marit/AFP/Getty ImagesThree years into her World Cup career came a broken leg; within nine months, ligaments shredded in both knees, forcing Johnson to withdraw from the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. “As athletes, we’re used to really good control over our bodies,” she said earlier this week in Italy. “We can do extreme athletic events, and then suddenly you can’t even, you know, turn a muscle on and walk.” The injuries were all pretext for her hardest hit yet – not to bone or tendon, but to her reputation.World Cup skiers must file pre-determined locations and 60-minute windows daily for random drug testing. But Johnson left her testers hanging on three separate occasions (once in 2022 and twice in 2023), triggering an automatic World Anti-Doping Agency violation that the US Anti-Doping Agencyupgraded to a 14-month ban. (Prior to that, she had never failed a drug test.) In a May 2024 Instagram post, Johnson apologized for disappointing her fans and called the missed tests “a human error,” added that she was “paying the consequences,” and vowed: “See you at Birds of Prey!”Johnson has long been open about skiing’s psychological toll – self-doubt, perfectionism, fear of failure and the intense therapy addressing it all. She has talked about the inner voice that whispered during her long stretches off the slopes – “maybe you suck” – and the way fear rides the chairlift with her, always poised to pitch her into existential crisis.Recalling her suspension, she told the Washington Post: “You feel like a criminal. It was very lonely.” But instead of letting the time away spiral her, she turned it into self-improvement fuel. Drawing on mental toughness forged through prior injury rehabs, she trained by herself and watched rivals sharpen their numbers from afar. “At the end of the day I want to win a gold medal,” she said in October when asked about the growing field of potential world-beaters. “I want to be the best out of everybody, not just in the US.”As promised, she served that reminder at Birds of Prey, thrilling fans with a solid World Cup reentry. From there, Johnson kept the momentum going: first and third in super-G at the European Cup in Sarntal, Italy, podium bronze at a World Cup tune-up in Kvitfjell, Norway. Then, three months after Beaver Creek, she answered her biggest personal challenge yet at the 2025 world championships in Austria, pairing with longtime friend Shiffrin for the US’s first-ever team alpine victory and topping the women’s downhill podium forher first individual worlds gold. “I was psyched because I knew that I had skied my best,” she said afterward. “I’m just going to enjoy this because I’ve had a lot of moments that weren’t like this.”The results cemented Johnson’s place on Team USA and as Shiffrin’s speed complement. And now withVonn’s recent ACL injuryadjusting American medal hopes (not thather box jump showcasewasn’t impressive), Johnson provides a bit of insurance, too – ironic given her own medical history. With everything to ski for in Cortina, Johnson is charging free again – this time with no headwind in sight. “At this point, I’m like, you know, your next Olympics is definitely not guaranteed,” she said this week. “You never know when the journey will end, and so you have to seize the opportunities that are in front of you.”Explore more on these topicsSkiingUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The championship is likely to be decided by the smallest marginsOliver ConnollyFri 6 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareWhat is the plan for Jaxon Smith-Njigba?The Seattle Seahawks’ run game came alive during the second half of the season and postseason. But it’s still the passing game that makes the offense sing. Almost all of that flows through Smith-Njigba.The wide receiver has played out of his mind this season. He roasts every defensive coverage and has morphed into a three-level threat: beating man-coverage quickly off the snap, showing fearlessness to attack the middle of the field and stretching away from deep coverage. Klint Kubiak, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, has channeled the entire Seattle offense through his star receiver. Smith-Njigba lines upeverywhere: out wide, in the slot, in the backfield. From any of those looks, he’s a matchup nightmare. His dominance has meant that the Seahawks can send fewer receivers out in the route, allowing them to keep extra players in to protect Sam Darnold. Only the Rams sent out all five eligible receivers at a lower rate than Seattle this season.In the NFC championship against the Rams, Seattle’s rushing attack dried up after an explosive opening. But they continued to convert on third-and-longs thanks to Smith-Njigba, either because of his catches or due to the gravity he creates for other targets.Butler did it: 11 years on, was the NFL’s most criticized call actually the right decision?Read moreSolving the Smith-Njigba riddle will be the Patriots’ biggest challenge. They could look to double-team him and force the ball elsewhere, or plant their own star player, cornerback Christian Gonzalez, in a one-on-one matchup and hope for the best.Whose pass protection holds up?The best way to stop an effective passing attack? Relentlessly pressure the quarterback. Darnold has struggled under heat this season. The Seahawks’ passing game ranks sixth in EPA/dropback when there is no pressure and drops to 22nd when there is pressure.New England’s best pass rushers – Milton Williams and Christian Barmore – play inside. Both have been outstanding during the team’s playoff run, and it just so happens they match up nicely with Seattle’s two weakest links. Seahawks right guard Anthony Bradford has struggled all season. On 10% of plays, he looks like a Hall of Famer, blasting open holes in the running game. On the other 90%, he’s a mess. Bradford will torpedo his own linemen in the run game and has conceded the highest pressure rate of any starting lineman in this year’sSuper Bowl. Next to Bradford is center Jalen Sundell, who hasn’t looked the same since returning from a mid-season injury.If the Patriots can craft one-on-one matchups preying on Seattle’s weakness, life will be uncomfortable for Darnold. When Darnold is uncomfortable, he plays erratically. To have a shot against a more talented team, the Patriots need to force turnovers. And the clearest path to that is isolating and attacking Bradford and Sundell.But the Patriots have protection problems of their own. The left side of their line features two rookies: tackle Will Campbell and guard Jared Wilson. Each has looked wobbly in the playoffs. There is no team you want to face less than the Seahawks when you have a compromised line.Seattle’s pass rush is merciless. They have high-end quality and depth. The Seahawks had six different players record at least 35 pressures this year – no other team had more than four players get to that total. They don’t blitz a lot, but when they do, they’ve been the most effective blitzing team in theNFL. For the Pats rookies, there will be no reps off.An offense can work around having one sinkhole along the offensive line. Working around two is tough. And working around two who stand next to each other is almost impossible – you can ask last year’s Chiefs about that. Drake Maye has been extra vulnerable to pressure in the postseason, too, with his pressure-to-sack rate jumping to an eye-watering 48%. The Patriots quarterback also has a bad case of fumble-itis. Sacks (and turnovers) kill drives – and drives will be at a premium on Sunday.Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels will need to find a solution. During the playoffs, the plan has been to keep extra players in the backfield to help out the rookies. But that compromises the menu of plays he can get to in the passing game, and will play into the hands of a Seahawks unit that swamps the field with bodies in coverage.All eyes should be on the matchup between Campbell and DeMarcus Lawrence, who will be the best pass rusher on the field. The Seahawks move him all around the front, but they’re likely to try to get him matched up on Campbell as often as possible. If Campbell can hold up Seattle’s best edge rusher, New England will have a chance to move the ball. If not, Lawrence will wreck the Patriots.View image in fullscreenDrake Maye and Sam Darnold will start in a Super Bowl for the first time in their careers.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPACan the Patriots find explosive plays?The Patriots led the NFL in explosive play rate during the regular season, recording a 10+ yard rush or 15+ yard pass on 15.8% of their plays. In large part, that’s been thanks to the brilliance of Maye. He is a dynamite thrower down the field and an effective scrambler. But he’s facing a unit that refuses to allow chunk yardage. Seattle’s entire defensive doctrine is to force quick, short throws before flying downhill to create carnage. And they do that better than any defense in recent memory.Trying to rip the Seahawks cornerbacks over their heads will be a challenge. The Rams found a path in the NFC championship game by focusing on cornerback Tariq Woolen, a hyperactive player who hunts big plays when there is no play to be made. Expect the Patriots to match up Stefon Diggs, their most reliable target, with Woolen as often as possible. And keep an eye on Kyle Williams, the Patriots’ most electric receiver. He only plays a handful of snaps per game, but is put on the field solely to chase big shots.Failing that, the Patriots will need to force missed tackles. Maye will have to check the ball down to his running backs against the Seahawks’ deep, shell coverage. Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson force a ton of missed tackles. If they can scamper away from Seattle’s defenders, they will have a chance to turn rough drives into scoring ones.The coaching matchupWhat makes this matchup so intriguing is that it features strength on strength all over the field. The Seahawks do their best work running the ball from heavier personnel groupings. That just so happens to be where the Patriots do their best workslowingrushing attacks. The Patriots are an explosive, vertical offense. The Seahawks stifle big plays.The difference between the two teams will be on the margins. Who handles the occasion best? Who makes the right fourth-down decisions? Who makes the correct on-the-fly adjustments when their pass protection is caving in? Who has saved a handful of bespoke, payoff plays for this opponent? Which kicker holds his nerve on field goals?Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel has been here before, as a player. Mike Macdonald, Seattle’s head honcho, has never coached in the Super Bowl. Macdonald is a defensive savant whose unit significantly improves as the game progresses. He figures out what’s working and ditches what isn’t. In fourth quarters this year, the Seahawks defense leads the league in EPA/play, pressure rate and sack rate. Macdonald can decode how an offense is trying to break down his unit and roll out counters of his own.But he’s going up against someone with bags of experience. McDaniels has been on six Super Bowl-winning staffs. His MO is saving something you haven’t seen before for the biggest possible moment. The Seahawks will need to be alert to a wonky formation or trick play as the Patriots look to steal a possession.Then there is Vrabel. His calling card is game management, aggression and his knowledge of the rules. His team is the underdog. What does he have under his vest to keep the matchup close late?In the modern era, Super Bowls have typically come down to one or two plays. The Seahawks have a kicking advantage, but the Patriots have a coach who has mastered the art of navigating one-score games. If the game turns into a slog, the Patriots have an edge. But they will have to find a way to limit the exposure to their offensive line, and that rarely works in championship games.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLSuper Bowl LXNew England PatriotsSeattle SeahawksUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Which raises a question that, until recently, would have sounded almost absurd in figure skating.Is the new USA Dream Team a group of figure skaters?Not only because they could leave Milan with a medal haul worthy of comparison tothe 1984 US boxing teamor the 1996 US women’s track and field squad. But because of something more: the chance this group could push figure skating beyond its traditional audience and into the broader cultural mainstream, much like the US men’s basketball teamdid at the 1992 Summer Olympics.The Milano Cortina Olympic figure skating program opens on Friday with the team event, a competition uniquely designed to test exactly that kind of collective strength. Staged across three days, it brings together the sport’s four disciplines – men’s singles, women’s singles, pairs and ice dance – into a single medal contest. Unlike the 1992 basketball Dream Team, the United States are unlikely to dog-walk the field, meaning success will depend as much on depth and consistency as on individual star power.Ten nations compete in the opening short programs and rhythm dance before five advance to the free skate and free dance finals. The format forces federations into calculated decisions: how much to push medal favorites early in the Games, and how much energy to preserve for individual events still to come next week. Since its debut in 2014, the team event has become one of skating’s most emotionally and strategically complex stages, capable of setting the tone for an entire Olympics. A strong performance can build momentum across a delegation, while a mistake can linger for days.The United States arrive in Milan as defending champions, having been elevated to gold after the messy fallout from the Beijing 2022 competition. The medal ceremony they were denied in China – delayed by the Russian doping investigation – did not take placeuntil the 2024 Summer Games in Paris. Once again, they enter as one of the deepest teams in the field.Boasting the largest roster of figure skaters at these Olympics, the Americans are anchored by a powerhouse trio of reigning world champions –Ilia Malinin,Alysa Liuand ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates – alongside three-time national championAmber Glennand world silver medalist Isabeau Levito.But what makes this group unusual, even by US skating standards, is not just how much they win but how they operate.Aftersecuring her third straight US titlelast month, Glenn’s first celebration came with her arms wrapped around Liu and Levito. The trio has settled on a collective nickname – the “Blade Angels” – reflecting a generation of American women skaters who are as publicly supportive of one another as they are competitive. More than a slogan, the nickname has come to signal something closer to sisterhood: athletes at different stages of their careers who have grown up navigating the same pressure, the same scrutiny and the same narrow expectations of what women’s skating is supposed to look like. Their success is individual, but their survival in the sport has often been shared. Aftera prolonged downturnfor the US women’s program, it is a stark contrast to the rivalry-driven eras that once fueled the sport’s popularity.At the same time, Malinin – the only skater in history to land a quadruple Axel in competition, an achievement that has earned him the nickname “Quad God” – has spoken openly about wanting topush skating into the mainstream sports conversation, not just dominate within it. Chock and Bates, through fashion, media projects andtheir Netflix docuseries, are expanding the sport’s cultural footprint beyond the rink.If Olympic dominance is usually framed through basketball dynasties or relay teams, this American group invites a different kind of comparison. Not because they skate the same way, but because together they embody nearly every version of what modern figure skating has become.The face of the futureThe quadruple Axel is figure skating’s most difficult element because skaters face forward as they launch, requiring them to complete an additional half revolution. The jump has been landed only 10 times in competition, all of them by Malinin, who firstpulled it off at the US Classicwhen he was 17.Malinin does not compete against other skaters so much as he competes against possibility.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin is hotly tipped for Olympic men’s singles gold.Photograph: Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty ImagesAt 21, thereigning world championhas already redrawn the technical limits of men’s skating, building programs around jump combinations once treated as theoretical. His ideal performance – what he calls his “perfect layout” – includes seven quadruple jumps, a level of difficulty no rival currently attempts. He’s also added anewly sanctioned backflipwhile flirting with theonce-fathomable quint.Malinin does not hide the intent behind it. He has described himself as a “gamechanger”, someone trying not just to win competitions but to expand what the sport itself can be.The dynamic is familiar to Olympic gymnastics fans. Like Simone Biles at her peak, Malinin’sonly consistent rival is his perfection itself. When he wins, the conversation is rarely about the podium. It is about whether he has reached the limit of what he believes is possible.Raised in the northern Virginia suburbs by former Olympian parents and immersed in elite skating culture from childhood, he learned early to trust preparation: repetition, muscle memory, instinct once the music begins. Even his Olympic path reflects that arc. In 2022, he arrived as an alternate. Four years later, he arrives as one of the defining athletes of these Games.The Olympic gold medal is the last major prize missing from his résumé. But even that exists inside a larger ambition: not just to win, but to show how far figure skating can still go.The comeback prodigyLiu’s career has already contained more reinvention than most skaters experience in a lifetime.Once defined as a child prodigy – theyoungest US women’s champion in historyat 13 – Liu stepped away from the sport entirely after the 2022 Olympic cycle, burned out by a life that had revolved around skating for as long as she could remember.View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu’s comeback reached new heights with last year’s world championships gold.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesThe 20-year-old from Clovis, California, has never framed that decision as a mistake. She has described both leaving and returning as equally right choices: different decisions that led her to the same place.At the time, she said she felt trapped by the identity of being a figure skater. Stepping away allowed her to discover who she was outside it. She traveled, studied at UCLA, and rediscovered something simpler: joy in movement.Now she approaches skating less like an athlete chasing results and more like an artist building performance. Expectations matter less than expression. The timeline belongs to her.In an era that still fetishizes teenage perfection, Liu represents something newer: an elite athlete willing to step away, reset and return on her own terms, thensomehow become better than ever. Were she to win a medal of any color in Milan, Liu would become the first American woman to reach the Olympic podium since Sasha Cohen won silver in 2006. Before that, it was Sarah Hughes’ gold and Michelle Kwan’s bronze in Salt Lake City in 2002.If Malinin represents the outer limits of what the sport can physically become, Liu represents something just as modern: an athlete who refuses to let the sport define her entirely.The late-career breakthroughGlenn’s path to the Olympics has never followed figure skating’s traditional script.At 26 – an age she jokingly calls “a dinosaur” in women’s skating – she arrives in Milan as a three-time US champion and first-time Olympian. Her longevity is rooted as much in identity as performance.View image in fullscreenAmber Glenn has won the last three US national championships.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesNext week, when she takes the ice for her individual short program to Madonna’s Like a Prayer, the moment will carry meaning beyond the leaderboard. The program – part gospel swell, part pop anthem, part quiet defiance – reflects how she now sees skating: something to be interpreted, not prescribed.For years the native of Plano, Texas, felt she didn’t fit the sport’s traditional mold, describing herself as too rough, too muscular, too different from what women’s skating was supposed to look like. Only when she stopped trying to reshape herself did her results begin to match her potential.That shift extended beyond the ice. Whenshe came out publicly, Glenn understood the risks of being openly LGBTQ in a sport still shaped by aesthetics and perception. She has since framed representation less as symbolism than honesty: existing openly for the next generation watching.Her path has never been linear. As a teenager, she stepped away during a mental health crisis, unsure if she would return. When she did, it was on her own terms, rebuilding both her skating and her relationship with the sport. Freedom changed her skating. In 2021 she landed a triple Axel in competition, becoming the first openly queer woman to do so – a technical milestone and a quiet statement about who gets to take up space in the sport.In an era long defined by teenage prodigies and brief competitive windows, Glenn represents something rarer: an elite career built through persistence, self-definition and time.The veterans chasing historyIf Malinin and Liu represent skating’s future, Chock and Bates represent its center of gravity.Their fourth Olympics together will also be their first as a married couple, capping a partnership that began in 2011 and has since produced world titles, seven US championships and Olympic team gold. The only thing missing is individual Olympic gold – a gap that now reads less like pressure than unfinished narrative.View image in fullscreenMadison Chock and Evan Bates have won a record seven US championships.Photograph: Atsushi Tomura/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesTheir longevity is built on something rarer than technical consistency: stability. Through rule changes, Olympic cycles and evolving judging trends, Chock and Bates have simply adapted.That evolution now extends beyond the ice. Chock designs not only their costumes but those of competitors around the world, shaping the sport’s visual identity alongside its competitive direction. Their programs are built as characters as much as athletic performances.Off the ice, their story has reached wider audiences through documentary storytelling and sponsorship visibility – exposure they have embraced only on their own terms, prioritizing authenticity over manufactured drama.After more than a decade together, they are not chasing reinvention. Nearly unbeatable since finishing fourth in the individual ice competition in Beijing, they are chasing a long-sought Olympic gold in their final chapter of a partnership that has helped define an era of American skating.The quiet technicianFor Levito, figure skating has never been something she discovered. It has always been something she was.The 18-year-old from Mount Holly, New Jersey, first stepped onto the ice at three years old and has spent nearly every year since building a relationship with the sport defined less by reinvention than by continuity. Where some athletes leave and return, Levito has always experienced skating as part of her identity.View image in fullscreenIsabeau Levito won a silver medal at the 2024 world championships in Montreal.Photograph: Elsa/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesThat continuity was tested last season when a foot injury forced her out of key competitions and briefly put her Olympic trajectory in doubt. The recovery reshaped her perspective, deepening her gratitude for competition and sharpening her focus on simply being able to perform at full strength.Her competitive mindset reflects that calmness. Before events, she leans into routine: familiar music, comfort shows, quiet preparation. The less she overthinks, the better she skates.There is confidence there, too – the quiet kind. Even before qualifying, Levito spoke about the Olympics less as a dream than as a destination built through years of steady results and technical reliability, from a world junior title to senior world podium finishes.In Milan, the stage carries personal resonance. With family ties to Italy and programs built around Italian cinematic themes – including a Sophia Loren tribute short and a Cinema Paradiso-inspired free skate – the Olympic setting feels less like a distant goal and more like a natural outcome.If others represent change, Levito represents continuity: the technical and artistic tradition that has long defined American figure skating.Put them all together and the comparison begins to make sense.Malinin pushes the outer edge of what is physically possible in the sport. Liu represents a generation of athletes defining success on their own terms. Glenn shows that longevity and identity can coexist in a discipline that rarely rewards either. Chock and Bates provide the institutional memory of American skating – proof that partnership, trust and evolution can outlast Olympic cycles. Levito carries forward the technical and artistic tradition that has anchored the sport for decades.Individually, each would make the United States a contender. Together, they form something rarer: a roster built not around a single dominant personality, but around complementary strengths.The Olympic team event was designed to reward depth, consistency and federation strength. In Milan, it may reveal something more: what it looks like when a country arrives with athletes whose stories map both the sport’s past and its future.For casual viewers tuning in once every four years, the appeal is simple: this is a group capable of winning. Inside the sport, the significance runs deeper. This team reflects the modern reality of figure skating – technical escalation, artistic evolution, cultural change and athlete autonomy existing all at once.Starting Friday, they step onto Olympic ice not just as individual medal contenders, but as something closer to a collective statement. If Olympic history is written in dynasties, the United States may be building one not around a single star, but around an idea of what the sport can become.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Figure skatingAlysa LiuAmber GlennIlia MalininWinter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Milan simultaneously delivered a three-hour love letter to Italy, and a plea for hope and harmony in a fractious world.But not everyone in the 60,000 crowd at San Siro was listening. As the United States team, led by the speedskater Erin Jackson, made its way across the stadium it was loudly applauded. But then the TV cameras panned to the US vice-president,JD Vance, and his wife, Usha, and the cheers turned to loud boos.Few here would have been surprised. All week Milan has echoed to the sound of loud whistles and rancour, ever since it heard that US immigration and customs enforcement officials (ICE) would be accompanying Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Winter Olympics Team GB skier targets ICE with graphic message written in snowRead moreHours before the opening ceremony, a thousand protesters also held anti-Ice banners, set off flares and chanted: “Fuck Ice, let’s take back the city.” Of course, some of them were going to stick it to the man when the world was watching.And it was perhaps Vance that the International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, had in mind when she gently promised that these Olympics would see “the best of humanity shine before the world”.“This is why we all love the Games,” she told the athletes. “Because through you, we see the very best of ourselves. You’ll show us that strength isn’t just about winning – it’s about courage, empathy, and heart.“You remind us that we can be brave. That we can be kind. When we see rivals embrace at the finish line, we are reminded that we can choose respect.“When we see grace, courage, and friendship – we remember the kind of people we all want to be. The spirit of the Olympic Games is about so much more than sport. It is about us – and what makes us human.”View image in fullscreenItalian flag bearers Arianna Fontana and Federico Pellegrino lead out their team.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a powerful message during a ceremony that was otherwise determined to party. The music was spectacular and the athletes and crowd revelled in every moment.In the buildup, the creative director, Marco Balich, had promised that his team of artists and performers had devoted 700 hours of rehearsals to ensure everything would be perfect. They delivered – and then some.The show began with 70 dancers from Accademia del Teatro alla Scala, twirling and spinning in perfect time, across a background of classical statues. Soon there were also nods to Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, food and fashion, literature and design.There were also genuflections to Verdi, Puccini, Rossini and Armani. There were supermodels in red, green and white, the colours of the Italian flag, walking down a catwalk before the Italian national anthem was played. There was even a surreal section devoted to hand gestures – although none of the ones that are usually seen in Milan rush hour.Unsurprisingly for such a lavish ceremony, 70 hairdressers and 110 makeup artists were involved on the night. Not all of them were for the personal use of Mariah Carey, who had the crowd eating out of her hand early in the evening by singing Volare (“Nel Blu, dipinto di Blu”) in Italian.View image in fullscreenMariah Carey charmed the Milan crowd.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesLater, the crowd were out of their seats again for Andrea Bocelli, who sang a neck-tingling version of Nessum Dorma, the Chinese pianist Lang Lang, a Brazilian athlete who did a backflip in the snow and the Ukrainian and Italian teams, who were given storming reactions when they were introduced.But the ceremony carried a deeper message too: that sport, in its own small and insignificant way, can sometimes unite a divided world. The theme of the night was armonia – or harmony in English – whose original meaning means bringing together what is different.Intimate and enormous: Milano Cortina opening ceremony tries something differentRead moreMeanwhile, Coventry, who took over as IOC president last year, also drew on her background growing up in Zimbabwe to stress how much the world was interconnected.“In Africa, where I’m from, we have a word: ubuntu,” she said. “It means: I am because we are. That we rise by lifting others. That our strength comes from caring for each other. No matter where you come from, we all know this spirit – it lives and breathes in every community.“I see this spirit most clearly at the Olympic Games. Here, athletes from every corner of the world compete fiercely – but they also respect, support and inspire one another. They remind us that we are all connected, that our strength comes from how we treat each other, and that the best of humanity is found in courage, compassion and kindness.”That was a message stressed by members of the US team too. Before the ceremony, the freestyle skier Hunter Hess admitted he had mixed emotions when asked what it meant to wear Team USA gear and the American flag.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry said: ‘We rise by lifting others. That our strength comes from caring for each other.’Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of,” he replied. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”At the end of the night, the president of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, officially declared the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 open to giant cheers. All told, it was a triumph. Even if this ceremony will be remembered for one particularly visceral reaction earlier in the night.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJD VancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, I am a child.”Kenworthy’s comments are particularly notable given that ICE agents are here in Milan as part of the security detail for the US vice president JD Vance, who was attending the opening ceremony. Protesters in Milan carried banners reading “ICE out”, “Fuck ICE”.However, Kenworthy will not be punished for violating Rule 50.2 of the Olympic Charter which states “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas,” as he made the post on social media.An International Olympic Committee media spokesperson confirmed: “During the Olympic Games, all participants have the opportunity to express their views as per theAthlete Expression Guidelines. The IOC does not regulate personal social media posts.”1:58Why are ICE agents going to the Winter Olympics in Italy? – video explainerKenworthy, who was born in Chelmsford but moved to Colorado when his family emigrated while he was two years old, competed for Team US in 2014 and 2018. He then switched his allegiance to Team GB for the last Winter Games in Beijing, finishing eighth, but still lives in the US.It is not the first time that Kenworthy has spoken out. Before the 2022 Games, he was openly critical of the decision to host the Games in China, citing the country’s human rights record and treatment of the LGBTQ+ community.Team GB did not comment directly on the post. However, it is understood that they are not concerned as they believe it is a personal opinion on a subject outside of the Olympic Games, and Kenworthy doesn’t invoke Team GB in any way, shape or form.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

The delays came after Slovenia’s Ilka Stuhec crashed early, forcing course regrooming, before fog again rolled in after the fourth starter, Austria’s Nina Ortlieb. Norway’s Marte Monsen, who also crashed in Crans-Montana last week, did not start.Quad God and the Blade Angels: is the new USA Dream Team a group of figure skaters?Read moreVonn kept warm in her ski jacket alongside teammates while waiting for the restart, passing time with stretches,social media postsand even brief impromptu dance breaks to Usher as officials waited for visibility to improve.When she finally pushed out of the start gate, the run itself lasted little more than 100 seconds but answered the question hanging over her Olympic participation.Vonn skied with visible intent from the top, briefly getting tight to her line midway down and only narrowly clearing one gate. She was among the fastest through the final checkpoints, reaching a maximum speed of 75.2mph (121km/h), before standing up out of her tuck approaching the finish. At the bottom of the piste, she exchanged fist pumps and a hug with US teammate Breezy Johnson, who started just ahead of her as the session resumed after more than an hour’s delay due to fog.The session carried added weight afterThursday’s scheduled opening training was canceledbecause of heavy snowfall, leaving Friday as the penultimate on-course test before the race. Skiers are required to complete one training run in order to compete in the final.Vonn’s Olympic preparationwas dealt a catastrophic blow last weekwhen she crashed during the final World Cup downhill before the Games in Crans-Montana. She was airlifted to hospital after losing control on a landing in deteriorating conditions during a chaotic morning that saw multiple crashes before organizers abandoned the race.Scans later confirmed a complete ACL rupture in her left knee, along with a bone bruise and meniscal damage of uncertain origin. Since the injury, she has framed participation as a day-to-day decision based on swelling, muscle response and knee stability inside a heavy brace she has worn throughout training.“Last Friday in Crans Montana in the last World Cup I completely ruptured my ACL,” Vonnsaid Tuesday. “I have to take it day by day. My goal is obviously right now the downhill. I have to see how it feels – if it’s stable and I feel confident, I’ll continue to race. But I can’t tell you that answer until I actually ski 85 miles an hour.”Friday’s run represented the closest thing yet to that test.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn prepares for her training run on Friday.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesVonn has maintained that her overall conditioning remains elite even as she manages structural damage in the knee.“My fitness is 100%, but that doesn’t mean my body is 100%,” she said Tuesday. “As long as my swelling is down and my muscles are firing, my strength is what it was a few days ago.”She has also leaned into the emotional weight of the moment, posting on social media before Friday’s training: “Nothing makes me happier. No one would have believed I would be here. But I made it. I’m here, I’m smiling and no matter what, I know how lucky I am.

Might that decision ultimately cost the club their Premier League status? It will be interesting to see whether Farke recalls the recently dropped former Lyon goalkeeper, Lucas Perri, or keeps faith with Karl Darlow against Nottingham Forest at Elland Road on Friday night. Darlow, formerly second choice at Newcastle, struggled with crosses whenArsenal won 4-0 in West Yorkshire last Saturdayand may approach a quintessential relegation six-pointer against Forest with dented confidence. What aboutIllan Meslier? Previously a star under Marcelo Bielsa, a keeper once hyped as France’s future No 1 has been demoted to third choice and has been discussing a potential move to Besiktas before Friday’s transfer deadline in Turkey. Talks only began after Leeds rejected a bid for Perri from Besiktas last week. Time will tell if that was that the right decision.Louise TaylorLeeds vNottingham Forest, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)View image in fullscreenKarl Darlow endured a torrid time from crosses in defeat by Arsenal.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters2United revival offers stern test for SpursManchester United are unbeaten in three games under Michael Carrick and Tottenham are unbeaten in four under Thomas Frank. While Carrick has overseen three victories, Spurs have two Premier League draws alongside Champions League wins. After Sunday’slast-gasp 3-2 win against Fulhamat Old Trafford, Carrick was asked if his Midas touch could continue for his remaining 14 Premier League matches. In the interim manager’s calm way he smiled and said, in essence, there are no guarantees. But factor in a reinvigorated and re-engaged home crowd and even a draw for Spurs looks like a tough ask.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pmTransfer window verdict: how every Premier League club faredRead more3Arsenal will need home fans againThe euphoria afterArsenal’s victory over Chelseathat booked their place at Wembley in next month’s Carabao Cup final showed how desperate their supporters are for success, and Mikel Arteta felt they deserved praise for sticking with his side during a nervous second half at the Emirates. “They brought so much energy and belief to the team in different moments,” he said. “It wasn’t easy because it was a late kick-off, windy, rainy, cold and they responded. The energy was very good from the beginning. I sensed it was different and they are on board.” Arsenal’s players will need the fans again when they face Sunderland on Saturday having experienced the power of a passionate home crowd inNovember’s 2-2 draw at the Stadium of Light. Régis Le Bris’s side are the only Premier League team still unbeaten at home this season and remain a threat, even if they have won only twice on the road.Ed AaronsArsenal vSunderland, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenArsenal fans get behind their side during the League Cup victory over Chelsea on Tuesday.Photograph: John Walton/PA4Villa seek attacking boost at VitalityGiven they sit just a point behind Manchester City, Aston Villa cannot be considered out of the title race. But having lost two of their last three league games,at home to Evertonand10-man Brentford, they are now looking down not up, with the clubs below them – Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool – all improving. When out of form and under pressure, there are many fixtures preferable to Bournemouth away: Andoni Iraola’s men are, er, “in a good moment” and will ask searching physical questions of players who have appeared tired in recent weeks. Of the sides in the top seven, Villa have scored the fewest goals, so it was no surprise they used the transfer window to bring in two attackers. With the hamstrung Ollie Watkins only a maybe for Saturday’s game, they’ll be hoping Tammy Abraham and the returning loanee Leon Bailey can quickly integrate into Unai Emery’s system, sparking the required attacking improvement.Daniel HarrisBournemouth vAston Villa, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenTammy Abraham attempts a shot against Brentford.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images5Hammers eye fresh blow for BurnleyIf you had told Scott Parker that, come the start of February, Burnley would still be involved in the relegation battle, he would probably have accepted that. The problem, though, is that his side are as good as down and their participation in the struggle is because of their upcoming opponents: West Ham on Saturday, then Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. At the start of the year, West Ham also looked doomed, but then they appointed Paco Jémez as first-team coach and the improvement was instant, impressivewins over Spursand Sunderlandfollowed bystoppage-time heartbreak at Chelsea. Jémez made his name turning Rayo Vallecano into an attacking force but, at West Ham, his principal influence has been defensive, coaxing improved performances from individuals and the back-four unit as a whole. If they can sustain that progress, given their forwards – Jarrod Bowen, Taty Castellanos and Crysencio Summerville – are in decent form, they will expect to take three points from a match they must surely win in order to stay up.Daniel HarrisBurnley v West Ham, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen (centre) is among the West Ham attackers who may have found form at the right time in the fight against the drop.Photograph: Mark Greenwood/IPS/Shutterstock6Wilson’s admirers brace for close lookHarry Wilson is one of the most improved players in the top flight this season. He has always been useful for Fulham, but has been a squad player for much of his time at Craven Cottage. The Wales winger often made an impact from the bench, chipping in with important goals. Now, though, Wilson is in the running to make the team of the season. He has eight goals in all competitions for Fulham and has scored in each of his past four home games.Evertonwill be keeping a close eye on Wilson, having tried to sign him during the winter transfer window. Wilson, out of contract at the end of the season, will be hoping to impress against one of his many admirers.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Everton, Saturday 3pm7Rosenior deserves better than derisionLiam Rosenior is the youngest of seven British managers in the Premier League – and yet despite establishing a fine reputation as a coach, there is an apparent thirst to dismiss his credentials at every opportunity. He has seen the online comparisons to Will from the Inbetweeners and David Brent. His tactics were widely denounced after Chelseawere knocked out of the Carabao Cupat Arsenal on Tuesday. Some, presumably, will have even taken delight in the 41-year-old’s clunky touch at the Emirates Stadium going viral. It is not the first time an English coach has been derided and is unlikely to be the last. This week Rosenior was asked about facing another British coach in Wolves’s Rob Edwards, flying in the face of that age-old question about homegrown managers getting opportunities. But when they get them, why is there a desperation to drag them down?Ben FisherWolves vChelsea, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenWhy do British coaches like Liam Rosenior seem to attract derision online?Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images8Howe needs forward pair to flourishGiven that a fatigued Newcastle have won only one of their past seven games in all competitions and are fresh fromCarabao Cup semi-final defeatby Manchester City, they could do with undoing Brentford. Not that it will necessarily be easy for Eddie Howe’s team. Memories of their3-1 loss to Keith Andrews’s sidein west London in November remain fresh on Tyneside, where home supporters can only hope that Yoane Wissa decides to remind his former club precisely what they have lost. The home fans are likely to relish jeering Jordan Henderson but the former Sunderland midfielder could yet enjoy himself in a department where Newcastle will again be without Joelinton, and possibly Bruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley too. Much may hinge on Sandro Tonali’s central midfield performance, while the hitherto underachieving winger Anthony Elanga will hope to build on a promising cameo against City. With tricky trips to Tottenham, Aston Villa, Qarabag and City, again, coming up, Howe needs that pair to be at their best.LTNewcastle vBrentford, Saturday 5.30pm9Hürzeler to take on his mentor GlasnerSunday’s meeting of Brighton (one win in nine league games) and Crystal Palace (no wins in nine) doesn’t promise to be a thriller but the “M23 derby” rarely is.An awful 0-0 draw in Novemberhinted at both teams’ deficiencies but Fabian Hürzeler will be eager to notch his first win in four attempts against their bitter rivals, after Oliver Glasner did the double over them last season – the first for Palace since 1932-33. Brighton’s last derby win was a4-1 thrashing at the Amex in February 2024that brought an end to Roy Hodgson’s second spell at Palace andushered in the Glasner eraat Selhurst Park. Hürzeler has described his Austrian counterpart as a mentor and still regularly speaks to Glasner on the phone. Beating him and Palace in their final showdown in this fixture could begin to persuade some doubting Brighton fans he is the right man for the job.EABrighton vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pm10Wirtz coming into best form for SlotRecent evidence suggests Liverpool should be a different proposition on Sunday to the team Manchester City encountered at the Etihad in November and Florian Wirtz most certainly will be. The potential £116m signing was still without a Premier League goal or assist when the sides last met and ineffectual duringLiverpool’s 3-0 defeat. He was not alone in that regard. Wirtz’s influence and impact is rising, however, and an improved understanding between the Germany international and Hugo Ekitiké has contributed to Arne Slot’s side scoring 10 goals in their last two home games. “I think he did not improve that much on the ball because from the start he was special,” the Liverpool head coach said. “But off the ball I see the biggest improvement. The Premier League is about both.” Had last summer worked out differently, Wirtz could have been lining up for City against a Liverpool defence containing Marc Guéhi. The champions need their playmaker to remind Pep Guardiola of what might have been.Andy HunterLiverpool vManchester City, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2429532Man City2426473Aston Villa249464Man Utd248415Chelsea2415406Liverpool246397Brentford244368Sunderland241369Fulham24-13410Everton24-13411Newcastle2403312AFC Bournemouth24-33313Brighton2423114Tottenham Hotspur2422915Crystal Palace24-42916Leeds24-112617Nottm Forest24-112618West Ham24-192019Burnley24-221520Wolverhampton24-308Explore more on these topicsFootballTen things to look out for this weekendPremier LeagueArsenalBournemouthTottenham HotspurWest Ham UnitedManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You never know what to expect with the score. There was even a little delay because they said it in Italian, we were looking for the score, and once we saw it, we were thrilled. To break 90 is always a great feat, and to do it to open the Games is even better.”Introduced at the 2014 Sochi Games, the team event brings together results across men’s singles, women’s singles, pairs and ice dance, with countries awarded points based on finishing position rather than raw score. The format also creates one of the few team environments in figure skating, with skaters watching and cheering from national team boxes between performances.The US maintained their position across the remaining Friday segments as pairs team Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea finished fifth in their short programme, whileAlysa Liuclosed strongly in the women’s short program, scoring 74.90 to finish second behind Japan’s three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto (78.88).After three of the four short programs in the team event, the US topped the table with 25 points, followed by Japan with 23 and Italy with 22. Only the top five teams after the short programs advance to the free skate phase.The Americans arrived in Milan as defending championsafter being elevated to goldfollowing the fallout from the Beijing 2022 team event and were widely expected to battle Japan for the title. Chock and Bates’ opening result strengthened that position, particularly after Japan placed eighth in the rhythm dance earlier in the session.Winter Olympics 2026: Anti-ICE protests before opening ceremony, Vonn completes training run – liveRead moreFor Chock and Bates, however, the focus remains on their own performances.“We’re not focused on that,” Chock said of the wider standings. “We’re just doing what we do.”The opening session of the Milano Cortina figure skating program also drew a high-profile political audience. US vice-president JD Vance, who is in Italy to lead the official US delegation at Friday night’s opening ceremonyattended the US women’s ice hockey team’s opening gameon Thursday afternoon, watched the rhythm dance with his wife and three children ahead of an afternoon meeting at the Prefettura di Milano with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. He was joined by US secretary of state Marco Rubio.

But do those lengths extend to ski jumpers injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid in order to fly further?That is the question theWorld Anti-Doping Agency will investigatesince such startling allegations emerged first in the German newspaper Bild in what has now been dubbed “Penisgate”.Bild has claimed that athletes have injected the acid into their penises to game the system when they are measured for their suits, which is tightly regulated to prevent any athlete having an aerodynamic advantage.While the result of that investigation is pending, other questions remain: why would a ski jumper want to tamper with their penis, is it safe, and what does it have to do with aerodynamics?What does injecting hyaluronic acid do to the penis?Hyaluronic acid is a common filler used in cosmetic surgery, including injections being used forpenile girth enlargement surgery, Prof Eric Chung, a urological surgeon, says.Injecting a penis with hyaluronic acid would make it bigger girth-wise, “but you would need to inject a lot of hyaluronic acid,” says Chung, who was previously the leader of the andrology specialty advisory group for the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand.Hyaluronic acid is temporary in effect and needs a top-up every six to 12 months depending on absorption and migration of the particles, Chung says.How does penis size affect ski jumping?Before the start of the season, ski jumpers have to have their suits made up based on the measurements of their body length, including crotch height determined by an FIS-approved 3D body scanner in the presence of a doctor, stripped down to their underwear and with particular stipulations around posture.The dimensions of that suit is strictly regulated because the total size of the suit can have a “significant effect” on the amount of lift that you can generate, which allows them to jump further, saysAssociate Prof Dan Dwyer, from Deakin University’s School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences.Enlarging the penis with hyaluronic acid could provide a benefit when the athlete is subject to this standardised body measurement process, as the dimensions recorded of their body would be larger than they might have been otherwise, which then allows them to be permitted to have a slightly larger ski suit made, Dwyer says. “And that slightly larger ski suit has a larger surface area which can then generate a small amount of extra lift.”Sandro Pertile, the men’s race director for the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS),says“every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further. Of course, this is a competitive sport and everyone’s on the limit with the rules because everyone wants to win.”What are the risks?Chung warns injecting a penis with hylauronic acid carries significant risks both in the short and long term.“Poorly injected technique or incorrect dose would cause penile pain, poor cosmesis [disfigurement], deformity, infection, inflammation, sensory change, and sexual dysfunction. In rare instances, infection can spread to cause gangrene (tissue necrosis) and loss of the penis.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Olympic GamesWinter OlympicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

San Francisco 49ers great Roger Craig was the lone seniors candidate elected from the pool of five that featured Belichick.‘Insane’: LeBron and Mahomes lead backlash after Belichick’s reported Hall of Fame snubRead more“The fact that this will be memorialized forever, what an elite club that we’re part of, what a respect and a reverence that we have for this game,” Brees said. “And the opportunity to play this game, it was an absolute privilege.”But Belichick’s omission, along with the franchise owner who hired him to spark a dynasty lasting parts of two decades, Robert Kraft, remain a talking point. Last week, as reports of Belichick’s omission circulated, figures such as LeBron James and Patrick Mahomesexpressed shock and disappointment.Former Patriots defensive back Devin McCourty said he would be surprised if the Hall escapes scrutiny when the new members are enshrined this summer.“I think the travesty of all of this is this summer, there’s gonna be a Hall of Fame induction and there’s gonna be guys who are deserving of being in the Hall of Fame. And we can probably all bet that the top topic is gonna be Bill Belichick not being there,” McCourty said this week. “And I think that’s unfortunate because there are going to be players, coaches, contributors that are Hall of Fame-worthy, but because this feels like a huge mistake, the only talk is going to be about the guys that didn’t get into the Hall of Fame.”Former Dallas Cowboys coach and Hall of Famer Jimmy Johnson skipped the announcement ceremony on Thursday because he was “pissed” about Belichick’s omission.“He is the greatest of all time. Yes, he had a great QB, but we all did,” Johnson said.The Hall of Fame said it understood and accepted the uproar over this year’s selection process, but did not name Belichick directly.“It’s that very passion that propels the game. The Hall also respects the members of the Committee when they follow the selection process bylaws. It is an honor to serve as a selector,” the Hall of Fame said in a release. “... The selection of a new class is the most important duty the Hall of Fame oversees each year, and the integrity of that process cannot be in question.”A Super Bowl winning quarterback under Sean Payton with the Saints, Brees (2001-05 San Diego Chargers, 2006-2020 Saints) and Fitzgerald (2004-2020, Cardinals) earned Gold Jackets in their first year on the ballot.Brees ranks second in NFL historywith 80,358 passing yards and 571 passing touchdowns and was a 13-time Pro Bowl selection in addition to Super Bowl XLIV MVP. Brees is the only member of the Saints to enter the Hall of Fame on the first ballot.Fitzgerald was drafted third overall in 2004 and played 17 seasons for the Cardinals. He had 1,432 career receptions for 17,492 yards andranks second in NFL historyin both categories. He is sixth on the all-time receiving touchdowns list with 121.“I never set out saying, ‘I’m going to be a Hall of Fame player,’” Fitzgerald said. “It’s not something you can ever imagine. It’s a surreal feeling.”Kuechly, a finalist in 2025, was in his second year on the Hall of Fame ballot. He played only eight NFL seasons (2012-19 Panthers) and retireddue to chronic head injuriesafter posting 1,092 tackles, 18 interceptions, 66 passes defensed, 12.5 sacks and 31 quarterback hits. He was named to NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2010s.The versatile Craig, now 65, was elected on the back of winning three Super Bowls with the 49ers with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice in featured roles. He was the first running back with 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season, accomplishing the feat in 1985. He scored three touchdowns in San Francisco’s Super Bowl XIX victory over the Miami Dolphins.In Vinatieri’s second year of eligibility, the 24-yearNFLkicker (1996-2005 New England Patriots, 2006-2019 Indianapolis Colts) got the call. He holds numerous kicking records, including the marks for career points (2,673), consecutive field goals made (44), career field goals (599) and most seasons with 100-plus points (21).His 48-yard field goal in the Super Bowl win over the Rams in February 2002, largely remembered for the performance of 24-year-old Tom Brady and Belichick’s mix of young and old talent, all but kickstarted the Patriots’ dynasty.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsNew Orleans SaintsArizona CardinalsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But on a rainswept evening in West Yorkshire, the collective response from everyone associated withLeeds Unitedfor each of their goals left you in no doubt that this had the whiff of a season-defining night.With Leeds andNottingham Forestsitting an advantageous but not decisive six points above the relegation zone before kick-off, and 18th-placed West Ham away at Burnley on Saturday, it felt like both these famous old clubs knew victory could dramatically shape the remaining three months of the campaign.Leeds v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreFor 20 minutes or so, it was unpredictable, end to end and pretty breathless viewing. But a four-minute period which encapsulated Forest’s season to date was decisive as they spectacularly fell apart and conceded twice midway through the first half before Dominic Calvert-Lewin settled this quintessential relegation six-pointer shortly after half-time.The consequences of this result will fully be known only by the time the weekend is out. If West Ham do slip up, this could well be the night that goes a long way towards securingPremier Leaguesurvival for Leeds. If they continue this sort of form at Elland Road – 22 of their 29 points have come at home – they will probably be fine no matter what.This venue somehow becomes even more intimidating under the lights, too. In Leeds’ past 22 league games at this venue that kicked off in the evening, they have won 19 and not lost a single one. “I’m very proud,” Daniel Farke, the manager, said. “Sometimes it feels like there’s a game where it’s just a bit more important than the others. This will do a lot for our confidence and belief. It’s a massive win.”It will be Sean Dyche and Forest who watch on nervously on Saturday . For all the good work they have done of late with eight points from their past four games, a West Ham victory at Turf Moor makes things fascinating once again. Not that Leeds, their supporters and Farke, who deserves immense credit for this mid-season turnaround, will care right now.View image in fullscreenJayden Bogle leaps in delight to celebrate his goal that opened the scoring for Leeds United against Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe game began at a frenetic pace despite horrendous conditions. Both sides clearly knew the importance of victory, both enjoying spells on the front foot inside the opening quarter. The first real chance came the way of Forest though, as Nicolás Domínguez forced a wonderful save from Karl Darlow after a counterattack before the visitors were stung at the other end.With the pitch heavy, the players covered in mud and Elland Road rocking under the lights, the game had a distinct early Premier League years feel. So perhaps it was fitting that the opening goal came from a simple, old-fashioned long ball over the top by Ilia Gruev, who picked the run of Jayden Bogle to perfection to allow the wingback to slot past Stefan Ortega for his first Premier League goal for Leeds.Four minutes later, Leeds doubled their advantage in far more intricate fashion. Some magnificent buildup play led to the tireless Brenden Aaronson threading through James Justin and, while his shot was saved by Ortega, he had the presence of mind to square the rebound for Noah Okafor, who tapped into an empty net for his first goal since October. Having more than held their own for almost half an hour, Forest were two goals behind in the blink of an eye. Dyche was furiously trying to instil some life back into his players from the touchline, shell-shocked by Leeds’ double.“They’re wise enough to know the basics and they didn’t do that,” Dyche said before offering a steadfast position on Forest’s prospects. “When we got here we were two points inside the relegation zone and now we’re six points out of it. My messages will stay the same.”Forest had to start well after the break but they did the opposite. More Leeds pressure led to the third goal, four minutes after the restart, as a curling cross from Gruev was chested out of Ortega’s path and into the net by Calvert-Lewin for his 10th top-flight goal of the season.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s new signing, Lorenzo Lucca, heads home to score on his debut and pull one back against Leeds.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThat is his best goalscoring return since 2020-21 when he was an England international. No Englishman has more goals in the Premier League this season – and Elland Road, clearly enjoying themselves by this point, serenaded their No 9 with chants about an international recall.Dyche rang the changes as the hour mark approached. Whether that was simply to stem the flow of Leeds’ attacking chances or try to haul his side back into contention, it did not have the desired effect.It was, in truth, a meek showing from Forest aside from that encouraging opening quarter. They at least grabbed some consolation when new signing Lorenzo Lucca scored his first Premier League goal by heading in an Omari Hutchinson cross but by then the damage had been done.Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedNottingham ForestPremier Leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 41-year-old has quickly become a figure of fun since his appointment as Chelsea’s head coach and was ridiculed after miscontrolling a dropping ball during his side’s defeat at Arsenal on Tuesday.It was the latest example of Rosenior facing online mockery because of his quotes and mannerisms. He has been referred to as “LinkedIn Liam” because of some of his comments in press conferences and compared to David Brent. One meme had him mocked up as Will McKenzie, the nerdy lead character from The Inbetweeners.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreRosenior is aware of the jokes at his expense but has made clear he does not take himself too seriously. He is not on social media so may not have seen another Premier League club poking fun at his clumsy attempt to trap a ball during Chelsea’sCarabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Asked whether he had been working on his touch before Saturday’s trip to Wolves, though, Rosenior was self-deprecating enough to reveal he has come in for stick from Chelsea’s 18-year-old Brazilian winger, Estêvão Willian.“The lads have played it back to me on the video and we’ve had a laugh about it,” he said. “Estêvão said he can’t believe that I was a professional footballer. This is a great job – I love this job. I am serious in many aspects and demanding in many aspects. Life is too short. You have to enjoy life. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. At the moment, a lot of people in this country have been laughing at me.”Rosenior, who has six wins from his first eight games, has placed a big emphasis on creating the right culture at Chelsea. His players are holding pre-match huddles in the centre circle. The influence of Willie Isa, Chelsea’s player support and development officer, is felt.“That’s a group thing,” Rosenior said. “Willie is a top guy. He comes from New Zealand, where the culture of togetherness and spirit is crucial. He’s spoken with the leadership group about different things we do. There are many, many things that aren’t seen, and that’s one of the many things that has been seen. For me, everything is psychological, everything starts with the mind. If your mind is in a good place, the rest takes care of itself.”Rosenior defended Alejandro Garnacho, who was taken off at half-time during last week’s3-2 win over West Ham. He denied that Garnacho, who has one league goal sincejoining from Manchester Unitedlast summer, lacks the confidence to take on full-backs. He said that “ceiling is limitless in life” when asked how far the winger could go in his career.Explore more on these topicsChelseaPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

That ship has sailed. Instead it is of how far Arne Slot’s side have truly progressed since their title defence was holed.Slot feels Liverpool’s displays have warranted defeat only occasionally this season – late lapses, set-piece failures and wasted chances have been more common explanations than the overall performance – and the3-0 reverse at the Etihad Stadiumin November was certainly one of them. The controversy over Virgil van Dijk’s disallowed header at 1-0 still lingers for the Dutchman but does not prevent him holding his hands up.Arne Slot admits things will be ‘more difficult’ if Liverpool sustain any further injuriesRead more“In the first half we were outplayed for large parts,” he reiterated this week. “We have shown we are able to compete with any team except for large parts of the first half against City. But it also helped [them] that the goal was disallowed for the wrong reasons in my opinion and they got a penalty. But they were the better team. We want to show a different side of us [on Sunday].”That defeat, in the 1,000th match of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career, was Liverpool’s seventh in the sequence of nine losses in 12 games that derailed their league campaign and undermined support for Slot. As the response to the subsequent 13-game unbeaten run anddefeat at Bournemouthshowed – misgivings accompanying almost every performance before erupting after another set-piece calamity on the south coast – neither team nor coach has fully recovered. Belatedly, however, there are at least signs of a recovery being under way.Liverpool have heeded Slot’s call for improvement in both boxes in their past two outings; the6-0 rout of Qarabagthat secured a place in the last-16 of the Champions League and the ultimately convincing4-1 comeback against Newcastlelast weekend.The team’s pressing game and work rate were superior, there were fewer chances conceded, and the form of summer signings Hugo Ekitiké, Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez continued an upwards trajectory. Repeating the levels in thePremier Leaguethree days after a Champions League fixture, having been unable to build on victory over Real Madrid against City in November, brought further encouragement for Slot. Hence why he considers the return meeting with City an accurate gauge of Liverpool’s recent development.“In that game [against City] it was obvious where we struggled,” said Slot, who saw Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah miss clearcut chances in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. “I prefer to keep that to myself because, as you know, I always prefer to protect my players. They had the ball much more than we wanted them to, we struggled to bring the ball out from the back, they didn’t even create that many chances, but it was 2-0 at half-time and they had a penalty that they missed.“We couldn’t press them and I was very curious to see that. In that time I was not happy with how much intensity we had in our pressing as a team. For me that is the biggest difference between this season and last season. Last season our pressing was much better than it was at the start of this season, but I do see a good development in that.View image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitiké are leading Liverpool’s recovery in the second half of the season.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images“And I see our players are able to run more, press more and press better, and combine that with offensive quality. That is why it will be interesting to see, against probably the best or one of the best teams in ball possession, if we have that progression in our work rate off the ball.”Slot highlighted Wirtz’s work off the ball as the biggest factor in his improvement. After a difficult start to his Premier League career, the 22-year-old Germany international is beginning to exert the influence thatLiverpooland City envisaged when the two clubs moved for him last summer. Wirtz and Ekitiké shared the pitch for 56 minutes in that City defeat but Sunday might be the first time Guardiola’s team have experienced the devastating understanding between the pair.Liverpool have left themselves little margin for error in the race for a top-four finish and need to rebuild momentum, form and confidence in a campaign that could yet be decorated by glory in the Champions League and FA Cup. Their 200th meeting in all competitions with City, who have won only once at Anfield under Guardiola and that behind closed doors, could have implications for the remainder of the season, even though it lacks the title consequences of previous episodes.“I think we are a better team [than City] and we improved quite a lot from that [3-0] game,” Alexis Mac Allister confidently declared this week. “But now we need to show it.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolManchester CityPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Under the nondescript heading “Premier League statement”, football’s richest and most popular domestic competition announced unprecedented disciplinary charges against Manchester City, champions of the two previous seasons (and the two to come). We are still waiting for the outcome.The estimated134 charges covered years of alleged wrongdoingbut broke down into a couple of key chunks: accusations that City had failed to provide “accurate financial information” to the league and to properly “cooperate … and assist” with the subsequent investigation. Precious little new information has followed.Premier League charges Manchester City over alleged financial rule breachesRead moreThe league has steadfastly refused to comment. City have gone no further than a statement that “welcomed” the appointment of an independent panel to consider the charges, and nodded towards “the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of [City’s] position”. The public and the football industry find themselves in the dark.The reasons for silence are obvious: until a verdict is known, neither party wants to be seen to be prejudicing an outcome or putting pressure on the three-person disciplinary panelled by Murray Rosen KC. But the absence of an update, or even guidance on how long the process may take, has meant a flood of speculation filling the void.Accusations of a cover-up or a stitch-up are common, as are claims that the process may have been botched by thePremier Leagueor obstructed by City. Speculation on when a verdict may come ranges from “imminently” to “years away”.The hearings at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London, where Rosen’s panel sat in front of two large teams of lawyers, finished in December 2024. The hearings began a year after the charges, which followed a four-year investigation into City by the league, were made.Why has a verdict not been announced? The explanations posited veer from one extreme to the other: on the one hand a suggestion that the panel is assessing each piece of evidence with a fine-tooth comb to ensure a sound verdict. On the other, rumours that the delay has been caused by the panel members needing to partly return to their day jobs.The question being asked within the game is: why has it been allowed to drag on for so long? “I genuinely think everybody is sitting there thinking: ‘What is the commission up to?’” said one senior figure in English football. “It’s outrageous, the case is not that complicated. You also have to ask: why so many charges? Some are more serious than others but the same resource will inevitably have been thrown at fighting the most trivial and the most complex.”According to the individual, who has experience of developing Premier League rules, the process should have been time-limited. “It needs a disciplinary system that matches the natural rhythm of the sport; it needs cases heard quickly,” they said, pointing to changes made by the league in 2023 to ensure charges relating to profitability and sustainability breaches were resolved “in-season”.That the league has been under scrutiny over the City case is obvious from any skim of the reams of media coverage. Pressure on its chief executive, Richard Masters, was intense at the time of the hearings, with concerns within the organisation that his position was in jeopardy. (There has been no such pressure on City’s leadership, who have continued tochallenge the Premier League rulebookwhile spending about £450m to buy players in the past four transfer windows.) But the mood has changed somewhat over the past 12 months.View image in fullscreenThe London headquarters of the Premier League, which has steadfastly refused to comment on the 134 charges against City.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty ImagesMasters ended 2025 by agreeing anew set of financial regulationsfor the league, ending two years of bickering between clubs and the executive. His position had been bolstered and the dynamics within the boardroom had changed too, with two of the loudest voices – Tim Lewis of Arsenal and Tottenham’s Daniel Levy – leaving.The mood among shareholder clubs in 2026 is more apathetic than antagonistic. There is fatigue relating to the City case and legal activity more broadly, with the league’s spending on litigation in 2024 alone running to £45m. There is a feeling too among some clubs that whatever happens to City in this case will not affect them much.If there is a sense that the Premier League and its shareholders would rather put this all behind them, there is still a keen public interest in the outcome. An incredible run of success may forever have an asterisk alongside it; the foundations of the Premier League as a competition could also be upended. The longer the case drags on, the more a compromise verdict feels plausible; one in which City are found guilty on some charges, but not others, and any sanction is tangible but not transformative.Three years on, though, and no one is any the wiser as to what will happen. The nature and scale of the case against City has never been seen before in English football. Almost as striking, however, is the extent to which any information about it has stayed hidden.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 45-year-old completed a domestic season unbeaten during her first year and won a treble, as well as reaching the Women’s Champions League semi-finals.News of her new deal comes despite the defending champions having slipped to third, 12 points behind the Women’s Super League leaders, Manchester City. According to sources the extension was agreed before Chelsea’s recent back-to-back losses against Arsenaland Cityand both parties retain full belief in one another.Having lost consecutive league games for the first time in her managerial career, Bompastor spoke on Thursday about her belief that her team will bounce back when they travel to Tottenham in the WSL on Sunday. “We work hard with intensity,” she said. “We are facing a tough moment because we are not used to losing games but we also trust the quality we have in the squad, and I know it’s small tweaks for us to be in a better position. I’m confident from what I saw this week in our training sessions, we’ll be able to bounce back on Sunday.”Formerly the head coach of Lyon – now OL Lyonnes – with whom she was a Champions League winner as a coach in 2022, Bompastor was Chelsea’s preferred candidate to pick up the baton from Hayes, who had been in charge for 12 years and oversaw a dominant, trophy-laden era.This season Bompastor has guided Chelsea to another League Cup final, in which they will face Manchester United at Ashton Gate in March. Her side are also through to the Champions League quarter-finals, having been the highest-finishing English side in this season’s league phase, and in the fifth round of the FA Cup.“I am delighted to extend my stay here,” the former France international told Chelsea’s club channels. “I want to thank the club for their unwavering support and the trust they have shown in me. It’s a privilege to lead this team and I could not be prouder to represent Chelsea.“Our success as a team is built on grit, resilience and intensity and we do not settle for anything less than winning. We have so much left to fight for, we are competing on four fronts, and we will give everything, every single day to make our supporters proud. My focus is firmly on bringing more success to this amazing club.”In a joint statement, sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said that Bompastor was integral to their long-term plans, adding: “Since the day Sonia joined Chelsea, she has delivered a level of excellence that has elevated our women’s team on and off the pitch.“Her impact has been immediate and significant, and the standards she sets embody exactly what we want this club to represent. Sonia is not only a key part of driving our success today, but also an integral part of the long-term future we are building.“Renewing her contract reflects our belief in her leadership, her vision and the stability she brings to the club.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Manchester City’s manager spoke out earlier in the week and is refusing to be silenced.“I didn’t say anything special. I don’t feel that. Why should I not express what I feel? Just because I’m a manager,” said Guardiola. “I don’t agree but I respect all opinions. What I said basically is how many conflicts there are right now all around the world. I condemn all of them. If innocent people are killed, I condemn them all – not this country being more than the other one.”On Tuesday Guardiola named Sudan, Palestine and Ukraine when talking about the killing of innocent victims in conflict. “The genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened all around the world – in Sudan, everywhere. What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problem as human beings,”the 55-year-old said.He also gave a speech in support of Palestinian children at a charity event in Barcelona. Yet in a statement posted on X and its website the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region said: “We have repeatedly asked for prominent individuals to be mindful about the words they use given how Jewish people have had to endure attacks across the globe. Pep Guardiola is a football manager. Whilst his humanitarian reflections may be well-intentioned, he should focus on football.“Manchester City is being let down by him repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs. This is the second time in a week he has decided to offer his controversial views on the Middle East conflict.“It’s especially galling given his total failure to use his significant platform to display any solidarity with the Jewish community subjected to a terrorist attack a few miles from the Etihad Stadium or the Barcelona community reeling from anti-Semitic violence close to where he once engaged in remarks we believe to be provocative.”Guardiola takes City to Liverpool for Sunday’s late kick-off with Erling Haaland having scored just once from open play in 10 appearances. Haaland was dropped for Wednesday’s 3-1 Carabao Cup semi-final win over Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium, again failing to score as a late substitute. Omar Marmoush, who replaced him, scored twice yet Guardiola has backed Haaland, saying: “Erling is the best striker in the world.” He added: “I don’t know if he plays at Liverpool but I always say Erling is the best.”Antoine Semenyo is aiming to extend his scoring sequence of four goals in six appearances since joining from Bournemouth in January. The forward has scored 14 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions this season and wants to be as prolific as Haaland.He said: “I have expectations for myself so coming here I knew there was going to be that pressure of scoring the same goals as Erling, but I feel like I’ve given myself those goals at the start of the season to compete with players of his stature. Being on the same team [as him] is a blessing. It’s [goalscoring] something that is in my blood and my DNA and I just want to keep going.”Bernardo Silva is facing a fitness test before City face Liverpool at Anfield.Jamie Jackson2.Arteta says sorry for crossing the lineMikel Arteta has apologised to Liam Rosenior for any disruption caused to Chelsea’s warm-up before their Carabao Cup semi-final and insisted he will not be drawn into a war of words with any managers who might try to derail Arsenal’s title challenge.Rosenior was shown on television launching a tirade against an unidentified member of Arsenal’s staff who he felt had strayed into Chelsea’s half of the pitch during the warm-up at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Chelsea’s head coach later said his team notbeen shown respectand that there were “certain etiquettes in football” to observe.“I don’t know, it’s his opinion and obviously we respect everybody,” said Arteta when asked about the incident. “If at any point one of the staff members went through that, we apologise and that’s it. It’s very common in football, especially with the keepers because they have to keep long balls and all that, so nothing left to comment.”View image in fullscreenChelsea manager Liam Rosenior (right) and his Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta shake hands but tempers frayed in their Carabao Cup semi-final.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockBukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard are still doubtful for the game against Sunderland on Saturday when Arsenal have an opportunity to move nine points clear at the top before second-placed Manchester City face Liverpool 24 hours later.Last week, Arteta dismissed suggestions that Pep Guardiola could try to affect his side with “mind games” and he once again insisted it is important not to listen to any outside noise if Arsenal are to achieve their objective. “I would engage with the things that, in my opinion, are relevant for the team, and what is the best for the team and the club,” he said.Arteta was booked against Chelsea for contesting a decision by the referee – only the second time he has received a yellow card this season. Asked whether it is important to keep your emotions in check if you are a Premier League manager, he said: “I don’t know. Sometimes it’s difficult because you cannot be aware constantly about everything, and we are human beings, and we react to things, so I think it’s normal. I try to be the right example always, and if that’s the intention, that’s OK.”Ed Aarons3.Howe: ‘My future isn’t relevant’Eddie Howe has moved to quell speculation he could walk away from Newcastle at the end of the season following a dispiriting run of results. The Carabao Cup holders’ defence of their first major domestic trophy in 70 years ended on Wednesday night when Manchester City completed a 5-1 aggregate semi-final victory over Newcastle, and they head into Saturday’s Premier League fixture with Brentford sitting in 11th place in the table.However, after social media went into overdrive in the wake of a disappointing first-half performance at the Etihad Stadium to suggest the 48-year-old has taken the club as far as he can, with further speculation that he could replace England manager Thomas Tuchel this summer despite Newcastle chief executive David Hopkinson’s claim this week that the two parties remain happy with each other, Howe was in defiant mood.“That’s a surprise to me,” Howe said: “I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff. I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games. That’s my only thought. I don’t tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense.“My individual future isn’t really relevant. Who knows? I don’t know my length of time here, I’ve got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe and his Newcastle players applaud the away fans after the Carabao Cup defeat at Manchester City.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesThe loss of £130m striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool during the summer has had a lasting impact, and Howe acknowledges that the £219m they spent on Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa, Anthony Elanga and Jacob Ramsey is yet to pay full dividends.“For me, it’s too early to make strong conclusions from that transfer window. At this moment in time, I’d probably say let’s see where we are at the end of the season, and then even six months into next season, too. I think you’ll have a clearer idea then because you can look back at Lewis Hall’s transfer and go: ‘Well that didn’t work initially,’ but for me that was always a long-term signing.“That’s also true of various other players we’ve signed through the years – Anthony Gordon also took time to become the player that he is now. Patience is needed, although it’s a rare commodity these days with transfers. I understand that with the outlay, people will go, ‘You shouldn’t need patience and understanding’. But I’d say with most transfers these days, I think there has to be an element of that.”PA Media4.Carrick pleased with Mainoo impactMichael Carrick has praised Kobbie Mainoo’s impact at Manchester United and challenged the club’s youngsters to follow in the midfielder’s footsteps. Mainoo has played every minute of the interim head coach’s three matches, having not started any of the first 21 Premier League games under his predecessor Ruben Amorim.Mainoo will start again when United host Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime, as Carrick looks to maintain his 100% record. Despite being handed the job only until the end of the season, Carrick has incorporated a number of academy prospects in training to show there is a pathway to the first team, after Amorim was reluctant to select homegrown products.“I’ve known Kobbie to start with, and what he can bring to the team,” Carrick said of the academy graduate. “It was just my thoughts to put him into the team and I thought he would give us an awful lot. From the club’s point of view, it’s an ideal scenario to bring players through the academy and have them in the team and have them go through their career at this club and stay in and around it.”Carrick called up the 15-year-old JJ Gabriel to take part in training this week alongside Jack Moorhouse, Yuel Helafu and the brothers Tyler and Jack Fletcher. They are working under the assistant coach Travis Binnion, who was the Under-21s manager until Amorim’s departure and has overseen the development of the club’s best talent in recent years, including Mainoo and Shea Lacey.“I’m not putting everything on Kobbie’s shoulders,” Carrick said. “He’s doing terrific at the moment and I’m sure he’ll continue to be that way. We want more of that; we want more players to come through the system and to get into the first team. For me, there’s no better feeling than giving younger players a chance.”The new backroom staff was built at short notice but Carrick said: “It feels like we’ve been together an awful much longer than just these three weeks.” The most noticeable appointment was the former Chelsea and England assistant Steve Holland, who – like Carrick – spent time working under José Mourinho“I learned a lot from José in the five months when I was coaching, even in that, when you see how he works, how he thinks and how he sees players and things and they end up coming off like he predicted at certain times,” Carrick said. “He had a real good eye for that, so there’s certainly that connection.” Carrick said of Holland: “There’s definitely the common kind of factors that help us work together.”Will Unwin5.Moyes urges Dibling to ‘get angry and make an impression’David Moyes has said the arrival of Tyrique George at Everton should prompt Tyler Dibling to think “I better get my finger out” and fight for a starting place. Dibling has struggled to make an impression after a £35m move from Southampton last summer and now faces competition from his fellow 19-year-old George, who was signed on an initial loan from Chelsea on deadline day.George could replace the injured Jack Grealish on Everton’s left but can play across the front line. Asked how Dibling should react to George’s transfer, the Everton manager said: “I’d be thinking: ‘I better get my finger out and show the manager what I was really all about.’“Tyler is young and he is a quite a quiet boy who might take more time to settle in. Might. But he needs to show when he gets the opportunities. There are little glimpses of him just beginning to get angry, which I am enjoying, just beginning to be someone who might have to get angry to show what he wants to do.“What we want from him is being direct, taking people on, committing people or the way Jack Grealish does it where he drags the ball and brings people to him and finds a way of not releasing. Are you going to get us some assists, are you going to score some goals? He is just showing little signs that he is heading towards that a bit better.”Dibling was taken off at half-time on his last start, the 4-2 home defeat by Brentford, and has been mainly restricted to brief substitute appearances. “I think he is more angry with himself,” Moyes said, “because he is realising that ‘If I don’t get my finger out than I am going to get pushed aside here.’ He has more competition but that is what happens in football. If you want to be at the elite end of football then the competition is stiff and you have to live with that.”Andy Hunter6.Watkins in Villa frame for VitalityUnai Emery says Ollie Watkins is back available after a hamstring scare as Aston Villa look to get back to winning ways at Bournemouth. The 30-year-old, who has scored eight goals in 33 appearances in all competitions this season, limped off 35 minutes into last Thursday’s Europa League match against RB Salzburg.Watkins missed the surprise 1-0 home defeat to his former club Brentford but the England international could lead the line at Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. Asked if the striker would be available at the Vitality Stadium, Villa manager Emery said: “Yes. He rested last week because he had a small injury and he was not ready to play. But this week progressively he was joining us, training normally, and today he trained normally.”View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins is substituted off by Unai Emery with an injury against Salzburg but the Villa striker is expect to be fit for Bournemouth.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty ImagesJohn McGinn, Youri Tielemans, Boubacar Kamara and Andres García remain absent for Villa, who enter the weekend third in the Premier League, seven points behind the leaders Arsenal. January signing Alysson is not ready to make his debut but Amadou Onana could start having been an unused substitute against Brentford.PA Media7.Iraola says performances not transfers are keyAndoni Iraola rejected suggestions the club’s January transfer window will have any bearing on his future at Bournemouth with his contract due to expire in the summer. The Cherries lost Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City last month but brought in Alex Toth, Rayan and Ademide Solanke as well as goalkeepers Fraser Forster and Christos Mandas.With the club continuing to build a young core, Iraola was asked before Saturday’s match against Aston Villa if they would make it more difficult for him to potentially walk away in the summer. “You are making it sound like I am like almost testing the club, sign very good players so I can stay,” Iraola said in response.“And from my side, it’s not like this. I think I try to help the club to sign the better players we can. And we’ve tried to do this in the winter market. Some players we haven’t been able to sign, others yes, like in every market. And now the market is not the important thing for me. The important thing is the performances, how we build a team, how we play games, how we can continue getting points. And this is the substantial part.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

He and his Tottenham teammates had nothing more to lose. TheFA Cup tie at home to Aston Villaon 10 January was going badly. Played off the park by Unai Emery’s team, they were booed off by their own fans at half-time. They were losing 2-0.Simons takes it personally when things are not going well and that had been the case, pretty much, since his £51.8m move from RB Leipzig last August. The 22-year-old knows his levels. These were not them.What Simons did next was to figuratively tear off the gloves. It was as if he pointed at the pitch and told his opponents he was ready to go one-on-one with them. He would get past them and he would make something happen. And if it did not work, he would try again. It was a street-football vibe, however counterintuitive that may sound for a player who was schooled at La Masia, the Barcelona academy.Solanke dents Manchester City’s title hopes with stirring comeback for SpursRead moreSimons was the spark for an improved second-half performance, bringing the drive, the sense of possibility. It did not avert another defeat, Spurs losing 2-1, but, for the first time, the club had really seen him. It was the prelude for more.Simons will run out at Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime having mined a rich seam of form. The momentum is with him which, after his struggles over the first half of the season, feels impossibly good. Spurs have had five games since Villa and Simons has been the standout player in three of them – the Champions Leaguewins over Borussia Dortmundand Eintracht Frankfurtand the2-2 home draw with Manchester Citylast Sunday.The Opta statistics show that Simons’ underlying numbers have improved significantly over the past six matches. For example, he created 17 chances in them compared with 24 in his first 23 Spurs appearances. His shot count has multiplied.But it is the glow of his performance against City that tracks him to Old Trafford. He was the lone bright spot for Spurs during a dismal first half in which they went 2-0 down and it was revealing to see him scream at the defence midway through it – even at the captain, Cristian Romero. Although Simons is a young player, he is a leader; a player who wants to set standards.View image in fullscreenSpurs’ Xavi Simons bursts past Aston Villa’s Emi Buendía and Morgan Rogers in their FA Cup third round tie.Photograph: Tom Cusden/PPAUK/ShutterstockWhen he joined Barcelona as a seven-year-old, it was the era of Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi Hernández – the player he was named after. Simons rubbed shoulders with them as he rose through the youth ranks; he would become the face of La Masia during that time. Then, when he went to Paris Saint-Germain at 16, he ran into Neymar, who he knew from Barcelona, and Kylian Mbappé. He would see Messi there a year later. Simons’ pedigree does confer a certain status.In the second half against City, it felt as if Simons was everywhere, particularly towards the end after Spurs had drawn level thanks to Dominic Solanke’s goals. It was the dribbling, the directness, the incision of his passes. The work rate, too. Twice, he almost set up Wilson Odobert for the winner. He might have scored it himself but for a fine Gianluigi Donnarumma save.What has changed for Simons? Thomas Frank’s switch to 3-4-2-1, which the manager brought in for Dortmund, has helped, Simons thriving in the left-sided No 10 role. That said, Frank went to 4-4-2 at the start of the second half against City, with Simons at left midfield. He moved him into a more central position just before Solanke’s equaliser.The forward’s return from a long-term ankle injury has been a factor, giving Simons a classic No 9 to work with; Solanke made his first start of the season against Dortmund.View image in fullscreenXavi Simons (standing second row, right) with the Barcelona team during the 2010-2011 season.What Simons has done is turn the focus inwards. He has leaned into his support team, which is extensive. He has a personal trainer, a performance trainer (with whom he analyses video footage), a nutritionist, a chef. He even has a mindset coach, who has been especially useful.Simons hit the ground running at his previous two clubs – PSV and Leipzig. So why was it not happening at Spurs? Nobody should underestimate the difficulties of adapting to the Premier League from the Bundesliga. There were flickers in the early months. He was very good against Copenhagen and Slavia Prague in the Champions League. He got a goal and an assist in the crucial league win over Brentford on 6 December. Frank, though, had taken him out of the starting XI in the preceding four games. Then there wasthe red card against Liverpoolon 20 December and the shattering three-match ban.Simons is heavily into meditation and visualisation work. He reads a lot, with philosophy a favourite area. He often uploads motivational slogans to his Instagram account. He fell back on all of this. Meanwhile, his personal situation has become more settled.The Dutchman lived at the Lodge for his first couple of months at Spurs – the hotel at the training ground. And very nice it is, too. But it is still a hotel. He moved into a flat in Canary Wharf for a bit more breathing space before he was able to get into a house in early December, which has allowed him to have his family over more. He has kitted it out with state-of-the-art fitness equipment. Simons is a gym fiend, who likes to warm up at home before training.It is hard to consider Simons’ career without an awareness of his child prodigy status. He was 12 when he filmed a commercial with Neymar, and at 15 he appeared in another one with him. The other “actors” in that? Philippe Coutinho, Kevin De Bruyne, Ronaldinho, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso.Simons’ appeal was boosted by his first name, by the distinctive blond locks he had at the time. His nickname at La Masia wasrizos de oro; golden curls. He was universally acknowledged to be among the top emerging talents in Europe; everybody wanted him. Then, to Barcelona’s dismay, PSG got him. When he moved, he had 1.6 million followers on Instagram. Simons made 11 appearances for PSG, having started in their under-19s. There followed a spectacular season at PSV – he was the Eredivisie’s joint-top scorer with 19 – and two decent ones at Leipzig, the first better than the second.View image in fullscreenXavi Simons soaks up the crowd’s adulation after scoring Spurs’ second goal against Brentford.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere has long been a sense that the boy who was born in Amsterdam before emigrating with his family to Spain at the age of three has been searching for something; the perfect stage for his talent. It is remarkable to think he already has 32 Netherlands caps and has played in five countries. Also, that he speaks seven languages – Dutch, Surinamese Dutch, Spanish, Catalan, English, French and German.Simons is determined to integrate at Spurs. He has been taken on a tour of Tottenham by two of the club’s former players, Ledley King and Michael Dawson. They visited King’s street art mural – among other local landmarks – and had a drink at the Antwerp Arms, which has become a match-day institution.In January, Simons dropped in on an Alzheimer’s Society singing session at Southgate Methodist church and what struck the organisers and care workers was how much he wanted to be there. His grandmother Rinia lives with the disease. And on Tuesday, he warmed a few more hearts when he posted a screenshot of a Google search: who are Chas & Dave? Simons’ Spurs journey is up and running.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifteen games without a Premier League win and 11 points adrift of safety, the Clarets are facing relegation the season after promotion for a second time in two years.Sparring with the best should bring glorious enjoyment at Turf Moor but instead they have three victories from 24 games, beating the two other promoted sides androck-bottom Wolves, with survival chances looking worse than slim.Relegation rivals West Ham visit on Saturday, and another defeat would remove any faint hope that Burnley could turn it around and leave their record over recent seasons reading: down, up, down, up, down.Beating Sunderland in their first home gamebrought optimism after a summer where money was spent, notably bringing in the 96-cap Kyle Walker after eight years of success at Manchester City, but that feelgood factor has dwindled.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreScott Parker has often spoken of the “fine margins” that have caused Burnley to lose by a goal on seven occasions and draw six times. After thelimp defeat at Sunderlandon Monday the manager questioned the players’ attitude and was clearly furious about the desperate performance, his team completing a fourth game without registering a shot on target.Relegation would be followed by another 46 matches of grind in the hope of being a small fish once more.There was a greater bond between club and fanbase during the Sean Dyche era, whenBurnleyenjoyed five straight seasons in the Premier League, even qualifying for Europe. The team and club had a strong identity throughout, something lost in recent times. Dyche’s name still adorns a pub round the corner from Turf Moor, and his name was sung at the Stadium of Light. Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United were put on the canvas by Burnley during Dyche’s reign.“I was wearing my Burnley shirt on holiday in South Africa and a lad came up to me wishing us the best for the season,” says another season-ticket holder, Paddy. “We wouldn’t have got that recognition at one time. I get a buzz out of that – it’s lovely. It’s about little old Burnley being in the top league in the world. All right, we get battered every other week but I’m quite happy to do it. The Championship was good – don’t get me wrong, there are some big clubs down there – but little old Burnley being in the best league in the world, that’s great for me.”January was a quiet month, only James Ward-Prowse joining on loan from West Ham, making him ineligible for this weekend’s critical fixture. A striker was sought but not found at a club whose joint top scorers are Jaidon Anthony and Zian Flemming on five. Those two were signed on permanent deals after loans last season in the Championship, a division their capabilities are more suited to.Recruitment over the past two windows has not helped Parker, with the squad short on depth and the requisite quality. Sunderland finished 24 points behind Burnley in the Championship, beforewinning the playoffs, and are 21 points ahead after quickly identifying players.View image in fullscreenZian Flemming is Burnley’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League with five goals.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersUnder Parker, who has 12 wins in 76 games as a Premier League manager, the football is conservative, the polar opposite of the approach favoured by his predecessor, Vincent Kompany, who also reached a century of points in the Championship. The situation is similar to two years ago under Kompany, when Burnley were two points worse off after 24 matches, with 13. There was a feeling that Parker’s pragmatic approach might have been more suited to a relegation battle but Burnley fans find themselves in a virtually identical position without the prospect of being entertained. “I go with my brother-in-law and two nephews, and they just don’t want to go because they’re bored,” Bentley says. “I think that just says it all.”Attendances have stayed the same at Turf Moor, dipping below 20,000, roughly a fifth of Burnley’s population, on only two occasions in the league, but there is a sense of apathy. The desperation of the efforts at Sunderland did stir stronger feelings, with chants for the manager’s sacking and a “Parker out” sign left at the entrance to the training ground. Thedefeat at Brightona month earlier also sparked fan ire. How another second-tier season under Parker would be received by the supporters would be interesting to witness.PosTeamPGDPts16Leeds24-112617Nottm Forest24-112618West Ham24-192019Burnley24-221520Wolverhampton24-308“I do actually enjoy going back down to the Championship,” says Bentley. “You feel like you get up for the games, the atmosphere’s better. I know some people said last season was the most boring promotion, but we got promoted. It was still really good celebrating at the end of the year. So I’d definitely do it all again. You want to be playing against the best clubs, and that means being in the Premier League.”Burnley have produced some competitive performances but Bentley says: “It’s difficult really to get anything else out of the season, given where we’re at. At least we haven’t got the lowest points total, which is always a bonus. And I guess the other one would be to make sure we don’t finish bottom – that’s the prize now.”Wolves coming to Turf Moor on the final day at least adds a touch of jeopardy for the rest of the campaign.Explore more on these topicsBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The goal still remains the same - I’d love to get an Olympic medal.”Thomas is the second Australian athlete in danger of missing competition following aerialist Laura Peel, who suffered a knee injury in training.The 36-year-old is aiming to participate in her fourth Olympic Games and finallyclaim a medal after finishing fifth at Beijing 2022.Ten to watch: the athletes who can bring glory to Australia at the 2026 Winter Olympics | Martin PeganRead moreTeam chef de mission Alisa Camplin said Peel wasn’t ready to make a call with her event not until 17 February.“She’s working with her coaches and physios and sports psychologists trying to work out what is the plan for every single day. She’s still got many days until her competition,” Camplin said in Livigno, in the Italian alps.“I think sometimes we forget that every athlete’s journey into the Olympics is a total rollercoaster and there’s so many ups and downs.“There’s actually no perfect preparation. You’ve just got to roll with what happens and make your best decisions so that you bring what you can when you get to the start gate.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The ­British No 1 beat Oleksandra ­Oliynykova 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in a tough semi-final to take her place in Saturday’s Transylvania Open final in Cluj.She now has a shot at winning her first title since her incredible success at Flushing Meadows in 2021 when she announced herself as a real force on the WTA Tour.Emma Raducanu begins latest search for coach after parting company with RoigRead moreTwo British women will compete in different WTA Tour finals on the same day for the first time, withKatie Boulterreaching the final of the Ostrava Open.What sort of physical or mental condition Raducanu, the top seed, will be in for the final against Sorana Cirstea remains to be seen after she came through one of the toughest matches of her career. It was an attritional match for Raducanu against the Ukrainian, who adopted some frustrating tactics, including heavy use of the moon ball and slices and the Briton was left physically shattered after a near three-hour battle.“What an incredible match,” ­Raducanu said. “I think all props to my opponent today. She played incredible, makes it so tricky to put any ball past her. You think it’s past her, and then the ball is on your baseline or on your sideline, so it’s so difficult.“I’m just most proud of how I competed, how I came back in the third set, how I managed the match. I honestly don’t know if I could have done it without everyone’s support.”The world No 91 adopted her infuriating tactics especially well late in the first set after Raducanu had broken to go 5-4 up. It paid off as she broke back, but Raducanu stayed strong to claim another break in a mammoth game at 5-5 and then served out the set with relative ease.View image in fullscreenKatie Boulter is into her fifth WTA final after beating Katie Volynets in straight sets in OstravaPhotograph: Lukas Coch/AAPThe British player then broke in the opening game of the second set to raise hopes of a more comfortable route to victory as she opened up a 3-1 lead. But Oliynykova would just not go away and turned the set on its head with a run of five successive games to level the scores as Raducanu had no answers to her unusual style.Raducanu showed her fighting spirit after trailing 2-1 in the decider to take back control of the match, ­winning 16 straight points to move close to victory. She missed two match points on Oliynykova’s serve, but finally finished the job behind her own serve.Earlier, the British No 4, Boulter, beat the American Katie Volynets 6-1, 6-3 to secure a place in the Ostrava Open final.Boulter, now No 120 in the world, broke in the opening game and then the fifth to establish a 4-1 lead, before taking the set as Volynets’ serve faltered again. Volynets, the world No 96, forced an early break in the first game of the second set, but the Briton responded immediately to level at 1-1.Boulter then went on the offensive with some power hitting across the court. Another break in game eight left her serving for the match, which she closed out after recovering from 0-40 down to hold her nerve and progress to a fifth WTA final.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuKatie BoulterTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

He asked for a photo with us, so I am feeling pretty good about myself,” reported Mouat. The duo were asked what the musician said to them, with Dodds replying: “He heard about Bruce!”The rapper, who was wearing a USA jacket that featured photos of Thiesse and partner Korey Dropkin, is an honorary coach for the US team as well as a special correspondent for NBC, and took to the ice himself to have a try at sweeping a stone. He had also carried the Olympic flame on Wednesday, having previously been a torchbearer at the Summer Games in Paris two years ago.The American pair beat Canada’s Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman 7-5 in front of a raucous stadium packed with US supporters. “It’s the Olympics, and our family and friends are here cheering us on. Snoop Dogg’s here cheering us on! [The jacket] was so cool. Loved it. Coach Snoop looked good today,” a fired-up Dropkin said.“I’m just here to cheer, uplift and maybe drop a little wisdom from the sidelines, Team USA athletes are the real stars,” Snoop said. “This team represents the best of what sport can be: talent, heart and hustle. If I can bring a little more love and motivation to that, that’s a win for me.”Mouat and Dodds were in action again on Friday afternoon, comfortably beating Korea 8-2 in the fifth match of the round-robin phase in Cortina.Earlier, the ice-skating pairing of Lewis Gibson and Lilah Fear made an excellent start in their quest for the first British medal in their Winter Olympics discipline since Torvill and Dean won bronze in the 1994 Games in Lillehammer.Gibson and Fear are in bronze position after the first round of the ice dance session of the figure skating team event. The pair, in a nod to the 1990s, performed to a Spice Girls medley.“I just feel so proud,” Fear said. “The week that we’ve had, building up to this point when we can just let all of our work just show up for us and enjoy it. I feel like we did exactly that and there’s nothing like this feeling.” Gibson added: “It’s our first ever time doing the team event. It’s incredible – their support is so close at the side of the boards.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsCurlingSnoop DoggFigure skatingTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

England are still investigating the extent of Feyi-Waboso’s knock –sustained in training on Thursday– and it remains to be seen if he will feature at all in the Six Nations.Bielle-Biarrey stars as France outplay Ireland to lay down a Six Nations markerRead more“[Manny] pulled out of training in the last 60 seconds and unfortunately won’t be available this weekend,” said the England assistant coach Tom Harrison. “He sustained a pulled muscle in the leg area. Does it disrupt some plans? Yes it does because it’s changing a player. But we’ve done everything we can to make sure the next player is ready.”The head coach, Steve Borthwick, had said that Roebuck was “a week or so” from full fitness when omitting him from the initial matchday squad earlier in the week, suggesting he was on track to make his comeback against Scotland next week, but the Sale wing has received the nod over Elliot Daly.“Steve said the other day [Tom would] be ready in a couple of days,” added Harrison. “In an ideal world, we’d have given him an extra week but the world isn’t ideal as we know. He trained fully yesterday and he’s been exceptional around the squad. I’m excited to see him go.”Feyi-Waboso’s absence is a blow for Borthwick given the Exeter wing has been in fine form for club and country this season. He started all four autumn Tests, scoring two tries in England’s 100% winning campaign and re-establishing himself on the international stage after missing last year’s Six Nations with a shoulder injury.The 23-year-old represented Wales Under-18s before pledging his allegiance to England but his late withdrawal means he is still yet to appear against Saturday’s opponents. “Any player would be disappointed with an injury,” said the England back-rower Sam Underhill. “We’re gutted for him. He’s a very emotionally resilient guy, he’s a hard-working guy. Anyone doing a medical degree and playing rugby probably has a level of resilience anyway. He’s a good guy, no doubt he’ll be back better for it but yeah, it’s disappointing.”Despite Roebuck’s lack of game time and question marks over his fitness, he has proved himself an impressive operator on the international stage. He started the autumn victories against Australia and New Zealand, scoring the fourth and final tryagainst the All Blacks, having cemented his spot on the right wing in last year’s thumping victory over Wales in Cardiff. Borthwick has called up the Bristol prop Max Lahiff into his squad to bolster front-row numbers with the Bath youngster Billy Sela absent due to injury.Despite the disruption, England are red-hot favourites to extend their winning run to 12 matches, with Wales on a Six Nations losing streak that dates back to 2023. The England captain, Jamie George, is expecting a fearsome challenge against their great rivals, however.“It’s hostile. There’s confrontation. They are tough games,” said George. “You feel it in the stadiums you play at, whether that’s the Allianz or the Principality. It’s like there’s a different energy in the crowd and that plays into the way the game is played and it’s so confrontational. That’s why they are great games to be part of.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamSix NationsWales rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Armstrong will be involved in the film but will not have a producing credit.The hope is for the film to be a cross between F1 and The Wolf of Wall Street.Brad Pitt’s smash-hit racing drama recently scored four Oscar nominations, including a surprise best picture nod.Armstrong became an international star after winning the Tour de France on seven consecutive occasions between 1998 and 2005. But an investigation in 2012 took away his titles when he was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs. He received a lifetime ban from the sport.His story was previously told in Stephen Frears’ 2015 drama The Program, where he was played by Ben Foster.

Right-wing critics raged over the musician’s gender-nonconforming style, Spanish-language music and anti-Maga politics. Donald Trump, after saying he had never heard of Bad Bunny, called the headlining choice “absolutely ridiculous”.Fans race to learn Spanish before Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showRead moreIn response, Erika Kirk and her Turning Point USA conservative advocacy group turned the controversy into its own counter-programming event: the All-American Halftime Show. After its Nashville-heavy lineup, led by Kid Rock, was announced on Monday, vice-president JD Vance was first among conservatives to enthusiastically spread the word.In the main, the alt-cast is meant to be Turning Point’s most defiant gesture yet, a massive middle finger to leftist values – and perhaps it would be if one of the Blackest shows on TV hadn’t pulled it off first and best. “We stole the audience,” the actor Marlon Wayanssaid recently. “And the next year, they were like, ‘Y’all are never doingthatagain.’”In 1990 a new sketch comedy called In Living Colorsplatteredon to the then fledgling Fox network. Riding the momentum of a film career that included writing and producing credits on Eddie Murphy Raw, In Living Color creator Keenen Ivory Wayans set the show in SNL’s blindspot, bringing Black culture, ethnic nuance and queer sensibilities to the fore with a fearless, streetwise edge. The In Living Color cast was a photo negative of the typical SNL lineup – a mix of future stars (Jamie Foxx, David Alan Grier), Wayans family members (Marlon and Damon, an SNL castoff) and DEI hires (Jim Carrey); Jennifer Lopez got her showbiz start on the show as a Fly Girls dancer.View image in fullscreenDamon Wayans as Homey D Clown (center) on season two of In Living Color.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn Living Color sketches didn’t just land; they became national refrains that echoed across break rooms and schoolyards, perhaps none more inescapable than Damon Wayans’ angry-clown punchline: “Homie don’t play that.” The show was a rap vanguard, booking Public Enemy, Queen Latifah and more hip-hop acts at a time when the big three networks were still cagey about young Black performers.Keenen’s bizarro SNL quickly became as big as its inspiration, drawing 12 million viewers a week on Sunday primetime – a major TV night in those days. But of course it wasn’t as watched as the NFL, a TV property that Fox honcho Rupert Murdoch desperately wanted for his young network.I don’t know anyone who likes half-time except for the parents of the children marching on the fieldKeenen Ivory WayansDuring In Living Color’s first season, a marketing impresario named Jay Coleman approached Fox with an idea that would draw even bigger ratingsandstick it to CBS, the NFL rights holder andSuper Bowlcarrier that Murdoch had in his sights: a special episode of In Living Color that would air opposite the Super Bowl intermission.The Super Bowl half-time spectacular was ripe for the picking back then – “the time that everybody went to pee”, as Keenenput it to ESPNin 2021. “They create a half-time show for the 100,000 people in the stadium that I don’t think translates that well to the small screen,” Coleman said in 1991. Even worse, the performances were deathly dull – a hodgepodge of dusty nostalgia acts and earnest marching bands, preceded by a monotone speech from the NFL commissioner. “I don’t know anyone who likes half-time except for the parents of the children marching on the field,” Keenen said in a 1992 LA Times interview ahead of his warring broadcast.The theme for the 1992 Super Bowl half-time was “Winter Magic” – an ode to the forthcoming winter Olympics in Albertville, France. The showstopper was a figure skating routine between American sweethearts Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano set to live music from – wait for it –Gloria Estefan. “Why would you feature a singer from the Miami Sound Machine in a show called ‘Winter Magic’?” a Hartford Courant reviewer wondered afterward.In Living Color not only promised a friskier production – live and taped sketches, Color Me Badd singing their monster R&B hit I Wanna Sex You Up – but also cut-rate prices for advertisers. Frito-Lay paid $2m forexclusive rightsto In Living Color’s Super Bowl Halftime Party, money that would have barely covered a 75-second ad on the CBS telecast. “Cute” was how George F Schweitzer, a senior flack for CBS,describedFox’s Super Bowl subterfuge, believing it would only “appeal to the people who watch In Living Color”.The country found out just how wrong Schweitzer was on 26 January 1992, when Buffalo met Washington at the Metrodrome in Minneapolis for Super Bowl XXVI. As the teams trudged off the field for the opening of Winter Magic, In Living Color went live on Fox, its full cast cramming on to the stage and turning SNL’s closing curtain on its head. Carrey started by revealing a 26-minute countdown clock at the left bottom corner of the screen that would let viewers know when to switch back for the second half. “You won’t miss any of the senseless brutality!”In Living Color carried the football theme through its Homeboy Shopping Network and Fire Marshal Bill parodies. But nothing shocked like the Men on Football sketch: playing a flamboyantly gay Siskel and Ebert style culture critic alongside Grier, Damon improvised jokes that amplified damaging sexual rumors about Richard Gere as well as Carl Lewis, slipping past the censors’ five-second delay. (The joke was quickly scrubbed from future versions of the episode.) And while some viewers took offense – “We are angry but not surprised,” Glaad’s Chris Fowler said – the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. “It made me forget how much money my husband was losing [on the game],” one New York woman said in a letter to Syracuse’s Post-Standard newspaper.We [at the league] said, ‘This isn’t going to ever happen again’Jim SteegBut the final ratings were the big headline. Altogether, 22 million people switched from CBS to Fox for the In Living Color alt-cast, outdrawing Winter Magic and cratering ratings for the second half. Washington dominating the game didn’t help.The NFL was shook. “We [at the league] said, ‘This isn’t going to ever happen again,’” Jim Steeg, formerly the NFL’s senior vice-president of special events, told ESPN. “We had identified who we wanted to go after [for the next half-time show] by March. And we met with Michael Jackson’s agent.” At the very next Super Bowl in Pasadena, when Buffalo and Dallas ducked inside, the king of pop appeared at the 50-yard line and soaked in the adulation from the capacity Rose Bowl crowd before breaking into his jock anthem, Jam. A record 133 million viewers tuned in from the US alone.Bald eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd: is Budweiser’s all-American Super Bowl ad serious?Read moreThe Super Bowl half-time has been appointment television ever since. And after Kendrick Lamar’s politically charged half-time topped Michael Jackson’s record-setting viewership last year, it will take a whole lot of fireworks from Kirk and Co to compete with Bad Bunny – athree-time winner at last Sunday’s Grammys(his Spanish-language record Debí Tirar Más Fotos took album of the year) who headlined one of the world’s top tours in spite of his decision to not perform inside the continental US in protest of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. All the while the NFL has held firm in its choice.“Listen,Bad Bunnyis one of the great artists in the world,” commissioner Roger Goodell said in his annual pre-game news conference on Monday. “That’s one of the reasons we chose him. But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that.”THE LINEUP FOR THE ALL-AMERICAN HALFTIME SHOW IS HERE! 🔥Watch Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett THIS SUNDAY 🇺🇸pic.twitter.com/xwurEhdB13— Turning Point USA (@TPUSA)February 2, 2026Ultimately, the In Living Color half-time show was a one-and-done. The series itself didn’t last much longer, going off the air in 1994 after five seasons. Not even Chris Rock joining the cast in season five, fresh off being fired by SNL, could save the show that had become a cultural touchstone. Most of the stars had moved on: the entire Wayans family departed by the end of season four, with Keenen citing business and creative control as his reasons. But Fox, which would slowly pivot from theBlack-led shows that built the networkto chase broader viewership, had already lined up programming to more than make up for any Sunday ratings slack.In 1993 Fox wrested CBS’s NFL broadcast package in a $1.6bn deal. Four years later, the Super Bowl landed on Bart Simpson’s network; in 2020 Fox carried the game again, with Shakira co-headlining alongside Jennifer Lopez – the original Fly Girl. No doubt for hardcore In Living Color fans, the show’s heavy hand in shaping that entire spectacle was unmissable.Turning Point is hardly the first to crib a page from In Living Color’s Super Bowl playbook. Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, the pay-per-view Lingerie Bowl and even SNL have all tried to snatch viewers orbiting the big game. But only In Living Color has managed to pull off the greatest audience heist in American television history. Kirk and Kid Rock have their work cut out.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionSuper BowlUS sportsTV comedyComedyTelevisionBad BunnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While Homeland Security Investigations teams that are focused on preventing human trafficking and the sale of counterfeit goods have long worked the event, immigration operations would be unusual.In the city of Santa Clara, where nearly half of residents were born outside the US, fear was building as the game approached, said Lisa Gillmor, the mayor.People were afraid of being targeted simply for having brown skin, she said: “They’re afraid to send their kids to school. There’s fear that maybe they should leave during the Super Bowl if the city is going to be inundated with ICE agents.”This week, however, theNFL, which has long partnered with the DHS, said there would be “no planned ICE enforcement activities”. “We are confident of that,” said Cathy Lanier, the league’s chief security officer.Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, said on Thursday that his office had been “assured there will be no immigration enforcement tied to the game”.In a statement to the Guardian last week, the DHS declined to confirm reports about operations around Levi’s Stadium, writing that the agency does “not disclose future operations or discuss personnel”.ICE agents expected to be deployed for Super Bowl in California, officials sayRead more“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.The announcement from the NFL has brought relief, but residents are still on edge, said Otto Lee, the president of the Santa Clara county board of supervisors.“It helps alleviate some fear in the community, but at the same time, we certainly need to prepare for the worst,” Lee said.Officials in Santa Clara county were already anticipating a demanding year ahead as the area prepared to host some six World Cup games this summer and the Super Bowl.The threat of an ICE presence added new challenges.As theTrump administrationhas implemented its mass deportation agenda and staged aggressive operations in which agents have killed two US citizens, alarm has spread across the US.Although northern California has hadlow ICE arrest rates, communities there have been readying themselves. Last fall, the Trump administration was expected todeploymore than 100 immigration agents to San Francisco, but the president ultimately called off the operation after conversations with the city’s mayor and tech leaders.Santa Clara county has a rapid response network that tracks ICE activity and provides verified information to residents.Lee said at a recent board of supervisors meeting that ICE agents don’t have “absolute immunity”, and that local law enforcement would arrest anyone who “comes into our county masked, spreading terror, breaking laws or threatening our residents”.Lee and other officials were outraged by the possibility of ICE activity at the Super Bowl. The county is focused on ensuring it will be a safe event, and enforcement activities would bring chaos. ICE activities in Minnesota created havoc, Lee said, with “incompetent chaos [and] trigger-happy gunmen”.“That truly endangers everybody’s lives. And certainly does not make our community safer,” he added.On Monday, the US representative Ro Khanna, whose district includes Santa Clara, and some 21 other members of Congress sent aletterto Noem demanding that the DHS not deploy immigration enforcement personnel.“This should be a moment of celebration, unity and economic opportunity, not a flashpoint for fear, polarization and violence,” they wrote.This week, the Santa Clara city council passed an ordinance banning federal authorities from using city property for immigration enforcement. Protests are expected outside the game, and volunteers plan to patrol near the stadium around the community looking out for ICE.Gillmor hopes that the NFL’s announcement will hold true, and she suspects that it will, given that the administration likely doesn’t want to disrupt the day for wealthy ticket holders. If there were an ICE presence, she said, local law enforcement would not cooperate with the federal agents, as state law mandates.“I’m trying to calm the waters here to let them know that we have their back in Santa Clara,” she said. “In the event [ICE] did come, we’re going to uphold the law no matter what, but they’re not going to get any assistance from us.”But the issues go beyond the Super Bowl, she said, and anxiety will surely escalate in the coming months as the community prepares for the World Cup and visitors from around the world.“The core issue is ICE and the way that they’ve conducted their operations,” she said. “Fear is at a crescendo now, but I think that the underlying issue has been building a long time. And it’s not going to stop. After this game, it’s going to reappear again no matter what.”Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationCaliforniaSuper BowlNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain,Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.Between the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the640,000-sq-ft, four-storywarehouse.Amazon offers tours to the public at28of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.Melania: Amazon’s $106m documentary takes $982 per screen in Australian opening weekendRead moreBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers havereportedhaving to pee in water bottles due tolack of time and access, and have even said theirbathroom breaks are timed.Zoe Hoffman, anAmazonspokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.None of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.Amazoncites 10 different robotsthrough its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.Several sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.The tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.The tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.Criticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the workerorganizing effortsat the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.The tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.Throughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.The second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room.Robotsresembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.The tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.Back on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.Not so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.Amazon tells workers it will cut 16,000 jobs worldwide in second big wave of layoffsRead moreTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics,told the Guardian in 2022he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”He said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”Now the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive,toldwhite-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.In October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, whichincludedplans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.Amazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.The companylaid off about 14,000 corporate employeesthe same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recentlyannouncedplans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazondeniedthat AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”Amazon isreportedlydeveloping “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.In November, more than 1,000 Amazon workerssigned an open letterexpressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.Staff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”They also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”An Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonGeorgiaRobotsE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The screentime management features were too easy to dismiss and parental controls were time-draining to install, the preliminary ruling added.The commission said its preliminary views did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and TikTok would have the opportunity to challenge its findings.Online safety campaigners have urged politicians to tackle features on social media platforms that encourage users to stay online. The crossbench peer and online safety campaigner Beeban Kidron, a leading voice in the UK debate, hasurged the British governmentto “detoxify the dopamine loops” of addictive social media platforms.Breaches of the DSA can result in a fine totalling up to 6% of a company’s annual turnover, as well as the imposition of remedies such as an app redesign. TikTok does not publish its revenues, but according to estimates from the World Advertising Research Centre it will post revenues of $35bn (£26bn) this year.TikTok said it rejected the commission’s findings. “The commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us,” a spokesperson for the company said.Last year Elon Musk’s X was fined €120m (£104m) for a breach of the DSA in the first-ever fine under the legislation. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue-tick verification badge given to users, and impeding research around what adverts the platform had hosted.Explore more on these topicsTikTokInternet safetySocial mediaEuropean UnionChildrenDigital mediaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, a finance officer at a Singaporean multinational paid out nearly $500,000 to scammers during what hebelievedwas a video call with company leadership. UK consumers are estimated to havelost£9.4bn to fraud in the nine months to November 2025.“Capabilities have suddenly reached that level where fake content can be produced by pretty much anybody,” said Simon Mylius, an MIT researcher who works on a project linked to the AI Incident Database.He calculates that “frauds, scams and targeted manipulation” have made up the largest proportion of incidents reported to the database in 11 of the past 12 months. He said: “It’s become very accessible to a point where there is really effectively no barrier to entry.”“The scale is changing,” said Fred Heiding, a Harvard researcher studying AI-powered scams. “It’s becoming so cheap, almost anyone can use it now. The models are getting really good – they’re becoming much faster than most experts think.”In early January, Jason Rebholz, the chief executive of Evoke, an AI security company, posted a job offer on LinkedIn and was immediately contacted by a stranger in his network, who recommended a candidate.Within days, he was exchanging emails with someone who, on paper, appeared to be a talented engineer.“I looked at the resume and I was like, this is actually a really good resume. And so I thought, even though there were some red flags, let me just have a conversation.”Then things became strange. The candidate’s emails went directly to spam. His resume had quirks. But Rebholz had dealt with unusual candidates before and decided to go ahead with the interview.Then, when Rebholz took the call, the candidate’s video took nearly a minute to appear.“The background was extremely fake,” he said. “It just looked super, super fake. And it was really struggling to deal with [the area] around the edges of the individual. Like part of his body was coming in and out … And then when I’m looking at his face, it’s just very soft around the edges.”Rebholz went through with the conversation, not wanting to face the awkwardness of asking the candidate directly if they were, in fact, an elaborate scam. Afterwards, he sent a recording of it to a contact at a deepfake detection firm, who told him that the video image of the candidate was AI-generated. He rejected the candidate.Rebholz still does not know what the scammer wanted – an engineering salary, or trade secrets. While there have beenreportsof North Korean hackers trying to get jobs at Amazon, Evoke is a startup, not a massive player.“It’s like, if we’re getting targeted with this, everyone’s getting targeted with it,” said Rebholz.Heiding said the worst was ahead. Currently deepfake voice cloning technology is excellent – making it easy for scammers to impersonate, for example, a grandchild in distress over the phone. Deepfake videos, on the other hand, still have room for improvement.This could have extreme consequences: for hiring, for elections, and for broader society. Heiding added: “That’ll be the big pain point here, the complete lack of trust in digital institutions, and institutions and material in general.”Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The verdict could influence thousands of similar cases against the ride-hailing company.The case, brought by plaintiff Jaylynn Dean, was the first trial of more than 3,000 similar lawsuits againstUberthat have been consolidated in US federal court. So-called bellwether trials are used to test legal theories and help gauge the value of claims for possible settlements. The jury found that the driver was an agent of Uber, holding the company responsible for his actions. They awarded Dean $8.5m in compensatory damages but declined to award punitive damages. Attorneys for Dean had sought more than $140m in damages.In a statement, an Uber spokesperson noted that the jury rejected Dean’s other claims, that the company was negligent or that its safety systems were defective, adding that the company plans to appeal. “This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety,” the spokesperson said.Sarah London, an attorney for Dean, said the verdict “validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety”. If the verdict is upheld on appeal, it will be used as precedent in other litigation against Uber, said personal injury attorney John Carpenter of Carpenter & Zuckerman, who is not involved in Uber litigation. Carpenter said while each sexual assault case is valued on its individual merits, the $8.5m verdict could be used as a benchmark for other such cases.Dean, anOklahomaresident, sued Uber in 2023, one month after her alleged assault in Arizona. She said Uber was aware of a wave of sexual assaults committed by its drivers, but had failed to take basic actions to improve the safety of its riders. Such assertions have long dogged the company, drawing headlines and congressional scrutiny.Alexandra Walsh, an attorney for Dean, said during the trial’s closing arguments that Uber had marketed itself as a safe option for women traveling at night, particularly if they had been drinking.“Women know it’s a dangerous world. We know about the risk of sexual assault,” Walsh said. “They made us believe that this was a place that was safe from that.“Uber, which has faced numerous safety controversies, including allegations of lax driver vetting and a culture critics said prioritized growth over passenger protection, has argued that it should not be held liable for criminal conduct by drivers who use its platform, saying that its background checks and disclosures about assaults are sufficient.The company maintains that its drivers are independent contractors rather than employees, and that regardless of their classification it cannot be responsible for actions that fall outside the scope of what could reasonably be considered their duties.“He had no criminal history. None,” Kim Bueno, an attorney for Uber, said of the driver during closing arguments, noting that he had 10,000 trips on the app and a nearly perfect rating from riders. “Was this foreseeable to Uber? And the answer to that has to be no.”Dean’s lawsuit said she was intoxicated when she hired an Uber driver to take her from her boyfriend’s home to her hotel. The driver asked her harassing questions on the ride before stopping the car and raping her, Dean alleged in the lawsuit.US district judge Charles Breyer, who normally sits on the bench in San Francisco, oversaw Dean’s case in Phoenix. Breyer is managing all of the similar federal cases against Uber, which have been centralized in his court in San Francisco. The company is also facing more than 500 cases inCaliforniastate court. In the only one of those cases to go to trial so far, a jury in September sided with Uber. The jury found that while the company had been negligent with its safety measures, that negligence was not a substantial factor in causing the woman’s harm.Rival Lyft is facing similar lawsuits in both state and federal court, although there is no coordinated federal litigation for those claims.Explore more on these topicsUberRape and sexual assaultUS justice systemUS crimeWomenArizonaOklahomanewsShareReuse this content"

But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect peopleKeza MacDonaldFri 6 Feb 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 09.41 ESTShareWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in thePokémonWorld Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.It is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.Over the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.Like The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.The developer nearly went bust several times, taking on outside projects to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salaryPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.The idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.View image in fullscreenClick and collect … Competitors at the 2019 Pokémon World Championships in Washington DC.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.But the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.Pokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.Time magazine called Pokémon 'a pestilential Ponzi scheme', describing the 'delinquent' and ‘criminal' behaviour of young fansToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.Now that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.View image in fullscreenThe greatest catch … Satoshi Tajiri with his  lucrative creation.Photograph: JC Olivera/Variety/Getty ImagesPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.July 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.There’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.The 10 most anticipated video games of 2026Read moreAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.Dr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

Well, as far as Mewgenics is concerned, you can forget it – and you can also forget the idea that a game about cats has to be in any way cute. These kitties are red in tooth and claw, prone to strange mutations, and strictly limited to just the one life, which often ends swiftly and brutally.Such is the nature of roguelike, a format that has spawned some of the biggest indie hits of the past 20 years. In these games, failure is permanent; dying sends you back not to the last checkpoint but back to the beginning, the game reshuffling its elements into a new shape for your next run. And so it goes in Mewgenics. You gather a party of four felines and send them out on a questing journey, from which they return victorious or not at all.Down in the sewers, Joyce, the tabby mage, gets trampled to death by a blob-monster. Shortly afterwards, Fulbert, with his Bagpuss-like markings and full beard, is exploded from within by maggots that have infested his guts. That’s the last you’ll ever see of either of them. But the pair enjoyed one magical evening together before shipping off to war, leaving behind a kitten with that telltale pink-and-white patterning (and some promising stats), ready for the next go-around.These emergent family sagas are told in the second of Mewgenics’ two modes: a pet sim – think Tamagotchi meets Love Island – where you furnish your cutaway-diagram home and grab cats by the scruff to drag them between rooms. As well as matchmaking partners who may produce the next generation of warriors, you’re trying to separate love rivals – whose scraps are yet another way these cats can meet their end – and members of the same family.View image in fullscreenA post-South Park teenage edgelord aesthetic …  Mewgenics’ cats in between battles.Photograph: Edmund McMillen/Tyler GlaielIf you find the title’s pun distasteful, be warned that it’s an accurate indication of the profoundly tasteless humour that awaits within. Expect an awful lot of poop, undeveloped foetuses and pussy-related single entendres, as well as sections where you watch cats in flagrante (the humping animation can, at least, be turned off). The game’s real shock value, though, is subtler and sharper: it’s in how quickly you grow accustomed to checking the litter from last night’s romantic encounters, then dumping any kittens with subpar stats or inbred birth defects.The game’s developers, Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, came up through the early 00s Flash game scene, the heyday of Newgrounds and Happy Tree Friends, and never really grew out of it. Coming to their work, you have to be willing to accept the post-South Park teenage edgelord aesthetic as part of the package.All that may put you off Mewgenics, and fair enough. But beneath its icky surface you’ll find a game of rare depth and variety. The pet sim is a sideshow, really, to the turn-based battles, which play out like a mashup of chess, D&D and Pokémon. You move your cats around a 10x10 board, looking for ways to leverage the particular combination of abilities and obstacles in front of you. Say you’ve got one cat with a lightning attack, another with a hosepipe, and a third who likes to be electrocuted. With careful positioning, and a basic understanding of water’s conductive properties, in a single turn you can zap multiple enemies and charge up your electrophilic moggy for the next turn.View image in fullscreenPokémon meets chess … a battle scene in Mewgenics.Photograph: Edmund McMillen/Tyler GlaielThese eureka moments are frequent, because Mewgenics is constantly throwing new things at you: locations, enemies, classes, abilities, weather conditions, one-off events. McMillen’s previous game, The Binding Of Isaac, launched in 2011 – one of the forerunners of the modern roguelike sensation – and is still being updated and expanded today. At launch, Mewgenics feels as if it has already benefited from years’ worth of tinkering.What’s impressive is not just the quantity of content but how elegantly it all interlocks. I’ve recently unlocked two new classes, the nature-loving druid and the meat hook-slinging butcher. An unlikely partnership, perhaps, but experimenting yields a discovery: a synergy between the former’s ability to talk to other creatures and the latter’s ability to spawn flies from the rotten meat they carve off their enemies. For the rest of the run, my cats can sit back and let their insectoid-plague army do all the hard work.These stars may align on your 100th run, or your 1,000th, or never. According to the save screen, after 60 hours, I’ve seen less than athirdof what this game has to offer. Mewgenics is built to fill every moment you’re willing to give it.Mewgenics is out 10 February; $29.99/£24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve hardly noticedMohamad BazziA crypto startup founded by Trump’s family signed a huge deal with the UAE president’s brother. Where’s the political fallout?Fri 6 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 13.03 ESTShareDays before Donald Trump returned to office in January 2025, an investment firm controlled by a senior member of the United Arab Emirates royal family secretlysigned a dealto pay $500m to buy almost half of a cryptocurrency startup founded by the Trump family. Under any other president, such an arrangement,which was revealedthis past weekend by the Wall Street Journal, would cause a political earthquake in Washington. There would be demands for an investigation by Congress, televised hearings and months of damage control.But this latest example of corruption involving Trump and his family business hardly made a blip over the past few days, relegated to apassing headlinein a relentless news cycle often dominated by Trump’s actions and statements.This scandal deserves our attention: a half-billion-dollar transaction with a foreign government official, executed in the shadow of Trump’s inauguration, which directly enriched the president and his family. The deal to acquire a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, thecrypto companyfounded by the Trump family and several allies in the fall of 2024 during Trump’s presidential campaign, was backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, one of the most powerful officials in the UAE. Known asthe “spy sheikh”, Tahnoon is the brother of the UAE’s president and serves as national security adviser. He also oversees one of the largest investment empires in the world, serving as chair of two Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds, which have $1.5tn in assets, and G42, a firm focused on artificial intelligence.It’s time to defund the oligarchy and invest in the American people | Joseph Geevarghese and Rashida TlaibRead moreIt’s dizzying to keep up with the ways that Trump has monetized the presidency and used it for personal profit in his second term. The Trump Organization, run by the president’s sons, has negotiated foreignreal estate dealsworth billions of dollars, some of which involve private companiesbacked by governmentsof the three wealthiest Arab petrostates: Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. In May, as Trump prepared to visit the Middle East, Qatar’s government donated a $400m luxury Boeing jet, which is being refitted by the US military so Trump can use it as Air Force One. It was probably the most expensive giftfrom a foreign governmentin US history – and Trump has said the plane will be transferred to his presidential library when his term ends in 2029, meaning he could still use it after he leaves the White House.In late May, the presidenthosted a private dinnerat his Virginia golf club for the 220 largest buyers of his memecoin, called $Trump, which is a type of cryptocurrency connected to an online joke or mascot and has no inherent value. The top 25 buyersin the crypto contestgot invited to a VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour. In all, the Trump family’s crypto business raked inabout $148mfrom the contest, most of it from foreign or anonymous buyers. The top spender was Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto billionaire who bought more than$20m worthof Trump’s memecoins. (In February 2025, a few weeks after Trump took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission suspended a civil fraud case it had brought against Sun in 2023 – leading to accusations that he was getting favorable treatment because he hadinvested $75min another of the Trump family’s crypto projects. Aspokesperson for Sun saidhe had “not requested special treatment, nor conditioned any commercial activity on regulatory decisions”.)Despite the sheer scale of these conflicts surrounding Trump over the past year, the$500m deal involving World Liberty and the UAE’s Tahnoon is “the only known case of a foreign government official purchasing a major stake in a Trump company after his election”, as theJournal reported. By intertwining his personal fortune with the ruling families of the Gulf, Trump has compromised his ability – and the ability of his entire administration – to negotiate foreign policy and act as an honest broker. How can Washington credibly pressure the UAE onits role fuelinga civil war in Sudan, when the Emirates’ national security adviser is a business partner of the US president?Over the past decade, Tahnoon has steered foreign policy negotiations with the US over major issues including fighting terrorism, economic investments and securing UAE access to advanced computer technology. In March, he visited Washington andmet with Trump, gaining access to top cabinet members and being feted at aWhite House dinner– honors normally bestowed on a visiting head of state. The public did not know about the secret deal Tahnoon’s investment firm had signed two months earlier with the Trump family’s crypto company.The revelations also underscore why Trump’s foray into crypto has turned into the most lucrative, and dangerous, way for him to profit from the presidency. After Trump’s first term, his family business expanded beyond a real estate conglomerate that licensed the Trump brand to hotels, golf resorts and residential towers around the world – it now includes media platforms such as Truth Social and various crypto ventures. Overall, the Trumps generated $1.4bn from crypto projects over the past year, making up almost a fifth of the family’s estimated fortune of $6.8bn,according to Bloomberg.These crypto ventures are particularly ripe for exploitation because they allow Trump and his family to collecthundreds of millions of dollarsfrom foreign investors and government officials who would usually have a difficult time channeling money to a US politician. Trump is not only enriching himself through the presidency, he’s tapped into an industry that is rife with fraud and a lack of transparency. Within months of returning to office, the Trump administration began toderegulate the industryand ordered the justice department to disband a national unit dedicated to investigating crypto-related fraud, which was set up in 2022 under Joe Biden’s administration.It’s dizzying to keep up with the ways that Trump has monetized the presidency and used it for personal profit in his second termWhile the infusion of $500m into World Liberty Financial last year was a great deal for Trump and his family, it didn’t makemuch financial sensefor Tahnoon, the UAE royal who engineered the investment into a fledgling crypto firm that was doing little business before Trump took office. So what did the UAE get in return for its money?It seems the authoritarian monarchy got the keys to unlock the future of artificial intelligence. Tahnoon’s secret investment turned out to be one of two large transactions last year involving the Trump family’s crypto company and the UAE government. At a crypto conference in Dubai in May, Trump’s son Eric and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy to the Middle East),announced that MGX, another company chaired by Tahnoon, would invest $2bn using a stablecoin issued by World Liberty. A stablecoin is a type of digital currency that maintains a price of $1, and the MGX transaction could generate tens of millions of dollars ininterest revenuefor the president and his family each year.At the crypto convention, Zach Witkoff hailed the MGX deal as an endorsement of World Liberty’s capabilities as a tech startup. But hefailed to disclosethat the two companies shared major investors and were being led by some of the same executives. Tahnoon’s earlier $500m investment enabled him to name two members of World Liberty’s board – and those two directors also served on the MGX board, according to the Journal’s investigation.Two weeks after MGX’s $2bn investment in the Trump family’s crypto firm, the Trump administrationallowed the UAEto buy hundreds of thousands of advanced computer chips critical for AI development. The chips are made by US companies, especially Nvidia, and the Biden administration had restricted how many chips certain foreign countries can buy to prevent the technology from being misused. But Trumpscrappedthose restrictions.Some US national security officialsobjected to sellingadvanced chips to the UAE and worried that Emirati companies would share them with China, which could use the technology to enhance its military systems. In an investigation published in September, theNew York Times revealedthat the UAE’s negotiations with the Trump administration over access to AI chips involved Steve Witkoff and Tahnoon – and intersected with the Emirates’ investment in the Trump (and Witkoff) families’ crypto venture.The White House insists that there was no connection between the World Liberty crypto transaction and the administration’s decision to sell AI technology to the UAE – and claims that Trump and Witkoff have no conflict of interest because they have stepped aside from their family businesses. “The president has no involvement in business deals that would implicate his constitutional responsibilities,” the White House counsel, David Warrington,said on Sunday, after the latest revelations about the UAE royal’s investment in World Liberty. “President Trump performs his constitutional duties in an ethically sound manner, and to suggest so otherwise is either ill-informed or malicious.”While Trump’s aides argue that he’s living up to the highest ethical standards, the Republican-led Congress has shown little interest in investigating an astonishing series of corrupt actions and self-enrichment that would have devastated any other presidency. And as Trump and his family tally the expanding profits from their crypto empire, the rest of us must reckon with the cost to our democracy.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUnited Arab EmiratesTrump administrationCryptocurrenciesUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Why are her fans defending her?Tayo BeroThe Barbz have built a parasocial relationship with the rapper – in some cases to their own detrimentFri 6 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 08.01 ESTShareNicki Minajis back doing PR forDonald Trump, and it’s messier than ever. Last week, sheappeared at a treasury department summitin Washington DC to show support for Trump accounts, a new kind ofinvestment accountdesigned to “provide eligible American children with tax-advantaged investment accounts courtesy of President Donald J. Trump”, according to a government website.The most disappointing part of the rapper’s recent turn toward Maga, though, is how her stans – a significant portion of whom are Black and queer – areresponding. After the summit, Minaj’s followersdefendedher online and evenhelped pushTrump’s agenda. “In a society full of hate and division, supporting Nicki Minaj is reminding people to see past political differences and see the human in one another,” one supporter wrote. Oh brother. Minaj is a perfect example of the cult of celebrity, the dangers of modern fan culture and how celebrity worship can intersect with politics in truly dangerous ways.Everybody knows that Barbz, Minaj’s staunch fandom, go hard for her. They stood by her when she supported her brother who wasconvicted in 2017of raping a child (Minaj reportedlypaid his bailwhen he was arrested in 2015, visited him andput moneyon his inmate commissary), and when she wasaccusedofharassing and attempting to intimidatethe victim in her husband’s 1995 attempted rape conviction. (Minaj’s husband, Kenneth Petty,was convicted of first-degree attempted rape, and served about four years in prison. He was arrested in 2020 for failing to register as a sex offender in California, which brought the story back into public view. Jennifer Hough had sued both Minaj and Petty, and eventually dropped Minaj from the suit, but the claims against Petty are reportedlystill pending. Although she didn’t speak publicly about the suit, Minajfiled documentsin response to the suit that claimed Hough was lying for a payday.) And Barbz have stayed at the ready when it comes to the innumerableindustry beefsMinaj has been involved in. So now that she’s in her Maga era, why would that devotion look any different?Toxic fandomsare common, but what makes Barbz stand out from the others is how perfectly they mirror their idol. In building parasocial relationships that require them to be in total allegiance to Minaj, they also take on the worst parts of the rapper’s erratic, confrontational, petty, illogical and staunchly unaccountable personality.Beyoncé rarely speaks to fans outside carefully curated platforms, and Taylor Swift at least pretends to not influence what her fans are thinking. But Minajlivesonline, both feeding and exploiting the worst instincts of an audience that worships her. She hasmessaged her critics directlyand dangled the carrot of access in front of her followers via intimatediscussionsthat make them feel as if they are truly connected to her.The fact of the matter is, to remain in Minaj’s world, you simplycannot“cross” her without feeling thevenomous wrathof her fandom. And it seems that taking on her so-called enemies is one way Barbz stay connected to each other, andprove their loyaltyto the rapper.For some, being part of a fandom means more than just enjoying the creative product. And it seems like the communities and identities they’ve built around being a Barb are so deeply entrenched that defecting not only feels like a tall order (both socially and emotionally), but they’d also have to interrogate all the other ways they’ve supported her bad behavior, and have compromised their values just to remain in alignment with their icon.Sadder still is the fact that Minaj’s reckless political moves are only contributing to the dehumanization of the same supporters who are egging her on. Trump has spent years waging war on groups that many of her fans identify with, including queer, racialized and poor people.Minaj herself once criticized this same administration’s long-held anti-immigration stance, writing in a 2018 Instagrampostabout how she “came to this country as an illegal immigrant at five years old” and couldn’t “imagine the horror of being in a strange place and having [her] parents stripped away from [her]”.Well, she’s finally getting her citizenship, apparently, even if she had to sell out her own to do it. “Finalizing that citizenship paperwork as we speak as per MY wonderful, gracious, charming President,”she posted on X, bragging about the gold card Trump gifted to her.The Barbz’s approval of Trump, tacit and outright, via their support of Minaj means that they are both staying distracted from working toward their own liberation, and making themselves complicit in their own oppression.Mercurial, deeply self-involved and obsessed with her own public image, Minaj is the kind of personality that her fans need to keep in check; but she’s also exactly the kind of person you can’t. So Barbz continue to live in a buffoonish kingdom, while their emperor struts around with no clothes on.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsNicki MinajOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Ending the horror starts with abolishing ICEFri 6 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareIn a recentSaturday Night Liveepisode, when asked aboutMinneapolis, one of the white hostsintones: “Well, the first word that comes to mind is unprecedented. You’ve got federal officers roaming the streets just pulling people out of their cars based on how they look. This just doesn’t happen in America.” The joke is, of course, that “this” has been happening forever, but toBlackpeople in America. Now that it is happening to others, and particularly now thatwhiteprotesters are being killed in the streets, it is suddenly anational emergency.In his 1955 work Discourse on Colonialism, Aimé Césaire, the French poet and politician, argues that fascism was the result of bringing to bear on domestic populations the tactics European countries used on their colonial subjects in Africa. This is what has been called in the literature the “imperial boomerang thesis”. As many have been pointing out on social media and elsewhere, if we think of the US Black American population asan internally colonized population, then you can see what is happening on the streets of Minneapolis as a manifestation of the imperial boomerang thesis.Democrats have a constitutional power they aren’t using to fight back: state resolutions | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreIt is an old point in the literature on fascism that if you allow fascism somewhere – in Guantánamo Bay, in Israel, on the streets of American cities – it will soon leak out everywhere. As Ida B Wellsnotedin her 1892 book Southern Horrors: “They forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain crime … concedes the right to lynch any person for any crime.”Some commentators have taken the fact that the violence we are seeing is familiar in the US – arbitrary killings by legal authorities – to draw the conclusion that what we are seeing is not fascism, but just America as it always has been. But fascism is characteristically arbitrary legal practices applied outside of what had been a standard exception – in the case of the United States, that would be generalizing the arbitrary violence directed at Black populations to the population as a whole. Fascism feeds off exceptions to equal personhood, adopting practices honed on those considered lesser-than to apply to the regime’s political opponents. America has always been structured on exceptions to equal personhood. These exceptions laid the groundwork for the descent of the US into full-blown fascism.We can also not maintain that the situation ismerelythe expansion of America’s fascist practices directed against non-white populations to the population at large. Fascism brings with it anintensificationof the campaign against the exceptions, since it rips off the facade of pretense.We are seeing classical theories of fascism unfold in real timeRight now, the official state policy of the US government is white supremacy. We are in the phase of autocracy where the government isarresting journalists. And of course, the government is beginning this phase with publicly arrestingBlackjournalists. The regime has publicly targeted Black people in positions of power, as well assectors that employ large numbers of Black women. And of course, longstanding US targeting of non-white immigrants has escalated, with the regime spending billions to builda vast system of concentration camps.The terror campaign against Somali immigrants in Minneapolis and (it looks like) a coming pogrom against Haitian immigrants in Ohio will be opportunities to showcase the regime’s capacity to impose terror. Under fascism, everything becomes dramatically worse for everyone – including the working-class white families whose access to healthcare and other basic human rights are dramatically rolled back to pad the pockets of the dictator and his billionaire friends.Fascism harshly targets LGBTQ+ acceptance. Again, this works in steps. The campaign against trans acceptance was promoted in large part by mainstream media. But it was taken up as a central plank of the Trump campaign, and we can expect this “exception” to tolerance to be the springboard of a more widespread attack against the American LGBTQ+ community.We are seeing classical theories of fascism unfold in real time, as exceptions to liberal ideals are used as launchpads for a full-scale assault on the ideals themselves. This should also serve as a vindication of another analysis–the response to fascism must include the dismantling of the pre-existing structures that enabled and justified its rise.In other words, we cannot put the fires out one by one – the response to American fascism must necessarily involve addressing America’s longstanding legal violence directed against its Black population, chiefly in the form of mass incarceration (nine US states havehigher incarceration ratesthan every country in the world except El Salvador; the US state with the lowest incarceration rate still has an incarceration rate three times as high as Canada). And the most obvious immediate step to dismantle the pre-existing structure that brought us to this moment is to abolish ICE, and indeed the entire Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The DHS was founded in the wake of the terrorist attack on 9/11. It immediately began infringing on the civil rights of Muslim Americans. Any would-be autocrat with a modicum of imagination would recognize it as an ideal institution to employ against the civil rights ofallAmericans. The DHS must be abolished. Any politician who argues otherwise is complicit in the rise of American fascism.Jason Stanley is the Bissell-Heyd chair of American studies at the Munk School at the University of Toronto.

Never forget thatMoira DoneganTheir ‘pro-family’ rhetoric is a cynical and hollow shamFri 6 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.07 ESTShareOf the 3,800 children and infants taken into immigration custody between January and October of 2025, a majority – 2,600 – were detained by ICE officers. That means that the children, as young as one or two years old, were not arrested at the border or legal ports of entry, where asylum seekers frequently present themselves to border officers, but inside the country.That means that those children were not new arrivals seeking help; they were kids going about their daily lives in the US, often with legal status. They were children likeLiam Conejo Ramos, aged five, who was snatched from his driveway after school by immigration agents while wearing a blue bunny hat to keep him warm in the Minnesota cold. They are children like one student, a 17-year-old from Liam’s school district in Minnesota, who was taken fromtheir car, or the other child, a 10-year-old girl in the fourth grade, who was taken alongsideher mother; or the two other boys, brothers in the second and fifth grades, who were delivered by school officials to an ICE detention center after their mother was arrested and taken there. She hadcalled the schoolto ask them to bring her boys to her in the prison; there was no one else to take care of them.Some would count that family lucky to be able to stay together. The truth of the mass deportation agenda pursued by theTrump administrationis that family separation is now a matter of course, both in the immigration detention facilities themselves and as a byproduct of the roundups of ordinary people, many with legal status and most with no criminal record, that follows ICE’s arrival in an unlucky city.Families with mixed immigration status are torn apart as fathers, mothers, brothers and aunts are swept into a vast network of detention centers, whisked far from their homes and loved ones quickly, moved repeatedly from one detention center to another, or warehoused in dirty, crowded facilities under horrific conditions for weeks or months until they finally relent and sign their own deportation orders. Scared families often have little information about what has become of their loved ones after an ICE or border patrol arrest; they may call in vain, navigating sterile phone trees and ill-staffed hotlines trying to find out where their loved ones are. As the days go by, children are deprived of the presence of their parents or caretakers; husbands are made to languish without their wives; mothers grieve the absence of their children.Those who are left behind have to muddle along, carrying their fear and grief as they work to make ends meet among strained and worsened circumstances. The capture and imprisonment of parents or spouses often means that families are missing not only the presence of their beloved one, but also that person’s much-needed paycheck. With fewer people in a family, childcare becomes more difficult; so do errands, eldercare and housework. This is all to say nothing of the reality that many of those immigrants may fear that the same fate that befell their loved ones will fall on them, too. Reports on the ground in Minnesota suggest that many people from targeted communities areafraid to leavetheir homes, even to go to work; afraid to walk their children to school; afraid to buy groceries. They stay inside as virtual prisoners as the masked, armed men roam the streets.Amid the tragedy of these broken families and warped lives, there is a distinct irony: the people tearing these loved ones apart are often the very same people who have spent so much of the past several years lecturing the American people, and in particular American women, about the importance of parenthood and family.It was Vice-President JD Vance who routinely derided American women who did not have children as “childless cat ladies” whose lives were less worthy and less meaningful. When asked if he wanted to apologize to the family of Alex Pretti – including his mother, Susan Pretti, who had a child and has now seen that child ripped away from her by ICE – Vance grinningly asked: “For what?”It was Donald Trump who courted the pro-natalists, a group of pro-birth advocates who express alarm at their view that American women are not having enough babies, and it is his administration that has stolen babies like Liam Conejo Ramos from the arms of their mothers. It was the Trump administration that appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court, all of whom voted to overturn Roe v Wade and compel women to give birth. And now it is the Trump administration that locks up those mothers, snatches away their children, and destroys, over and over again, that circle of belonging that it claims to cherish: the family.Is it too obvious to say that the brutal separations of wives from husbands, sons from mothers, sisters from brothers that is evidenced in the Trump immigration crackdown gives the lie to the right’s claims to champion love, parenthood and family?Is it too obvious to say that of course the right only values family as a system of ownership and property, only values motherhood as a way to push women from public life and into relationships of dependence and subordination, only values babies and births when they are white babies and white births, meant to reproduce the nation as they imagine it?Is it too obvious to say that this administration’s actions are an insult to love, to marriage, to parenthood, and brotherhood, and family; that they vulgarize the honor and beauty of these connections by appropriating them for projects of violence and exclusion?Perhaps it is too obvious: perhaps this is all beyond saying. There is a term, after all, for what it is called when two little children are delivered to their mother in jail because that is the only place where they can be with her. It is not “family values”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionRepublicansICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

As far as I am able, I will play my partFormer prime minister ‘deeply regrets’ bringing Mandelson into his governmentFri 6 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareIn Jeffrey Epstein’s wider circle, women and girls were treated as less than human by powerful men acting far beyond the law. The sexual trafficking plotted by him and his fellow criminals is the most egregious example of a global network of wealthy and powerful men that thinks it can act with impunity. Nothing less than a century-defining rebalancing of power and accountability is equal to this moment and the trauma of the victims. This scandal is primarily about them and their pain.But as I digest the details of what has emerged, I also find it hard to find words to express my revulsion at what has been uncovered about Epstein and his impact on our politics. During the financial crisis, I wanted every moment of every day to be spent doing everything that could be done to save people’s homes, savings, pensions and jobs. That a member of the cabinet at the time was thinking more of himself and his rich friends is a betrayal of everything we stand for as a country. That theleaks of sensitive informationwere going to someone we now know was the ringmaster of a cabal of abusers and enablers sickens me.In the weeks and months to come, we must find ways to rebuild trust. Yet trust in politics, once dented, is difficult to repair. And so, as thepolice investigate Peter Mandelson amid allegationsof financial and political misconduct, indeed criminality, politicians have a herculean task to persuade people that they act in the public interest and not only self-interest. Already,two-thirds of the British publicbelieve that politicians are out primarily for themselves. The grim truth is that unless something fundamental changes, this week’s revelations will be acid in our democracy, corroding trust still further.We in Britain must face uncomfortable facts. Every few years, our country has suffered a major scandal that shakes us to the core but from which lessons are never fully learned: the Profumo affair of the 1960s, the “brown envelopes” sleaze of the 1980s, the MPs’ expenses affair of the 2000s, the Boris Johnson Partygate excesses of the early 2020s and now the Mandelson affair.I have to take personal responsibility for appointing Mandelson to his ministerial role in 2008. I greatly regret this appointment. I made it at the end of his four years as the UK’s European commissioner on trade. I was informed that his record in the role was unblemished and there were no reports of a relationship with anyone named Epstein. No one could say I promoted him out of favouritism. I did so in spite of him being anything but a friend to me, because I thought that his unquestioned knowledge of Europe and beyond could help us as we dealt with the global financial crisis. I now know that I was wrong.He seems to have used market-sensitive inside informationto betray the principles in which he said he believed, and he betrayed the people who believed in them – and him.His activities, which his own emails have brought into the public arena, do not only show his duplicity. They force us to examine how easy it is in our country to trade secrets – for wealth to gain access to power, how backdoor routes to decision-makers can be covered up, how lobbying for financial gain can circumvent well-meaning but insipid rules and how our laws seem tohave failed to catch up with corruption. The case is now unanswerable for comprehensive and immediate action to clean up our politics with new rules for politicians and public servants, as well as powerful new institutions and checks to enforce them.Just after the Johnson scandals, at the request of Keir Starmer,I chaired a review of our constitutionwhose report included recommendations on standards in public life. And because he commissioned and subsequently approved all of it, the prime minister is in the best position to lead its full implementation.To his credit, some of its recommendations are already being put in place –tightening the codeon ministerial behaviour, reforming electoral laws toban foreign moneyand reducing thesuffocating overcentralisationof Whitehall – but he will be the first to agree that we must now move much faster and further.First, we need an independent anti-corruption commission to be appointed by parliament, with the commissioner given the remit and power in law, as our review promised, to root out any criminality in UK political life by detecting and punishing it wherever and whenever it occurs. And to remove all doubt as to our determination, parliament should be quite specific in naming “corruption” a new statutory offence, as theLaw Commission has proposedand Transparency International has sought in the public office (accountability) bill going through parliament. The anti-corruption champion, Margaret Hodge, has done her best with a limited remit, but the commissionershould have statutory powers of search and seizure and access to bank records, and all public bodies should be required to fully cooperate.Australia has led the wayin introducing such an agency and that can be a blueprint for rapid reform.Proper behaviour in public life is, however, more than simply the absence of suspicious money.The Nolan committee in 1995laid down the underlying principles that should govern public life and public service, but the mechanisms for enforcing these have proved seriously wanting.We needthe new ethics and integrity commission– which replaced the committee on standards in public life in October 2025 – to be placed on a statutory basis, as it supersedes the current hotchpotch of standards commissioners and ethics advisers. At the moment, it is only advisory andhasno powers to investigate individual cases, impose penalties or enforce its conclusions. It should be empowered to take a proactive role in investigating all alleged breaches of the various codes for ministers and MPs. An updated MPs’ code of conduct, which should also have a statutory footing, should include a general prohibition on MPs’ second jobs – with only a few exceptions required to maintain professional memberships, such as inmedicine. Through the innovation of citizens’ juries – as promised by the Labour manifesto – there should be a greater role for the public in deciding and enforcing the rules to be followed by politicians.Questions have been raisedabout the awarding of contracts, not just in the wake of the many Covid PPE scandals, but in relation to lobbying by a company co-founded by Mandelson, Global Counsel (whose overseas activities led to newadvice on transparencybeing issued in 2025), and other firms. Transparency International reports that less than 4% of lobbyists are covered by the hastily concocted 2014 Lobbying Act. A report,No Rules Britannia, in April 2025 stated that we are the western world’s least transparent country. Conventions about commercial confidentiality should no longer prevent public service contracts delivered by private companies being subject to reasonable freedom of information requests.It is no accident that in both theMichelle Moneand Mandelson cases, the spotlight has fallen on the House of Lords. Its membership contains many good and great public servants beyond reproach. But without greater accountability and a fully adequate statutory lobbying register akin to those in Germany, Canada, the US and France, the Lords’ 50 known lobbyists and the 91 memberswho are paid for their political adviceform a section of our lawmakers that reminds me of the old rotten boroughs. Too many peers have second, third or fourth jobs, some of them employed under the radar because of a suspiciously lenient system for the declaration of conflicts of interest. I believe that we are one false declaration away from yet another scandal. Reform of the Lords, therefore, cannot stop at removing a few hereditary peers and expelling those guilty of crime.In the absence of the most desirable outcome that I and the Labour commission support – the replacement of the Lords by an elected second chamber – we need immediate action to exclude lobbyists and to mandate rigorous standards of disclosure. Proper declaration of interests should be required also by those appointed to the privy council, and five years is a more appropriate delay than the currenttwo yearsfor former ministers lobbying or doing private business in areas where they clearly have inside knowledge of undoubted commercial value.This week’s events show why it is also imperative that the government bring in a fully accountable system for vetting major appointments such as those of Mandelson, and one that allows public scrutiny. Before the first world war, an incoming minister had to immediately put himself up for re-election as a constituency MP as a condition of taking up government office. A minister making executive decisions was seen as different from a legislator scrutinising them. It is because we have had since then no satisfactory means of vetting ministerial or other major appointments that mistakes are so easily made.The way forward is to hold parliamentary hearings, similar to those in the US Senate, for newly appointed ministers to ensure the right questions are asked and answered in public about present and past interests and conduct. We already have formal parliamentary hearings for new members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. It is a system of formal vetting that should extend at a minimum to senior ambassadors. If it had been in place last year, it would have led to a very different ambassadorial appointmentNone of these changes can be guaranteed to prevent a determined individual from betraying our country. But we owe it to the victims of abuse, whose moving accounts have triggered current investigations, that our every action is now determined by the effort to prevent the powerful acting with impunity against the powerless. Without delay, the prime minister can do what he has always wanted to do: legislate for a new era of transparency, putting in place the strongest possible safeguards to prevent misbehaviour and to ensure proper accountability if misconduct happens. The time is overdue to let in the light – and send the princes of darkness on their way.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the crowd were old folks, babies in arms, toddlers in prams, gathering peacefully as our families do every year on our National Day of Mourning.The Western Australian police say he threw a fragment bomb containing screws and ball-bearings, the kind designed to send shrapnel flying and cause maximum damage. It is due to luck and presumably the incompetence of the bomb-maker that it did not explode.It was a bomb. We can say that now. Not an “alleged” bomb, not a “bomb scare” or an “incident” involving a “homemade device”. Now that the man has been charged with a terror offence, the media – where it has chosen to pay attention to the story – can finally drop the quote marks and use direct language.First Nations communities have been asking why it took nine days for this charge to be laid. And why it happened after sustained pressure from our leadership and allies, including independent media and the handful of First Nations journalists working in the mainstream, who have spent the past 10 days reporting on an attempted terror attack on their own people and keeping the story alive, while at other outlets the news of a bomb in the Perth CBD barely ruffled their hair.The police, state and federal governments say they took this incident seriously. The man was arrested on site. Initially, the man was charged with committing an unlawful act with the intent to harm and with making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances – criminal charges. Critics said this was not enough to reflect the seriousness of the incident. What they saw was minimisation, the use of euphemism and legal sophistry to hose down the importance of the matter and our anxieties about it.He was refused bail, but his duty lawyer successfully argued for his identity to be suppressed, saying there was concern that “if (the accused) was identified as the person facing allegations his safety in a custodial environment would be at risk.” Because so many of our people are in jail? Coded language for sure.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAfter the terror and the anger came rising frustration at the silence of those in power, who had otherwise been so vocal on the matter of racist violence of late. We saw the hallmarks of official denial – minimisation, euphemism and passive language, public indifference – that we see unfold when Aboriginal lives are at stake. We saw the kind of passive not-knowing that Australia is very good at when it comes to Indigenous people and history. Thelate US sociologist Stanley Cohenonce said that “denial is built into the ideological façade of the state” and that is the truth here.“The social conditions that give rise to atrocities merge into the official techniques for denying these realities – not just to observers, but even to the perpetrators themselves,” Cohen said. That is how Australians can cling to the idea that these acts of terror “are not who we are”.This is a low point in Australia’s long history of colonial terrorism against Indigenous people. Land theft, massacres, poisonings, forced assimilation, child removals, missing and murdered women and children, mass incarceration: genocide. Our survival, our resilience, our joy in our families and communities coming together is the whole point of the annual rally on 26 January. To strike at the heart of that is a hate crime.How useful an Indigenous voice to parliament would be at a time like thisPeople saw a stark difference in attention and empathy at the unsuccessful bombing at Boorloo. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe told the ABC she felt there had been “double standards” in the response. Thorpe put a successful motion to the Senate, to condemn “an act of horrific, overt hate and racism”.“What followed was the quieter, insidious thrum of the entrenched, systemic racism that shapes this country,” Thorpe told the Senate. “Decisions were made – in newsrooms, in ministerial offices, in the daily rhythms of power – about whether this was urgent. Whether it mattered. Whether our lives mattered.”Racism was real and rising, she said, and she had never seen it so bad.“This motion is … about condemning hate and racism consistently, no matter who the victim is or what colour their skin is.”After the man was initially charged, warnings circulated on social media not to post anything that would endanger the investigation, identify the man at the centre of it, or jeopardise the work of the police. This was of course necessary. But people were being asked to once again contain their feelings of fear, anger and despair while hoping for the police to do their job. It was a big ask, in a climate of indifference and denial, to expect Indigenous people to trust the police at all, let alone trust that an investigation would yield results.Authorities spentnine days investigating the accused man’s motives. On 5 February a bulging press conference held by the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, police commissioner, Col Blanch, Australian federal police commissioner, Krissy Barrett, andIndigenous Australiansminister, Malarndirri McCarthy, announced that he was being charged with one count of engaging in a terrorist act, the first time this charge has been laid in WA.“This charge … alleges the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology,” Cook said. Politicians condemned the act. We stand with you, they said. It was meant to show that justice is being done, or is being seen to be done.But it’s past time for governments to do something about the fact that Indigenous communities are extremely vulnerable to ongoing racist violence, now coming from radicalised members of the public.In August last year, about 40 men dressed in black, some armed with flagpoles and sticks and led by known neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, violently attacked Camp Sovereignty in Naarm Melbourne, injuring four people. Sewell and six others were charged. Sewell was initially denied bail and held injail but then released on bail in November.Our communities have been warning that racist violence has been on the rise, especially since the failed referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament (and how useful such a voice would be now, at a time like this. A special envoy, if you like).In the wake of the Perth attack, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, Katie Kiss, said the hatred on social media against Indigenous people is “so visible, so constant”, but her commission’s National Anti-Racism Framework, handed to the government in 2024, was just gathering dust.On Friday, the organisers of the Perth rally called for the federal government to expand the terms of reference for the royal commission into antisemitism to cover all forms of racism and far-right extremism. They asked that the government urgently endorse and implement the Australian Human Rights Commission’s anti-racism framework. This problem is nationwide and it affects us all.As Lidia Thorpe said in parliament this week: “The bomb thankfully did not detonate. It could have caused many deaths. Our elders say it was the protection of our ancestors present through ceremony, holding our people when the worst was intended.“It was a deliberate act of hate directly targeting First Peoples on our day of mourning.”Lorena Allam is descended from the Gamilaraay and Yawalaraay nations of north-west NSW and was the Guardian’s Indigenous affairs editor.

But as a dead medium, DVDs make a more abstract statement: a collection suggests an ongoing commitment to physical media – the film equivalent of a record collection – but DVDs have come and gone, superseded in quality and accessibility.Yet even with the world of streaming at our fingertips, if offered a DVD shelf we will happily peruse it like in Blockbuster stores of yore, whether it belongs to a friend, parent or a total stranger from Airbnb. The limitations of a finite collection offer more choice than an endless scroll. They’re recommended, not by an algorithm, but by the person who thought these films were worth keeping. Putting on a DVD, or a CD or LP, requires a physical action and stopping or changing it requires another – you have to commit to your choice.Do we need Imax? 70mm? VistaVision? All I need to watch movies at the cinema is darkness and quiet | Larry RyanRead moreIt might seem strange to lump DVDs and CDs in with other obsolete technologies, since these digital formats signalled the beginning of the end for physical media. They might not be welcome at its funeral, but they have their place in the pantheon of obsolete technologies; forgotten but not quite gone. And as many of us head to the final resting place of outdated tech (our parents’ houses), these dead technologies deserve their day in the sun.My affection for outdated technologies go well beyond media: the stovetop coffee maker, the old Sunbeam MixMaster and the phone simply used to make a call. As the world becomes more atomised there is comfort in the familiar. There’s also the inevitable, “they don’t make them like they used to” argument (and they don’t), but for me the appeal of older gadgets is all about tangibility. As the world is streamlined into integrated touchscreen devices, there is a joy to the clunky, tactile process of using technological unitaskers.There is satisfaction in pressing a button or cranking a dial that no touchscreen will ever replicate. There is also certainty; if I reach for my car’s temperature control, I know it will be there, without taking my eyes off the road to click through six sub-menus. If I want to watch a film, the DVD can’t disappear from my shelf without notice. And as neat as a Switch is, can it really compare to smacking a cartridge into a Nintendo 64 and grappling with the unwieldy three-pronged controller?View image in fullscreenGoldeneye 007 was a popular game in the 1990s used in the Nintendo 64 – or N64 – video game console.Photograph: Maurice Savage/AlamyBrian Eno wrote in his diary in 1995 that, “whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature …these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided”. In an era of frictionless digital experiences, it is friction itself that becomes precious. The act of loading a record on to a turntable, lowering the needle and being forced to listen all the way through, no matter how badly you want to skip. When you have to sit through a song you hate, you have to think about why you hate it, rather than just breezing by.That very difficulty is the point – we’ve made a world so seamless that to have to get up and flip a record or fiddle with a radio dial makes you into part of the process. A broken piece of analogue tech can usually be fixed with a tape, WD-40 or physical violence, but a dead digital gadget is beyond salvation.And for all its promises of frictionless-ness, the Screen Era has also invented its own unique frustrations. The pain of typing search terms into a smart TV with a remote, one agonising letter at a time. We have all the music available in the world, but it’s harder for new artists to break through. There are also far more serious concerns that replacing physical buttons with touchscreen in cars distracts drivers, andsome researchers estimatethat using a car’s touchscreen is more distracting than drink-driving.The landline may be having a renaissance – but it’s to a world in which the art of phone calls has changed | Paul DaleyRead moreIs older tech easier to use? No. Can the quality compare? Usually not. Is it reliable? No, but it’s unreliable in a predictable way – my mother’s 40-year-old soldering iron bravely solders on, provided it’s plugged into a dimmer switch to control the temperature.In our endlessly updated age, there is also a sense of rest that comes with obsolescence. There are no new Walkmans, or Game Boys or landline phones, so the ones that cling on haven’t changed. If you knew how to use it once, you know how to use it now.Sure, the friction of older technology is still friction – but at the heart of friction is interaction. There is victory in getting life out of a CD or button mashing your way to a Mario Kart triumph.It may take a physical action to crank the volume of your car stereo, but that action is satisfying as hell.Tansy Gardam is a writer, critic and podcasterExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionAustralian lifestyleCollectingBlu-rayFilm industryMusic streamingcommentShareReuse this content"

Now that’s in dangerNosheen IqbalLed by women, queer-friendly, diverse: this model can break so many boundaries. But if we lose spaces to meet in, it can't happenFri 6 Feb 2026 08.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 08.43 ESTShareSomething quietly profound happened last Ramadan. In a year when the war on Gaza hardened public debate into camps, when half the UK was found to believe that Islam – and therefore Muslims – to beincompatible with British values, when the general volume of Islamophobia was ratcheted several notches higher by Reform UK’s rise in the polls, hundreds of Muslim Londoners gathered every night to build the kind of community and connection we were told had been decimated. Lost to whatever the flavour of blame is at the moment: doomscrolling, the telly streamers, individualism promoted by late-stage capitalism, a society fractured by the cost of living.For a month, Muslims came together in the capital and put on iftars, the evening meal that breaks the day’s fast, that reflected the world we want to live in: inclusive, often female-led and queer-friendly, properly diverse, rooted in generosity. A community without judgment, formed outside mosques, free from the performative piety Olympics. Which all sounds deeply earnest, but believe me when I tell you that these were some of the most vibey events I went to last year.Communities such asRamadan Space, grown on WhatsApp, negotiated a venue in Shoreditch and put onsold-out nights all month long. These became regular rituals for some, a wholesome bit of eat-pray-love that, as one hijabi student told me, felt “like oxygen” at a time when it felt difficult to come up for air. TheInclusive Mosque Initiativeput on feminist prayers in a south London church. A friend launchedShukr, bringing together London’s Muslim creatives at the top of180 The Strand. (In attendance: rappers Krept and Konan, and the mayor of London.)Another friend hostedFaith & Flow, a wellness workshop mixing movement with meditation.Palestine Housequickly became a central destination for everything from political solidarity to spiritual Sufidhikrs.Hulm Club, a Muslim coworking space for techies, opened its doors in Farringdon.Rumi’s Cavein north-west London, a hub like no other, fed hundreds of vulnerable, homeless and isolated members of the local community via Rumi’s Kitchen. Buzzy new interfaith ideas and venues –Karrom Club,Kismet Cafe– were born from that energy. And through it all: charity, fundraising, volunteering. Allcentral tenetsin a month that’s about compassion and empathy.It doesn’t take a sociologist to point out the importance of third spaces like these, and the social and cultural benefits of spontaneous meet-ups, of breaking bread with people from different backgrounds. There is a hunger for meaning and purpose among young Muslims who are doing things differently from their elders in a way I find far more inspiring and encouraging than what much of my generation did. To be clear,Ramadanhas always been about community coming together, about family iftars and leaning into your most spiritual, introspective self. But last year was different. Breaking from traditions, it felt fresh, open – and desperately necessary.London can often feel harsh and transactional but,like New York, its dynamism and creativity comes from the margins. From people pulling it out of the bag with the DIY punk spirit that has always been key to influencing the wider culture.This is Muslim New York: artists, thinkers and politicos on defining a new era for the cityRead moreWhich is why news that Ramadan Space’s venue has pulled out this year feels so crushing. At the time of writing, the physical space to gather won’t happen this year. Its founding committee is desperately trying to secure a different spot – any generous benefactors please step forward – but it’s a huge blow for those of us trying to create something at the grassroots.Does this matter? Perhaps it’s tempting to view the cancellation as a logistical hiccup or an admin problem for a minority of Muslims who make up a scene on the fringes. But that misses the point that what comes under threat is a model of belonging that so many from all backgrounds say they want to see, and that Londoners desperately need.There is endless talk about cohesion and resilience, about mental-health crises andloneliness epidemics, about us living in polarised, divided times. What sense does it make to allow the very spaces that soften those hard edges to disappear?Ramadan is coming again, we’re less than two weeks out, and I know what kind of Ramadan I want. Community doesn’t just happen. It is made, night after night, by people choosing to be together. On any day, in any month, we should be doing everything we can to make space for that, not the polar opposite.Nosheen Iqbal is the host of the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcastDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After all, for those of us who need a degree to enter their field of employment and don’t have the family finances to sail us through, it doesn’t matter how unfair the system becomes: student loans are a trap we have little choice but to fall into.Ignoring the problem has, however, become impossible over the past week, as a public spat between the financial adviserMartin Lewis and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over a hidden detail in November’s budget kicked off a fierce debate about the fairness of our student loans system. Almost 6 million people on plan 2 loans, which were taken out by students from England who started university between September 2012 and July 2023, and students from Wales who have started since September 2012, will now be facing higher repayments after Reeves took the decision to freeze the salary threshold until 2030.The change has tapped into a mounting frustration that it is those already struggling who end up footing the bill, while those with the broadest shoulders waltz away scot-free. The myth that was constantly drilled into me growing up – that anything is possible if you work hard enough – once again finds itself faced with the ugly realities of modern Britain.It’s not as if students were lacking bad news before this; thanks to AI, entry-level job opportunities arerapidly disappearing, with hundreds of applicants for a single role now commonplace. Annual increases in England in tuition feesin line with inflation, along with soaring rents across major cities, are already stacking up the immediate costs of university.For young people, the decision of whether to go to university has in large part been influenced by three factors: the upfront costs, the long-term burden and future job opportunities. The UK is reaching a point of no return in all three respects. When friends complain about rent swallowing their student loans or being forced to choose between attending lectures and clocking into work, who can say with any confidence this situation is temporary, or that it will be worth it in the end?Those in power like to claim that this is just a small change, and that they’ve been left withno other choice. But the reality is we’ve been facing deteriorating terms and conditions ever since the introduction of tuition fees in 1998. Now, every time the government makes the system worse for students, we can’t help but wonder: what’s coming next?Lewis rightly observes the current changes to loan repayments are “not moral”, but he remains under the misguided assumption that this government is remotely interested in morality at all. Only six years ago, Keir Starmer himselfproclaimedthat he would “end the national scandal of spiralling student debt and abolish tuition fees”, while Reeves sat for three years as shadow chancellor of an opposition whoseofficial policywas the abolition of tuition fees. Today not only does this government not support abolition, not only has it made the system harsher for students and graduates than it was under the Tories, but it now has the audacity to proclaim it was “fair and reasonable” all along.The reality is that rather than being treated like the future of the country’s economic growth and social development, students have long been regarded as bottom of the priority list by successive governments of all stripes. They are terrified of taking a swipe at pensioners, who can be relied upon to make their displeasure felt at the ballot box, and so view young people as easy pickings when it comes to budgets. Britain is not alone in this generational warfare. In France last year,there was a periodin which the average pensioner was earning more than the average person in full-time employment. As countries across the western world age, governments are increasingly ignoring the collapsing conditions for their young people, further alienating them from the political system. And although this is certainly bad news for young people, in the long term it’s going to hurt everybody else as well – a society that refuses to invest in its future is a society creating the conditions for its own decline.Once upon a time, Labour may have been able to brush the matter under the rug, relying on the fact that young people had nowhere else to go. However, the rise of parties to its left should give it reason for pause. The upcomingbyelection in Gorton and Denton, an area seen as one of Labour’s heartlands, now has the Greens (and not Reform UK) as the bookies’ favourites, propelled by a notable percentage of disaffected graduates and students. Last November, as Reeves publicised her new attacks on students and graduates, the Young Greensannouncedthat they had become the largest youth and student wing of any party in the UK, taking the crown from Young Labour, which has seen membership fall consistently since the Corbyn years. Some might hope that a defeat to the Greens, who oppose tuition fees, could send a message to Westminster and help encourage a U-turn on government policy. But I wouldn’t hold your breath. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this Labour government, it’s that they’re not particularly fond of listening.Rohan Sathyamoorthy is a 20-year-old writer from south-west LondonExplore more on these topicsTuition feesOpinionHigher educationStudentsRachel ReevesLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Unless lessons are learned, the Greens could do the sameFri 6 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 08.16 ESTShareIn three weeks, the people of Gorton and Denton willhead to the pollsfor their byelection. And the rest of the UK will be watching. The attention given to this vote will be huge. The main talking points are the verdict it gives on Keir Starmer’s premiership, the decision to stop Andy Burnham standing, Reform UK potentially taking the seat and the Greens being the current favourites. It is both an important election in its own right, and a microcosm of the biggest political questions facing the country.Given the state of flux that politics seems to be in, you might think it would be hard to predict what is going to happen. Luckily, there is a very good indicator of what we can expect: at the end of October, there was a byelection in the Welsh parliament seat of Caerphilly – the similarities between that vote and Gorton and Denton are stark.Both areas had been safe Labour seats for a long time (though Gorton and Denton and its boundaries were created for the last election, its previous forms have been mainly Labour). Both were set against the backdrop of a deeply unpopular Labour government (in Caerphilly’s case, it was the Welsh Labour government in Cardiff Bay). And in both, Reform committed huge resources towards winning the seat. And finally, in both cases a left-of-centre partybesidesLabour appeared to have the best chance of stopping Reform. In Caerphilly, it was Plaid Cymru, which won. In Gorton, the Greens’early polling numbers are strong.I will never forget sitting in the count at Caerphilly on 23 October last year. Nigel Farage had been swanning around the area all day ready for the coronation of his picked man, Llŷr Powell (whom Farage calls “Welsh Dave” because Llŷr is seemingly too hard). When it became clear that Reform was coming second, Farage was straight back down the M4.There are lessons in what happened in Caerphilly ahead of the Gorton and Denton vote. The first is a brutal lesson that Labour is about to learn the hard way – once you are no longer the best vehicle for stopping the right, a lot of people you counted on as supporters leave. In Caerphilly,Plaid Cymruwent from 28% of the vote in 2021 to 47% in 2025. Labour, by contrast, went from 46% to just 11%. A large part of this swing towards Plaid was because it was seen as the best way to stop Reform getting in.In the 2024 general election, much of Labour’s support was based on getting the Tories out, rather than any great love of Starmer. In Gorton, the bookies seem to think that the Greens are the favourites, followed by Reform. Though no poll has put them in the lead yet,Labourneeds to be incredibly wary of this narrative developing. If it permeates into people’s consciousness that if you want to stop Reform, you need to vote Green, Labour is in big trouble. This was exactly what drove such huge numbers for Plaid in Caerphilly and that “we are the only way to stop Reform” message is now central to Plaid Cymru’s campaign ahead of May’s Senedd election.Asecond lesson is that high spending doesn’t automatically equal victory. In Caerphilly, Labour spent £98,000 trying to avoid the party’s first parliamentary defeat in the area in decades. Reform spent £96,000. Plaid spent just £47,000. Labour spent more than £26 for every vote it got, whereas Plaid spent just £3. It is worth taking a second to also reflect that however much money you spend, if it’s spent wastefully it won’t help you.Labour spent £25,000 on Airbnbsincluding some in Hirwaun. If you are not au fait with the geography, that is 50 minutes’ drive from Caerphilly …13:48Why this Manchester byelection is a lesson in 21st century politics – videoThird,Labour must learn to not treat the voters as idiots divorced from reality. During the campaign inWales, the Labour candidate called on people to vote for his party in order to “save our libraries”. There were indeed proposed library closures in the area. They were proposed by the Labour council. So we ended up in the farcical situation where a Labour candidate wanted to get elected to a Labour-run Senedd, to tell a Labour-run council to spend UK Labour-provided money, to not close libraries that that very same Labour council was trying to close. People simply didn’t buy it.In Gorton, it will be a Labour candidate in an area already run by a Labour mayor. Don’t fall into the trap of saying you are a change candidate when your party is literally already running everything.Finally, there is turnout. While byelections are often associated with low turnout, when people feel it matters, they get out and vote. The drive by people on the left to stop Reform led to a turnout higher than in the previous election. In Caerphilly in 2021, it was under 44% whereas this time around it was 50.4%! This is more than the average for the whole of Wales in 2021. Any strategy that relies on this upcoming election looking like previous byelections will get it wrong.Starmer has little to offer voters of either right or left in Gorton and Denton. That’s why he’s facing a perfect storm | Owen JonesRead moreThe stakes are very high. We saw in Caerphilly how defeat can make parties on the hard right of politics such as Reform lose interest. The likes of Nigel Farage base much of their persona on the idea that they are infallible winners. What Caerphilly showed was that he and his party can be beaten handily. Since then, Reform’s interest in Wales has fallen significantly. I see this in its messaging and direct conversations with people within the party. These byelections can stop the first domino from falling.And whatever the result,if Keir Starmer takes one thing from both Caerphilly and Gorton, it needs to be about the voting system. The archaic dog mess that is first-past-the-post needs to be ditched. It allows outright majorities based on a minority of voters. In a bitterly divided society, a system that bakes in outright victory to the party that loses the least just forces us all further down the spiral of division. Voters should be able to vote for whom they want, not feel obliged to vote for the person best placed to stop the extremists.Will they learn these lessons? Starmer’s Labour has been many things but introspective doesn’t seem to be one of them. If he fails to learn this lesson, his party faces being crushed under the rubble of its own “red wall”.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

He died on 3 February 2026Fri 6 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 03.13 ESTShareDear reader, for the first time since I became a journalist, I have to tell you I wish you weren’t reading what I’ve written. Because if you’re reading this, it means I’m no longer in this world – or any other. I’ve died. Shit, it’s hard to write this, but that’s the way it is. I’ve died, and I don’t want to leave without saying goodbye and sharing a few final thoughts.I’ve been a very fortunate person. I was fortunate to have been born in a European country that, although still under the yoke of Franco’s regime, very soon afterwards began to progress economically, socially and politically. Luck, and it was only luck, made my destiny infinitely easier than that of hundreds of millions of children who are born in regions of the world ravaged by hunger, poverty and war.Even in this difficult moment I’m going through, I don’t think I have the right to complain or to moan about my lot. How can I play the victim knowing these historical inequalities and injustices? How can I lament my fate when we see what is happening even now, in Africa, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Yemen, Iran or in Palestine? I can’t say for sure, but I imagine that my last thought – the last image that passes through my mind before I shut down – will be of the children massacred in Gaza and of the surviving Palestinians who face a terrible future. What I do know is that I will leave this world without understanding why the international community chose to remain impassive while Israel perpetrated a genocide right before its eyes, broadcast live, minute by minute, massacre by massacre.View image in fullscreenCarlos Hernández de Miguel in 2015.Photograph: ChernandezdemiguelI decided to become a journalist because I truly believed that by reporting rigorously and honestly, we could improve this world. I still believe it now. I know that in my professional career I have made mistakes, I have put up with things (I hope only a few) that I should have rejected, and I have not, by any means, been a perfect journalist. Despite all that, I can look back and what I see doesn’t trouble me. I can say I have never, ever lied, manipulated, or concealed information. In all my reporting, whether from Madrid, Bilbao, Seville, Kabul, Jerusalem or Baghdad, I have tried to hold those in power to account, I have tried to relate what was happening, and I have tried to give a voice to those who lacked one. Voices for the victims; criticism for the perpetrators. No neutrality. No ambiguity. And that’s why I’m especially proud of not having risen as high as I could have. I was even fired for trying to remain true to my principles.I learned, from veteran colleagues, what I consider to be the two principles of journalism. The first is that objectivity is not the same as neutrality. If there is an aggressor and a victim, a liar and an honest person, a corrupt individual and an honourable one, then your task is to describe all that clearly and forcefully. I’m sick of those who believe that being a journalist means reporting both sides’ versions, without filters, without challenging their veracity, especially – and this is worse and all too common – when you know that one side isn’t telling the truth.The second principle is that to be a good journalist, it’s vital that you’re a good person.I always add a third. Journalism is not just another profession. Society’s right to be well informed rests on our work. Freedom, equality and democracy depend on our work – albeit not exclusively. So there are no excuses for lying or concealing information. If we do, we should be held professionally, and even criminally, responsible.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises in Gaza after an explosion, 7 July 2025.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersI’ve been fortunate to have experienced politics from both the inside and the outside. If there’s something I’ve learned, it’s that no, not all politicians are the same. There are men and women who truly believe their mission is to improve the quality of life of all citizens, regardless of whether those citizens voted for them.Obviously, there are also other politicians – far too many – who are driven by corruption and an insatiable thirst for power. We must fight against them, change countless things, and improve the entire system, but we must do so from within politics itself. We must do so because everything in life is politics or is conditioned by politics. So let us beware of those who attack politics, political parties, trade unions and democracy. The alternative to democracy is dictatorship, whatever the attractive euphemism some may use. The alternative to political parties and trade unions is a single-party system and a state-controlled union. There is much – so much – room for improvement, but the path is not the one the global far right is showing us.I have been fortunate to dedicate the last stage of my professional life to researching and disseminating the recent history ofSpain. Meeting survivors of Nazi and Francoist concentration camps, as well as their families, has been one of the greatest gifts that life has given me. The victims of nazism and other dictatorships never stopped repeating that fascism had not died, that it was still lurking, waiting for the moment to resurface. That is why it was, is and will be so important to be aware of history. Looking back is the best way to face the present, to avoid repeating mistakes and to be prepared for future threats. Looking back shows you that freedom, life and democracy are never guaranteed, and that we must fight every day to preserve them.I’ll finish now. A young, much-loved person, who was aware that her end could come at any moment, told me: “Life is a privilege.” At the time, I didn’t appreciate her words. But, dear reader: savour life, be happy, value what truly matters, flee from toxicity and show empathy … lots of empathy.I’d like to wrap up this article by saying that I’m going to be reunited with all the friends and family members I have lost over the years. I’d like to say it, but I don’t believe in any god. As I write these last lines, I am aware that all I have ahead of me is a fade to black. A fade to black that, paradoxically, is what gives meaning to our existence.I wish you all the best and hope you enjoy yourselves because, yes, life is a huge privilege.This article is an edited version of aposthumous columnwritten by the Spanish journalist and writer Carlos Hernández de Miguel and originally published in elDiario.es.

But shielding Isaac Herzog from legitimate protest is not the answerGeorge NewhouseAllowing fair and peaceful criticism of a foreign head of state, even amid a deeply fraught Middle Eastern crisis, is not antisemitismThu 5 Feb 2026 19.16 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 22.41 ESTShareNot all protests have a violent intent or target a group as illegitimate. But there are many Jewish people in Australia who feel that they are being attacked and that violence is being fomented against them. They see it every day when they watch the news, they worry about it when they see security guards at their schools or when at their synagogues, and they hear it when they are told that they have no right to cultural safety if they believe in the right of Jewish people to a homeland.After the terrorist shootings at Bondi, the New South Wales government has empowered the police commissioner to put limits on protests or to ban them. The problem is that in allowing the banning of all protests, our laws go too far. They treat every protest as the same, without regard to intent, conduct, or risk.In the context of a terrorist massacre at Bondi beach and violent attacks in Melbourne and Perth, it is not unreasonable to ask what does it mean to have a safe and thriving democracy? What does it mean to protect citizens while safeguarding free speech?Isaac Herzog is accused of inciting genocide in Gaza. He shouldn’t be welcomed to Australia | Chris SidotiRead moreThese are precisely the questions we must confront as the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, prepares to visit Australia.I grew up in a different age. One where Martin Luther King Jr reminded the world that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time. That philosophy has long imbued my work. Last September, I retraced part of the Freedom Riders’ journey through the American south. In seeking to understand the impact of systemic discrimination and the power and meaning of peaceful protest, I was also overwhelmed by the reminders of the significant violence directed at the peaceful protesters and representatives of the civil rights movement.Little did I know how soon those lessons would resonate here at home, as Australia finds itself in a sharp and painful debate about the right to protest and violent attacks designed to intimidate and sow fear.True safety is not built by sweeping dissent from the streets. It is built by defending the right of every citizen to peacefully call for justice, while ensuring that no one is subjected to intimidation, harassment or violence.Sadly, over very recent months, we have seen the opposite. Jews have been murdered celebrating a religious festival and Jewish communities are feeling vulnerable and threatened by the language and messaging of some protesters. We have also seen neo-Nazis brazenly attack Camp Sovereignty in Victoria and an attempted bombing at a peaceful Invasion Day protest in Western Australia, which has now been identified as a terrorist act.In expanding protest restrictions acrossSydney, the NSW police commissioner explicitly cited Herzog’s upcoming visit, implying that public dissent against a foreign leader could somehow threaten peace and security at home.As a former mayor of Waverley and a member of the Jewish community, I understand the deep personal impact of the shootings to the Bondi community. The 14 December attack was not just another news headline; it was a violation of sanctuary. For many Jewish Australians, Bondi is more than a postcode, it’s a place where we meet, live, pray and belong. Respecting that collective trauma is not only a matter of policy; it’s a moral imperative.In this moment of deep division, we should look again to Dr King’s legacy. He understood that peaceful protest is not an act of hate, it is a profound expression of care for a nation’s moral health. He never called for the delegitimising of another group or resorted to violence. Instead, he used the language of love and solidarity to challenge entrenched power. “True peace,” he famously taught, “is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.”By restricting the right to protest, our state seeks an artificial quiet, an enforced calm at the expense of justice.The government’s decision to roll out the red carpet for President Herzog while simultaneously establishing “exclusion zones” for the public is a misstep, one likely to deepen the rift between already polarised communities. People must be able to peacefully voice their objections to the horrors of war in Gaza, against the violence of ultra-Orthodox settlers in the West Bank, the massacre of Iranian protesters or the terror unleashed by Hamas.Protest, when done peacefully and without hate, is not only legitimate – it is vital.But let me be equally clear: support for protest is not, of itself, support for hatred or intimidation. The power of protest is not just in its volume but in its values. It loses its moral force when it is laced with threats, language that denies the suffering of others, or rhetoric that calls for violence. We must challenge injustice with integrity. Peaceful protest must never become a platform for antisemitism or the dehumanisation of any community.Labor’s vague and ill-conceived hate speech laws risk undermining Australia’s democracy instead of defending our way of life | Timothy RobertsRead moreThe Bondi tragedy should have brought us together in grief and resolve. Instead, the so-called “Bondi laws” are being used to shield a visiting politician from people seeking accountability. If we allow the state to decide which leaders are too controversial to criticise, we are not ensuring public safety, we are undermining the implied constitutional freedom of political expression.Allowing fair and peaceful criticism of a foreign head of state, even amid a deeply fraught Middle Eastern crisis, is not antisemitism. Protest itself is not an attack on the Jewish people. We cannot let terrorists win by driving deeper wedges between us. Yes, Jewish Australians must be able to walk through Bondi without fear or harassment. But Palestinians and their allies must also be able to stand in Martin Place and criticise the manner in which the Israeli government conducts itself.Perhaps now is the time to reclaim King’s dream: a dream forged in love, tested by fire, and handed down to each generation. Love, sadly, cannot be legislated. But we can, and must, protect the freedom to express it. The challenge before us now is how to balance the right to protest with the responsibility to keep all communities safe. The question is not whether we value safety or liberty more but whether we have tipped the scales too far in one direction.In moments like this, it is our commitment to both justice and free expression that will determine the kind of country we become.George Newhouse AM is a former mayor of Waverley and a member of the Sydney Jewish communityExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionAustralian politicsSydneycommentShareReuse this content"

There wasn’t a lot of advance publicity about what might happen, beyond a list of musical performers, heavier on popular classical names including Andrea Bocelli and Lang Lang than pop stars – and a quote from the event’s creative lead and executive producer, Marco Balich, that it would eschew “hi-tech and bling”.Anyone desperate for intel might alight on a tabloid live stream that proffered the news that “it could last THREE hours” – it wasn’t entirely clear whether this was meant as enticement or warning – and a news report suggesting the International Olympic Committee were concerned that Team America might be booed, the legendary charm of the Trump administration having done so much to spread goodwill towards the US over the last 12 months. In fact, what the president of the IOC said was: “I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as an opportunity to be respectful of each other” – so there was always the chance she was concerned the crowd might take against Denmark, but it didn’t seem likely.‘We are all connected’: Winter Olympics opening ceremony stresses harmony and showcases ItalyRead moreAs it turned out, there were references to Roman mythology, 18th-century opera, Giorgio Armani and indeed to the work of a film director the BBC’s commentator referred to as Fredrick Fellinia. Plus, a lightning-fast approach to music that meant things moved fairly quickly from Verdi to giant-headed effigies of him, Puccini and Rossini dancing to the strains of Righeira’s 80s Italo disco hit Vamos a la playa; and to the oeuvre of the late Raffaella Carrà, best known in Britain for her 1978 novelty hit Do It Do It Again and its terrifying accompanying dance routine. (If you haven’t seen it, or can’t remember it, get yourself to YouTube and boggle that the poor woman wasn’t helped off the Top of the Pops stage in a neck brace.)It could have been confusing, but luckily, the BBC’s commentary team were always on hand to let you know what was what. “Beauty – a way of life in Italy!” “That puffa coat isfascinating!” “Mariah Carey’s many, many fans out there shouldn’t go to the toilet!” There was some valuable context given, though, for an admirably highbrow segment of contemporary dance, about “how to keep a balance between human ambition and the natural world”, set to These New Puritans-style clattering percussion and neo-classical strings. Up in the stands, JD Vance was probably baffled.View image in fullscreenAndrea Bocelli performing Nessun Dorma.Photograph: Peter Kneffel/EPAFor anyone unmoved by light classical music and not au fait with Italian pop (Laura Pausini, who has sold 40m albums without ever troubling the mass consciousness of the UK, sang Italy’s national anthem), Carey was the big draw, but was dispatched pretty early on in proceedings. Wearing sequins and a thousand-yard stare, she offered a slow-motion and relatively subdued – at least by Mariah Carey standards – reading of Volare (or rather, Nel blu, dipinito di blu, given that she sang it in Italian) before hitting an astonishing whistle note that indicated a segue into her recent single Nothing Is Impossible.The live performances were bisected by the athlete’s parade – the American team ended up getting what the BBC tactfully described as “a mixed reception” – and resumed with a dance history of theOlympic Games. The 1960s and 70s were soundtracked by Adriano Celentano’s fabulous 1973 single Prisencolinensinainciusol, belatedly famed in the UK as the soundtrack to a TV advert for easyJet. From there on in, the musical entertainment was popular classical music all the way – Andrea Bocelli doing Nessun Dorma, Lang Lang accompanying Cecilia Bartoli – save for a brief appearance by the Italian rapper Ghali.Largely unknown in the UK, Ghali sounds intriguing on paper – not least because he has a single called Pizza Kebab – but his performance was too subdued, too close to spoken word, to give you a real flavour of what he might be capable of. As the giant-headed effigies of opera composers took the stage once more, dancing to perky pop-dance as was the opera composer’s wont, I found myself wondering what the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028 might have in store. Given that Donald Trump will still be in power, we can probably look forward to Kid Rock.Explore more on these topicsMusicWinter Olympics 2026Mariah CareyPop and rockClassical musicOperaOlympic GamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Looking at Jack Thorne’s astonishing list of credits, it’s hard to argue. The prolific playwright and screenwriter’s output includes many of the best homegrown TV dramas of the past two decades.That’s without the many hit plays and films he has also written. There’s more to come, too. Next out of the Thorne pipeline is Channel 4’s forbidden romance Falling, with Keeley Hawes and Paapa Essiedu, and the film Enola Holmes 3, which will be followed by the small matter of Sam Mendes’four Beatles biopics.As Thorne’s new BBC adaptation of Lord of the Flies arrives, we’ve rated his 20 TV projects so far. Surely he’s overdue a holiday?20. The Eddy (2020)View image in fullscreenAmandla Stenberg and André Holland in The Eddy.Photograph: Lou Faulon/APA rare misfire saw Thorne penning a moody Netflix musical drama for director Damien Chazelle about a bereaved jazz pianist running a struggling Paris nightclub. With dialogue in French, English, Arabic and Polish, it was as confusing as it was chin-strokey.19.The Accident(2019)This Channel 4 miniseries followed a south Wales community’s fight for justice after local teens were killed in an explosion at a building site. It was rousing and righteous, but was let down by Sarah Lancashire’s wobbly Welsh accent and a plodding courtroom climax. Thorne would later tell a similar story in Toxic Town to more powerful effect.18. Cast Offs (2009)This unjustly forgotten Channel 4 mockumentary followed six disabled people sent to a remote island for a fictional reality show. Episodes intercut the Survivor-style action with flashbacks fleshing out their lives. These proved superior to the main plot. Darkly funny and bracingly transgressive.17. Lord of the Flies (2026)Pass the conch. The first ever TV adaptation of William Golding’s classic novel about stranded schoolboys sees writer Thorne reunite with a regular collaborator, director Marc Munden. The result is low on dialogue, high on unsettling atmospherics. However, it’s lifted by the brilliant performances of its young cast, particularly David McKenna as Piggy.16. The Last Panthers (2015)Kicking off with a diamond heist, this Sky Atlantic six-parter delved into a sprawling international alliance between criminal gangs and shadowy “banksters”. The sleek trilingual series had elements of a textbook Euro-pudding, deliberately designed to appeal continent-wide, but was more thrilling than most. Samantha Morton, John Hurt and a David Bowie theme tune helped.15.His Dark Materials(2019-2022)It was no easy task to adapt Philip Pullman’s epic multi-world trilogy for TV. This HBO/BBC co-production didn’t entirely succeed but did a damn sight better than the00s film flop. It was visually stunning and strongly performed (Ruth Wilson’s villainous Mrs Coulter was a standout) but, ironically, lacked a little magic dust.14.The Hack(2025)This ITV romp told the story of the News International phone hacking scandal. With David Tennant breaking the fourth wall as Guardian journalist Nick Davies and a parallel plot following Robert Carlyle’s police detective, it recounted the sprawling saga in galloping style, although the playful tone jarred with some. Anyone would think a Harry Hill cameo was a bad thing.13.Then Barbara Met Alan(2022)Co-written with Genevieve Barr, this one-off drama celebrated a milestone in civil rights history. It told the true story of cabaret performers Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth, whose campaign for disabled rights resulted in the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. A rollicking activism biopic, wrapped up inside a sparky romcom – complete with disabled sex scenes, rare on mainstream TV.12. Don’t Take My Baby (2015)Another superb standalone factual drama. Based on real testimonies, this BBC Three heartbreaker chronicled a young disabled couple’s fight for custody of their newborn daughter. Would wheelchair user Anna and partially sighted Tom be allowed to keep their baby? Or will social worker Belinda take her into care? It went on to win the Bafta for best single drama.11.Toxic Town(2025)View image in fullscreenJodie Whittaker and Aimee Lou Wood in Toxic Town.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixThe legal case was dubbed “the British Erin Brockovich”. This Netflix miniseries dramatised the Corby toxic waste scandal by following three mothers involved in the case. When contaminated soil from the dismantled steelworks caused congenital birth defects in local babies, the women fought a council cover-up. Jodie Whittaker, Aimee Lou Wood and Claudia Jessie made for compelling leads.10. Glue (2014)Broadchurch meets Skins, anyone? E4’s gripping rural whodunnit laid bare the dark heart of the bucolic Berkshire countryside. When a 14-year-old Romany boy was found murdered, the investigation uncovered all manner of druggy criminality. The cast brimmed with rising stars, among them Callum Turner, Billy Howle, Faye Marsay and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.9. The Fades (2011)This bold, Bafta-winning BBC Three supernatural drama followed bed-wetting student Paul (Iain de Caestecker), who was able to see vengeful spirits of the dead all around him. He was pulled into a battle between these zombie-like “Fades” and the “Angelics” able to detect them. Tense, haunting and gory, it had a strong cast that included Daniel Kaluuya, Natalie Dormer, Johnny Harris – and Daniela Nardini as a gun-toting priest.8. Skins (2007-2009)The landmark E4 teen drama would figure higher here, except Thorne was a relatively small cog in its machine, writing five episodes in its first three series – plus one instalment of the US remake. His writing of the Bristolian sixth formers was an early sign of his deftness of touch with controversial issues and acute understanding of young lives. Thorne credits showrunner Bryan Elsley as a formative influence on his career.7.Kiri(2018)This wonderfully observed, warmly humane four-parter centred on the abduction of the titular nine-year-old Black girl, who had been fostered by a middle-class white couple and was about to be adopted by them. The mighty Sarah Lancashire was mesmerising as her social worker, strongly supported by Paapa Essiedu and Wunmi Mosaku. It became a breakout hit for Channel 4, clocking up 5 million viewers and becoming the biggest ever drama on its catchup service. Not bad for a penetrating study of race, class and family.6.Help(2021)There was a flurry of lockdown dramas during Covid. This was comfortably the best – and angriest. Following Jodie Comer’s care home assistant and Stephen Graham’s resident with early-onset Alzheimer’s, it was a blistering indictment of the plight of vulnerable people during the pandemic and the myriad ways they were failed by the government. The harrowingly hellish night shift sequence, shot in a 26-minute single take by director Marc Munden, was a masterpiece.5.National Treasure(2016)View image in fullscreenFrom left: Andrea Riseborough, Robbie Coltrane and Julie Walters in National Treasure.Photograph: Joss Barratt/Channel 4/PA“They think I’m Jimmy fucking Savile.” Inspired by Operation Yewtree, this Bafta-winning miniseries starred Robbie Coltrane as a veteran gameshow host. When he was accused of historic sex crimes during his standup days, his family’s life fell apart. It would be Coltrane’s last major role before his death. Julie Walters as his longsuffering wife and Andrea Riseborough as his drug addict daughter were equally devastating. A morally knotty treatise on memory and truth, celebrity and power.4.Best Interests(2023)Another miniseries, this time for the BBC, tackling issues around disability. Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen delivered powerhouse performances as a married couple fighting for their disabled daughter’s future. When she winds up in intensive care after a chest infection, doctors question whether treatment should be withdrawn. Her parents fight for medical care to continue but are driven apart by the battle. Urgent, unflinching and profoundly moving, with tragic echoes of the previous year’sArchie Battersbee case.3.The Virtues(2019)One of Thorne’s fruitful collaborations with writer-director Shane Meadows. The Channel 4 miniseries was based partly on the latter’s own experience of repressing the memory of childhood sexual abuse. Stephen Graham was heartbreakingly convincing as the unravelling alcoholic who returned to his native Ireland to find his estranged sister – in the process unearthing a horrific buried trauma from his past. Niamh Algar and Helen Behan co-starred and PJ Harvey composed the soundtrack; the bruisingly painful material was masterfully handled.2.Adolescence(2025)In terms of sheer impact, this would be No 1. Quality-wise, it came mighty close, too. The Guardian’s critic Lucy Mangan called it “the closest thing to TV perfection in decades”. Co-created with star Stephen Graham, last year’s Netflix four-parter was an unflinching look at the deadly consequences of online life leaking into the real world. Tracing the fallout of a 13-year-old boy’s arrest for the murder of a female classmate, director Philip Barantini audaciously filmed each episode in one continuous take. Graham andErin Dohertydelivered bravura turns. Newcomer Owen Cooper became the youngest ever Emmy-winner. Thorne wanted to “look in the eye of modern male rage”. He did so in a devastating drama that transcended TV to hit headlines worldwide.1. This Is England ’86, ’88 and ’90 (2010-2015)Edging out Adolescence partly thanks to its scope and longevity, the three tumultuous TV sequels to Shane Meadows’ 2006 coming-of-age film combined bittersweet romance with brutal violence to uncompromising effect. Set in 1986, 1988 and 1990, the vibrant backdrop spanned from the mod revival to rave culture, adding up to a resonant parallel history of Thatcher’s Britain. The lovingly portayed Midlands gang of Shaun, Woody, Lol, Milky, Combo, Smell and the rest became like old friends. By turns deeply affecting, stomach-churningly tense and anarchically funny, all set to an evocative soundtrack, it’s a modern masterpiece. And if rumours ofThis Is England’00 are to be believed, the final adventure is still to come.Lord of the Flies starts on 8 February on BBC One.

A gigantic arch! Trump’s gaudy plans for America’s 250th anniversaryFrom minting coins featuring his own face to covering buildings with gold, the president’s proposals for marking America’s semiquincentennial say a lot about the country’s backwards outlookCatherine SlessorFri 6 Feb 2026 09.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.42 ESTShareWhen the United States celebrated its bicentennial on 4 July 1976, it marked the occasion with the opening of the National Air and Space Museum’s exhibition hall on Washington DC’s National Mall. Designed in a boldly modernist style by the blue-chip firm Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum (now HOK), it stood as a testament to American aeronautical derring-do, from the Wright brothers to the moon landings.At the time, even though the stench of Republican political shenanigans was never far off, with Gerald Ford replacing the disgraced Richard Nixon in 1974, there was a sense of a nation embracing progress, looking forward, not back. For all the historical re-enactments of Washington crossing the Delaware, the US chose to see itself through the prism of modernity and technological puissance.Half a century on, as the country prepares to mark the 250th anniversary of its founding, historical re-enactments have edged out just about everything when it comes to architecture. Intent on stamping his crassly gilded imprimatur on Washington, Donald Trump recently shared the latest iterations of his proposed triumphal arch, first unveiled last October, to be erected just across from the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River.His post on Truth Socialshows three uncredited versions of the so-called “Arc de Trump” now rebadged as the Independence Arch, embellished with varying degrees of gilding and statuary.Given Trump’s weakness for bling, the smart money would be on the gilded iteration, a gaudy exemplar of what the American architecture critic Kate Wagner has described as “regional car dealership rococo”. All three versions are modelled on the Arch of Titus in Rome, originally constructed in the first century following Rome’s military conquest of Jerusalem. As a template from classical antiquity, it has popped up throughout history, from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to New York’s Washington Square Arch.View image in fullscreenA mock-up of the planned Independence Arch shows where it would sit, across from the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River in Washington DC.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesInitially, Trump teasingly floated a choice of three different scales for his Independence Arch but has apparently alighted on the largest, which would be 250ft (76 metres) tall. And though the scale has alarmed some architectural and conservation experts, who see it as potentially distorting the relationship between existing historic monuments, Trump feels that “250 for 250” – a foot for every year of the US’s existence – chimes perfectly with his ambitions.“The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And we’re gonna top it by, I think, a lot,” Trump said at a White House Christmas reception in December. For context, the Arc de Triomphe is 164ft tall.Historically, triumphal arches – the bigger the better – have been catnip to despots of all stripes. Hitler confected one with his pet architect, Albert Speer, for his postwar vision of Berlin as awelthauptstadtor world capital. At a colossal 328ft, it would have dwarfed the Arc de Trump and the Arc de Triomphe.Trump’s other semiquincentennial wheezes includeminting $1 coins with his face on them, thereby flouting an 1866 law that prohibits a living person from appearing on US currency. He also plans tostage a star-studded Ultimate Fighting Championship eventin a temporary arena at the White House. It’s hard to imagine any other US president countenancing a cage fight on the south lawn, but we’re not in Kansas any more, and Trump’s cronies in all areas of public and cultural life seem content to enable his killer clown proclivities.Yet there has been some pushback on his controversial plan toshutter and redevelop the Kennedy Center, a model of elegantly modern formalism by Edward Durell Stone dating from 1971. Trump employed his familiar gameplan for the Kennedy debacle, convinced that he knows better than the experts, and that a “silent majority” actually supports his disruptions.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s post of Truth Social showing the options for his arch, which would dwarf the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.Photograph: Truth Social/@realDonaldTrumpHowever, after boycotts by several performers, the US chapter of Docomomo, a global heritage body dedicated to conserving modern buildings, has come out swinging. Its executive director, Liz Waytkus, told the Architect’s Newspaper that “in addition to being a beloved cultural institution honouring the life and legacy of our 35th president, the Kennedy Center is a celebrated work of modern architecture and a landmark achievement by master architect Edward Durell Stone”.Waytkus added: “Docomomo US remains deeply concerned by the ongoing lack of adherence to the regulatory processes that govern federally owned properties. Sites such as the Kennedy Center belong to the public and must be stewarded transparently, not treated as private assets.” She also confirmed that Docomomo is “joining with like-minded organisations to assert the public’s right to review and participate in decisions affecting these nationally significant places”.In co-opting history and its symbols for his own ends, Trump clearly sees himself as some kind of untouchable modern Roman emperor, with a penchant for spectacle of both the human and architectural kind. His mandates stipulating that “classical” or “traditional” styles are used for federal buildings are calculated to exert power over public space and stifle any remotely progressive ideals. No doubt he loathes HOK’s National Air and Space Museum.While the latest iteration of Trump’s overbearing arch may be hucksterishly spun as a tribute to US independence, if he really means to go full Roman, he may want to engage a flunky to whisper in his ear what was murmured to triumphant Roman generals during their victory parades: “Memento mori.” Remember, you are mortal.

Why not do the same for classical music?It began in the Royal Festival Hall, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra “playing the unforgettable ‘da-da-da-dum’ of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony”. And, indeed, the opening movement was brisk and the da-da-da-dums were present and correct. Vogue Williams, media personality, model and presenter ofSend Nudes: Body SOSwelcomed us to the event. “Wasn’t that incredible,” she gushed after the six minutes of the symphony’s first movement. “You must be wrecked,” she told an orchestra who routinely perform 90-minute Mahler symphonies and four-hour operas, but conductor Ed Gardner smiled gamely and moved on to a short medley of Howard Shore’s Lord of the Rings film music.The finale from Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony followed, whose lurches of mood made little musical sense divorced from the rest of the work. Still, the LPO played it at full throttle and impeccably.Thereafter the audience was free to choose one of the four other orchestras (in fact, small groups of musicians from each) playing short sets in vastly smaller Southbank spaces. Each set was repeated three times over the next 75 minutes, meaning in theory you could catch most of the music on offer, but did no one do the maths or visualise how the audiences would move through the site? The Royal Festival Hall (which seats 2,700) was full. Disgorge that many people simultaneously into four smaller spaces, whose combined capacity is nowhere near sufficient to cope with such a crowd, and you will inevitably leave much of your audience stuck in bottlenecks. Catching up with friends happened mostly in queues, and too often involved the question, “Have you managed to actually hear anything yet?”When you did, the results were uneven. Members of the Chineke! Junior Orchestra were arrayed around the Clore Ballroom on individual podiums like exhibits in a gallery, with Yshani Perinpanayagam bravely keeping her disparate troops together to perform the moving Montgomery Variations by Margaret Bonds while the audience wandered between players. Some of the younger performers looked distinctly uncomfortable; a more experienced orchestra and a less intricate piece would surely have been a happier choice here.In the undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall, a handful of musicians from the London Sinfonietta performed three extracts from Steve Reich works. Those lucky enough to squeeze in found the industrial space lit like a nightclub, and in what felt rather polite accounts, Reich’s music still wove its hypnotic magic.View image in fullscreenThe sound of music … Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at Classical Mixtape.Photograph: Pete WoodheadMeanwhile, in the Purcell Room (with a capacity of about 300), players from the Aurora Orchestra were on a musical adventure inspired, apparently, by Gustav and Alma Mahler’s time in the Alps. Audience members “are free to move between stages as they wish” went the blurb, but that was easier said than done: none but the most dedicated of queuers were able to see what musical peaks the Aurora scaled. Still, in the foyer you could enjoy a brass and percussion band from theOrchestra of the Age of Enlightenmentwearing lederhosen, alpine caps and dirndl dresses (and yes, with the instruments of 19th-century Bavaria) doing a Sound of Music medley and having a whale of a time using beer glasses as percussion and proving they are most definitely game for a laugh.The Barbican’sSound Unbound festivalshowed that classical music in bite-size chunks with an audience free to explore can work incredibly well. There, the music was spread across 19 venues and an entire weekend. Here, mystifyingly, the centre’s second hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall (capacity about 900) was not being used as a performing space, and there were no duos, trios, quartets or quintets in the vast public spaces on any of the six Royal Festival Hall floors. The audience profile was noticeably younger and more mixed than a usual classical one, but they were poorly served by unambitious programming and abysmal planning.As everyone was ushered back towards the Royal Festival Hall to hear the finale – the Philharmonia performing two movements of Holst’s The Planets and the Star Wars theme, I decided less was definitely more and fled this dispiriting vision of classical music’s future.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSouthbank CentreLondon Philharmonic OrchestraAurora OrchestraChineke!

But far better artists have been similarly profane for centuriesFri 6 Feb 2026 10.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 12.31 ESTShareIt must be the ugliest wall painting in Rome - and that’s even without the bizarre portrait of Giorgia Meloni as an angel. ArtistBruno Valentinetti painted his tributeto Umberto II, the last king of Italy, earlier this century in a side chapel of the ancient church of San Lorenzo in Lucina in its historic heart, the Centro Storico. It’s the kind of unsightly accretion you try to ignore when enjoying the city’s artistic glories which include, in this particular church, a staggering,stormy vision of the Crucifixionby the 17th-century painter Guido Reni, his most unforgettable masterpiece.Valentinetti’s mural, by contrast, is a glib, tacky, photorealist effort that didn’t even last two decades before water damage demanded restoration. Valentinetti, now 83, carried out the repairs himself and had the genius idea of giving an angel the face –highly recognisable because obviously based on photos of her – of Italy’s populist prime minister. What was he thinking? Is he in love? Or was this an insidious piece of propaganda?View image in fullscreenMeloni no more … the face of the angel erased from the fresco after protests.Photograph: Remo Casilli/ReutersGiven Meloni’s far right political roots, it may be significant that she materialised in the chapel of Italy’s last monarch. Umberto II’s father Victor Emmanuel III collaborated with Mussolini and ceded the throne to his son in 1946 in the hope of clearing the monarchy’s name. But in a referendum that year, the people chose a republic anyway and Umberto II went into exile in Portugal. So in the artist’s mind, and Meloni’s “Who, me?” reaction to his angelic vision of her, perhaps there are disturbing affinities with the authoritarian Italy of the early 20th century.The church may have suspected this. After removing Meloni’s face, the artist claimed he was pressured to do so by the Vatican. Cardinal Don Baldo Reina has spoken of his “bitterness” at the artist’s secret portrait, strong language conveying condemnation of Meloni’s uninvited appearance in the heavens. This is understandable in our dark times. In Europe’s populist age you never know what is funny and what is terrifying. The artist may be a harmless eccentric or a gaslighting manipulator – either way Meloni gets free publicity and the undercurrent of an idea that she’s in some way holy or chosen by God. Funny if you don’t think about it too much, a bit scary if you do.View image in fullscreenOnly human … Madonna and Child With Two Angels by Fra Filippo Lippi.Photograph: AlamyYet one thing the cardinal says about art, and Italy’s religious art in particular, is nonsense. It’s wrong to paint Meloni in a church, he argues, because “images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited”. In other words, the sacred and profane are separate, and Christian art must be free from any taint of politics or contemporary life. When has that ever been true?Italy’s frescoed churches are full of portraits of real people, powerful and famous in their day, depicted as unmistakably as Meloni. In Santa Maria Novella in Florence you can see women of the wealthy Tornabuoni family portrayed in scenes of theBirths of the Virgin and Baptist by Domenico Ghirlandaioin the 1400s. In another Florentine church, Lorenzo de’ Medici greets his young sons and their tutor in a scene of the history of the Franciscan order. These are naked displays of wealth and status by leading families in the sacred setting of a church. The Medici went further and had themselves and their friends portrayed byBenozzo Gozzoliin their family chapel in the company of the Magi, processing to the Holy Land. A business associate of theirs got Botticelli to portray them as the Magi themselves, wealthy and wise, with Cosimo de’ Medici touching the foot of Christ.Would these have made Don Baldo Reina feel “bitter” if he was around in 15th-century Italy? Such gross, quasi-blasphemous displays certainly appalled Savonarola, who toppled the Medici in a religious revolution. Yet the contemporary portraits that fill Italian Renaissance art also humanise holy themes, dragging art out of the holy shadows into real life. And while rich people paid for their faces to be inserted into religious scenes, artists also took advantage to do so secretly, in brilliantly ambiguous fusions of the sacred and profane that haunt and stun us today.View image in fullscreenPainfully familiar … Minos in Michelangelo’s Last Judgment.Photograph: Public domainThe first artist who did this was probably Fra Filippo Lippi, a friar who ran off with a nun called Lucrezia Buti. They had two children together and Lippi seems to celebrate his partner (they never married) in depictions of the Madonna. HisVirgin and Childin the Uffizi Gallery adorns Mary with ravishing jewels and translucent silk in a way that outrageously crosses the line between reverence and desire: it is hard to believe this is not his portrait of Buti.Some of the most celebrated frescoes in Rome contain portraits of contemporaries that artists added secretly or unofficially as private jokes, homages or acts of revenge, even in the heart of papal Rome. The most astonishing is inMichelangelo’s Last Judgmentin the Sistine Chapel. When a papal official called Biagio da Cesena accused Michelangelo of filling this fresco with male nudes for his own irreligious reasons, Michelangelo responded by giving Minos, the judge of Hell, Biagio’s face. He stands to this day, in the chapel where popes are elected, with a snake wrapped around his naked body, clamping its mouth on his penis.What has changed? Obviously these were great artists, their private portraits artistic miracles. The portrait of Meloni was an embarrassing hack job that deserved to be removed on aesthetic grounds alone. Yet our expectations of church art are also different. It is required to be safe and contemplative, not contentiously real. That is surely at least partly because while Christianity once permeated everyday life without barriers between life and faith, in the modern world it’s a more tenuous presence, even in Italy. And it is overshadowed by politics.It’s probably safe to say that the Vatican under American Pope Leo XIV is to the left of Meloni’s government. So when Valentinetti inserted into his restoration job the face of a rightwing populist, implying that Meloni belongs with the angels, the Church begged to differ. She may look like an angel to Bruno Valentinetti, but for a lot of us she’s the devil in disguise.Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtMichelangelocommentShareReuse this content"

But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect peopleKeza MacDonaldFri 6 Feb 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 09.41 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in thePokémonWorld Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.It is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.Over the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.Like The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.The developer nearly went bust several times, taking on outside projects to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salaryPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.The idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.View image in fullscreenClick and collect … Competitors at the 2019 Pokémon World Championships in Washington DC.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.But the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.Pokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.Time magazine called Pokémon 'a pestilential Ponzi scheme', describing the 'delinquent' and ‘criminal' behaviour of young fansToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.Now that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.View image in fullscreenThe greatest catch … Satoshi Tajiri with his  lucrative creation.Photograph: JC Olivera/Variety/Getty ImagesPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.July 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.There’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.The 10 most anticipated video games of 2026Read moreAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.Dr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

As How to Get to Heaven from Belfast hits our screens, she explains why the craic’s about to get deadlyRóisín LaniganFri 6 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 09.01 ESTShareHow do you follow up a show about girls in Derry? With one about women in Belfast, obviously. That’s what Lisa McGee has done. Her new eight-parter, How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, is as far away fromDerry Girlsas you can get when the distance between the worlds amounts to 70 miles along the A6.Or as she puts it: “I wanted a shit, female, Northern Irish A-Team!”Part thriller, part surrealist comedy, How to Get to Heaven from Belfast follows Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher), Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) and Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne), who have been pals since their teenage years at the accurately named Our Lady of the Sorrows school – and who get dragged into a Knives Out-style mystery after the shocking death of their school friend, Greta.Although the show is billed as a mystery comedy thriller – McGee also took heavy inspiration from Columbo and Scooby-Doo – it is at heart, like Derry Girls before it, a story about friendship. More specifically, about female friendships that span decades, the shared memories and the pressure to edit those shared memories to suit our ideas of ourselves.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to put my voice on something new’ …Lisa McGee on the set of How To Get To Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/Netflix“The problem with a group of friends that have known each other since they were kids,” says McGee, “is that you know everything. And sometimes you don’t want that thing from your past being brought up again. Or you don’t want to talk about that story because it doesn’t represent you as you see yourself now. So it can get quite spiky. You’re living this agreed lie. But in a more comical way, you get away with nothing. I remember starting to eat sushi when I was in my 20s and my friends being like: ‘Who the hell do you think you are?’”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast comes on the heels of three seasons of Derry Girls, a smash hit for McGee. But it actually precedes it by decades. “I wrote it as a play when I was at Queen’s University here in Belfast, and it was about a reunion,” says McGee.She took the name from flyers thrust into her hands by Christian societies during freshers week. “I hadn’t done anything yet, and it wasn’t very good,” she jokes of the original How to Get to Heaven from Belfast. “But then during Derry Girls, a lot of my schoolfriends started coming to the premieres …” It was seeing those old pals again that made her go back to the play she’d written 20 years prior.View image in fullscreenThree’s company … (from left) Dunne, Keenan and Gallagher with Bronagh Gallagher as Booker in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixLike the teen survivalist thrillerYellowjackets, the story jumps back and forwards in time, showing the gang as adults but also as their teenage selves. The flashbacks are mysterious, all satanic symbols etched on walls and burning sheds in the woods. At other times it’s as explosive as a show likeThe White Lotus… if it were set in Ballycastle (there is somehow a yacht and a car chase, both of which blow up).Before they go on a madcap sleuthing adventure to get to the bottom of Greta’s death, the women’s circumstances are sobering. Dara lives at home, caring for her overbearing mother after a terrible breakup; Saoirse is a TV writer in London engaged to a man she doesn’t really like; and Robyn, a glamorous but harried mum of four, is married to one she’s not fond of either. Greta’s death unmoors them, but it also offers an escape from the humdrum and lets them embrace the uncanny elements of their own lives. It’s inevitable, really, in a place like the north-west. “Derry people,” Robyn muses, “are always such weirdos.”Together, the three travel to Greta’s wake, where they encounter her strange family. Her mother lies about Greta’s childhood, her daughter, wide-eyed and ghostly in a frog hat, freaks them all out. Worst of all is her widower, Garda officer Owen (Emmett J Scanlan), who is determined to cast himself as a grieving husband while seemingly hiding more sinister secrets.View image in fullscreenSleuth worker … James Martin as Tommy in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixThe show is a mystery within a mystery. While trying to uncover the truth about Greta’s death, Robyn, Saoirse and Dara confront the dark secret from their teenage years none of them want to look back on. The trio have matching tribal tattoos (Greta had one too), the meaning of which is never explained. They’re adamant they “didn’t do anything wrong” with the “thing we never talk about”, but the audience is only teased with what that thing could be – and whether the women are lying to us, and themselves, about their guilt.Like Scooby-Doo’s Mystery Gang running riot in the hills and villages of the west of Northern Ireland, Saoirse, Dara and Robyn are far more likely to stumble through their murder mystery than solve it. They storm the wrong funeral wearing Disney princess masks, scandalising a church full of mourners. A twister (bad weather, even for Ireland) forces them to take refuge in the attic of eccentric innkeeper Seamus (Ardal O’Hanlon), who wears a spinning bow tie and spends his evenings hosting a series of ever more wacky themed discos. Dara extracts information from a local funeral director by staging her own – very alive – mother’s wake.The craic may be deadly, in other words, but it’s still craic. The crimes and tragedies here are offbeat and fantastical – a boy from Fermanagh has been raised by chickens, a Kenny Rogers impersonator from Ballybunion has been killed by being thrown off a bucking bronco during country songBoot Scootin’ Boogie.“I always loved the mystery genre, and I wanted to put my voice on something new,” says McGee. “I really, really want people to like it, but I don’t feel that pressure I had [with Derry Girls], certainly when the third series was coming out. I felt like such a huge responsibility for that to land in a way that everyone at home was happy with. Now I feel like I’m just telling a story and it happens to be set in Northern Ireland. I just hope people enjoy the ride. I hope they like the friendship group. I hope they laugh.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m just telling a story and it happens to be set in Northern Ireland’ says Lisa McGee.McGee lives in Belfast with her husband, English actor Tobias Beer, and their two sons, after 12 years in London. “I was really frustrated with London,” she says. “But I was also frustrated when I came home, because I didn’t feel like I was part of that.” Those experiences are mirrored in Saoirse, who won’t commit to a life in either place, and endures the indignity of having her colleagues explain away her brusqueness as a cultural trait. “I’m so sorry,” one says, “she’s Irish.” Saoirse’s name is frequently shortened to “Seersh”, which is arguably only slightly less torturous than being an Irish writer in London named “Róisín” and having your name constantly shortened to “Rowsh”.“That’s the really interesting thing about identity,” says McGee. “You don’t quite know where you fit. Your job takes you to this place, but there’s stuff about this place that frustrates the hell out of you. And then you come home and people are like: ‘I don’t care about your stupid London job.’”There are elements of the Derry Girls in all the How to Get to Heaven from Belfast characters. McGee says Dara is similar to Orla, while Robyn shares much of the same DNA as Michelle, and is based on the same real-life friend, who grew up to become a similarly glam mum of four. But there’s an edge to the friendships that feels truer to the experience of navigating relationships in adulthood. “It’s the same group of girls,” she says, “only we’ve grown up now and we still don’t know what we’re doing!”Although How to Get to Heaven deals with inalienable truths of life – fashion is circular, friendship is complicated, you never get a crowd for a closed casket at a wake, obviously don’t marry a police officer, although it might be grand to ride one occasionally – it feels quintessentially Northern Irish in tone, a dark comedy odyssey through the Lynchian bleakness of Ireland’s rural north-west.View image in fullscreenBack in the day … Saoirse Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Dylan Llewellyn and Jamie-Lee O’Donnell in Derry Girls.Photograph: Peter Marley/Peter Marley/Channel 4“When you think about the history of Northern Ireland, the people and the landscape, there’s something so charming and beautiful, but it can turn really quickly,” says McGee. “Something that was the most picturesque, gorgeous thing [can become] suddenly really dangerous. There are so many layers to the place with the history and what we’ve been through. The landscape is so wild and gorgeous and in the dark so scary. There’s all the ingredients you need for a very scary story.”If there’s misery in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast, it’s short-lived. “I don’t believe you can sustain that level of depression,” says McGee. “Really bad stuff was happening here for quite a long time, but it’s like, you can’t stay at that. Someone will say something ridiculous or do something inappropriate and then the conversation changes. I think comedy is way more truthful than drama at times because people are just ridiculous, particularly somewhere like Northern Ireland.”That doesn’t mean they’re not amazing to watch. As with Derry Girls, the women are active protagonists, not passive characters watching their lives pass them by. “They needed to feel badass,” says McGee. “They don’t make it better a lot of the time, and a lot of the time they’re making it worse. I wanted any woman watching this to think: ‘Oh, that looks a bit sticky, but I’d love to do that with my friends. I’d love to solve something like that.’ That was always my driving force … that and sometimes you need to blow a few things up.”How to Get to Heaven from Belfast is on Netflix on12 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before she was chosen from more than 100 artists to design six new stained-glass windows for the cathedral – reopened in 2024, five years after it almost burned to the ground – Tabouret had a select group of admirers (one of them the French tycoon and art collector François Pinault), but she was hardly a household name.‘Ludicrous’: bitter row erupts over plan to replace windows at Notre DameRead moreThat has changed – for better and for worse. At the end of last month, the first major solo retrospective of her work opened at the Museum Voorlinden outside The Hague. In Paris, Tabouret’s window designs are on display at the Grand Palais, before being installed at Notre Dame later this year at an estimated cost of €4m (£3.3m). The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Paris’s archbishop have been enthusiastic in their support, but the plan to integrate a modern artist into a historic landmark has alsoprovoked protests,petitions and claims of cultural and spiritual vandalism.Tabouret refuses to takethe critics’complaints personally. “These are people who hate the project, no matter what,” she says when we meet in the library at the Voorlinden, amid sweeping glass and 40,000 books ranged on wooden shelves. “They didn’t even really look at the designs. They go on their computers to spread hate, but you can see from the messages they write that they don’t really know what it’s about. And I’m also receiving a lot of love, which is very nice.”View image in fullscreenClaire Tabouret, Self-portrait as a vampire, 2019, acrylic on wood.Photograph: Courtesy of the Artist/©Marten ElderThe retrospective at the Voorlinden,Weaving waters, Weaving Gestures,is a testament to the versatility of her art, and an exploration of identity and human relationships with paintings on canvas, faux fur and Plexiglas, bronzes and ceramics, and works reproduced on tapestries and rugs. In almost every work, the colours are intense and overwhelmingly vibrant.From the 50 or more diverse works on display at the museum, it is easy to see why Tabouret caught the Notre Dame jury’s attention.Visitors enter to a series of self-portraits in which she depicts herself variously as a vampire with a blood-stained mouth, a Joan of Arc figure in armour, and casually wearing a hoodie. In reflecting herself, Tabouret says, she is also holding a mirror to the viewer. “The human face is like the surface of water, always in motion, always elusive, never still,” she says.The centrepiece of one gallery is a bronze sculpture of swimmers, surrounded by paintings of larger groups of children in bathing suits; another features a series of Sèvres porcelain vases, each with the face of a weeping woman, called The Mourners. The technique of removing colour from the painted porcelain background while also adding new paint was one she later applied on Plexiglas to produce the images for the Notre Dame windows.View image in fullscreenClaire Tabouret was chosen from more than 100 artists to design six new stained-glass windows for the cathedral.Photograph: Ruud BaanTabouret did not immediately consider applying to design the Notre Dame windows after learning the competition was looking for a contemporary artist.After the fire in April 2019, Macron promised the cathedral would be rebuilt within five years with a “contemporary gesture”, a suggestion that inspired all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft ­carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. When it was announced, the notion of creating something new, which meant replacing the undamaged windows in six chapels on the medieval cathedral’s southern aisle, caused a furore.The existing seven-metre high monochrome windows areoften described as “original”; in fact, they were installed when the building underwent a renovation in the mid-19th century. Experts say their value is more historic than aesthetic, but a committee of the culture ministry opposed the plan to replace them, as did the influential Académie des Beaux-Arts. Activists have unsuccessfully appealed to the courts and to heritage authorities to prevent their removal.View image in fullscreenTabouret’s stained glass window designs for Notre Dame Cathedral.Photograph: Nathan Thelen/© Claire Tabouret“I was intrigued,” says Tabouret, who was living in the US at the time. “It’s not very French to change stuff so I thought that interesting as well as brave and fresh. They specifically wanted figurative painting, which also isn’t very French.Francereally loves abstract projects in public spaces so this was very different.” In the end, she submitted her application 15 minutes before the deadline.After reaching a shortlist of eight artists, Tabouret flew toParisto present her designs to a jury. The specified theme was the Pentecost, the biblical moment when the Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles in Jerusalem 50 days after Easter, marking the beginning of the church. “We were supposed to make six sketches … I did 60. I got obsessed. You couldn’t pull me out of this. I was deep-diving into the Pentecost and my studio was just Pentecost everywhere!” Tabouret recalls.She adds: “I was not brought up with religion, but I come from a place of love and respect and interest for the Catholic church. When I read about the Pentecost I was arrested by the beauty and poetry of the text.”In western ecclesiastical art, Pentecost is traditionally illustrated with the Virgin Mary seated among the disciples, whose crowns are topped with flames. The four principal symbols are fire, wind, a dove and the breath of God.Tabouret’s designs do not break with this tradition. They trace the narrative with groups of people and vivid landscapes, including a turbulent sea and wind-lashed trees in a palette of vibrant blues, reds, greens and purples. “I think the jury wanted the images to be understood by everyone, which is absolutely how I paint. I’m not trying to create any traps or mysteries.”View image in fullscreenClaire Tabouret’s designs for the Notre Dame windows trace the narrative of the Pentecost.Photograph: Simon LeratHer windows are being made at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a nearly 400-year-old glass workshop founded in Reims that has previously worked with artists such as Marc Chagall and Joan Miró. Each window is made up of about 50 pieces of stained glass.The Grand Palais exhibition D’un seul souffle(With one breath) follows the process of designing the full-scale models. This involved Tabouret painting the image in reverse on transparent Plexiglas, using stencils and then monotype to print each on thick paper. Other than being asked not to disturb the cathedral’s inner “white light”, she says she was given “complete artistic freedom” by the church authorities.“When you live in a country with so much history, so much architecture and heritage you cannot just freeze time,” she says. “The question is, how do we create a harmonious dialogue between new layers in buildings like Notre Dame that are made of layers? If you stop those layers it makes no sense in my opinion.”View image in fullscreenOne of Claire Tabouret’s designs featuring a depiction of the Virgin Mary.Photograph: © Claire Tabouret Adagp, Paris, 2025Tabouret, 44, left the US last year and moved back to France. She now lives 90 minutes south of Paris with her American husband, Nathan Thelen, who designs wooden furniture, their two- and three-year-old daughters – and a menagerie of chickens, rabbits and a dog.While she is generous with her explanations and answers, there is a sense she would much rather be back in her studio. One of the exhibits features paint-spattered trousers, boots and a sweater, her workwear. “I’d rather be wearing these than what I’m in now,” she says.Family legend has it that she decided to be a painter aged four when her parents, who are music teachers, took her to see Monet’s Water Lilies in Paris.“I remember the moment and I know the feeling, because I still get it when I see the Water Lilies or a painting I love; I feel an urgency to paint,” she says. “I didn’t know the artist or his paintings, I just knew I wanted to paint. My mum tells people I went to see the person sitting in the gallery and said: ‘I need paint right now’, it was that urgent.”Claire Tabouret: Weaving Waters, Weaving Gestures is atMuseum Voorlindenin Wassenaar until 25 May.Explore more on these topicsNotre DameFranceArtEuropeParisMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not only Norton, in fact, but the stars from the guest lineup who sat alongside Swift when she appeared in October 2025: actors Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith, and fellow chart-topping musicianLewis Capaldi.The whimsical, fantastical video, produced with a retro 90s aesthetic, is written and directed by Swift. Her lonely character befriends a pet rock, while Gleeson’s equally lonely character has a similar friendship with a cactus, before a magical substance – the spray-on Opalite – brings the two together. Norton appears as a salesman hawking a reverse serum, Nope-alite, while Turner-Smith plays a fitness instructor, and Lee mimes along to Swift’s song as a fictional singer-songwriter on MTV. Capaldi plays a mall photographer, while the final guest that week, Cillian Murphy, does not act in the video but appears as a billboard image and provides a voiceover.“The thrill of a lifetime and the hardest secret I’ve ever had to keep!! Thank you thank you,” Norton wrote on Instagram.Introducing the video, Swift called Norton “insanely charismatic and lovable” and said of the October show: “I remember thinking I got ridiculously lucky with the group I was paired with … I was instantly struck with an *idea*.“And so a week later [Gleeson] received an email script I’d written for the Opalite video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn’t mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90’s with us and help with this video.”‘Tickets have become status symbols’: from Harry Styles to Taylor Swift, why is live music bigger and more expensive than ever?Read moreSwift is a relatively regular guest on Norton’s long-running BBC chatshow, appearing five times since 2013, sitting alongside the likes of Bono and John Cleese. Her casting of Norton is a demonstration of his growing transatlantic cachet: clips from his show frequently go viral in the US, and he has himself appeared on Seth Meyers’ US talkshow.Opalite had already reached as high as No 2 in the UK charts when it was first released, but it is likely to shoot up again in next week’s chart from its current position of No 15.The video is available on Spotify and Apple Music, and will appear on YouTube on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftGraham NortonTelevisionLewis CapaldinewsShareReuse this content"

The album became the first Spanish-language work to take home the prize, beating out competition from Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.Fans race to learn Spanish before Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showRead moreWhile making his acceptance speech for best música urbana performance, Bad Bunny echoed theanti-ICE sentimentthat animated many Grammys speeches. “ICE out,” he said. “We are not savages, we are not animals, we are not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” He added, more broadly: “The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.”Eyes on both sides of the aisle will be watching to see if his Sunday performance will contain a more pointed statement.In a Thursday press conference ahead of the showBad Bunnysaid: “I really want people to have fun. It’s gonna be a huge party. I want to bring what people can always expect from me, and a lot of my culture..”The announcement of his headline slot was greeted with both jubilation and hostility. While many artists and activists welcomed his booking, the Department of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski said: “It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the half-time game.”The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said that ICE would be “all over” the Super Bowl.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny hosting Saturday Night Live.Photograph: Will Heath/APBad Bunny broke records last year with alandmark 30-night concert residencyin San Juan, but decided against bringing the show to the US out of fear for his fans’ safety. “There was the issue of – fucking ICE could be outside [my concert],” he toldi-D. “It’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency is a rare example of fame used for good | Adrian HortonRead moreHe responded to critics whilehosting Saturday Night Live in October, following a Spanish-language monologue segment with a winking kicker in English: “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”Since then, there’s been anuptickin social media posts about learning Spanish and Puerto Rican slang, with Duolingo launching a “Bad Bunny 101” course last month to give newcomers a taste of the language.Donald Trump will not be attending this year’s Super Bowl after stating in aninterviewthat the venue in Santa Clara, California, is “too far away”.In regard to Bad Bunny and Green Day, who will perform before kick-off, the US president said: “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.”TheNFLis standing by the booking. When asked about Bad Bunny’s anti-ICE comments at the Grammys, commissioner Roger Goodell called him “one of the greatest artists in the world. It’s one of the reasons we chose him … He understood the platform he was on.”Sunday’s NFL game will mark the second time that Bad Bunny has appeared on the Super Bowl stage, following a 2020 guest appearance during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez’s 2020 co-headline slot.“I really don’t want to give any spoilers,” Bad Bunny said at the press conference. “It’s gonna be fun and be easy, and people only have to worry about dancing.”As the most-watched US television event of the year, Super Bowl ad rates have risen to $10m for a 30-second spot, with many brands presenting their biggest campaigns of the year.A-listers set to appear in commercials this year include Sabrina Carpenter, Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Melissa McCarthy, Lady Gaga and Emma Stone, while some brands are targeting gen Z with ads starring MrBeast, Addison Rae and Chicken Shop Date’s Amelia Dimoldenberg.This year will also mark the Super Bowl’s first mainly AI-generated ad courtesy of the vodka brand Svedka, with a spot that features a robot couple dancing with human partygoers.

Five years elapsed between publication of The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo’s Child, and now it will be more than 20 between The Gruffalo’s Child and the third book. I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn’t think how to develop it.“It was only when the National Literacy Trust, whose work I’m very impressed by, used the first two books as part of their Early Words Matter programme that I was spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story.“To my surprise, I managed to do just that. I was of course delighted when Axel came on board, and am even more so now that I’ve seen the brilliant illustrations he’s done for the new book. I really hope that children – and adults too – will enjoy the new story, as I know what a wonderful experience shared reading can be.”Scheffler added: “Never say never – a lesson learnt for me who, whenever asked, denied the possibility of another visit to the deep dark wood. Till one day out of the blue there came a wonderfully clever and inspired new text by Julia. How does she do this? Could I decline? Of course not.“As I have had to draw the odd Gruffalo and his daughter over the last 20 years, I’m not completely out of practice. I’m also very happy that the Gruffalos will get involved in some charitable activities to reach even more young readers with support from the National Literacy Trust.”The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo’s Child have sold more than 18m copies combined and the books have been translated into 115 languages and dialects.View image in fullscreenJulia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler.Photograph: Urszula Sołtys/PAFans will get the chance to get a first look at the Gruffalo Granny when Scheffler’s never-seen-before illustration is projected in central London and Glasgow on Friday evening.Alison Ruane, the managing director at Macmillan Children’s Books, said: “The impact that Julia Donaldson, Axel Scheffler and The Gruffalo have had on families around the world can not be underestimated, the sheer amount of global excitement following the announcement of the new book has been evidence of this.“We are so proud to publish Julia and Axel here at Macmillan’s Children’s Books, and we can’t wait for children and families to experience this new story together, especially in the National Year of Reading. Get ready for this September, Granny is coming to stay.”Donaldson and Scheffler’s many collaborations include The Snail and the Whale, Room on the Broom, Stick Man, Tiddler, The Scarecrows’ Wedding and The Highway Rat.Televised animations of their best-loved stories have become a staple of the festive calendar and many of their books have also been adapted for the stage.Explore more on these topicsChildren's books: 7 and underPublishingChildren and teenagersnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a stress-inducing case for tropical detective Mervin (Don Gilet), not least because his incorrigible half-brother, Solomon (Daniel Ward), has cheerfully done a runner with most of his wardrobe.Graeme VirtueDevil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy9pm, ITV1If you must dramatise real serial killers’ awful crimes, make a show as sober and thoughtful as this one. The police have captured John Wayne Gacy (Michael Chernus) but are met with disarming playfulness.

So here’s a sequel to the 2022 horror about an AI-led robot that will do anything, including murder, to protect its young human charge. This time, M3gan has been superseded by Amelia, an even deadlier model that’s gone rogue from its military handlers. Allison Williams and Violet McGraw return as inventor Gemma and her niece Cady, who reluctantly join forces – Mission: Impossible style – with the rebooted M3gan to defeat the new bot on the block. With a healthy seam of sarcasm (there’s a superb misuse of a Kate Bush song), plus the odd serious thought about the future of AI, it’s a fun ride.Simon WardellSilver Haze (Sacha Polak, 2023),11pm, BBC TwoView image in fullscreenTrauma tale … Esmé Creed-Miles (left) and Vicky Knight in Silver Haze.Actor Vicky Knight and director Sacha Polak are becoming quite the team. After Dirty God in 2019, they reunited for Silver Haze, another traumatic tale about love, hate and unexpected families. Knight plays a nurse, Franky, who is physically and emotionally scarred after a fire 15 years earlier and harbours vengeful thoughts against those responsible. Then she meets a suicidal patient, Florence (Esmé Creed-Miles), and falls fatefully in love with her. This is far from the “normal” relationship she desires, but Flo’s grandma (Angela Bruce) could help her to a solution.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His subjects range from social and political justice to meditations on poetic heroes such as Elizabeth Bishop and sonnet sequences elegising the writer’s sister. The interwoven specificity and occasional nature of the poems is captivating: one feels their movement, “in the flesh, / in his memory / and in the words”, as they unspool with control and purpose. “I’m still capable of being in love.” This is a poet clearly still in love with life.View image in fullscreenInto the Hushby Arthur Sze (Penguin, £12.99)This first UK publication introduces readers to the current US poet laureate’s bold vision of the world’s fragility: one of unceasing iridescence and glimmer, even in the face of ecological destruction and dilapidation. While the title suggests a sonic organisation, it may be more apt to understand the poems as painterly brushstrokes. “When you’ve / worked this long your art is no longer art / but a wand that wakes your eyes to what is.” Single-line stanzas that decrescendo to em dashes recur, illustrating the silence into which Sze feels both world and body disappearing: “you have loved, hated, imagined, despaired, and the fugitive colours of existence have quickened in your body -”. Even in its continual replenishing beauty, the collection is eerie, as though these poems were a last attempt to bring order to the disorder of living. “What in this dawn is yours?” asks one. Perhaps nothing, because “once lines converge, lines diverge”.View image in fullscreenUnsafeby Karen McCarthy Woolf (Bloomsbury, £12.99)“This is how you learn to stay alive – / sunlight streaming / through branches – / all young girls must remain / alert.” McCarthy Woolf’s taut new book reflects both the semblance of wholeness and the opacities of erasure. Alongside the poems, which broadly meditate on the capitalistic impressionability of bodies and landscapes, are photographs of blasted doll heads, metallic and shattered borders, surveillance cameras sutured to palm trees. “How do we claim / the nothing / that is space?” Photography, maybe. Poetry, most definitely – though the collection also contains essayistic explorations of tattoos: “I started to think a tattoo was a way to reclaim agency over the body…” Juliana Spahr encouraged poets to pay attention to the bulldozer as well as the beautiful bird; McCarthy Woolf extends this ecological ethic to the human and the architectural in this playfully sparse and hypnotic collection.View image in fullscreenOnly Singby John Berryman, edited by Shane McCrae (Faber, £12.99)Babe, wake up – 152 new Dream Songs just dropped! Readers meeting Berryman via Only Sing are not encountering the poems that weren’t good enough to make the first cut in his 60s classic; rather, they’ll discover a poetics of fierce vernacular, meticulous sonics, a consciousness unwilling to partition the demotic from the highly conceptual. “Let’s think of his nature as a kind of mist.” The “he” here is Henry, anthero of the Dream Songs, a prejudiced, nervy, white American man who, beyond the idiosyncrasy of situation, wholly resists classification. Berryman is a master of the line and like no other poet produces a page with variable technical tectonics that can stun or quake, often both: “Drink & sing seems all our fate obliges, / sleep feed make love between whiles, till we die, / & what does then our fate oblige?” A treasure trove for Berryman fanatics and new readers alike.View image in fullscreenLamping Wild Rabbitsby Simon Maddrell (Out-Spoken, £11.99)Loss and candour categorise Maddrell’s debut collection. The speakers feverishly recall desires often accompanied by the contrapositive of shame: “how their smooth twigs age and develop warts / there I go again talking about shame”. While the subjects include memory, life with HIV and the transformation of innocence, the language is steeped in a poetics of interpenetration, observed with a rich descriptive eye: “Polaroid of people gone, re-faced for posterity, / white-powdered cheeks, dust marks death on my pants.” The prize of age is wisdom – “the captive live longer than the wild” – and moments here silence the reader to introspection.View image in fullscreenDream Latitudesby Alia Kobuszko (Faber, £12.99)“Often, I felt I was / on the precipice of some great / feeling,” declares one of 11 poems titled “X”. The letter X? The Roman numeral? Or have the titles been cut away? Approximating a climax that never arrives, Dream Latitudes is a strange debut – strange like waking up in the afternoon’s “armfuls of light”. Kobuszko’s poems are songs littered with accidentals, changing the timbre of their music, sometimes line by line. “There is nothing to do but sleep. There is nothing but sleep. How to exhaust the inexhaustible?” Fields, dreams, songs, birds, green, light, horses, pain – a poet can save these words from cliche if, like Kobuszko, they “unspool” them in a haunting music that neither entices nor repulses. “Tell me you can hear me when I say / in the fields of our dreams I will find you.” This collection breaks many rules, and is all the better for it.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who wouldn’t want to see the formerBake Offstar, after “30 years in our living rooms”, put on such a show? But it’s not quite what Perkins delivers. Like Dawn French before her, ina touring setpurporting to show what a “huge twat” she was, The Eternal Shame of Sue Perkins compiles a series of perky professional and personal anecdotes only loosely connected to that theme, and is judicious with its intimacies.It is stronger in its second half, which cleaves more tightly to the theme and affords more glimpses behind our host’s brisk demeanour. Act one begins with Perkins alluding to her shame at being middle-aged and tired in an industry dedicated to youthful vigour. The ensuing anecdotes have nothing to do with that whatsoever, as she relates an inconclusive tale about local drug dealers cloning her car registration, and a literal shaggy dog story, more suggestive of pride than shame, about rescuing a wounded pup on a trip to Bolivia.In neither instance, one senses, does Perkins let truth get in the way of a lively comic yarn. And she certainly tells them well, embroidering each with lurid details of her own ineptitude. See for example the bilious tale, all sobs and dry heaves, of a drug-addled trip for telly to a South American shaman. That skit is not alone in parlaying Perkins’ public life into comedy: another fineDave Gorman-esque routine, about a story she wrote for a celebrity anthology, obsesses over the statistical likelihood of “being bummed by a Dyson”.But, away from the showbiz world, the show’s most striking passage is about the breakdown Perkins experienced a decade ago courtesy of a benign tumour on her pituitary gland, pitching her into “a posh One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” scenario, vividly outlined here. The rest of the show, all jaunty tales of skin-deep self-abasement, is entertaining enough. But here alone are her protective Russian-doll shells stripped away, and something more meaningful revealed.AtLeeds Playhouseon 6 February.

Centred on a group of teens who have decided that tonight is the night their sex lives finally get moving, it’s a tornado of growing pains and pretence at pleasure.It’s a Friday night, and best friends – and virgins – Chloe (Anushka Chakravarti) and Jess (Ella Bruccoleri) are getting ready to go “out out” for the first time. Joined by their gossip-hoarding friend Phoebe (played by a hysterical Molly Hewitt-Richards), who panics at even the mention of physical contact, they brush their teeth and straighten their hair in anticipation of Anya (Zoë Armer) from the year above arriving to teach them all they need to know. Even better, Chloe’s brother Joel (Ragevan Vasan), who practically shrinks when a girl enters, and his “really, really fit” friend Mel (Alec Boaden) are next door playing video games. With no parents at home and vodka mixers at the ready, the night is a recipe for success.Battye’s script has each room discussing the other as if it contains strange wild animals. The girls gather in the doorway, gawping and gasping at the boys staring at the TV screen, while Anya hands out advice in an effort to assert her power. Sexual experience is currency here, and Chakravarti’s perfectly judged Chloe works hard to impress Anya with fabricated stories and artificial confidence, shunning her true friends in the process. Elsewhere, Joel follows Mel’s advice as if it were drawn from a golden rulebook.View image in fullscreenUnfolding like a horror film … the cast of The Virgins.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe threat of men is never far from view: Phoebe can barely summon words when a boy enters the room, and the girls plan signals to alert one another if they find themselves in uncomfortable situations. Still, desire bubbles beneath their half-open conversations. Watching them perform at adulthood is a queasy, stomach-churning experience.Directed by Jaz Woodcock-Stewart, the play unfolds like a horror film in short, sharp bursts. Between scenes, the stage drops into darkness as dramatic orchestral music blares. When the lights return, each moment feels poised on a cliff-edge, even if some key elements – the rumours surrounding Anya, or the roots of Mel’s speech about feeling let down by women – are left unexplained.Still, Battye’s strength lies in writing scenes that feel utterly authentic. If you’ve lived through the awkward choreography of nights like these, The Virgins lands uncomfortably close to home.AtSoho theatre, London, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Beware of the silhouetted hands!Arifa AkbarFri 6 Feb 2026 11.09 ESTLast modified on Fri 6 Feb 2026 11.38 ESTShareThere is a twinkling irony to the setup of Tim Foley’s ghost story: an out of work actor is enlisted to play the role of a ghost for a week, only to become haunted himself. Joe (George Naylor) is employed by David, a handsome stranger, to circle the grounds of Paragon Hall in order to perpetuate the myth of the country estate’s resident restless soul.What a great gig – he can pay off at his debts with what he earns and exercise his actorly muscles. Of course, Joe gradually begins to wonder if he is the only ghost walking through the woodlands surrounding Paragon Hall, but this drama by touring company ThickSkin does not go the way you think it may. It blends the gothicism of a 19th-century literary haunting with modern horror film jumps and bumps.View image in fullscreenBringing the tingle … It Walks Around the House at Night.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThe storytelling is channelled largely though Joe’s narration, although there is also prerecorded omniscient narration by Paul Hilton, and you savour it for its atmospheric eloquence. The gothic gloom of Paragon Hall looks like “the ancient valley howled and spat out this house”, he says, and later reflects on why ghosts persist in wandering the Earth: “Some say it’s because they hurt so much. I think it’s out of spite.”It is phrases like these that bring the tingle in award-winning writer Foley’s script, alongside the jump scares, of course. Deftly directed by Neil Bettles, these are created by stabs of sound, light and projection (sound design by Pete Malkin, and lighting and video design by Joshua Pharo). The stage features a back screen of bare tree trunks that shift and shake with shadows (set design by Bettles and Tom Robbins).There are some genuinely spine-tingling moments, from Joe’s creepy somnambulism to a scuttling creature in his room and a bigger “thing” whose silhouetted hands resemble Freddy Krueger’s.This entity is more of the natural world, though, with a Pan-like mythology around it. The story becomes excitingly twisty, but revelations towards the end come thick and fast and you cannot always keep up. The Dancer (Oliver Baines) emerges from the woods to tell Joe his story; Joe’s friends turn up; and David brings his own storyline, as does an ex-boyfriend.A lot is fit into 90 minutes without enough unpacking of the supernatural “hurt” here, or the bigger themes of class privilege and exploitation that run through the play. But the show is certainly worth experiencing for its thrills and spills, which stay with you, and follow you home.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 7 February.

Full of exclusively female artists – from Berthe Morisot in the 19th century and Frida Kahlo in the early 20th to contemporary figures such as Tracey Emin – it houses an incredible collection of often overlooked art and artists. We visited on a rainy October day and it was remarkably quiet and calm. I particularly enjoyed the abstract works – well worth a trip up the hill.JamesSecret church in Amsterdam’s red light districtView image in fullscreenOns’ Lieve Heer op Solder church, Amsterdam.Photograph: Frans Lemmens/AlamyOns’ Lieve Heer op Solderis a bit of a mouthful, but it is the best museum I have ever visited. Our Lord in the Attic is a hidden gem in the centre of Amsterdam and well worth a visit. “Our Lord” is a clandestine church originating after the Reformation when Catholics were no longer allowed to hold public holy masses. It enabled Catholics to worship, but only in private; thus creating an incredibly intimate and secretive experience. The canal house feels like a Tardis as you move from what seems like a labyrinth of rooms, all leading to what appears to be a doll’s house church. A sliver of heaven in the middle of the red light district!RyanBerlin’s pioneering socialist artistView image in fullscreenKäthe Kollwitz museum.Photograph: Imago/AlamyI came across theKäthe-Kollwitz Museumonly because I was staying nearby, just off Berlin’s glamorous Ku’damm avenue. This small, intimate building houses probably the best collection of Kollwitz’s prints, drawings, posters, sculptures and woodcuts, inspired by and illustrating her lifelong socialist beliefs with real power and poignancy. Her life and work were profoundly shaped by inseparable personal and political tragedies.LeslieProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The staff are knowledgable and there are some excellent exhibits exploring the history of our relationship with mountains along with displays of mountaineering gear and derring-do over the past 150 years. There’s also a rooftop terrace with a great view of the city and mountains beyond. A fantastic way to spend a few hours and a must for any lover of mountains.Samantha McGradyCaptivating artefacts from the far east, PortoView image in fullscreenSculptures in the Museo Nacional Soares dos Rei.Photograph: Hemis/AlamySet in a late 18th-century palace belonging to the Porto bourgeoisie, theMuseo Nacional Soares dos Reis, founded in 1833, is considered to be Portugal’s oldest art museum.

Don’t miss the tranquil garden at the back of the museum.PeterHomage to Copernicus in KrakówView image in fullscreenThe Collegium Maius at theJagielloniandates back to the 14th century.Photograph: John Warburton-Lee/AlamyTheJagiellonian University Museumhas a wonderful collection for those interested in history and science. The university was founded in 1364 and a young Copernicus (who worked out that the sun was at the centre of the known universe rather than the Earth) studied there in the 1490s. Many objects related to its most famous student and his heliocentric theory are showcased, alongside quirky objects related to the history of the university, and the history of Poland. The guides are very knowledgable, the visit is affordable, and it’s conveniently located in Kraków’s beautiful historical city centre.Aline TMarinhoQuiet contemplation and wonder in BarcelonaView image in fullscreenCaixa Forum, Barcelona.Photograph: Kaprik/AlamyIn a stunningly restored mattress factory (La Casaramona) designed by Catalan modernist architect Josep Puig i Cadafach, you can find theCaixaForum, just up the road from the Plaça d’Espanya in Barcelona. There are some buildings that eclipse the art that’s inside it, but the Caixa specialises in having a revolving display of exhibitions from photography to sculpture to immersive art, in an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and wonder. It is near the Miró Foundation and so many visitors pass it by without realising how great it is. Within its curvy walls there is a cafe for a welcome cold drink.Liz Owen HernandezAn airship and Trump toddlers in PragueView image in fullscreenA steel and wood airship ‘floats’ over the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art.Photograph: Arazu/AlamyI would really recommendDOX Centre for Contemporary Artin Prague. It’s a little way out of the touristy city centre but is an excellent art gallery within a stunning feat of architecture – a steel and wood airship (built in 2016) seemingly floats out of a postwar factory building.

Stendhal syndrome is surely a real risk in this glorious space, as one staggers among the dizzying, gigantic paintings painted in elaborate, decorative detail. Classical mythology and intimate biblical scenes are presented in vast gilt frames alongside looser drawings and watercolours housed in cabinets with pivoting shutters for ease of browsing. A spiral staircase between studio floors adds to the magic and the fascinating private apartments offer insight into a brilliant mind. Truly inspiring.Petra PainterWinning tip: Bronze gods in PiraeusView image in fullscreenBronze statue of Artemis in the Archaeological Museum, Piraeus.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyTheArchaeological Museum of Piraeuscontains a wonderful collection of artefacts spanning 2,000 years of Greek history and is generally less hectic than bigger museums in Athens. In pride of place are the Piraeus bronzes, a truly staggering collection of statues (including the Piraeus Apollo and bronze statues of Athena and Artemis) that left such an impression on me that I now have tattoos of two of them. It’s only 20 minutes from the centre of Athens by train, and is a wonderful place to explore while you wait for your ferry connection to the islands.Ben HolmesView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsCultural tripsReaders' travel tipsCity breaksShort breaksTop 10sMuseumsEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than building it in the glass with crushed ice, as for a traditional caipirinha, this is shaken so that the kiwi jam is mixed into the drink more thoroughly.Kiwi caipirinhaServes1For the kiwi jam3 kiwi fruit3 tbsp sugar3 tbsp lemon juiceFor the drink50ml silver cachaça50ml kiwi jam(see above and method)25ml fresh lime juice, plus a lime wedge to garnish1 splash 1:1 sugar syrup, to taste2 dashes 20% saline solution(that is, 1 part sea salt dissolved in 5 parts water)First make the jam. Peel the kiwis, then blend the flesh to a pulp. Scrape into a saucepan, add the sugar and lemon juice, then heat gently over a low heat for about 10 minutes, until jammy. Decant into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for about four days (use any excess to make more caipirinhas, or spread it on your morning toast).To build the drink, measure all the ingredients into a shaker filled with ice and shake hard until very cold. Single strain into a tumbler filled with fresh ice, garnish with a big wedge of lime (or, if you’re feeling fancy, a slice of dehydrated kiwi) and serve.Jake Garstang, restaurant manager and sommelier,Maré, Hove, East SussexExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"

Make one to share or two individual ones, depending on your mood. They can be made ahead, anywhere from an hour to a full day in advance, and will keep happily in the fridge. If they’ve been chilled for more than a couple of hours, let them sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before serving. They should feel cool against the spoon, but not fridge-cold, which dulls their luxurious texture. A slick of good olive oil and a pinch of flaky salt is a lovely contrast to the chocolate’s richness, but you could also top them with a few edible flowers or a scattering of grated chocolate and a raspberry or two.Valentine’s chocolate pots de creme for twoPrep5 minCook50 minCool/chill1 hr 30 minServes210g softened butter125ml double cream60mlwhole milk1 cinnamon stick½ tsp instant coffee powder75g dark chocolate(60-70% cocoa),chopped into small pieces1 large egg yolk1tbsp caster sugar½ tsp vanilla extract1 pinchflaky sea saltTo serveWhipped cream or creme fraicheGood olive oil1 pinch flaky sea saltBrush a 250ml ramekin (for sharing) or two 125ml ramekins with the softened butter and put them in a small, deep baking dish or cake tin.Combine the cream, milk, cinnamon stick and coffee powder in a small saucepan, then warm gently over a low heat until the mixture just begins to steam – don’t let it boil. Take off the heat, leave to infuse for about 10 minutes, then return to a low heat until hot again.Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Lift out and discard the cinnamon stick from the hot cream mixture, then pour it over the chocolate and leave to stand for a couple of minutes, so the chocolate softens. Whisk gently until melted and smooth.Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. In a second bowl, whisk the egg yolk, sugar, vanilla and salt until creamy. Gradually whisk a little of the warm chocolate mixture into the yolk mixture to temper it, then add the rest of the chocolate, whisking until smooth and glossy.Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a jug, then pour into the prepared ramekin(s). Put the baking dish in the oven and pour in enough just-boiled water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 20–22 minutes for two small pots, or 25–28 minutes for one larger one – the centre should quiver slightly when jiggled.Lift the ramekin(s) from the water bath and leave to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, or up to a day ahead.To serve, top with softly whipped cream or creme fraiche, and finish with a few drops of olive oil and a pinch of flaky salt.Explore more on these topicsValentine's DayThe sweet spotFoodDessertBakingChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"
