Ministers are also looking for ways to mitigate the cuts with extra spending on measures to tackle child poverty, including extra benefits payments for poorer parents of children under five.One Labour MP said: “When people abstained on thewinter fuel vote, they were warned that it had been taken by the leadership as voting against the government. This time, however, a number of MPs have been offered the opportunity to abstain.”Government sources said whipping arrangements had not yet been decided for the vote in two months’ time, but did not deny that potential rebels had been offered the opportunity to abstain.The cuts to benefits have become one of the biggest sources of tension within the Labour party since it came to power. In recent months, backbenchers have beenstripped of potential privilegesfor abstaining on a vote to remove the household cap on winter fuel payments, while severalwere suspendedlast summer for defying the whip over the two-child benefit cap.The vote in June over£4.8bn worth of cuts to disability paymentsis expected to trigger an even bigger backlash from within the parliamentary party. Disgruntled backbenchers say as many as 55 MPs are prepared to rebel at that vote, with more than 100 others still considering their position. Recent analysis by the Disability Poverty Campaign Group showedmore than 80 Labour MPshave a majority which is smaller than the number of their constituents who could lose some or all of their benefits.Labour backbenchers arealso irritatedthat they are being asked to vote on the package without an assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility on how effective the government’s back to work scheme will prove. One MP said: “The obvious truth is that people will lose money under these proposals – including those who clearly don’t deserve to. This can’t simply be spun away. The mood in Westminster may seem calm, but this issue isn’t going to fade quietly.”As well as offering MPs a chance to abstain on June’s vote, ministers are hoping to win favour among backbenchers with a separate package on child poverty which is likely to propose increasing benefits for poorer parents of young children.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will announce the government’s child poverty strategy about the same time as the benefits vote, and is looking for ways to lift children out of poverty without entirely removing the two-child benefit cap. Kendall recentlytold the Mirrorshe would consider it a personal failure if child poverty was not lower by the next election.The Guardian revealed this year Kendall was particularly interested inproposals to boost the incomes of parents of children under five, which is likely to cost less than the £3.6bn it would take to remove the cap altogether.Officials are looking at a suggestion promoted by the Fabian Society thinktank to increase universal credit payments for parents of babies and toddlers.The group found that ministers could reduce child poverty by 280,000 by doubling the child element of universal credit for those with children under one, while raising it by 50% for those with children between one and four. Doing so would give parents of babies an extra £293 per month, and those of toddlers an extra £146 per month, at a cost of £2.4bn a year.Alternatively, increasing the payment by £20 a week for those with babies and £10 a week for those with toddlers would lift 80,000 children out of poverty at a cost of £715m a year.The Fabians recommended paying for the move by reducing or ending themarriage tax allowance, through which married couples can share part of their tax-free allowance.Officials said they were looking at any suggestion that could be shown to take children out of poverty. One said: “There are a lot of discussions and options on the table for what that might look like.”Ministers held a series of meetings with MPs to discuss the welfare changes in the days before the Easter recess in an attempt to take the wind out of any rebellion this summer.At the same time, anti-poverty charities are holding private briefings for MPs to lay out the likely implications of the welfare reductions.One MP said the sessions they had became a forum for backbenchers to vent their anger at the government’s actions. “There is a serious depth of concern about how we got into this mess,” they said. “There’s a growing sense of frustration that the leadership simply isn’t listening.”Others in the party have become irritated at what they see as an organised campaign to exaggerate the impact of the changes. “The network tend to get together, message each other and get terribly worried about these proposals,” said one MP. “But nothing that’s been sent to me has given me hard evidence of cases that are at risk of really losing out.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsBenefitsDisabilityLabourPovertyUniversal creditnewsShareReuse this content"

Under Wednesday’s ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act 2010, this would be scrapped.Senior NHS legal officials and estates and facilities managers are racing to draw up proposals for how hospitals, community care centres and GP practices should reflect the ruling, sources told the Guardian.The ruling poses a challenge for the NHS, which has an estate spanning 25m square metres in England alone, with infrastructure repair bills of more than £14bn. The issue is further complicated by the fact that health policy and spending is devolved in Wales and Scotland.Trans activists accuse UK equalities chief of ‘overreach’ for suggesting bansRead moreKishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity.“There is no confusion as of yesterday, at 10.30 in the morning, and they can start to implement the new legal reasoning and produce their exceptions forthwith, but they have to change it. We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.”Asked if the EHRC would pursue the matter if the NHS did not do so, she replied: “Yes, we will.”An NHS England spokesperson said: “The NHS is currently reviewing guidance on same-sex accommodation and, as part of this process, will consider and take into account all relevant legislation and [Wednesday’s] ruling.”Meanwhile, the BTP, which patrols the railways in Great Britain, announced that male officers would conduct intimate searches of trans women “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”, while trans men would be searched by female officers.Under the force’s previous policy, officers had been told that anyone in custody with a gender recognition certificate would be searched by an officer matching a detainee’s acquired gender.The update comes during a legal battle between gender-critical campaigners and the force over its guidance that allowed transgender officers to strip-search women, so long as the officer held a gender recognition certificate.The rapid change of approach came after Lady Falkner said the EHRC would be issuing updated and legally binding codes of practice on single-sex spaces and services in the wake of the “enormously consequential” court ruling.“We are going to have a new statutory code of practice [meaning] it will be interpreted by courts as the law of the land. We’re hoping we’re going to have that by the summer,” she told Today.She said the judgment meant only biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women’s toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women’s wards in hospitals.Even so, the commission “will not tolerate” discrimination or harassment of trans people, which remains unlawful under the Equality Act, and would support trans women taking out equal pay claims under sex discrimination laws.Falkner said the ruling was “a victory for common sense” but “only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.”The UK government has avoided making any substantial comment on the ruling, but a strong indication of Labour’s approach came from Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, who swung the party behind the supreme court and the EHRC’s stance.Previously a supporter of self-identification for trans people, Sarwar said there was now a need for an “urgent” update of Scotland’s policies on single-sex spaces. Scottish ministers are expected to update Holyrood next week on their response to the ruling.“I’ve always said that we should protect single-sex spaces on the basis of all biological sex,” he said during a visit in Falkirk. “There’s a clear ruling now from the supreme court.”How will UK judgment on legal definition of womanhood affect policy?Read moreThe bulk of the reaction from Westminster politicians continued to come from the Conservatives. Speaking during a local elections campaign visit to Cambridgeshire, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said the court decision was a vindication of their views.She said she would support changes to the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act to cement the court’s view. “These laws were written 20 years ago plus when the world was different. A lot of people are trying to change what the law means,” she said.In contrast, there was little sign of how ministers will help institutions navigate the new framework. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, on a visit to Scunthorpe, dodged some questions on the issue, saying only that more advice would come in “due course”.Among the issues that will need to be tackled is provision of toilet facilities for transgender people, given the EHRC said the ruling means they will not be able to use single-sex toilets.A directive introduced by Badenoch when she was equalities minister last year requires new public buildings such as offices and shopping centres to prioritise single-sex toilets, and to provide universal toilets only “where space allows”.That regulation remains in force, meaning public buildings could become increasingly inaccessible for transgender users.Explore more on these topicsNHSTransgenderHospitalsEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

At this juncture United had gone 4-2 down to a Rayan Cherki strike and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty (on 104 and 109 minutes) that had the French side leading 6-4 on aggregate and apparently dumping Ruben Amorim’s men out of Europe.Manchester United 5-4 Lyon: Europa League quarter-final, second leg – live reactionRead moreBut, no. First, Casemiro went over with Nicolas Tagliafico pulling him and after turning down the spot-kick, the referee, Sandro Schärer, awarded this after being ordered to the monitor. Up stepped Bruno Fernandes to coolly beat Lucas Perri to the goalkeeper’s left.United still trailed as the opening 60 seconds of the five added on-began yet, now, came their auxiliary No 9, Kobbie Mainoo, who, fed by Casemiro, steered through a crowded area to make it 6-6 on aggregate, causing Old Trafford to go ballistic as penalties were surely how the tie would be decided.Except this is Manchester United and their proud DNA of Fergie-time and that 2-1 triumph over Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou. So: enter Harry Maguire to head the winner 34 seconds into added time, put United in dreamland and take the roof off the stadium – Casemiro again the provider, to make it three involvements in the three crucial strikes.United, then, head to Spain for a semi-final first leg at Athletic Bilbao and following this who will wager against them reaching the showpiece at the same venue, after what was, too, a night of redemption for André Onana.With the host broadcaster’s cameras fixed on him before kick-off the No 1 returned a far more accomplished display than last week’s personal fiasco. For swathes of the contest United were also in charge and registered 10 minutes in. Noussair Mazraoui flipped the ball to Fernandes as he cruised along the right, the ball was relayed to Alejandro Garnacho and he ran into a near-post area: the pass to Manuel Ugarte was as precise as the No 25’s left-foot finish that had the congregation in raptures.United were in a smart, fast mode that pinnedLyonback. But they failed to capitalise, allowing the French to breathe easier and raid United’s area. Cherki saw a shot ping off Maguire for a corner. Georges Mikautadze slipped in towards the spot and Maguire hoofed clear.Then, the clearest opening – Tagliaficao crossed, Leny Yoro miskicked, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, roving in behind, snatched at the chance to equalise.Now, United roared back in a moment which thrilled. Diogo Dalot fashioned a long parabola from his half and Fernandes, running in, stretched to power a volley that left Perri a spectator and crashed off the bar, drawing “oohs” from the crowd. More followed when Rasmus Højlund swivelled and fed the irrepressible Fernandes: again the attempt beat Perri, but this time spiralled wide.United hurtled for the break like a train, the period finishing with their second. It was route-one stuff, in high-class fashion. Maguire, deep in his territory, dropped a 70-yard pass into Dalot, the wing-back shrugged off Tagliafico, then coolly rolled home, off Perri’s right post.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo celebrates his equaliser in the 120th minute.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAMazraoui, perhaps injured, was replaced by Luke Shaw as the second half whistle blew, as Garnacho claimed a free-kick via a rapier thrust. The Argentinian flier can lack composure but here he was uber-calm when sprinting after a Højlund defence-splitter. Entering the area and making an amateur of his marker, he steadied, then blazed at goal, only Perri’s acrobatics stopping a certain third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Lyon could pull one back, a grandstand finish would be in store and so it proved.Mikautadze might have done the trick but the No 69 slashed the ball wide in a moment as panicked as Dalot’s was slick when, moments later, he again bested Tagliafico.Suddenly, he was in Lyon’s area and crossing but no teammate could finish.From the Stretford End came the “Ruben Amorim, he’ll bring the glory days again” song and, as Lyon fans lit red flares, the continental dream remained firmly on.Now, though, came Lyon’s fightback: Tolisso beat Onana with a header after Moussa Niakhaté and Lacazette nodded on and with United in disarray, a Maitland-Niles laser was repelled by an Onana leg but he could do nothing to stop Tagliafico’s equaliser, the No 1 exposed by shoddy defending.On 89 minutes came Tolisso’s dismissal – a precursor to the heart-stopping, box-office end to the evening.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueManchester UnitedLyonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A second cabin was above a precipice on Mount Faito and fog delayed the rescue effort, reports said.The cable car had just reopened for the summer season and prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into the accident.“The cable car reopened 10 days ago with all the required safety conditions,” said Umberto de Gregorio, the head of the cable car company. “What happened today is an unimaginable, unforeseeable tragedy.”The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni expressed “sincere condolences” to the families of the victims, her office said.The cable car has been operating since 1952 and a similar accident in 1960 also left four dead.In 202114 people died when a cable car linking Lake Maggiore with a nearby mountain plunged to the groundin northern Italy. In 1998, a US fighter jet flying at a low level on a training flight cut a steel cable, killing 20 people in a cable car in the Dolomites.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday evening the force said the case was now being treated as a murder investigation, led by its major crime team.A 41-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman, who are both known to Veisi, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. Officers said they are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with the investigation.Veisi is described as having long, curly black hair.

Picts, Scotti and Saxons took advantage of Britain’s descent into anarchy to inflict crushing blows on weakened Roman defences in the spring and summer of AD367.Senior Roman commanders were captured or killed, and some soldiers reportedly deserted and joined the invaders. It took two years for generals dispatched by Valentinian I, emperor of the western half of the Roman empire, to restore order. The last remnants of official Roman administration left Britain about 40 years later.Warning of the possible consequences of drought today, Tatiana Bebchuk, a researcher at Cambridge’s department of geography, said: “The relationship between climate and conflict is becoming increasingly clear in our own time, so these findings aren’t just important for historians. Extreme climate conditions lead to hunger, which can lead to societal challenges, which eventually lead to outright conflict.”The study, published in Climatic Change, used oak tree-ring records to reconstruct temperature and precipitation levels in southern Britain during and after the barbarian conspiracy. Combined with surviving Roman accounts, the data led the authors to conclude that severe summer droughts were a driving force.Little archaeological evidence for the rebellion existed, and written accounts from the period were limited, said Charles Norman of Cambridge’s department of geography. “But our findings provide an explanation for the catalyst of this major event.”Southern Britain experienced an exceptional sequence of remarkably dry summers from AD364 to 366, the researchers found. In the period AD350-500, average monthly reconstructed rainfall in the main growing season was 51mm. But in AD364, it fell to 29mm. AD365 was even worse with 28mm, and the rainfall the following year was still below average at 37mm.Prof Ulf Büntgen of Cambridge’s department of geography said: “Three consecutive droughts would have had a devastating impact on the productivity of Roman Britain’s most important agricultural region. As Roman writers tell us, this resulted in food shortages with all of the destabilising societal effects this brings.”The researchers identified no other major droughts in southern Britain in the period AD350-500 and found that other parts of north-west Europe escaped these conditions.By AD367, the population of Britain was in the “utmost conditions of famine”, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, a soldier and historian.Norman said the poor harvests would have “reduced the grain supply to Hadrian’s Wall, providing a plausible motive for the rebellion there, which allowed the Picts into northern Britain”.The study suggested that grain deficits may have contributed to other desertions in this period, and therefore a general weakening of the Roman army in Britain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They reconstructed the climate conditions immediately before and after 106 battles and found that a statistically significant number of battles were fought following dry years.Explore more on these topicsRoman BritainHistoryDroughtnewsShareReuse this content"

The police said he had been involved with training programs at the police force.Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the shooting, which began around lunchtime just outside the student union, sending students and frightened parents hiding for cover in a bowling alley and a freight elevator inside the building.The suspect “had been in the Leon county sheriff’s office family, engaged in a number of training programs that we have”, McNeil said. “So, it’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons. This event is tragic in more ways than you people in the audience could ever imagine, from a law enforcement perspective.”The suspect’s mother has been with the sheriff’s office for more than 18 years, McNeil said.The officials confirmed that the suspect was currently being treated at a hospital.Ambulances, fire trucks and patrol vehicles from multiple law enforcement agencies had raced toward the campus that sits just west of Florida’s state capital after the university issued a shooter alert at midday, saying police were responding near the student union.“Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding,” the state’s governor,Ron DeSantis, wrote on X.The gunfire was reported at the student union building on the FSU campus and students and faculty were advised to shelter in place as police responded. More than 42,000 students attend classes at the main campus.Videosposted on social mediashow students being evacuated from the scene.By midafternoon the Florida State University campus had been secured, according to the Tallahassee police department. Multiple law enforcement agencies remained on site for the ongoing investigation. The student union and the surrounding area were still considered an active crime scene.Earlier, hundreds of students streamed away from the direction of the student union. Students were glued to their phones, some visibly emotional, while others hugged each other. Dozens gathered near the music school waiting for news.The Tallahassee Memorial hospital confirmed it was treating six patients wounded in the shooting, one in critical condition.Ryan Cedergren, a 21-year-old communications student, said he and about 30 others hid in the bowling alley in the lower level of the student union after seeing students running from a nearby bar.“In that moment, it was survival,” he said.Donald Trump opened his Oval Officemeetingat the White House with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, with comments on the shooting, saying he had been fully briefed.“It’s a horrible thing. It’s horrible that things like this take place,” the US president said.Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old daughter Jaime Guttenberg, who was murdered in the 2018 Parkland high school shooting, said ina post on X: “America is broken.”“As a father, all I ever wanted after the Parkland shooting was to help our children be safe,” he said. “Sadly, because of the many people who refuse to do the right things about reducing gun violence, I am not surprised by what happened today.”Guttenberg also said that many of his daughter’s friends who survived the Parkland shooting are current students at FSU.University police escorted the students out of the union after about 15 minutes of hiding.A junior student, Joshua Sirmans, 20, was in the university’s main library when he said alarms began going off warning of a shooter. Law enforcement officers escorted him and other students out of the library with their hands over their heads, he said.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said in a social media post that the justice department was in touch with FBI agents on the scene. Students and faculty were instructed to seek shelter and await further instructions.“Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures,” the alert said.The Leon county school district, where Tallahassee is located,posted on X: “All LCS schools are back to normal operating procedures.

Pemberton, who was jailed for 32 months, had a long history of eye disease and was informed on several occasions by different clinicians that he should not drive, the inquest heard.He also repeatedly failed to declare his sight deficit on licence applications to the DVLA.Ferguson died when she was struck by a van driven by Vernon Law, 72, in Whitworth, Rochdale, on 11 July 2023. A month before the incident, Law was told he had cataracts in both eyes but he lied to an optometrist that he did not drive.Law, who was jailed for four years, knew he had problems with his eyes for years before the collision and also failed to declare his sight issues on licence applications to the DVLA, the inquest at County Hall heard.Adeley said: “The four fatalities shared the same feature that the driver’s sight was well below the standard required to drive a car.“The current system for ‘ensuring’ drivers meet the visual legal standards is ineffective, unsafe and unfit to meet the needs of society as evidenced by the deaths of Marie Cunningham, Grace Foulds, Anne Ferguson and Peter Westwell where the DVLA continued to provide licences to drivers who had failed to meet the legal sight requirements.”The Department forTransportsaid it would consider the coroner’s report once received.A spokesperson added: “The NHS recommends adults should have their eyes tested every two years and drivers are legally required to inform the DVLA if they have a condition which affects their eyesight.“We are committed to improving road safety and continue to explore ways to achieve this.”Explore more on these topicsTransportDVLATransport policyNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But between friends? Hey, we can work it out.Even if Italy boasted one of Europe’s biggest trade surpluses with the US, such disagreements could be bridged with recourse to the previously uncoined creed of “western nationalism”, argued Meloni, speaking in confident, lightly accented English, although she admitted she did not know if it was “the right word”.“I know that when I speak about west mainly, I don’t speak about geographical space. I speak about the civilization, and I want to make that civilization stronger,” she said, in terms that the president and his attendant cabinet members-cum-courtiers surely lapped up.“So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions.”After all, Meloni pointed out, they were on the same side when it came to one existential struggle, “the fight against the woke and ADI [sic] ideology that would like to erase our history.”The acronym was a bit confusing. Did she mean DEI? But no matter, her audience got the general gist.Trump’s ‘chosen one’ Giorgia Meloni heads to Washington to play delicate balancing actRead moreMeloni, 48, has been labelled “Europe’s Trump whisperer” – deemed capable of awakening the concealed angels of his nature that other Euro-leaders cannot reach. She has spent time at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home, and was the only European leader invited to his inauguration in January.Here, in the Oval Office, the whispering was having a soothing effect. The president smiled indulgently, before going off on several“weaves”during which he attacked Joe Biden,the federal reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates, Biden again, “activist judges” who were blocking his deportation agenda, then Powell once again.But it was standard Trump. The man who had publicly browbeaten Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, and barely tolerated Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer on their White House visits was the very picture of a gracious host.Even JD Vance – whose boorish interventions blew up the Zelenskyy visit and nearly did the same to Starmer’s – kept his trap shut, proof indeed that all was going swimmingly.Then disaster threatened.An Italian journalist insisted on asking the prime minister a question in her native Italian.Mamamia!Meloni looked disgusted. Weren’t they all supposed to be western nationalists here, defenders of the same civilization. Why emphasize differences?She played along reluctantly, her features relaxing slightly as she embarked on an extended discourse, but her body language betraying her as she lifted both feet off the ground, one crossed leg folding behind the other. Trump watched her intently all the while.When she finished, an American journalist tried to ask another question but Trump interjected: “No, wait, I want to hear what you said.”It was over to Meloni’s female interpreter, sitting nearby, who revealed: “Prime Minister Meloni was asked … what she thinks about the fact that President Trump holds Zelenskyy responsible for the war in Ukraine.”It was a discordant, yet key, moment – and the prime minister knew it. As the interpreter tried to continue, Meloni – perhaps sensing this was unsafe territory, not least because she has, for the most part, stuck with the western support for Ukraine that Trump is on the brink of abandoning – took over interpreting her own answer.She limited her explanation to vowing to raise Italy’s contributions to Nato, currently at below 1.5% – well below the 2% minimum agreed, and far short of the 5% Trump has lately demanded.Then it was the president’s turn. “I don’t hold Zelenskyy responsible,” he said, a retreat from hisprevious false accusations that Ukraine started the war. “But I’m not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. I’m not happy with anybody involved.”If anybody was to blame, he went on, it was Biden – the default scapegoat for every wrong – because, after all, everyone knew the war would never have started if Trump had still been president.No blame was attached to “President Putin”, the man who actually was responsible for starting the war. “Now I’m trying to get him to stop,” said Trump.For the unfortunate Zelenskyy, widely praised across the west for standing steadfast in defense of his country when it was under attack, there was little charity.“I’m not blaming him. But what I’m saying is that I don’t think he’s done the greatest job, OK? I’m not a big fan, I’m really not.”It was a telling moment of just how far the west’s center of gravity had shifted in the few short weeks since Trump’s return to power. And an uncomfortable one, even for Meloni.Then the conversation moved on to to the common ground of combatting migration – and it was back to the whispering again.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGiorgia MeloniItalyTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Governments, meat suppliers and retailers have promised to clean up their act, but one of the biggest hurdles is a complex and obscure supply chain that can hide the origins of meat products.From birth to slaughter, most of the cattle raised in the Amazon are moved around multiple farms. Before sale to big meatpacking companies such as JBS (the world leader), they may spend up to 75% of their lives on indirect supplying ranches. This system creates loopholes and blind spots in oversight, which allow “cattle laundering”, as it is known, where cattle from illegal or deforestation-linked farms are mixed into the supply chain. Farms that have been linked to deforestation may be embargoed by the Brazilian environment agency IBAMA.Global consumers of Brazilian beef cannot know for sure whether their burgers and steaks caused destruction of the rainforest until there is a way to track the entire supply chain, which can be understood as follows:How beef is ‘laundered’ in the AmazonIllustrated flow diagramExplore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestMeat industryFarmingCattleBrazilFarm animalsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s just a shame that we don’t get more of him in this show about helping people with facial differences overcome their issues with the way they lookLucy ManganThu 17 Apr 2025 18.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere are two ways to view Love My Face, Channel 4’s latest venture into one of its best-loved terrains – the place where medicine and society meet. The first is as a testament to man’s inhumanity to man, based on the accounts of lives made miserable by bullying and exploitation of the slightest visible difference sported by an individual. The second is as a shining example of the human spirit’s ability to endure adversity and forge a new, better life out of suffering. Over the four hour-long episodes you may find yourself pinging back and forth many times between the two.The format is familiar. At a specialised treatment facility, a group of people are brought together who have varying degrees of facial differences – ranging, for example, from a conventionally handsome young man with a keloid scar growing just noticeably on the back of his earlobe, to a man who was set on fire by his mentally ill uncle and suffered burns over nearly half his body, including his face and scalp. A team of doctors awaits to provide them with their medical options. And presenter Jono Lancaster, who has Treacher Collins syndrome, which means the bones of his face did not develop in the usual way before birth, offers emotional support and ways of thinking about their conditions and situations that may enable them to come to terms with them better – and perhaps avoid physical intervention.Lancaster is a gift to television generally, and this programme in particular. A natural communicator, he is also that rare breed who has clearly lived through much, analysed it thoroughly and internalised what worked for him in such a way that he can share it with others in direct, ordinary and therefore deeply affecting terms, instead of sounding like a therapised robot. He speaks with a wonderful combination of authority and compassion. You can see even the most traumatised patients falling under his spell and beginning to heal almost in real time.And there is real trauma here. Most notably, perhaps, in Kerry’s story. She longs to get rid of a stubborn double chin that persists despite her losing several stone after a lifetime of being overweight. Her size was one of her abusive father’s favourite subjects of attack, which left her no respite from the other comments she received at school and in public. “That’s how I felt before I was allowed to become anybody,” she says. She is now slim and, it is implied, has been in therapy before. But her chin, she explains on the verge of tears, “is what’s left of my dad. I’ve tried so hard to get rid of his voice.” Now she wants the physical reminder gone too.Love My Face is (ironically) a superficial production. Whatever the actual extent of Jono’s discussions with each participant, we are shown very little of it (but enough, as I say, to appreciate his talent for connecting and supporting each one according to their needs). More time is spent with the medics and their proffered plans – all of which are taken up by their subjects, most of whom have been denied further treatment on the NHS because it is “only” cosmetic – and on the obligatory reveals after the necessary weeks or months of care. For any deeper meanings or lessons to be learned, the viewer must do his or her own running.View image in fullscreenMia’s alopecia was acquired during adolescence and caused her to be tormented at school.Photograph: Channel 4It is fascinating, for example, to note the impact on the participants of a characteristic acquired during adolescence, such as Mia’s alopecia, and the repeated mentions of becoming self-conscious only as they were tormented at secondary school. It’s a painful reminder of how very little you need to deviate from the norm at that time to be marked – by yourself and by those around you – for life. We hear that Hattie was called a “minger” and “ugly” for her “Concorde” nose, and has “always been shut down … I feel like I shouldn’t be here.” Kayleigh talks of her “shame” about the port wine stain birthmark that covers part of her face, and says she hasn’t left the house without makeup since she was first old enough to apply it.You can also wonder at the gulf between people’s perceptions of themselves and the reality. There are a couple of times in the series when it is hard to see what is troubling a participant – with even fellow guests struggling – until it is pointed out. It is unclear whether anyone’s perspective shifts when they are in the company of people whose differences are far more marked. This also makes you question how much of Jono’s magic would be required to undo the harm social intolerance has caused the participants (who, for the most part, are not physically circumscribed in any way by their conditions) so that they can go without the medical interventions on offer.The programme itself, however, is content to end with the big visual reveals and words of gratitude to Jono for helping them find some peace with their experiences. Good enough, I suppose.Love My Face is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHealth & wellbeingreviewsShareReuse this content"

That means more to us than being defined by our hearing status,” says PJ, as they prepare backstage for a TV show in Seoul. “Through our activities, we’d rather be seen as artists who give strength and inspiration to people.”Alpine skier, YouTuber and health workerBefore Big Ocean, the trio were on entirely different paths.“I was an alpine skier for about four years, competing in national disability winter competitions,” says 22-year-old Jiseok, the group’s youngest member and main dancer, who has been deaf since infancy and uses hearing aids.PJ, 25, was a YouTuber creating content about hearing impairment awareness. He lost his hearing through a childhood illness and uses a cochlear implant in his left ear and a hearing aid in his right.Chanyeon, the eldest at 27, worked at Korea University Anam hospital for four years as an audiologist before joining the group.

The group synchronises by using specialised metronomes that flash in time with the music, vibrating smartwatches that pulse to the beat, and numeric displays that visually count measurements.When recording vocals, Big Ocean collaborates with AI specialists who track each member’s vocal characteristics and then create a voice model that helps them refine their performances.“It’s a collaborative process,” says PJ. “When things get difficult, our staff support us, helping us adapt and overcome challenges together.”Their music focuses on the themes of perseverance, hope and unity. Their debut song,Glow, encourages listeners to “draw the world we’ll create together in the sky”. Later releases, likeBlowandSlow, continue this optimistic narrative by emphasising resilience and never giving up.K-pop idol Rosé of Blackpink fame grew up in Australia – but she could never have made it big here | Wing KuangRead moreThe singleBright, released in February, features lyrics written by students with intellectual disabilities who used AI tools, and artwork created by students with visual impairments.The group’s upcoming second mini-album, Underwater, marks a shift from youthful freshness to a more mature concept, revolving around the metaphor of mermen who discover their true power beneath the surface, with tracks representing a journey from submersion to awakening.What drives the three through the tough times is their connection with a global fanbase, affectionately called “pado” (Korean for “wave”).“They [the fans] are so considerate,” says PJ. “Even when things are tough, their generosity gives us strength. We have video calls with fans worldwide … No matter how tough things may be, I read their message as my motivation.”‘Seeing them … gives me hope’That motivation works both ways.Fan Nicolle Brown, from North Norfolk in the UK, has a chronic illness. The 32-year-old says: “It’s incredibly uplifting and inclusive, with their use of sign language in their performances bringing that extra touch that’s personal to them and something new to bring to the industry as a whole.“Seeing them accomplishing wonderful things despite the drawback of not being as able-bodied as the average person gives me hope.”View image in fullscreenFan Kirsty Spencer says Big Ocean are ‘something the music industry needs: true representation that disabled people rarely see in the media’.Photograph: 조태형/Parastar EntertainmentKirsty Spencer, 33, from Tipton, England, says: “Big Ocean inspires me in a lot of ways…. They are something the music industry needs: true representation that disabled people rarely see in the media.”Jazmin Tannie, 29, from South Wales, says it’s easy to feel left out as a disabled K-pop fan, but Big Ocean’s “meaningful lyrics make many of us feel seen and understood in ways we haven’t experienced before”.Haley Cha, the CEO of Parastar Entertainment, had previously encountered significant obstacles when promoting artists with disabilities in modelling and acting, so she turned to K-pop as a “last bastion” for inclusion. She is confident in Big Ocean’s potential.“My goal is to make Big Ocean the post-BTS phenomenon,” she says. “Just as BTS broke stereotypes about Asian artists succeeding globally, Big Ocean can challenge preconceptions about artists with disabilities.”Big Ocean’s tour begins on 19 April in Lausanne, Switzerland. “We’re really looking forward to travelling abroad and trying different foods,” says Chanyeon, smiling. “Any recommendations?”Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaDisabilityAsia PacificPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was as if he’d just got out of bed.”The man in the wheelchair wasPope Francis, who had come by to thank Piñeiro and her colleague, Michela Malfanti, for their work.It was the second time in a few days that the pontiff,who almost diedin February during a severe bout of pneumonia, had made a surprise public appearance since being discharged from hospital on 23 March, defying doctors’ orders to rest for at least two months. On the first occasion he appeared at Sunday mass in St Peter’s Square. He alsoprivately metKing Charles and Queen Camilla during their state visit to Italy.Francis delegated cardinals to lead Holy Week liturgies, although he maintained the Maundy Thursday tradition of visiting inmates at Rome’s Regina Coeli prison, and is expected to make another appearance during Easter Sunday mass.But the jaunt to the basilica from his home next door in Casa Santa Marta was daring. Not only was he without his traditional papal robes – something that irked the more conservative faction of the Catholic church – but Francis, who is using a nasal cannula to help him breathe, readily shook hands with both restorers, as well as a child who was in the basilica.“We hesitated to approach him as we thought he might have felt a little ashamed because he wasn’t officially dressed,” said Piñeiro. “But he didn’t care. He seemed like a very happy, curious person.”The Vatican’s spokesperson said the next day that the outings were proof that the pope’s health is improving.But there are possibly other motives at play.“If you think back to when he was elected pope and decided to forgo the traditional vestments and to live in Casa Santa Marta, he came in as a maverick,” said Christopher White, Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. “Now, at 88, and after a very serious hospitalisation, he continues to be a maverick.”White believes the reasons are twofold: “One, he really does believe that being with people is the best medicine. As a pastor, he has a duty to be out and public-facing,” he said. “But I also think there’s a political calculation. He’s politically astute and would have read the papers and all the endless speculation about his health, possible resignation and conclave. I think he’s trying to channel pretty concrete ways of saying ‘I’m here, and I’m in charge’.”Pope Francis has pushed the limits throughout his papacy, for example going to Iraq in 2021 despite being strongly advised against it because Covid-19 was still raging and the security risks were high. He revealed in his autobiography, Hope, published in January, thathe escapeda double suicide bombing during the trip after the attempts on his life were foiled by British intelligence and Iraqi police.He embarked on more than 40 overseas trips and kept up a busy schedule before his hospitalisation.Meanwhile,the Catholic church is in the midst of a Jubilee year, with millions of pilgrims visiting Rome. Another significant event –the canonisation of Carlo Acutis, the church’s first millennial saint – takes place on 27 April.“He keeps pushing the limits to see how much he can do,” said Robert Mickens, a Vatican commentator. “Whether that’s a wise thing to do or not, that’s up to other people … but he realises that it’s very unlikely he will get back to where he was before he went into hospital. Easter is a big holiday with lots of pilgrims expecting to see him, so he’s thinking, ‘let’s just do it’.”Javier Martínez-Brocal, Vatican correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC, and author ofthe bookConclave: the Rules For Electing the Next Pope, said that after Francis’s near-death experience, the pope just wanted to “live in the present”.“He probably feels strong and thinks it’s useless to be locked up indoors,” he said. “So he thinks these are reasonable risks to take. He wants to show that he’s still present, and to see how far he can push it.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismReligionChristianityItalyEuropeThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, new evidence could get him another day in courtSimon HattenstoneThu 17 Apr 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 13.03 EDTShareForJeremy Bamber, 17 April is D-day. Today, he hopes his case will be sent back to the court of appeal for the second time, and his many supporters believe this will lead to his conviction for murdering five members of his family being quashed after 40 years in prison. They say this is an unsafe conviction at the very least, but maintain Bamber did not and could not have carried out the horrific crimes. Others, including most of Bamber’s surviving relatives, remain convinced that Bamber murdered his mother, father, sister and her six-year-old twin boys and should never be released.It could also be a huge day for theCriminal Cases Review Commission(CCRC), the body responsible for sending alleged miscarriages of justice back to the court of appeal. When the commission started in 1997, it was a beacon of hope for the wrongfully imprisoned – the first independent organisation set up to investigate and refer miscarriages of justice. But over the years it has fallen into disrepute, widely condemned as tardy, conservative and inept.Bamber’s story is not simply that of a potential miscarriage of justice. It is also the story of how long it can take to challenge a conviction.Take his latest submission to the CCRC. It included 10 grounds for appeal, including new evidence showing that Bamber’s father, Nevill, rang the police 10 minutes before Bamber did so; police tampering with the crime scene; the existence of a second gun silencer when the trial judge insisted there was only one; and the fact that the police had seen signs of life inside the house while Bamber was with officers outside. So far, the commission has spent four years dealing with four of these pieces of evidence. At this rate, it would take another six years to consider the case, by which time Bamber would be 70. It is believed that the decision to accelerate his case has been made to save the CCRC from further criticism.View image in fullscreenComposite: ANL/Shutterstock/Guardian DesignBamber and I have been in touch for almost 15 years. In 2011,I interviewed himwith the lateEric Allison, then the Guardian’s prisons correspondent, with whom I often worked. Allison was passionate about the case. We asked Bamber how he stayed sane in prison. His answer was either poignant or chilling, depending on your perspective. He said he walked and talked with his father, his mother, his sister and her children – the very family he was convicted of killing. “In my mind, I walk with my dad more than anybody on a daily basis and think: how would he cope with it? What would he think about it all?” He told us about a picture he had on the wall in his cell – a drawing by a friend that shows Bamber standing outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, his hands raised in triumph. “I look at it all the time,” he said.The massacre at White House FarmIt’s 7 August 1985. At about 3.30am, the police receive a call from Bamber. Remember the time – it becomes increasingly significant. He tells them his father has phoned to say Sheila Caffell, Bamber’s sister, who has schizophrenia, has got hold of one of the Anschütz shooting rifles on the family farm. Bamber tells the police that the line then went dead. He gives them the address – White House Farm, Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex. The police say they will attend immediately. They ask him to leave his home, three miles away, and drive to the farm, where they will meet him.Even the most stout defender of Essex police would accept that the incident was appallingly handled. The police stood outside the house for almost four hours, unsure what to do. When firearm officers finally entered at about 7.40am, they discovered a massacre. The crime scene was then compromised in numerous ways – objects and victims appear to have been moved; evidence was burned or not undisclosed; witness statements were changed; police trampled over the bloodied farmhouse.Few British crimes have been covered with the salacious relish of the Bamber murders. And few have divided opinion so profoundly. The case had everything – ghoulish murders in a remote setting, a Georgian farmhouse, characters that could have been drawn from an Agatha Christie novel, fights over inheritance, religious extremism, myriad unanswered questions and a police force at war over the identity of the killer.Nevill was a respected former RAF pilot, a successful farmer and a magistrate. His wife, June, was a much-loved mother, according to Bamber; according to others, she was a religious maniac who made the lives of her two adopted children a misery. Sheila, their 28-year-old daughter, had been a successful model known as “Bambi”. And then there was Bamber. The handsome 24-year-old was thought to have acted strangely after the massacre and was charged with murder seven weeks later.The prosecution said he had made it look like a murder-suicide, motivated by greed and hatred of his parents. The main evidence against him was provided by Julie Mugford, a girlfriend whom he had jilted weeks after the deaths of his family. Bamber was remanded in custody and, 12 months later, convicted of all five murders on a 10-to-two majority verdict. He was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison, which was upgraded in 1988 to a whole-life tariff by the then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, although Bamber was not made aware of this until 1994. Bamber has challenged the legality of his whole-life tariff. The judge at Bamber’s trial described him as “warped” and “evil, almost beyond belief”. If Bamber committed the crimes for which he has been convicted, that description is fair.The original senior investigator, DCI Thomas “Taff” Jones, was a tough Welshman who didn’t deal in doubt. From the moment he saw the scene, he was clear he was dealing with a murder-suicide. After all, Sheila was found with the gun, a bible by her side and a fatal wound to her throat.In March that year, Sheila had been discharged from hospital after being treated for a psychotic episode. Colin Caffell, her ex-husband and the father of the twins, wrote to Nevill after Sheila was released, saying he feared for the “health, safety and stability” of the boys, Daniel and Nicholas, when they were with their mother. He asked Nevill to broach the subject of them coming to live with him “most of the time”. “We all know that Sheila lives in her own little world and is almost oblivious to anything but her own thoughts,” he wrote. “She’s been like that for a long time and the boys are now obviously finding this very distressing.” Colin wrote that “witnessing their mother’s religious illusions has been most traumatic for them, to say the least”. During Sheila’s hospitalisation, the boys had lived with their father in London; when the tragedy happened, they were spending a week’s “holiday” on the farm with their grandparents and Sheila.Three days after the murders, Bamber’s cousins Ann Eaton, David Boutflour and Anthony Pargeter met Taff Jones and said they didn’t think Sheila could be the killer, because she was hopelessly uncoordinated and inexperienced with guns. (One family member, who doesn’t want to be named, says now: “Poor Sheila couldn’t pour a cup of tea without spilling it.”) They believed Bamber had killed the family for the considerable inheritance – in their wills, Nevill and June left £380,000 and £230,000 respectively, while the family business, N&J Bamber Ltd, was worth £400,000.But the cousins’ version of events, it seems, made no sense to Taff Jones. After all, there had been sightings of movement within the house when the police had been outside with Bamber. A radio log stated that firearms officers had been speaking to someone in the house at 5.25am. By then, Bamber had been with them for well over an hour. It seemed an open-and-shut case, as newspapers reported in the days after.View image in fullscreen(Clockwise from top)White House Farm; June Bamber, Sheila Caffell and her sons, Nicholas and Daniel; Bamber leaving a police car.Composite: Guardian Design; Ted Blackbrow/ANL/Shutterstock; Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy; PABut Taff had not accounted for the persistence of his junior and namesake, DS Stan Jones. Stan Jones became suspicious when he attended the house after the massacre and noticed Sheila had been shot twice in the throat. What kind of suicide victim shoots themselvestwicein the throat?The reality was more complicated – and remains a mystery. After the killings, six officers made statements saying Sheila had one bullet wound to the throat. The doctor who pronounced life extinct and the coroner’s officer referred to a single shot. In 2011, it emerged that officers carrying out training exercisesmoved the gunon and off Sheila’s body to ensure it was safe. Some supporters believe the police accidentally shot her a second time. It sounds unlikely – but the handling of the whole investigation was unlikely.It appears the cousins found a more sympathetic listener in Stan Jones, who didn’t much care for the belligerence of Taff Jones. (The chief inspector was later sidelined from the investigation, then died shortly before the trial after falling from a ladder.) Eaton, who ran a caravan site with Bamber, told Stan Jones that Bamber didn’t look like a man who was grieving. She said he had been acting oddly – laughing and larking about with friends, flogging his parents’ valuables, spending money with abandon. Eaton was convinced that he shed crocodile tears at the funeral.She discovered that the kitchen window at the farm didn’t close properly and suggested that Bamber could have escaped through it after carrying out the murders, leaving the house apparently locked from the inside. Her father, Robert Boutflour, who has since died, provided the police with an elaborate plan for how he believed Bamber carried out the murders.By now, Stan Jones, who died in 2014, was on a mission to nail Bamber. Three days after the murders, David Boutflour contacted Stan Jones to tell him he thought he had found significant evidence in a downstairs cupboard – a silencer, also known as a moderator, that appeared to have blood on it. The blood was tested. It appeared to be a potential match with Sheila’s. Stan Jones then carried out another test. He attached a silencer to a gun and asked somebody the same height as Sheila to pretend to shoot herself. She was unable to do so. The silencer increased the length of the gun and meant she couldn’t reach the trigger. Stan Jones believed he had his killer.Julie Mugford, the hitman and the trialThis is where Julie Mugford enters the picture. The day after the murders, she had told police that Bamber phoned her between 3am and 3.30am, saying: “There’s something wrong at home.” In her initial interview, she said she was tired and had not asked him what was wrong, even though he sounded worried. Soon after the murders, Bamber broke up with her and Mugford’s best friend, Lizzie, told her she and Bamber had slept together. On 4 September, another woman phoned him in Mugford’s presence and it became apparent that he was asking her out. Mugford smashed a mirror and slapped him. He twisted her arm behind her back.After this, she told friends he had been planning the murders for a year because he was hungry for his inheritance; he and Sheila stood to inherit 50% each of the estate, so long as he was still working on the farm. One of these friends called the police. On 7 September, a month after the killings, Mugford gave a new statement, contradicting her first. She said Bamber had hired a hitman, a local plumber, to kill the family and paid him £2,000. Mugford said Bamber had told her hours before the attack that it was “tonight or never” and that he had phoned her in the early hours to say: “Everything is going well.”There was only one problem. When the police arrested the plumber, he had a cast-iron alibi. Mugford then changed her story and said Bamber had carried out the killings himself.A few months before the murders, the office of the caravan park run by Bamber and Eaton had been burgled and £980 taken. Eaton suspected Bamber of the theft. The police asked Mugford whether she knew anything about the burglary. Mugford admitted that she and Bamber were responsible. The police then asked if she had anything else she wanted to confess. Mugford admitted she had carried out 13 cheque frauds and smuggled and sold cannabis.Bamber came across – or was made to come across – as unlikeable ... a villain from central castingShe had put herself in a tricky situation. If Bamber was prosecuted, she could be charged as an accomplice. If he wasn’t, she could still be charged for the other offences. It seems the police agreed not to charge her if she testified against Bamber. In late 1985, the assistant director of public prosecutions, John Walker,wrote to the chief constable of Essex policestating: “With considerable hesitation, I would suggest that Mugford be advised that she will not be prosecuted in respect of these matters. Thereafter she will be called as a witness in the case against Bamber.”After he was convicted, she did an interview with the News of the World about their relationship, accompanied by a revealing photoshoot. It later emerged she was paid £25,000 for the interview, enough to buy a two-bedroom flat and start a new life.The trial relied on Mugford’s evidence, but it also depended on the silencer. Mr Justice Drake told the jury that if they believed the silencer was used in the murders, the killer had to be Bamber. After 16 days at Chelmsford crown court in October 1986, the jury retired to consider its verdict. The members couldn’t reach a unanimous decision. Drake told them he would accept a majority verdict. The jury wrote a note to the judge asking whether the blood found deep in the baffles of the silencer was a perfect match with Sheila’s. Drake, who died in 2014, said it was and that it didn’t match any other family member. But that wasn’t true. Shortly before the trial, forensics had shown that the blood was also an identical match with Robert Boutflour, Bamber’s uncle. This was known to the defence, the prosecution and the judge. However, for reasons that are unclear, the defence never used it. Bamber is convinced if it had been used, he would never have been convicted. In any case, the jury came back 21 minutes later and found Bamber guilty. The courtroom was silent except for the sobs of two jurors.After Bamber was convicted, there was a vicious fight over the inheritance. June’s sister Pamela Boutflour, Robert’s wife, initially inherited the family estate, which included various business interests, property and land. However, in 1992, an out-of-court settlement was reached with Jacqueline and Anthony Pargeter (the children of Nevill’s sister) after they brought a civil suit regarding Nevill’s estate. Ann Eaton (the Boutflour’s daughter) and her husband, Peter, moved into White House Farm with their family. They still live there today.When I first spoke with Bamber in 2011, he had been waiting for seven years for the CCRC to respond to his second submission. A year later, they refused to refer his case back to the court of appeal.My colleague Eric Allison and I worked as a team for many years. But it was he who was close with Bamber; he became a patron of the Bamber campaign. Since he died two years ago, I have made an effort to get to know Bamber better.It hasn’t been easy. At times, it feels as if he speaks a foreign language. He is so focused on the minutiae: if you can’t distinguish between gun silencers, blood types in the baffles of a silencer and the significance of a call at 3.26am rather than 3.36am, you are lost. Myriad documents were disclosed in 2002 and 2011 and Bamber spends his life forensically examining and re-examining them, hoping they will prove his innocence.But underneath the facts and figures, there is a complex person. Years ago, he told me his greatest sense of hurt was over the way his parents have been portrayed in the press as cold, controlling and dysfunctional. He says this couldn’t be further from the truth: “Mum and dad were the sweetest parents you could imagine and they took care of Sheila and I to the very best of their abilities.” In 1991, Bamber asked for a polygraph examination – also known as a lie-detector test – and, in April 2007, he was given one in prison. He passed. He hoped this might help clinch his freedom, but it made no difference.He blames relatives for the way the family has been depicted. “They told anyone who’d listen what awful parents my mum and dad were,” he says. He believes it suited their narrative. “My relatives were happy to portray me as someone who had been abused by my dysfunctional mum and dad, instead of supporting them as the lovely, kind, generous, hard-working people that they were. They wanted to portray them as [people] who deserved to be killed by a nutter son who had suffered at their hands for all these years.” Most of our communication over the years has been by letter. The Ministry of Justice refused to add me to Bamber’s phone list or to allow me to visit him in prison. Sometimes, his friends have asked him questions on my behalf.View image in fullscreenA police officer with the rifle and the silencer presented at the trial. Evidence of a second silencer(below)was shared with the Guardian in 2024.Composite: Guardian Design; PAHis mother has been depicted as a religious zealot. He says this is untrue. “She didn’t ram it down people’s throats, as people said. As children, she liked us to say our prayers at bedtime, but she didn’t go on about it all the time. I think her Christian faith and studying of the Bible was more because of her frustration at not having enough to do. She would love to have gone to university. Her religious fascination was more the philosophical studying, though she did believe strongly in it.”If he is innocent, it’s hard to absorb the scale of the injustice – imprisoned for the murder of five family members he claims to love. All the time, he is aware of the ticking clock. “I’m an old man now,” he told Allison and me 14 years ago. “I’m 50 and I feel it.” He had already spent more than half his life in prison. That was when he first alluded to the importance of clearing his parents’ name. “If Mum and Dad were around, they would be proud that I had the self-discipline and staying power to keep with this as long as I have,” he said. In finding him guilty of the massacre, he believes the court besmirched his family’s name. If his sister was the perpetrator, it doesn’t dilute the horror, but it is less shaming, because she was ill.As for Sheila, he says she developed a religious fervour, but believes that was part of her schizophrenia. Again, he talks of happy childhood memories – his big sister looking after him, then visiting her in London when she was a successful model and hanging out with her glamorous friends. “Sheila was wonderful as a sister, but as her mental illness started to kick in, it became difficult to engage with her, because we didn’t understand schizophrenia. She was a very kind and gentle child, that’s all I can say, really.”When she was found, the blood-stained Bible next to her was open at Psalms 51-55. (“Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.”). The theologian Susan Gillingham prepared a report for Bamber’s first submission to the CCRC on the significance of the psalms in relation to Sheila’s mental state. Gillingham said anyone who knew the psalms well would turn to them as a means to express “their own penitence at the evil within themselves and outrage at the evil words and actions performed against them by others”.Hugh Ferguson, Sheila’s psychiatrist, gave evidence at the trial. But in a statement in 2002, he said he had been unaware the Bible was open at the psalms. In 2011, having read them, he said: “They contain in them the themes which, over time, I knew were exercising Sheila Caffell. In short form, the struggle between good and evil, or God and the devil.” Ferguson had also been unaware of the letter Colin Caffell had sent to Nevill, suggesting he broach the subject with Sheila of the children living permanently with their father. If Nevill had pleaded Colin’s case to Sheila, it could have had a “potentially catastrophic effect on her”, said Ferguson. “She may have projected on to her father a concept of evil.”View image in fullscreenBamber arriving at court.Photograph: Anglia Press AgencyAs I work my way through hundreds of documents – a tiny fraction of the total – I wonder how Bamber can be so phlegmatic if he is innocent. “Knowing how my family died, and why, makes it much easier, because I haven’t got someone to hate and despise,” he tells me. “I just understand mental illness can manifest in really horrific ways. There’s also time. Forty years ago, I felt very different. But today I feel much more empathy with Sheila than maybe I ought to. But I just do. I’ve come to terms with it and feel sad for everyone.”Bamber was taken into police custody on 8 September, a day after Mugford said he was the killer. He was interviewed over a period of five days, the first two of them informally by Taff Jones, without a solicitor. Among other things, he said the night before the murders there had been a debate at the dinner table between Sheila and their parents about the twins being put into foster care.For the next three days, he was forcefully interrogated by Stan Jones. Bamber was asked whether he murdered five members of his family and told they had proof that Sheila had been killed, yet appeared to be asked few specifics about the murders – for example, where were his blood-spattered clothes (none were found) and whom did he kill first?Instead, he quizzed Bamber about the order of his phone calls. Eventually, Bamber says, he got confused and gave inconsistent replies about whether he had phoned Nevill or Mugford first. But he still did not believe he was the prime suspect: “At the end, DCI Taff Jones stormed in and said: ‘This is a load of nonsense; we don’t believe Julie.’” On 13 September, Bamber appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court and was granted bail on charges of burglary of the caravan park office. He then went to St Tropez for 10 days with a friend. On his return, he was greeted at Dover docks and charged with five counts of murder.Was Bamber convicted more on character than on the strength of the evidence? He came across – or was made to come across – as unlikeable: the playboy cad who couldn’t wait to inherit the family money, who had slept with his girlfriend’s best friend, who started selling the family treasures and took himself off to the south of France for a luxury holiday just after his family died, who smiled smugly after the funeral and as he was being driven to prison in the police van. A villain from central casting.Bamber takes me through these points. Yes, he did have a liaison with Mugford’s best friend. Yes, it was bad behaviour. But no, it wasn’t the seduction that was depicted. “All three of us were friends. Lizzie said to Julie: ‘When you were away, Jeremy slept with me.’ Well, it was her sleeping with me, that’s the way it was.” He sounds embarrassed. There is no dignity in his argument, but it’s important to him in the way things played out. “Julie always said: ‘If I ever find out you slept with Lizzie, I will kill you,’ and that is why she tried to kill me.” Mugford admitted to the police that, after learning about Bamber and Lizzie, she had tried to smother him with a pillow, saying: “If you were dead, you would always be with me.”As for selling off the valuables, he says he sold things only once he realised Ann Eaton, who had a key to the farm, had taken valuables without his permission. She has always said she took them for safekeeping because she didn’t trust him.He laughs off the idea he was a man about town. For one thing, he says, he was too mean. “The only nightclub I ever went to was Peter Stringfellow’s, because Sheila used to take me and Peter would let me in for free because he remembered me as a 14-, 15-year-old sneaking in with Sheila and her friends. I was too tight to spend all that money in fancy nightclubs. It’s just not my thing.”In the 2020 ITV drama series White House Farm, he is shown living it up by the pool in France, drinking cocktails. He admits he spent one night in a hotel, paid for by an older woman with whom he had a fling. The rest of the time he was in a caravan. Why did he go on holiday just after his family had been killed? He says his head was all over the place and he was desperate to get away. It wasn’t a good look. “We all cope with grief in different ways. Normally, relatives and especially grandparents would have raced around and supported me.” The only relatives he had left believed he was a murderer.Then there is the infamous smile. Bamber tells me it is easy for photographs to lie without the benefit of context. “I’d been crying profusely, sobbing embarrassingly, because we’d been brought up not to show that kind of depth of emotion. I got back in the funeral car and people asked how I was and I did that smile to reassure them.”The “incriminating” photograph used most frequently shows him smiling as he is driven off in a police van. “They use that all the time. My friends were on the pavement and I was just smiling at them and waving goodbye. Again, it was to reassure them.” He says that is his character: he has never wanted people to worry for him. He didn’t want it when his parents were killed, nor when he was charged with their murders; neither does he want it when people visit him in prison. “I’m not sobbing and feeling sorry for myself, because I’m not that kind of guy. I want to reassure people that I’m OK – and most of the time IamOK. I don’t want people to leave the visits and see me sobbing my eyes out and feeling sorry for me. I want people to go away saying: yeah, Jeremy’s strong and he’s doing OK.”The creation of the CCRCIn 1997, 12 years after Bamber was jailed, the CCRC was established. Before then, alleged miscarriages of justices were dealt with by a shady Home Office department known as C3, which was neither independent nor well resourced. The CCRC was created after a series of high-profile cases from the 1970s were exposed as miscarriages of justice. In 1989, the convictions of theGuildford Fourwere quashed, followed by those of theBirmingham Sixand theMaguire Sevenin 1991. These cases featured a mixture of false confessions, police misconduct and nondisclosure, the last two of which Bamber claims have led to his wrongful conviction. The idea was that the CCRC would hire a group of well-paid experts with the drive, expertise and time to thoroughly investigate suspect convictions and order them to be returned to the court of appeal where necessary.By the time the CCRC was established, Bamber had already been refused the right to appeal by the Home Office. Prisoners can apply for permission to appeal a crown court decision and usually have to do so within 28 days of conviction. Bamber had argued that the judge had misdirected the jury in his summing up of the trial. In 1989, three years after being found guilty, he was told his submission had been rejected and would not be returning to the appeal court.The creation of the CCRC gave Bamber new hope. He had entered a second submission three years earlier to the Home Office, which was now transferred to the CCRC. He was convinced that, with its statutory investigative powers, the commission would expose the many inconsistencies and failings in the investigation and trial and refer the case back to the appeal court. Sure enough, in 2002, it did.“I had to wait until DNA testing became advanced enough to test the sound moderator for traces of blood,” he says. “The DNA test was eventually done on the baffle plates inside the sound moderator and it was shown that there was none of Sheila’s DNA present. The next day, my case was referred to the court of appeal.” Bamber also argued that his conviction was unsafe due to police misconduct, including alleged corruption, failure to disclose crucial evidence, destruction of evidence, concerns about witness credibility and inheritance-related motives not being disclosed.He was so convinced he would be a free man by Christmas 2002 that he didn’t bother ordering a Christmas lunch. He told anyone who would listen that his conviction was about to be overturned. But,in a 522-point judgment, the three appeal court judges concluded that no conduct on the part of the police or the prosecution would have adversely affected the jury; the more they examined the details, they said, the more they thought the jury had reached the right conclusion.In 2004, Bamber made a new submission to the CCRC. He was convinced he had compelling new evidence. Scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, which the jury had been told suggested a struggle between Bamber and his father, did not appear to exist in the original crime scene photos. “On the evidence of the scratch marks alone, you may find Mr Bamber guilty,” the trial judge had said. Experts had also concluded that the wounds were consistent with “the rifle not having a silencer attached”. Again, the jury had been told use of the silencer was enough to convict Bamber.View image in fullscreenJeremy Bamber with Julie Mugford;(below)the coffins of Neville and June Bamber and Sheila Caffell leave the church.Composite: Guardian Design; Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix; PA Images/AlamyThis time, the CCRC did not refer Bamber’s case back to the appeal court. It stated that the new evidence and legal arguments presented were “matters of pure speculation and unsubstantiated allegations”. Bamber was devastated. He argued that the CCRC had failed to thoroughly investigate his case and that there was a conflict of interest, because its then investigations adviser, Ralph Barrington, was formerly the head of criminal investigations at Essex police.Over the years, the CCRC has become increasingly enfeebled. Critics have suggested it is not truly independent of the MoJ. In 2013, full-time commissioners who had been on salaries of nearly £94,000 wereput on minimum one-day-a-week contractsat the insistence of the MoJ. At one point, the CCRC had onlynine commissioners, although by statute it is required to have at least 11.In 2018, Allison and I, with our colleague Owen Bowcott, reported that a group of prominent lawyers haddeemed the commission unfit for purpose. The lawyers had found that a record low of 0.77% of cases seen by the CCRC had been referred to the court of appeal in 2016-17. “Almost all the cases being prepared by professionals working in this field are being refused,” said Matt Foot, then of the civil liberties law firm Birnberg Peirce, now a co-director of the miscarriage-of-justice charity Appeal.Last year,Andrew Malkinsonhad his rape conviction overturned after serving 17 years in prison. He had first applied to the CCRC 15 years earlier.Writing in the Guardian, Malkinson said: “It was left to my legal team at the charity Appeal to do the work the CCRC should have done long before. Appeal commissioned further DNA tests and uncovered disclosure failures that finally forced the CCRC to send my case to the court of appeal in January 2023.” He was exonerated in July 2023. In January 2025,the head of the CCRC, Helen Pitcher, resigned. She claimed she had been scapegoated over the Malkinson failings and pointed out that the organisation was under-resourced.When asked about Bamber’s case, a spokesperson for the CCRC said: “Mr Bamber has now made three applications to the CCRC. Following a review, the first application in 1997 led to Mr Bamber’s case being sent to the court of appeal, and his conviction was upheld. The second application to the CCRC in 2004 did not result in a referral. A third application received in 2021 is currently under thorough review. It would be inappropriate to comment any further while this review is ongoing.“The CCRC has received more than 33,000 applications in its 28-year history and made more than 850 referrals to the appellate courts. We employ a range of staff from many backgrounds, with skills and experience appropriate to the difficult work they do.”The New Yorker and new evidenceBamber’s legal team made its third submission to the CCRC in 2021. Again, they were obliged to find new evidence to prove his innocence. Bamber has always believed his father contacted the police to say Sheila had “gone crazy” and got hold of a gun. In fact, it had been part of the previous submission. But the CCRC concluded the argument was unconvincing. This time, Bamber believes he has proof of the calls.In 2011, he received 347,000 pages of documents initially withheld by Essex police under public interest immunity laws, which no longer apply after 30 years. In this mass disclosure, he came across an incomplete rolling police log. It starts with an entry at 3.26am stating that “Mr Bamber” had called from White House Farm at that time. It reads: “Daughter Sheila Bamber aged 26 [sic] yrs has got hold of one of my guns.”Neither the jury nor Bamber’s legal team had knowledge of this document. What they had seen was the note of Bamber’s report to the police. “Father phoned (age 62) ‘Please come over your sister has gone crazy + has the gun’ Phone went dead.” This was timed at 3.36am, 10 minutes after the call apparently from his father. At the trial, it was suggested to the officer who had taken the call from Bamber that he had intended to write 3.26am, rather than 3.36am. He reluctantly agreed that this could have been the case.Years later, it became apparent why this was crucial for the prosecution. The first police car was sent out at 3.35am, a minute before the time given for Bamber’s call. This makes sense only if Nevill had called 10 minutes earlier, at 3.26am. Another document that Bamber came across through bulk disclosure revealed that the officer was still on the phone to him at 3.37am.In 2016, a documents expert, Dr Chris Davies, studied the new evidence and concluded the most likely reason for the inconsistencies was the obvious one – there were two phone calls. “I consider that this would be my preferred explanation for them,” he said.If Nevill did call at 3.26am, it puts Bamber in the clear. It would be impossible for him to travel the three-and-a-half miles home, over the sea wall and moonlit fields on his mother’s “sit up and beg” bike, as the prosecution claimed he had done after the murders.View image in fullscreenThe police report recording a call from Jeremy Bamber at 3.36am.Last July, the New Yorker publishedan exceptional 17,000-word article by Heidi Blakeabout the Bamber case. Blake had done the investigating the CCRC had seemingly failed to do in the four years since Bamber’s most recent submissions. She interviewed surviving officers, including Nicholas Milbank, who had been monitoring the open line into White House Farm.Milbank is one of the great mysteries in the case. He never made a statement for the investigation or the trial. His only appearance was in a 2002 inquiry, known as Stokenchurch, by the Metropolitan police into the original investigation. In the Stokenchurch inquiry, there is a reference to a 999 call that had come from the farmhouse at 6.09am. Underneath is a statement attributed to Milbank saying he had monitored the open line, but heard nothing until the police entered. There is no mention of a 999 call. Surprisingly, the statement is unsigned.View image in fullscreenA police log, timed at 3.26am, reporting that Nevill had called to say Sheila Caffell ‘has got hold of one of my guns’.Blake got in touch with Milbank, who still works for Essex police. He told her that a 999 call had come in at 6.09am from inside the farm and that he had heard human movement. Blake asked him if that suggested somebody was alive in the house. “Well obviously,” he replied. She said he was taken aback when she told him there was a statement in his name saying he had heard nothing. He had given no such statement, he said, and nobody had asked him for one.Soon after publication, Bamber wrote to me. He was delighted by the piece and once again convinced he would soon be a free man. “The real crime is that from 6.09am on 7 August 1985, Essex police knew someone else was alive and inside the farm and that they made a 999 call. That fact was concealed from the courts, the public, the media et al. My view is that this is what I’ll win my freedom on, the falsifying of a police officer’s witness statement, without his knowledge.” But his self-belief camouflaged a more muted realism. In saying that ultimately he believed this would clear him, he also acknowledged that he might have a much longer wait. The CCRC is not considering the evidence uncovered in the New Yorker article.In response to Bamber’s allegations, a spokesperson for Essex police said:“In August 1985, the lives of five people, including two children, were needlessly, tragically and callously cut short when they were murdered in their own home by Jeremy Bamber. In the years that followed, this case has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the court of appeal and the CCRC – all of these processes have never found anything other than Bamber is the person responsible for killing his adoptive parents Nevill and June, sister Sheila Caffell and her two sons Nicholas and Daniel. Essex police have continued to comply with all legal requirements in this case and will continue to assist the CCRC as required.”But already something positive has come out of the New Yorker article. Although the CCRC still has six grounds to investigate, it is expected to rule on the first three or four grounds today. He believes the decision has been expedited by media reports about the commission’s failings and the New Yorker article. Bamber says if his case is not referred back to the appeal court, he will have the decision judicially reviewed immediately. He tells me he is getting ever closer to restoring the reputation of his parents.I find it hard to comprehend. A man who has spent 40 years in prison for murdering his family says he is more interested in clearing his parents’ names than his own. I think of what he said to Allison and me all those years ago about spending time in his head with his mother, father, sister and nephews. Does he think of his family as much these days? “As time goes on, my memory fades,” he tells me. “But yes, of course, I think of them, particularly on birthdays. I was thinking about my mum and what we used to do on Mother’s Day. Dad and I would go off to get chocolates and cards and it was fun. We’d give Mum breakfast in bed. So it does still come back, but it’s not as strong as it was 40 years ago. Sadly, memories fade. They just do.”Would somebody who had murdered his family admit that his memories of them were fading? Would somebody who told his girlfriend that he was planning the murder and that it was “tonight or never” finish with her a few weeks later? Surely he would be wedded to her in guilt and their terrible shared secret for life?The second silencerIt’s 4 November 2024. Bamber’s style of letter writing has not changed over the years: big block capitals on lined prison paper sent from HMP Wakefield. Today, there is no disguising his excitement. “Before I answer all your questions, I am going to share some breaking news with you.” He says he has found definitive photographic proof that there were two silencers, something the police and prosecution have always denied. Since day one, he has claimed there were two. (Bamber believes the silencer has always been a red herring – that Sheila shot the family without using a silencer.)He tells me he is not giving the exclusive of the new silencer to the Guardian; he owes it to another media outlet that helped him track it down. But he sends me pictures and trusts me to keep the news under my hat. The silencer shown in the new pictures looks much like the previously disclosed silencer, except there is a piece of yellow tape wrapped around one end.In 2018,Frank Ferguson, the head of special crimes at the Crown Prosecution Service, wrote to Bamber’s lawyer Mark Newby, saying: “Any evidence that suggests that there was or may have been another silencer for the rifle would raise the possibility that the other silencer was used during the shooting and not the one alleged by the prosecution. Such a possibility would significantly undermine the case against JB and any material supporting such a possibility would plainly be material which casts doubt on the safety of the conviction.”March 2025, Hove. I visit Philip Walker, one of Bamber’s campaign team and a semi-retired finance manager. Walker splits his life between work and Bamber. Has he fought for a miscarriage of justice before? “No, never,” he says. What drew him in? “I was adopted through the church, like Jeremy, so I was interested when I read about him. And his father was a big character, well known locally, and so was mine. Then I read a book about him and came to the conclusion that the case was fatally flawed.” He started to read more and more about Bamber. “In one of his blogs, he wrote about his father and it struck a chord. The way he spoke about him, I thought: that is not somebody who’s pumped eight bullets into his dad.” Seven years on, Walker could be a Mastermind contestant with Bamber as his specialist subject.Bamber phones when I am with Walker, who asks questions about his daily life. How does he fill his days when not researching his case? “Just doing normal jail,” Bamber says. “I go to work in DHL, packing bags for the prisoners’ canteen. I do a bit of gym. It’s very basic stuff. I go to work, I get visits, use the phone, write letters to people and that takes a lot of time. Keeping up with correspondence. All the lovely people who support and love and care for me while I’m in jail.”In many miscarriages of justice there is a good reason for prosecutors to pursue the suspect: a false confession, made under duress; suspicious behaviour; an unrelated crime. Bamber thinks the caravan park burglary gave the police grounds to suspect him of the murder. “It was a stupid thing to do and I didn’t think it through, but when they asked me about it I admitted it straightaway. And they used that to say: ‘Well, if you’re prepared to do that…’” He trails off.View image in fullscreenBamber in 2020.Photograph: Andrew Hunter/PABamber insists he was taking back money he believed belonged to him. He also says he wanted to prove to Ann Eaton, after a series of break-ins, that they needed security cameras. He succeeded in making his point, he says, and she agreed to install CCTV.Ann Eaton and her brother David Boutflour declined to talk to the Guardian for this article. They have always insisted that they have no doubt about Bamber’s guilt and denied that their suspicion of Bamber was motivated by financial considerations.Mugford, who has rarely spoken publicly about the case since selling her story to the News of the World, later worked at a primary school in Canada. In 2001, she said: “As far as I am concerned, nothing has changed – I sincerely believe he is guilty. Do I stand by my original story? Yes, absolutely. I always assumed he would be in jail for life.” She did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Bamber believes that, after confessing to crimes in her police statement, Mugford was trapped. “You think to yourself: well, you’d have never been a teacher if all that had come out. And that pressure – if you don’t give evidence against Jeremy we’ll probably charge you with doing it with him … And all those other criminal activities you’ve done without Jeremy we’ll charge you with them.” Bamber was initially charged with burglary of the caravan site, but the case was later dropped. Mugford was not charged with any crime.Bamber hopes the CCRC will refer his case, but he is already planning for the next stage if he is knocked back. His capacity for seeing the glass half full has always amazed me. How does he keep going? “I’ve got fantastic support. I’ve got people who love me and people who I love. Even though I’m in jail, in life, I’ve been very lucky to have that, because many people don’t. I have had a good life in many ways because the experience I’ve had and the people I’ve met have been so interesting.” It’s an astonishing thing to say – jailed for 40 years and yet, in some ways, he still feels lucky.Bamber says his conscience is clean. “I know I didn’t murder my parents. What’s happened to me has happened to me, and I’ve just gone away and coped with it and lived the life I’ve lived and I’m OK. Of course, seeing me recognised as innocent is important, too. But that motivated my campaign for only a few years – I don’t need to prove I’m innocent, I just am. Now, what motivates me is showing that my mum and dad were loving and generous and wonderful to me and Sheila and that this whole thing was a tragedy, not a murder.”He may not need to prove his innocence to himself, but he needs to prove it to others. Whether the CCRC believes he has done enough to merit another appeal remains to be seen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So are the benches, flower boxes, front doors, post boxes and the plinth under the bust of the half British 19th-century playwright Baron Taylor. In fact, anything that does not move has been tagged.View image in fullscreenGraffiti on the monument in Place de la République in Paris.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesNow Paris city hall has declared war on the vandals and promised to track them down, prosecute and seek fines for some of the estimated €6m (£5.1m) of damage they cause every year.The latest anti-tag campaign is being waged by Ariel Weil, the mayor of France’s central district covering the first to fourth arrondissements on the right bank of the Seine. Weil is particularly infuriated by the repeated vandalism to the Marianne, the female symbol of the nation and a listed historic monument.“I’ve asked police to use cameras and I will take legal action each time and work out the cost to the city in each case,” Weil told Le Parisien. “Everyone needs to work together: city hall, the police and the courts. People have to know that damaging a public building is not nothing.”François Louis, the president of an association of Parisiens who use city hall’s official DansMaRue app to signal damage, dumping and antisocial behaviour in public spaces, says he has heard it all before.He said a core group of about 50 “serial taggers” were responsible for half of the tags across the city and had been operating with impunity for decades.View image in fullscreenCity hall has said it will seek fines for people who ‘tag’ buildings with stylised initials or names for some of the estimated €6m of damage they cause each year.Photograph: Elsa/Getty Images“Some of these serial taggers are arrested, released and are back tagging again the next day. Some take pictures or film themselves and post on social media. They act with total impunity,” Louis said.“We need to catch those who do it time and time again. It shouldn’t be beyond the capability of the national police to investigate, in fact it’s disconcertingly easy. They should be taking images from CCTV, matching it to phone mast records and tracing these serial taggers.”He added: “Can you image if Notre Dame was tagged? When the Gilets Jaunes tagged the Arc de Triomphe it was headline news so why are we letting these people vandalise the historic monument at Place de la République?”Paris police prefecture says the number of tagging cases it has handled increased by 51% in the last two years from 317 to 479. Those taken to court and convicted can face up to two years in prison and fines of up to €30,000 for the most serious damage.Despite repeated threats of clampdowns, there has been only one prosecution in three years. In 2022, a Paris court sentenced a man known as Six Sax to two months in prison and gave him a €17,000 fine.City hall says the cost of repairing the damage falls not only on public authorities but also on private property owners if the graffiti on a building is above the first floor. Officials also worry that the chemicals used are causing permanent damage to the stone of monuments and buildings and the trees.Emmanuel Grégoire, a former deputy mayor of Paris who hopes to be elected as city mayor next year, said the authority had been compiling files on the worst serial taggers with a view to producing evidence for any eventual court cases.“These investigators take photographs and look at social networks and AI to identify the signatures,” he said. “Many of the taggers are not anonymous but operate under their own names with a sense of impunity.”Sitting in a cafe just off Place de la République, Grégoire pointed to tags all along the facade of a building opposite. “They’ve gone along from balcony to balcony tagging the wall. It’s a real problem all over Paris but this is one of the worst-hit areas.”Louis said the ubiquitous tags are a stain on the city’s magnificent Hausmannian avenues of the Grands Boulevards.“They’re like dogs pissing against a wall to mark their territory,” he said. “It gives a very poor impression. People who have a certain image of the city in their mind arrive here and see whole districts trashed by tagging.”Explore more on these topicsParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they are a chilling indication of the executioners we don’t knowCorinna LainThu 17 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 09.15 EDTShareBeing an executioner is not the sort of job that gets posted in a local wanted ad. Kids don’t dream about being an executioner when they grow up, and people don’t go to school for it. So how does one become a death row executioner in the US, and who are the people doing it?This was the question I couldn’t help but ask when I began a book project on lethal injection back in 2018. I’m adeath penaltyresearcher, and I was trying to figure out why states are so breathtakingly bad at a procedure that we use on cats and dogs every day. Part of the riddle was who is performing these executions.Seven years later – and with theTrump administrationpromising more executions to come– I have an answer, sort of.We do not, and for the most part cannot, know precisely who is under the executioner’s hood. State secrecy statutes put the equivalent of a Harry Potter cloak of invisibility over these state-sanctioned killers. But litigation files and investigative journalism have revealed a number of executioners’ identities, allowing us to peek behind the veil of secrecy for a glimpse of who these people are.The return of the firing squad is a defeat for death penalty supporters | Austin SaratRead moreConsider Missouri’s chief executioner from 1995-2006, Dr Alan Doerhoff, who was responsible for 54 of Missouri’s 65 executions between 1976 and 2006. He didn’t push the syringes – shockingly, non-medical prison guards did that – but he did most everything else. “Nobody will ever do as many [executions] as I have,” he would later boast.Doerhoff’s identity was revealed when a lawyer for a condemned prisoner checked the prison’s chemical dispensary logs and discovered that 2.5 grams of sodium thiopental (the drug used to anesthetize the prisoner) had been used in previous executions. The state’s protocol called for 5 grams, double that amount. The prisoner sued.State officials first told the court that the chemical dispensary logs were wrong. But the next day, they wrote again to “apologize to the court and the parties for providing incorrect information”. The logs were correct. The amount of sodium thiopental being injected was wrong.Troubled by the finding, the court allowed the prisoner’s lawyers to conduct a limited deposition of the state’s chief executioner. The executioner stated under oath that he had problems mixing the drugs, “so right now we’re still improvising”. He also said that he “sometimes transpose[d] numbers”.View image in fullscreenThe Missouri correctional center in Bonne Terre.Photograph: James A Finley/AP“I am dyslexic,” he explained. “So, it’s not unusual for me to make mistakes.” (Doerhoff later stated that he was not dyslexic, he just sometimes mixed up numbers.)Missouri doubled down on its executioner, telling the court that it was confident in his competence and planned to continue to use him in future executions. But the court rejected the state’s assurances, writing that it was “gravely concerned that a physician who is solely responsible for correctly mixing the drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of condemned inmates has a condition which causes him confusion with regard to numbers”.The state appealed, but soon thereafter, investigative journalism discovered Doerhoff’s identity. Jeremy Kohler with the St Louis Post-Dispatchbroke the storyin January 2008, and with it came another shocking revelation: Doerhoff had been sued for medical malpractice more than 20 times, and his hospital privileges had been revoked at two hospitals. Doerhoff had also been publicly reprimanded by the state medical board for hiding his malpractice suits from the hospitals where he practiced.All of this was known to the Missouri attorney general’s office when it assured the court of Doerhoff’s professional competence. After oral arguments, the state dropped its appeal of the ruling.The following year, Missouri’s legislature passed a law stating: “A person may not knowingly disclose the identity of a current or former member of an execution team,” authorizing punitive damages for violations.“Their answer to the public finding out they had an incompetent doctor was making it impossible to find out who the doctor is,” an ACLU spokesperson stated.No longer able to serve as Missouri’s executioner, Doerhoff joined the staff of a localhair-removal businessand served as an executioner for the federal government and at least one other state – Arizona.Arizona knew about the trial court’s ruling in Missouri, and the facts behind it. But it hired Doerhoff anyway, and he conducted an execution for the state in 2007, just months after being barred from conducting executions in Missouri.When attorneys found out about Doerhoff’s involvement, the prisoners next in line for execution in Arizona sued.Arizona settled that suit in 2009, agreeing to a number of changes in its lethal injection protocol, including formal background and license checks of its executioners. But during the litigation, attorneys for the prisoners discovered that Doerhoff wasn’t the only executioner who had no business conducting executions.One of Arizona’s three IV team executioners was medical team member #3, who was once a nurse but had his nursing license suspended. At the time of the litigation, his occupation was running an appliance business in another state. The identity of medical team member #3 is unknown, but the court noted that he had been arrested multiple times, “including three times in 10 days in Arizona for a DUI in 2007”.Arizona pledged that with its new screening system in place, the court could be confident that the state would use only licensed medical personnel going forward.But in 2011, Arizona was hauled back into federal court because it had not made good on its promise. The prison director admitted to conducting five executions with full knowledge that medical team member #4 did not hold a medical license of any kind. Nor did officials conduct the required criminal history check on him. If they had, they would have learned that medical team member #4 had been charged with DUI in 2008, public intoxication in 2000, and writing a bad check before that.Medical team member #4 was a prison guard who had previously served as a medical corpsman in the military. He later stated that his only screening was a phone call from the warden “asking whether he knew how to start an IV and whether he would have a problem doing it for an execution”. He was not asked any other questions, and at the time, he had not placed an IV for 15 years. On paper, Arizona was dutifully screening its execution team members. But in reality, the state was doing nothing of the sort.View image in fullscreenThe Arizona state prison in Florence.Photograph: Ross D Franklin/APMissouri and Arizona are not the only states where discoveries about executioners have raised serious questions about the care and competence with which executioners are chosen. In 2006, a federal court struck down California’s lethal injection protocol based in part on the “inconsistent and unreliable screening of execution team members”.The execution team member responsible for the custody of lethal injection drugs had been disciplined for smuggling drugs into San Quentin before joining the execution team; two team members had been arrested for drunk driving; one suffered from depression and PTSD; and one had been out on a two-month medical leave from getting into a fight with a prisoner.The court in California also noted the “extremely troubling” disappearance of sodium thiopental that was ostensibly taken from the prison pharmacy for training purposes but never used and never returned. “These circumstances may warrant investigation by an appropriate law-enforcement agency,” the court wrote. In California, the state’s executioners were also the chief suspects in a potential criminal investigation.The federal government has proven no better than states on this score. Not only did the federal government hire Doerhoff after he was banned from serving as Missouri’s executioner, but it also hired a nurse for the Timothy McVeigh execution who had been charged with felony aggravated stalking and first-degree tampering with property, ultimately pleading no contest to the misdemeanor version of both charges. The nurse had allegedly smashed the windshield and headlights of a man who was seeing his estranged wife, ran over his mailbox, smashed windows of his home, and left voice messages threatening to burn his house down and blow his “[expletive] head off”!Federal officials knew of the convictions when it hired him – the nurse was on active probation and had to get permission from his probation officer to leave the state.“It seems bizarre to me that we would knowingly allow an offender, on active supervision, to participate in the execution process at any level,” a probation supervisor had written while the department was considering the request. But the permission was granted.In an internal memo, the administrator who confirmed the request for travel wrote: “It would be extremely problematic for [the nurse] and this department if the media got wind of this.”And how did this nurse-executioner get on the federal government’s radar? He was recommended by the Missouri department of corrections. A nurse with his own serious criminal convictions was secretly conducting executions on behalf of the show-me state.Lethal injection litigation has likewise revealed patently unfit executioners in other states as well. In Maryland, litigation revealed that one member of the state’s execution team had been fired by a local police department and charged with poisoning several neighborhood dogs, while another execution team member had been suspended for spitting in prisoners’ food.In Tennessee, litigation revealed that a member of the execution team had pleaded guilty, twice, to possession of a controlled substance, and missed an execution because he was at an in-patient treatment program. That was in 2007. In 2021, Tennessee’s physician-executioner stated that he surrendered his surgery accreditation because of “too many malpractice suits” – at least 10 by his estimation.These are just the executioners we know. But they are a chilling indication of the executioners we don’t know. As the former head of Oklahoma’s corrections department told a legislative committee in 2023, the prison staff charged with carrying out executions are “some of the lowest-paid state employees in government”.In executions, as elsewhere, you get what you pay for. Even when a doctor is nominally involved in the execution process, the people injecting the drugs are typically low-level prison employees.Most executioners say they just fell into the job. The opportunity came to them, and they had their reasons for saying yes. For prison guards, it may be a necessary step to moving up the prison ranks. Doctors likewise tend to say they simply slipped into the role. They had agreed to be an observer, but then the medical team needed help. Who were they to watch executioners prick a prisoner a dozen times in a desperate attempt to pierce the vein when they could do it more quickly?One reason doctorsaren’tgiving, but merits mention anyway, is money. A doctor willing to participate in an execution is a precious commodity, and states will pay dearly for it – up to $20,000 in cash per execution in some places. No doctor yet has said they’re participating in executions for the money. But the fact that they can make a killing from state killing has to be worth something.Corinna Lain is the author ofSecrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection, out on 22 AprilExplore more on these topicsUS newsCapital punishmentUS prisonsDeath and dyingTrump administrationUS politicsUS justice systemfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But her career should flyThu 17 Apr 2025 06.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 06.33 EDTShareIf you ever needed definitive proof thatMarvelhas lost pace with the zeitgeist, just look at the panicky marketing of Thunderbolts*. The film opens in a couple of weeks and, according to the trade press, is tracking to open soft.Had this been six or seven years ago, then fans would be clamouring to see Thunderbolts* simply because it was the latest instalment of the grand MCU soap opera. After all, it’s a film that stars several side characters from older Marvel films and TV shows, and there was a time when audiences would go bananas for this sort of thing. But as the last few MCU films have shown, that approach doesn’t really work any more.For a while Marvel attempted to trade on the intrigue of the asterisk, but that fell down because the people who cared guessed what it meant and the people who didn’t couldn’t care less. Then camethe weird trailer last monthwhere the movie tried to rebrand itself as an A24 film, declaring itself to be “absolute cinema” because it hired the production designer from Hereditary and the editor of Minari (and, in Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of You Hurt My Feelings). And while there was a lot of novelty about this – when was the last time a Marvel film made a big deal about the pedigree of the people who made it? – it didn’t do a lot to shift the needle.But now, finally, it looks as if Marvel has cracked it. The final flurry of pre-release marketing about Thunderbolts* doesn’t make a big deal about the superheroes or the mythology or the cinematography or anything like that. No, this time it’s being much smarter. This time it’s unveilingFlorence Pughas the new Tom Cruise.Thunderbolts* contains a big setpiece stunt in which Florence Pugh jumps off the 2,722ft Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, the second tallest skyscraper on Earth. Now it has been revealed that not only did Pugh perform the stunt herself, but she also pleaded with the Marvel brass to do it.“As we got closer and closer to shooting, they said they don’t think it’s going to happen because it’s a crazy insurance ordeal,”Pugh told Variety. “I was like what the fuck? Of course we are! We have to do that.” Referring to herself as a “sassy Karen” for refusing to let the issue drop, she then described the moment they relented. “They’re like, ‘OK, if you want to fall off the second tallest building, we’ll figure it out for you.’”These claims are backed up by a film that was posted to YouTube five days ago, in which we see Pugh jump off the aforementioned building. In truth, as far as the footage shows, it’s less of a jump and more of a dangle – she appears to step off the roof and descend a small distance before she’s winched back up – but nevertheless it looks absolutely terrifying.It’s a very Mission: Impossiblish formula. You’ll remember that the entire selling point of 2023’s Dead Reckoning: Part One was the sight of Tom Cruiseriding a motorbike off the side of a mountain. Indeed, by the time the film came out we’d already seen the stunt in its various forms hundreds of times.Of course, it turns out sharing your biggest stunt ahead of time is not always completely wise. Box office grosses for Dead Reckoning were lower than expected because we’d been given the exciting bit for free several years before it was released. This year’s instalment, The Final Reckoning, is doing a better job of hinting at the big stunt –Tom Cruise flapping abouton the underside of a corkscrewing biplane – without revealing the whole thing.Time will tell whether Thunderbolts* should have been less generous with the stunt footage. But for now that doesn’t really matter. What matters is that Florence Pugh wants to do her own stunts, and she’s fearless about it. If there’s a Thunderbolts* 2, maybe she’ll do a helmets-off motorbike chase, or a one-take skydive. Maybe she’ll beat Cruise and literally shoot into space. Maybe she’ll even start sending cakes to people for Christmas. Either way, this might be the start of an amazing action career.Explore more on these topicsFilmMarvelFlorence PughFilm industryTom CruiseMission: ImpossibleMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OnecommentShareReuse this content"

It is critical to democracy – in Hungary, and the EU as a wholeThu 17 Apr 2025 11.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 12.28 EDTShareHungary’s parliament has given Viktor Orbán the tools to do what he has long threatened:ban Pride, silence dissent and strip political critics of their citizenship. Aconstitutional amendmentpassed on 14 April allows the government to label LGBTQ+ gatherings a threat to children and to revoke the citizenship of dual nationals deemed a risk to “national sovereignty”.This is a purge disguised as law – another step in Orbán’s dismantling of democracy, where the constitution is degraded to a propaganda instrument. Hecalls ita “spring clean-up” to root out “bugs”, targeting LGBTQ+ people, journalists, critics, civil society and now, dual nationals. As one myself, I could be among the targets.All of this is also a cynical political ploy to distract Hungarians from a deepening domestic crisis. Withhigh inflation, acrumbling healthcare systemandailingrailways, Orbán needs enemies more than ever. Hungary is acutely vulnerable to the collapse of global trade, which his ally in the White House has single-handedly brought about. The electoral system is seen as rigged, but elections are still scheduled for next spring – and Orbán’s party, Fidesz, is slidingin the polls.Increasingly troubled at home, Orbán is looking abroad. In February hedeclaredthat the political climate in the west had become more favourable. The implication was clear: with Donald Trump back in power, the EU distracted and global authoritarianism on the rise, there are even fewer consequences facing a leader who wants to dismantle democracy.This has long been much more than a Hungarian story. It is a European crisis – and a warning to every democracy. Take the case of Budapest Pride. For 30 years, Pride has been the largest recurring demonstration of human rights in Hungary – a vital expression of joy, resistance and visibility in the face of growing hostility. It has endured far-right attacks, harassment and vilification. But this year the march has in effectbeen banned. Organisers and participants have been threatened with facial recognition surveillance and fines of 200,000 Hungarian forints (£420).BudapestPrideis no longer just a march. It is a frontline. A ban on Pride is unprecedented in the EU. It is a rupture with the most basic rights enshrined in Article 2 of the EU treaties: freedom of assembly, freedom from discrimination, the right to live and love without fear.View image in fullscreenProtesters in the Hungarian capital on 8 April 2025.Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd yet theEuropean Commission– the guardian of those very treaties – has so far offered nothing but the usual statements of concern. This sets a devastating precedent. It tells every member state that fundamental rights are optional – that governments can outlaw protest and strip people of EU citizenship without consequence.Let’s be honest: the EU’s track record for enforcing the rule of law gives Orbán every reason to believe he can get away with it. Years of delay and half-measures have allowed him to tighten his gripwith little resistance. While some EU funds have beensuspended, most continue flowing. Article 7 proceedings – meant to sanction breaches of EU values – have stalled. There are no meaningful attempts to put them on the agenda, even though suspending Orbán’s voting rights could shield EU values and end hissabotagingof unanimous EU votes in support of Ukraine.The European Commission and council remain hesitant, divided and timid. This is not just a moral failure – it is a strategic one. The EU may be the last functioning democratic project of global scale. And it is being tested. As democratic backsliding accelerates worldwide,Europefaces a simple question: can it defend its own values? Or will it fold? Because the truth is, an authoritarian turn can happen anywhere. If Pride can be banned in Budapest, it can be banned in Bratislava, Zagreb, Rome. If citizenship becomes a weapon here, it becomes a precedent everywhere.So what should the EU do? Orbán is daring Brussels to look away. A European Commission that takes its role seriously would act immediately. It has the legal tools – what’s missing is the political courage.Brussels is reportedlyconsidering legal action“if necessary”, but it has yet to take interim steps to protect this year’s march, now just two months away. Its usual excuse – the need to avoid “political interference” – is no longer viable. Orbán is the one breaking the law – the one wiping his feet on the EU treaties.There is also a tangible, immediate way to show solidarity: elected leaders from across Europe should publicly announce that they are joining us at Budapest Pride. We are immensely proud to already have pledges from members of the European parliament. Their presence is not symbolic – it is protective. They help guarantee that the march can take place in safety. When government power is being used to intimidate and suppress, a visible international presence can deter harassment and police overreach. This is not optics – it’s a line of defence.This is not a political dispute between equals. This is one side dismantling rights, and the other asking Europe to uphold its own laws. Brussels’ engagement would not be a partisan act; it would be a defence of the very values it was created to protect.If we don’t respond collectively, publicly and decisively, we will wake up to find the authoritarian turn complete. But we refuse to give up. The party I represent, Momentum, is constantly on the streets, protesting, organising, standing with those who will not be silenced. On 28 June, Budapest Pride will march. Orbán says he will stop it. We say, just try.To every democratic leader, activist and ally in Europe: join us. March with us. Let us show together that the streets of a European capital will not surrender to fear.Katalin Cseh is a member of the Hungarian national assembly for the Momentum Movement and a former MEPDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Federal officials alleged that the detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang,callingthem “heinous monsters” ,“criminal aliens”, “the worst of the worst”. The federal government has also revoked visas fora thousandinternational students over their alleged participation in protests against Israel’s genocide in Palestine. Some were abducted, like Mahmoud Khalil, who has spent more than a month incarcerated in one of theworstjails in the US. Officialsallegedthat Mahmoud “sided with terrorists … who have killed innocent men, women, and children”.Media reports quickly revealed that the Trump administration islyingabout “innocent” people tojustifyabducting them. But this raises a more important question: if Trump’s victims weren’t “innocent”, does that make them disposable? I worry that emphasizing theinnocenceof victims creates a rhetorical trap. It’s like carefully digging a pit that the fascists can shove us into.Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’Read moreInstead, we should interrogate the fact that theTrump administrationchose to target “gang members” and “terrorist supporters” in the first step of its ethnic cleansing project. Criminals and terrorists are the bogeymen animating bipartisan racism against Black, Latino and Arab people, and Trump is weaponizing these myths because many liberals have already written them off as less than human. The political context that enabled US residents to be shipped to El Salvador’s Cecot facility is a bipartisan project more than 50 years in the making, largely unquestioned by people who are rightfully horrified by recent escalations.Allegations ofcriminalityhave long been an effectivepretextfor anti-Black violence in the US – this is the “war on crime”. So long as there are “criminals” to fight, viciouspolice brutalitybecomes politically palatable. This is true in blue and red statesalike.

The consequences of gang policing aredevastating: it can lead tofederal prosecutionorpotential deportation, not to mention a lifetime of stateharassment.Gang membership isn’t the only tool the Trump administration can use to portray its victims as guilty. When the “war on crime” morphed into the “war on terror”, Arab and Muslim residents suffered from discriminatorysurveillanceand repression – the “terrorist” category matches the “gang member” category in that it justifies racist dragnet policing practices. The “counter-terrorism” net has already widened,targetingStop Cop City activists in Atlanta. This problem is not limited to Republicans – liberalpoliticiansanduniversitystakeholderslaid thegroundworkfor Trump’s deportation efforts. Last year, the Anti-Defamation League’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, called student Palestine activistsproxies for Iran, and New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, smeared us asterrorist supportersto justify an incrediblyviolentpolice raid.The innocence trap is dangerous because allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violenceThe widening net of who is considered a criminal not only chills dissent among immigrants and activists. It further dehumanizes and renders disposable people who have genuinely committed harm.We must defend the rights of people whodohave criminal records. No one deserves to be whisked away to a brutal prison that deprives them of basic human rights – no matter if it’s in El Salvador,Louisiana,California,PennsylvaniaorNew York. Criminal records and bona fide gang membership don’t turn human beings into monsters. If Trump goes through with his plan of sending citizens to El Salvador, he could initially target people convicted of heinous crimes. This would allow federal officials to ask: “Why do liberals care about pedophiles and murderers?”We should be prepared to defend the basic rights ofallof Trump’s targets with our full strength. If a single person becomes disposable, anyone could become the next target. Last week, Trump said he“loved” the ideaof sending American “criminals” to El Salvador, and law professors aresounding the alarmabout citizen student activists being subjected to terrorism prosecutions. First it will be the “migrant gang member” or “terrorist on a student visa” sent to Cecot. Next it will be the domestic gang member and the terrorist-supporting citizen. Eventually, perhaps any political opponent could be construed as a criminal-terrorist.Trump may not even need to rely on the justice department to criminalize his enemies – dozens of local copsjoinedthe 6 January 2021 putsch at the US Capitol, and local prosecutors have eagerlychargedstudent activists withfelonies. This is another reason to avoid the innocence trap: many policeloveTrump, and law enforcement can very easily make theiradversariesseem likecriminals.The innocence trap is dangerous because allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violence. If we only defend the “innocent”, the fascists will argue that their victim “was no angel”. An anti-fascist rhetoric that carves out exceptions forimperfect victimsis a gift to our opponents.Jonathan Ben-Menachem is a PhD candidate in sociology at Columbia University, where heresearchesthe politics of criminalizationExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS policingUS immigrationUS campus protestsUS crimeUS prisonsMahmoud KhalilcommentShareReuse this content"

Given the problems that can be associated with coming out to family, friends and work colleagues, the constant vilification of trans people by certain parts of the media and on social media and the internal emotional turmoil transition entails, it requires mental strength beyond the ordinary. I should know – I have walked that path.Yesterday, transgender people weredealt a blowfrom a source I would not have predicted when I transitioned 13 years ago – the UK supreme court. In a case concerning representation on the boards of public bodies in Scotland, the supreme court ruled that in the 2010 Equality Act (EA), “sex” should be taken to be “biological sex”, in the sense of the sex recorded on a citizen’s original birth certificate, and does not include “certified sex” where a transgender person has obtained a gender recognition certificate (GRC) by the process set out in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. This renders a GRC valueless for the purposes of the Equality Act.The 2004 legislation was not granted by a benevolent UK government but enacted after the UK lost the case of Goodwin v UK in 2002, in the European Court of Human Rights, which held that the UK lacked a process for the state to acknowledge and accept a transgender person’s acquired gender. The 2004 GRA included a number of exceptions, including one that deferred to any future legislation.In this case, the supreme court found that, while there is not explicit exemption in the EA, there was animpliedexemption given the stresses and strains caused by “sex” meaning different things in different parts of the act, and in particular the possibility that a “trans man” might be pregnant when the pregnancy and maternity provisions referred to protecting “women”. Strangely enough, at the two previous stages of the case at the outer and inner houses of the Scottish court of sessions, the courts had felt able to live with those stresses and strains and ruled that “sex” included “certified sex”.Gender ruling ‘a victory for common sense, but only if you recognise trans people exist’, says equalities watchdog – liveRead moreWe now know that the supreme court was indeed wrong in its judgment. Melanie Field, the civil servant who led the team that created the EA, has sincecome out publicly to say that it was “based on the clear premise thatfor a person with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), their ‘sex’ for the purposes of the EA is that recorded on their GRC”. Harriet Harman, the minister who introduced the bill, has contradicted this, saying that the ruling “correctly interprets the Equality Act, giving effect to our intention when drafting it”. This may be true of the EA, but it doesn’t seem to take into account the GRA position on certified sex – and as Field has correctly pointed out, some of the exceptions written into the EA permitting the exclusion of trans people (for example, in competitive sport) make no sense under the supreme court’s interpretation. They were clearly based on the assumption of certified sex. It seems that the law of unintended consequences now stalks the halls.The fact that no trans person or organisation appeared before the supreme court (an intervention by two trans grandees, one a professor of equalities law and the other a retired judge wasrefused) seems telling to trans people. Imagine, if you will, a discussion of women’s rights with all women excluded. The trans-positive intervention of Amnesty earns an honourable mention.The supreme court’s judgment is clearly wrong in another way. Following Goodwin, the UK was obliged to provide an effective route for transgender people to have their affirmed gender recognised. If a significant part of the legal protections afforded to citizens is denied to them, the UK would once again appear to be in breach of its obligations to the European convention of human rights.There seems no prospect, in the present political climate, of the Labour government sorting this out. It seems that transgender people will have to find the right case and walk the long path to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg once again.In the meantime, what difference will the 88-page judgment actually make for transgender people in the UK? Most do not have a GRC. Estimates vary, but there are about 100,000 trans people and perhaps 6,000 with GRCs. I have already seen comments suggesting that some among the anti-trans lobby think that trans people are likely to be banned from toilets in public buildings, changing rooms and the like by the end of the Easter holidays. Fortunately, while service providerscanexclude trans people – and this ruling makes it easier to do so – most do not. We do not have laws requiring that, and the discussions in the hours after the ruling with service providers did not suggest that any I spoke to are going to change their practice or instigate an anti-trans crusade. Nevertheless, we would expect responsible politicians to be calming the debate rather than fuelling the flames.Judicial ruling on legal definition of ‘woman’ will have UK politicians sighing with reliefRead moreThe supreme court was keen to emphasise the continuing protection for trans people – most, if not all of whom, will have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It is highly likely that if a policy of “use your birth sex facility” were imposed, it would be indirectly discriminatory against those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment – and given the unacceptability of having trans women using the men’s facilities and trans men the ladies’, such a policy could not be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. More concerning, perhaps, are the implications for other legislation in which the meaning of “sex”, “woman” and “man” are important.A certainty is that this will remain a fertile area for lawyers for some time to come – and will therefore provide some further tough and uncertain days for trans people across the UK.Robin Moira White is a discrimination barrister at Old Square Chambers, London, and joint author of A Practical Guide toTransgenderLawDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A man is an adult human male.Theunanimous UK supreme court rulingdelivered on Wednesday is a big step towards clearing up the almighty mess created by politicians in Scotland, who got so carried away with promoting transgender rights that they decided transgender women ought to be eligible for seats on public boards on preferential terms that are for women.This argument was taken apart in a judgment that was as far as possible from the fudge predicted by some. The judges ruled in favour of For WomenScotland, the feminist voluntary organisation that brought the case, that the protected characteristic of “sex” and the terms “man” and “woman” in the Equality Act refer to biology, not gender identity. A gender recognition certification (which formally acknowledges a person’s transition) does not alter their sex in this piece of legislation.Across88 pages, the judges explained how any other reading of the act would render it unworkable. They showed that language used in clauses about pregnancy and maternity makes it clear that sex refers to biology. The claim by the inner house of the court of session, Scotland’s highest court, that words could mean different things in sections of the same act was dismissed. Instead, the UK supreme court emphasised “the need for a meaning which is constant and predictable”. People ought to be able to understand the law without a glossary to guide them.Public services including prisons and hospital changing rooms have been in the news a good deal recently. Provisions in the Equality Act dealing with associations have had less attention until now, but submissions on this issue appear to have been crucial. Had the court ruled in favour of the Scottish government, lesbians and gay men would have lost the legal right to form associations limited to people of the same sex and orientation. People of the other sex, with a gender recognition certificate, could no longer have been excluded.That the resulting “loss of autonomy and dignity for lesbians” was part of the court’s reasoning is one of the most significant elements of this judgment. Resistance to transgender rights activism from lesbian and gay groups has been alternately dismissed and denounced. But the impact on lesbians of gender identity policies is massive, since they have a particular and historic commitment to female-only culture and spaces.New rules for public bodies expected ‘by summer’ after UK gender rulingRead moreThe judges stress that their role is limited to interpreting statute. It is not for them to adjudicate on the definitions of gender or sex, or “the meaning of the word ‘woman’”, in other contexts. People can continue to use words in whatever way they want. But the Equality Act – which incorporated earlier legislation including the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 – is the vital underpinning for societal rules and norms around fairness and equal treatment. Ever since another volunteer-led feminist group, Woman’s Place UK, highlighted the single-sex exceptions in the act as a basis for their campaign to defend sex-based rights, questions about the functioning of the exceptions, and the language in the act, have been hotly debated. That has now been settled. Unless the supreme court’s decision is appealed and overturned, or legislation is changed, biological women are a protected class in law.As important as this is, it is not an end-point. It is almost four years since Maya Forstater won a crucial appeal and established that the gender-critical belief that sex is binary and immutable is legally protected. Since then,numerous caseshave been brought by women who were penalised by employers because they did not subscribe to the contrary belief in gender identity. Several more are working their way through the system. Outside the courts, gender critical feminist activists have engaged in other forms of campaigning and lobbying, setting up groups and charities, producing research, writing books and articles.I have thought about all this for years, and still don’t fully understand how trans activist demands, above all the push for legal gender self-identification, were so widely adopted.Under Boris Johnson, the Tories changed direction. But it must be remembered that it was under Maria Miller, a Conservative chair, that the women and equalities committee recommended a system of self-ID about a decade ago.Badenoch calls for broader review of equality and gender recognition laws – UK politics liveRead moreI think the absorption of these ideasinto western progressive orthodoxy has been a grave error. By re-energising socially conservative opposition to shifting gender norms, roles and behaviours, this uncritical adoption of a contested belief that goes far beyond the protection against discrimination to which trans people are, of course, entitled, has fuelled a broader backlash against human rights.Hostility to “gender ideology” from the right of the Tory party,Putin, Trump and other authoritarian leaders has made it hard for some liberals to admit this possibility. Despite their borrowings from intellectual postmodernism, gender identity activists (including such luminaries asJudith Butler) take a binary view of our complicated world in which anyone who doesn’t line up with them must be on Team Trump. This polarising stance has already had the effect of increasing division and hostility.The judges have done their job in upholding the rights of women, and same-sex attracted people, alongside those of transgender people – all of whom have the legally protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It must be hoped that the court’s unequivocal judgment brings the ending of this wounding chapter in our politics closer, along with a sharper awareness that equality law is always a balancing process.But the plaudits this week should go to ForWomenScotland. The determination to hold on to sex-based rights and protections built up over centuries has galvanised an extraordinary renaissance of the women’s movement in Britain.Susanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British FeminismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sorry, but I’m not convincedSimon JenkinsIf Starmer is serious about bringing young people into his ‘social contract’, then protecting them from the tech giants must be his priorityThu 17 Apr 2025 11.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 13.06 EDTShareIremember being 16 in the 1960s. The prime ministerseemed geriatric and I was sure he should be in care, while a group of us went to meet our young MP, a certain Margaret Thatcher. She was young, but she didn’t seem as if she was with the times. We could not dream of voting for someone like her. Matter closed.Sixteen-year-olds are great fun but they are not grown up. They cannot marry in England and Wales, drive, smoke,get a tattooor buy alcohol on their own. They are legally classed as children and are supposed to be informal education or training to 18. Sixteen-year-olds have not taken to the streets demanding the right to the franchise, like the Chartists or suffragettes did.So why has Keir Starmer suddenly reiterated thathe intends to enfranchise them to votein UK-wide elections? The only plausible answer is that he hopes they will vote for him. In a desperate attempt tojustify this manoeuvre, he says that, if 16-year-old soldiers “are old enough to take a bullet for our country”, they should get the vote. (Likewiseif they are “old enough to work” and “pay taxes”.)In fact, 16-year-olds are not old enough to “take a bullet”, since frontline army service isbanned for under-18s.Meanwhile, precious few 16-year-olds work, sinceStarmer’s own party, when last in power, made it supposedly compulsory for them to remain in education or training to 18. As for taxes, younger children already pay VAT when they spend their pocket money. The whole argument is slapdash.Young people say they’d elect a ‘strong leader’. I say give more of them the vote | Polly ToynbeeRead moreEven the expected electoral gain to Labour is dubious. Well under half of 18-24sturned out at the last general election. There is some evidence from Scotland, which lowered the voting age to 16in 2014 for the independence referendumand in 2016 forScottish parliamentary elections, that the new groupwould be active, though novelty may recently have been a factor in turnout. In Wales, whichlowered the voting age to 16in 2021 for Senedd and local government elections,early evidence suggeststhat the new group plans to vote at a similarly low rate to other age groups under 55. Either way, Starmer would be lucky to see more than half of his1.5 million new votersactually turning out, with perhaps about a third of those voting for him. Even then, the general assumption that the young are leftwing has taken abruising recently from rightwing influencers.Where Starmer must be right is in wanting to bring young people into what he pompously calls his“social contract” with gen Z. Here, his absolute priority should not be the ballot box, but how he proposes to prepare the new cohort for their responsibilities. With social media so clearly dominant over the views and behaviour of those whose support he seeks, its proper regulation should be a priority for any such reform.The present government shows no interest in such regulation. Indeed, if anything, quite the reverse. Rumour has it that Starmer, in his attempt to reduce tariffs, is on the brink of pledgingno further curbs on the tech giants, in view of their closeness to Donald Trump. This would follow the cabinet’s apparent capitulation to those same giants in the matter of copyright and artificial intelligence. All this suggests a complete lack of concern for what must currently be the greatest threat to the mental health of gen Z. All Starmer has done is boast that hewatched Adolescence. So what now: voting at 13?The one thing that might excuse the government’s cynicism is a programme to prepare teenagers for their new responsibility. Thetyranny of academic GCSEsand exam culture should be suspended, if not for ever, then at least for one day a week, to be replaced by compulsory civic awareness. This should embrace an introduction to peace and war, national politics, local government, the law, practical economics and the handling of money.The subservience of British secondary education to academia was dented only as recently as 2000. The then Labour government nodded at the revolutionary idea that schools might help pupils to get on in life, rather than merely get a place at university. It introduced “non-compulsory”personal, social and health education, to which economics was later added. To say these topicsdo not rank highlyin the syllabus would be an understatement, nor do they embrace politics.I know teachers who genuinely think it is not their job to “teach” a world outside education. They see no need to educate young people in how to relate to one another, work in groups or keep their minds and bodies in good shape. They see no reason to teach self-presentation or expression, the new skills of oracy so crucial to getting on in a creative career. Teachers seem to think all this is for parents, not schools, even when they know it is not true. The school curriculum is in the dark ages.The truth of the matter is that teenagers are acquiring these skills and attitudes from social media. It is online that they are gaining a whole new context for their personal and social lives. They are doing so from the worst possible sources: biased, uncensored, unmediated and unregulated. It must be the worst preparation for that most sacred of democratic rituals – the vote. This is the grim reality of Starmer’s new social contract.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionElectoral reformLabourVoter apathycommentShareReuse this content"

Both men, elected to lead nominally democratic countries, have described themselves as dictators, and they exuded that sense of smug impunity. While reporters sought answers on the fate of Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old father of three who was wrongly deported to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot mega-prison, Trump and Bukele disclaimed responsibility, joked about further deportations, and engaged in casual slander of Ábrego García, who is not, and has never been alleged to be, a terrorist.And then there was the gold. So much gold.Since returning to the White House, Trump has applied gilt to the Oval Office with the same light touch that he brings to the caps lock key, which is to say, it’s everywhere. Gold knickknacks cover every surface in the Oval Office while gold-framed paintings climb the walls. Trump has added gold highlighting to the room’s ornamental moulding, imported gold cherubs from Mar-a-Lago, crowded the mantelpiece with gold urns, and even affixed what I can only describe as gold filigree doodads to the walls and fireplace. (These ornaments were made by John Icart, a south Florida cabinetmaker, according to theWall Street Journal, though it’s possible to find aclose replicaon Alibaba for $1-5 a pop, pre-tariff.) He even has a gold seal on thebuttonon his desk he presses to summon an aide with a Diet Coke.View image in fullscreen‘Trump has applied gilt to the Oval Office with the same light touch that he brings to the caps lock key, which is to say, it’s everywhere.’Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockTrump’s penchant for the gaudy has long drawn jeers – the Washington Post critic-at-large Robin Givhanwrotethat the redecorated Oval Office “now evokes insecurity and petulance” – but as with so many of Trump’s buffoonish tendencies, there is a real menace beneath the shiny surface.Those tacky antique decorative urns were gilded usingormolu, according to Givhan, a technique involving mercury that was so toxic that its practitioners rarely lived past 40. And while ormolu was banned by the French government in 1830, gold mining remains a major source of pollution, accounting for 38% ofglobal anthropogenic mercury emissions, as well as copious amounts of cyanide and arsenic, withserious consequencesfor human and environmental health. Scientistsestimatethat more than 100 million people worldwide suffer chronic mercury poisoning, either because they are themselves miners or they live in a community affected by mining.That’s no secret to the people of El Salvador, who madehistoryin 2017 by becoming the first country in the world to ban the mining of metals. The ban followed years ofcampaigningby environmental and Indigenous activists fighting back against the international companies that have for so long extracted mineral wealth from Latin America while leaving little behind butpolluted waterwaysand impoverished communities. The European appetite for the western hemisphere’s precious metals fueled centuries of slaughter of Indigenous populations and enormous environmental destruction; great wealth was extracted, but rarely was it shared with the local communities.View image in fullscreenA drone view of the San Sebastián river, contaminated as a consequence of past mining activity of the San Sebastián gold mine in Santa Rosa de Lima, El Salvador, in 2024.Photograph: José Cabezas/ReutersBukele rose to power in El Salvador in 2019 with promises of an entirely different kind of mining – of cryptocurrency, rather than metals. But the2023 prosecutionof five key activists behind the mining ban on decades-old, trumped-up charges led to suspicions, since confirmed, that he was planning to reverse course.In late 2024, Bukelecame out against the ban, claiming that El Salvador had untapped gold reserves worth $3tn. The self-proclaimed “world’s coolest dictator” soon had his wish mademanifestby a compliant congress, and El Salvador’s historic ban is no more. While Bukele claims that future gold mining will be mercury-free and “sustainable”, environmental activists are getting ready to fight tosave El Salvador’s waterways.Whether that $3tn of gold will ever materialize is very much in question. Open pit mining involves the production of just over four metric tons of waste, much of which is toxic, to find a single gram of gold, according to Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a recentpaper, The Case Against Gold Mining.“If you run any kind of holistic cost-benefit analysis, I don’t think you can justify it,” Lezak says. “Gold mining is just as destructive as coal mining, and unlike coal, can’t heat a home or fuel a power station.” Lezak says that he supports mining minerals that are crucial to the energy transition – such as copper, nickel and lithium – but the fact that only 7% of gold is used for technology or medicine (as opposed to jewelry or stores of wealth) makes the environmental damage and risk to health too costly to bear.But that’s the thing about gold. The human desire for its sparkle has never been a question of need, only want. The violence and displacement, suffering and grief that have accompanied the quest for gold have not yet managed to turn our eyes away from its gleam. In that way, it’s a perfect emblem for Trump – garish, useless, drenched in blood.“The president’s fascination with gold is part of a timeless tradition of human’s liking shiny objects,” Lezak says. “You can tell the story of a lot of human history as a story of men in power wanting shiny objects, whether it’s the Spanish looking for silver in the Andes or European Americans looking for gold in California and Alaska.“History does not look back favorably on those leaders,” he added. “I wish the president had a little more perspective.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEl SalvadorGoldAmericasCommoditiesUS immigrationMar-a-LagocommentShareReuse this content"

They’ve met their matches. None of them has blinked – and they won’t.China not only refused to back down when the Trump regime threatened it with huge tariffs, but also retaliated with huge tariffs of its own, plus a freeze on the export of rare-earth elements that the US’s high-tech and defense industries depend on.Harvard also pointedly defied the regime, issuing a clear rebuke to its attempt to interfere with academic freedom.The supreme court – in a rare unanimous decision –ordered Trump to facilitatethe return of a legal US resident wrongly deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, without any criminal charges.But the White Housewas defiant. On Monday, both Trump officials andEl Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, said they could not return Kilmar Ábrego García.“Of course, I’m not going to do it,”Bukele saidwhen asked. Trump sat by his side with a smile on his face. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, joined in the cruel imitation of justice: “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him.”What’s next?I suspect the testosterone-poisoned lackeys around King Trump are urging him to hit back even harder, escalating their confrontations with China, Harvard and the supreme court. They view these showdowns as ultimate tests of the regime’s strength.Think of it – they must be telling themselves and their boss – what prizes!

Back in 2020, Boris Johnson’s governmentestimatedthat a US deal “could increase UK GDP in the long run by around 0.07%” – a figure that is not exactly transformative. The view touted by some Brexiters that a US trade deal would fire up the entire British economy was always a fantasy, the product of deregulatory yearning for which there was little public support, even among leave voters. Any urge of that kind is clearly even more delusional now, in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff wars.Hopefully, the right’s across-the-board deregulatory horror is now a thing of the past. But global trade has new traumas too. Mr Trump’s protectionism and bullying of US rivals are resetting the terms. There are nevertheless specific reasons why it is in Britain’s interest to pursue freer trade talks with the US. Chief among these is the threat posed by current tariffs, especially on cars and pharmaceuticals, as well as the prospect that a 10% tariff will be reimposed on all UK exports to the US after the current pause ends in July.The problem with any deal lies with the prices that the US may try to extract for tariff reductions or exemptions. Although the vice-president, JD Vance,saidthis week that he sees a “good chance” of a deal, this could still be contingent on UK concessions insectorssuch as agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitaryrulesand digital regulation. These are essentially the same sectors that, for good reason, proved to be stumbling blocks in the post-Brexit discussions. Efforts to rebrand things like AI, biotech and digital as strategically important industries of the future do not dispel some real threats now facing British food standards, healthcare or online controls.All this is multiplied by the Trump administration’s unreliability and geostrategic approach. The administration’s goal in Europe is to weaken and destroy the EU. Urged on by rightwing Brexiter politicians, the president sees pulling Britain away from the EU’s orbit as part of that effort. So, however, does the EU. As a result, any attempt by Washington to offer generous terms to the UK in particular sectors is likely to make anyresetwith the EU more difficult. Sir Keir Starmer says that Britain does not need to make an either/or choice. Like Mr Johnson, he says Britain can have its cake and eat it. The brutalrealityis that neither the US nor the EU will necessarily take the same generous view.Even if the prospective UK-US deal is less wide-ranging than it might once have been, it is still significant. Politically, the Trump factor also makes any such deal more explosive. UK treaties and trade deals are traditionally made under prerogative powers. As theBrexitargument about a “meaningful vote” showed, there is a very limited role for parliament. That needs to change. It would be intolerable in the UK-US case. This is clearly a matter for parliament to debate, both during and after negotiations, and for both houses of parliament to vote on.This week, the Labour chairs of the Commons foreign affairs and trade select committeescalledfor such votes. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are both in favour. The government should make clear that no agreement will go ahead without a meaningful Commons vote in favour.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Christian festival gives us pause to reflectThu 17 Apr 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 21.17 EDTShareChristians are to be envied atEaster. The story of death and resurrection, suffering and rebirth is a beautiful and all-encompassing one. For non-believers, a diet of chocolate and wall-to-wall snooker, and the prospect of a perhaps drizzly bank holiday, do not have the same teleological logic. The religious narrative gives life meaning. The notion that there is a plan and purpose is deeply satisfying.The last line of Kenneth Williams’ diary encapsulates the conundrum we all face: “Oh, what’s the bloody point?” James Bailey’s new book,The Meaning of Life, sought answers to that vexing question from a variety of what Bailey calls “extraordinary people”. Like a philosophically inclinedHenry Root, Bailey – “unemployed, heartbroken and living alone in my dead grandad’s caravan” –sent more than a thousand lettersto well-known artists and philosophers, and to people who had suffered some tragedy that might, he thought, give them special insight into life’s purpose and meaning.Some replied at length, and, for many, the meaning of life resided in love or small acts of kindness. But it was the pithier contributions that had more impact. The writer Michael Frayn gently mocked the whole exercise. “It might be an idea to start with something smaller, say a pickled walnut,” he replied. “Once we’ve got it clear how a pickled walnut could have a ‘meaning’, we might move on to something larger – the borough of Haringey, say, or influenza – and work our way up.” Great age, it seems, brings its own bleak wisdom. “Sorry, but you caught me at the wrong end of my existence,” the playwrightAlan Ayckbourngrumbled. “I have no idea why I write, nor indeed why I’m still alive.”The young seek meaning and purpose. The old have no time for it. “Tutto nel mondo è burla,” sings Falstaff at the end of Verdi’s valedictory opera. All the world’s a joke. Verdi, feted for his tragic endings, was having his own little joke in fashioning thisebullient finale. Ayckbourn reaches the same Falstaffian conclusion. “What the hell?” he concludes in his response to Bailey. Many artists have followed a similar path – from floridity and purpose to concision and irresolution. Fail again, fail better. Religion and art are often antagonists: one feeds on certainty, the other on doubt.In Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,the supercomputer Deep Thought gives 42as the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Fans of Adams’ work earnestly asked him what the number meant. “It was a joke,” heinsisted. “It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number ... I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought ‘42 will do’.” Decoding the meaning of life, Adams is wittily suggesting, is a mug’s game. Cracking the meaning of pickled walnuts may indeed be more fulfilling.If this Easter you are celebrating the working out of a divine plan, enjoy Sunday’s magnificent reawakening. If not, put your faith in Montaigne’s answer to Williams’ great philosophical inquiry. “If you have been able to examine and manage your own life, you have achieved the greatest task of all,” he writes in his final essay, On Experience. “Our most glorious achievement is to live our life fittingly. All other things – reigning, building, accumulating wealth – are at most small props, superfluous accessories.” A life well lived has its own logic.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The stories resonated with me too. These “homes” played a role in the Dublin childhoods of my aunt and mother. My aunt’s experiences were heartbreaking: in the late 1960s, she was effectively imprisoned in a home for “fallen women”, her baby taken from her for adoption almost immediately after birth. It’s a loss that stayed with her for the rest of her life.My mother’s experiences reflected the general poverty and cruelty of Irish society in the late 1940s. Desperately hungry and neglected, brutalised by her brother who’d returned from the second world war with PTSD, she ran away from home and presented herself at a Magdalene laundry. Although she was subjected to a demeaning medical examination to see if she was pregnant (she wasn’t) and made to work long hours, the laundry provided her with a better standard of living than she’d hitherto known – regular meals, a bed free of vermin and, paradoxically, given the reputation of the laundries, freedom from physical violence. Her life must have been truly miserable if a laundry was preferable to her family home.Ireland was such a cruel place that my mother escaped to England aged just 16. Her experiences, I’m sure, are why my family never holidayed in the “old country” or wore shamrocks on Saint Patrick’s Day.Name and address suppliedThe intergenerational damage done by the Catholic church lives on. Remember that church leaders attributed imbecilic behaviour and muteness to children born outside wedlock. To be such a child meant that your chances of living a decent life after being in any institution of shame (mother-and-baby home, industrial school, Magdalene laundry, mental health institution) was zero. No employer would hire you and your chances of marriage were low. And your chances of looking at the world through the bars of a prison cell or mental institution were a lot higher unless you could keep your secret – an impossibility in a country made up of hundreds of small insular towns.And, of course, the men got off scot-free, with no blemish on their reputations. They thrived, while sowing their oats. Not so the young, single and vulnerable girls during a time of reproductive health ignorance. Their families, overwhelmed with the church’s currency of shame, threw them to the wolves. Why do you think more Irish women emigrated to the UK than Irish men? And the good nuns have the gall to say “It wasn’t me”.Rosemary C AdaserNortholt, LondonRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is right about the Magdalene laundries being a stain on the church. But it was families who sent their daughters to those places. My father remembered illegitimate children in 1950s Mayo being given to families to work on their farms, effectively as slave labour. The dysfunction and evil in Ireland was across the board. It’s too easy to pin it all on priests and nuns, as if they were separate from wider society. What sort of families did they come from to need to be so abusive? Not happy and healthy ones.Catherine McLoughlinLondonRhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s article was sobering, and raised my anger at how women and children were treated by the religious orders mentioned. But I am struck once again by the fact that there is no mention of the men – the fathers of all these children. These were not virgin births, after all. Do we ever hear men’s voices in protest and regret?Terry PrendergastHarefield, LondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

It was a great night, the team were tired, 4-2 with one more player, we think it’s over, but here it’s never over.Maguire heads winner as Manchester United pull off chaotic comeback against LyonRead more“Here everything is possible, you feel the environment. At 4-3, after the Bruno Fernandes penalty, we felt we could change the game.”Harry Maguire scored the winner 34 seconds into the 121st minute after Kobbie Mainoo had made it 4-4 on the night, 6-6 on aggregate.At the break United were 2-0 up in the leg after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot and cruising through 4-2 on aggregate before strikes from Corentin Tolisso and Nicolás Tagliafico in regulation time took the tie into the added 30 minutes.Rayan Cherki (on 104 minutes) and Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty (109) putLyontwo ahead.Maguire, like Mainoo, was pressed into service as an auxiliary No 9 as United sought salvation.“We tried to put Harry Maguire up front because he is the only one who can score a goal with a header.

After the manager complained that the football gods were against him last week, Dominic Solanke’s penalty after an intervention from the video assistant referee – another of the Australian’s pet peeves – was enough to seal his side’s progress to the semi-finals of theEuropa League.Postecoglou has probably regretted his decision to point out back in September after a defeat to Arsenal that he “always” wins trophies in his second year at a club. But after their north London rivals eased past the might of Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, Spurs also still have something to hang on to in a season that has otherwise been filled with disappointment.Eintracht Frankfurt v Tottenham: Europa League quarter-final, second leg – liveRead moreA trip to the Arctic Circle to face Norwegians Bodø/Glimt awaits in the last four after this dogged display against anEintracht Frankfurtteam who look destined to qualify for next season’s Champions League. But a disciplined Tottenham side showed they are still playing for their manager. Solanke had not scored since 4 January – a run of 12 matches – but there were unbridled celebrations in the away end when he stroked home the decisive spot kick just before half-time and at the full-time whistle after almost eight nerve-racking minutes of injury-time.Postecoglou – who has increasingly cut a defiant figure in recent weeks as results in the Premier League have gone from bad to worse despite the return of several key players from injury – was in amongst it in between hugs for Solanke and James Maddison. The Australian spikily suggested beforehand that Spurs supporters shouldn’t take being one match away from the last four of a European competition as a regular occurrence “because it certainly hasn’t been for this club”. In the absence of captain Son Heung-min due to a foot injury, he saw his players grasp the opportunity with both hands.Micky van de Ven and Destiny Udogie were outstanding in defence, while Rodrigo Bentancur marshalled the midfield superbly and, as Postecoglou put it, Maddison put his body on the line to win the decisive spot-kick.The Eintracht supporters had packed out the end behind one of the goals almost an hour before kick-off. There was an electric atmosphere as they unfurled a tifo when the players emerged with the message “the Eagles are on the hunt”, with trophies representing their two previous triumphs in this competition and its predecessor, the Uefa Cup.View image in fullscreenEintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kauã Santos concedes a penalty by colliding with Tottenham’s James Maddison.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersAlmost 3,000 Spurs fans also braved the incessant rain as Jean-Mattéo Bahoya and Mario Götze both tested Guglielmo Vicario’s handling on the greasy surface with early shots. There was a moment of panic when Hugo Ekitike raced on to a long punt forward from goalkeeper Kauã Santos but Van de Ven ate up the ground to get back just in time. Götze’s evening came to a premature end when he was taken off clutching his hamstring before Tottenham had their first sight of goal in the 20th minute, although Son’s replacement Mathys Tel could not make proper contact with Brennan Johnson’s cutback. The Frenchman was on target with his next effort from distance that drew a good save from Santos.Postecoglou will have been pleased with how his side had grown into the game and he was given even more hope on the stroke of half-time. Santos thought he had escaped when he clattered dangerously into Maddison but VAR thought differently to the Italian referee and sent him to the replay screen. Tel initially looked as if he would take it but eventually Solanke sent the goalkeeper the wrong way as a groggy Maddison was replaced by Dejan Kulusevski after trying manfully to carry on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A free-kick from 35 yards out from Götze’s replacement Farès Chaïbi that had Vicario sprawling across his goal must have quickened Postecoglou’s pulse.Cristian Romero and Bentancur both had golden chances to make things more comfortable from corners but neither could hit the target. Ekitike was convinced he should have had a penalty after a Romero clearance but this time VAR correctly said no after replays showed there had been no contact.Postecoglou must have checked his watch umpteen times as Spurs closed in on the victory. Vicario reacted brilliantly to save Chaïbi’s effort with his legs before the former Leeds defender Rasmus Kristensen somehow fired wide with the goal gaping to ensure that Tottenham’s season remains very much alive and kicking.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueEintracht FrankfurtTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it is Athletic Club of Bilbao who face Manchester United, a unique club still hoping that a first continental trophy in their 124-year history will be won when they host the final.Barry Ferguson’s side were still standing at the end ofa first leg that finished 0-0, despite spending most of the night a man down, and they still hadn’t conceded 48 minutes into the second, but a penalty gave the Basques a breakthrough. “This hurts, and I want it to,” Ferguson said.Maguire heads winner as Manchester United pull off chaotic comeback against LyonRead moreLiam Kelly had been the hero seven days ago, saving Álex Berenguer’s penalty; here though he could not stop Oihan Sancet’s spot-kick.Rangersstill might have been revived when Nicolas Raskin hit the post and Ferguson complained that his side should have had two penalties – a shirt pull in the first half and a handball in the second – but ultimately Athletic were too good. They racked up 21 shots here, 40 over the two legs, until the 41st was headed in by Nico Williams to make it 2-0, the stadium they call the Cathedral erupting into songs of praise.Rangers, by contrast, weren’t good enough: “The work rate was there but the quality wasn’t at times,” Ferguson admitted. “I just want my club to be back where it should be.” Over 180 minutes they only had two shots on target, although they actually had the first here, James Tavernier’s free-kick flying into the stands. Their task, or perhaps their limitations, were much the same as the first leg. This was, above all, about holding Athletic back again, or trying to.On the left Nico Williams ran at them, Ridvan Yilmaz being nutmegged and then having to depart with an early injury that reinforced the idea that what Rangers had to do was resist. On the right, Óscar de Marcos provided a steady stream of balls into the box. In the middle, Maroan Sannadi, a huge, broad-shouldered centre-forward with his socks half way down his shins, was becoming a key figure. He was playing third tier football three months ago; now he stood above on the European stage.Athletic were dominating, although Rangers might have been handed an opportunity when Cyriel Dessers fell in the area. He said he had been pulled by Dani Vivian and had the proof of it too: a gaping hole in the front of his shirt. “That should be a penalty and a red card; it’s baffling,” Ferguson said. When Rangers broke soon after, Vaclav Cerny decided to take on the shot from 50 yards, snatching at a rare sight. The “ooh” from the Athletic fans was came from a place of fun, not fear, but the Czech would end up worrying them.View image in fullscreenAthletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet sends Liam Kelly the wrong way from the spot.Photograph: Vincent West/ReutersAthletic’s attempts were accumulating and becoming clearer too. De Marcos set up Sannadi for a miss very similar to one at Ibrox. An outrageous piece of control from Sancet made another opportunity, Berenguer bending past the post. And then Sannadi rolled Tavernier and Yilmaz to set up Nico Williams. Kelly was out of his goal but, incredibly, Williams shot wide. And then it happened, three minutes into added time at the end of the first half. Sannadi was clipped by John Souttar and Athletic had another penalty; this time it was Sancet who took it, not Berenguer, and this time Kelly couldn’t stop it.It was still just one goal, Athletic knew. They were reluctant to sit on this, aware that a single moment could change everything. Rangers too knew that, and when that opportunity came they so very nearly took it. Cerny’s free-kick hit the wall but the loose ball was lobbed back into the box where Dessers swung at an overhead kick, the scuffed ball falling at the feet of Raskin. Six yards out, on the turn, he struck the post. On the touchline, Ferguson put his head in his hands and then found the fourth official unwilling to hear his appeals for a handball by Yeray Álvarez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sixty-eight minutes into the second leg, was Rangers’ first on target but it threatened not to be the last, hope revived amongst the visiting fans.Athletic, though, kept coming, determined not to leave this to chance. Vivian shot over, Berenguer curled wide and with 10 minutes left a perfect delivery found Nico Williams at the far post and he headed this place into raptures and his team into the semi-final.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAthletic BilbaoRangersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Such is life for Enzo Maresca at the moment. Losing 2-1 toLegia Warsawon the night was embarrassing. Chelsea, who seemed intent on giving the fifth-best side in Poland hope of pulling off a comeback for the ages at a disgruntled Stamford Bridge, were shambolic and easily could have crashed out.No wonder Maresca is not feeling the love from the crowd. Nobody celebratedChelseasqueezing into a Conference League semi-final against Djurgården after winning 4-2 on aggregate. The defending was miserable and the attack was poor. Filip Jörgensen, Robert Sánchez’s understudy, was jittery in goal and the worries around Cole Palmer’s slump are not going away.Maresca picking a fight with Chelsea fans feels like an act of self-sabotage | Jacob SteinbergRead morePalmer, who has gone 15 games without scoring, again cut a frustrated figure. He was not alone, though. Nobody had turned up expecting that they might be about to witness a Polish attempt at aremontada. Initially there was intrigue about Maresca naming such a strong side when Chelsealed 3-0 from the first leg. There was no rest for Marc Cucurella at left-back, although it was possible to interpret starts for Palmer and Nicolas Jackson as an opportunity to play themselves back into form.That seemed a sound theory when Palmer surged through in the second minute, only to shoot wide. Will his goal drought ever end? Palmer toiled. He spurned another chance moments later, failing to turn in a rebound after Jackson had a shot saved by Vladan Kovacevic, and Maresca’s gamble was looking decidedly foolish when a nasty challenge from Tomas Pekhart left Chelsea’s chief creator hobbling in the 20th minute.Chelsea were behind by that stage, Pekhart squeezing a penalty past Jörgensen after being fouled by the goalkeeper, and were far from secure. The first hint of discontent from the home support came when Ryoya Morishita shot just wide after sprinting past Cucurella.View image in fullscreenTomas Pekhart gave the visitors a glimmer of hope after winning and scoring an early penalty.Photograph: John Walton/PA“It was a poor performance,” Reece James, Chelsea’s captain, said. “We had a 3-0 lead – maybe that played a part in taking our foot off the gas. Maybe we disrespected the competition today. If you don’t prepare right, you will pay. It’s going to affect the mindset. It’s going to be in the back of people’s heads. I understand the frustration. Fans come to see excitement. We were frustrating to watch.”The mood improved when Cucurella, Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025, met a cross from Jadon Sancho to make it 1-1. It dipped when the hosts, who brought Tyrique George on for Jackson at half-time, started the second half badly. Chelsea’s distribution was poor and a mistake from Josh Acheampong almost led to Claude Gonçalves heading past Jörgensen.Chelsea have produced a lot of great defensive performances in Europe but this was not one of them. Tosin Adarabioyo and Benoït Badiashile were unconvincing in the middle and Legia regained their lead when Steve Kapuadi punished dismal marking at a corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Japanese winger sustained a heel injury against Crystal Palace, ruling him out ofthe draw with Leicester. It was the first time he had missed a Premier League game all season after making 31 appearances. Whether he will be available against Brentford is yet to be seen but, with three teenagers on the bench last weekend, the more experience Hürzeler can name on the teamsheet the better. James Milner, Igor Julio, Georginio Rutter, Adam Webster, Ferdi Kadioglu and Tariq Lamptey are all out, while the goalkeeper Jason Steele returned to action for the under-21s this week but Carl Rushworth will remain the backup to Bart Verbruggen for now. If Mitoma can recover in time, it will be a timely boost as Hürzeler’s side fight for a European place.Will UnwinBrentford v Brighton, Saturday 3pm (all times BST)2Palace need to tighten up fastConceding 10 goals in their past two games has extinguished Crystal Palace’s chances of gatecrashing the chase for the Champions League places, but Bournemouth’s visit to Selhurst Park is an opportunity to cut the gap to Andoni Iraola’s side to two points. “Maybe it’s good for us getting one step back,” reflected Oliver Glasner afterNewcastle’s 5-0 winon Wednesday. “Now we’ll focus on the basics and remember what made us so strong. Now is not the time to point fingers. We’ll just look in the mirror and I’ll see what I can change a little bit.” With a trip to Arsenal in midweek before their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Palace must turn things around quickly if they are to remain in contention for Europe on two fronts.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenCrystal Palace have lost 5-2 and 5-0 in successive matches.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA3Broja playing for Everton future?Major upheaval was on the cards at Everton this summer regardless of how they finished the season, which, thanks to David Moyes’s impact, is with encouragement rather than trepidation. A staggering 13 members of the first-team squad are out of contract at the end of the campaign, including loanees, and Abdoulaye Doucouré’s celebration after scoring thelate winner at Nottingham Forestdemonstrated renewal talks have not exactly been gathering pace. There is no reason for further delay with the club 13th in the table and 17 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with six games to play. Moyes’s decision to start Armando Broja over Beto or Youssef Chermiti at Forest reflected a desire to see the Albania international in competitive action as he assesses all options. Everton can make Broja’s loan move from Chelsea permanent for £30m this summer. His injury record suggests that will be a non-starter but his ability, coupled with Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s likely departure, could make a cheaper bid worth considering should he get another chance to impress against Manchester City and take it.Andy HunterEverton vManchester City, Saturday 3pm4Ferguson floundering at West HamEvan Ferguson’s move to West Ham has not gone to plan. The striker has made one start since joining on loan from Brighton in January and has been an unused substitute since coming off at half-time against Wolves earlier this month. Graham Potter, who knew Ferguson well before bringing him to east London, seems to have given up on the 20-year-old. Niclas Füllkrug is above Ferguson in the pecking order and has done well as a substitute in his previous three appearances. It could be another long afternoon watching from the sidelines for Ferguson whenSouthamptonvisit the London Stadium. The Republic of Ireland forward may spy an opportunity against the worst team in the league, but will Potter be willing to give enough minutes to a player who has not looked sharp enough during his brief cameos in claret and blue?Jacob SteinbergWest Ham v Southampton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenEvan Ferguson (left) attempts to shield the ball from Wolves’ Emmanuel Agbadou during his last outing for West Ham.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/Reuters5Villa have to refocus after midweek dramaAfteran intoxicating Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germainin midweek, Aston Villa switch their focus to domestic duties. How much did running PSG so close drain Villa? Unai Emery has always maintained the league is his priority as it provides the pathway to Europe’s elite competition. Marcus Rashford enjoyed his best performance in a Villa shirt but Ollie Watkins, one goal shy of Gabby Agbonlahor’s goalscoring record (74) in the top flight, could return to the starting lineup after being reduced to a substitute role in four of Villa’s past five matches. Newcastle will arrive in Birmingham fresh from a thumping victory over Crystal Palace which extended their winning streak to six matches, while Villa have won nine of their past 10 games in all competitions. There is plenty at stake as two form teams, both of whom have designs on Champions League football next season, collide.Ben FisherAston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 5.30pm6Fulham look to write derby historyWin, loss, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss: so goes Fulham’s form in their past eight league games. They are nothing if not reliably unreliable and, given their recent record, they will presumably go into this weekend’s west London derby with Chelsea full of belief after defeat toBournemouthlast Monday. Chelsea have not won an away game in the league since December, a major complication in their quest for Champions League qualification, and their fans look ready to turn on Enzo Maresca. Fulham, who have already take points off Arsenal, Liverpool and Forest at home this season, could deepen the gloom. Yet history is not on their side. Fulham won at Stamford Bridge in December but have never done a league double over their wealthier neighbours. Expectations around Marco Silva’s side are high, but can they hold their nerve and boost their push for European football?JSFulham vChelsea, Sunday 2pm7Can Hirst step up in Delap-less future?All the talk has been aboutLiam Delap’s futureat Ipswich as he enters his final six games for the club. The striker will cost someone £30m in the summer and there is absolutely no chance he will stay to spearhead Ipswich’s attempt at returning to the top flight. This will leave a gap at the top of the pitch. George Hirst started in the draw at Stamford Bridge last Sunday as Delap nursed a rib injury. The Scotland international was part of the team thattook a two-goal leadagainst Chelsea, proving his worth as the understudy. He has four goals in 23 appearances but has mainly appeared off the bench under Kieran McKenna. Hirst would love the opportunity to show he can replace Delap in the long term and be a regular scorer. All he needs is a few more chances, but it would be a bold decision to start him against Arsenal.WUIpswich vArsenal, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenGeorge Hirst may go down with Ipswich but could he help them find a way back up?Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters8United face hard truths against WolvesSurely no one would have wagered onManchester Unitedwelcoming Wolves in mid-April only two points better off, with 38, than their visitors, and two places higher in 14th. But this is where Ruben Amorim’s insipid gang of flatliners find themselves as they trudge through the club’s poorest ever Premier League campaign. They can only realistically hope to end up 11th, where Brentford sit on 43 points, as even a top-half finish seems improbable with Brighton 10th on 48 points, 10 ahead with 18 left to play for. Next season has to be better or Amorim will be history.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Wolves, Sunday 2pm9Youth get a chance in Foxes’ dead rubbersRuud van Nistelrooy knows the gig is up at Leicester. They are whimpering their way to the Championship but he is at least using the long list of dead rubbers to give academy products aPremier Leaguedebut. Jeremy Monga and Jake Evans have come off the bench in recent weeks for a taste of life at the top and the next potential debutant is Olabade Aluko. The 18-year-old defender has progressed through the ranks at the King Power Stadium after joining at 15. Aluko, who can play right-back or centre-back, was named on the bench at Brighton but was an unused substitute, instead witnessing Evans take his bow. Two appearances in the EFL Trophy, against Northampton and Notts County, have given him a taste of senior football but playing against the Premier League champions elect would be one to remember.WULeicester vLiverpool, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenJeremy Monga (second left), aged 15, was given his Leicester chance by Ruud van Nistelrooy.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters10Wood waiting to get back to his bestThe good news forNottingham Forestis that Chris Wood was back on the pitch last weekend against Everton. The bad news is that they lost and the New Zealand international did not look up to speed after his hip problem. Nuno Espírito Santo needs his striker firing if Forest are to maintain their push for a Champions League spot. Playing on Monday night will provide Wood with longer to fully recover from the problem picked up last month when playing for the All Whites, and any New Zealander will want to get one over on an Australian. His 18 league goals are a key reason why Forest find themselves in the Champions League places but, after two straight defeats, they need to turn things around to avoid all the hard work going to waste.WUTottenham v Nottingham Forest, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3243762Arsenal3230633Newcastle3221594Nottm Forest3213575Man City3220556Chelsea3217547Aston Villa323548AFC Bournemouth3212489Fulham3244810Brighton3224811Brentford3244312Crystal Palace32-44313Everton32-43814Man Utd32-73815Tottenham Hotspur32113716Wolverhampton32-143517West Ham32-183518Ipswich32-342119Leicester32-451820Southampton32-5410Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendEvertonManchester CityAston VillaNewcastle UnitedWest Ham UnitedSouthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The car struggles with balance problems and is proving a handful to drive, with the team identifying a disconnect between their data from the wind tunnel and its real-world performance.‘Very alarming’: Red Bull hold crisis talks as Verstappen stews over Bahrain F1 GPRead moreAfter the race, Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko called the performance“very alarming”and warned that “the concern is great” Verstappen, who has a performance-related escape clause in his ­contract, could leave. Senior ­personnel, including Marko and the team ­principal, Christian Horner, held crisis talks after the race to consider how to address the car’s problems.Speaking before this weekend’s Saudi Arabian grand prix, the Dutchman brushed off suggestions he would join another team. “Honestly a lot of people are talking about it except me,” he said. “I just want to focus on my car and work with the people in my team. That is all I am thinking about in F1 at the moment.“I am happy [at Red Bull], I’m just not very happy with our car. But that goes for everyone, we all want to be better, there’s no secret about that. That’s what we’re trying to improve.”There have been questions raised about internal conflicts and discord at the team over the past 12 months and whether they were having an impact on performance and on ­Verstappen. After the race at the Sakhir circuit, Sky’s pit-lane reporter Ted ­Kravitz witnessed Verstappen’s manager, Raymond Vermeulen, confronting Marko in the team’s garage. Events which Verstappen also attempted to defuse.“To my knowledge they were having a conversation about everything, which is allowed,” he said. “We were all left frustrated with things that went wrong in the race. That’s what my manager, Raymond, and Helmut spoke about and Christian came along as well so they had a ­conversation. We all care about the team. We care about the team, the people and results.”Verstappen trails the championship leader, McLaren’s Lando Norris, by eight points and is in third place behind Norris’s teammate, Oscar Piastri. McLaren have the quickest car in the field at this point and in ­contrast to last season, when the Dutchman opened with an ­enormously strong series of races, this year he is on the back foot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rest is out of my hands anyway,” he said. “Of course if we are not the quickest it’s very tough to fight for a championship.

After avoiding a scare to edge out Rob Cross 6-5, Littler fell 3-2 behind to Bunting and then drew the ire of the Dutch crowd when he spent time changing his barrels – to no avail, as Bunting charged into a 5-2 lead.Nathan Aspinall fights back for home Premier League win over HumphriesRead moreLittler celebrated pulling it back to 5-3 and it signalled a change of momentum as he came back to level things up. But in a tense deciding leg, Littler missed double nine when looking for a 138 checkout and Bunting made him pay as he advanced to the final against Dobey.Few would have predicted a final between the two players who started the night last in the standings, but Dobey had looked strong all evening, opening with a 6-3 win over Luke Humphries, the world No 1, before dispatching Nathan Aspinall, last week’s winner, 6-2.In the final, Dobey seized a 4-1 lead when Bunting blew his chance three times on double 19 to cut the deficit, effectively the end of his challenge as Dobey took full control for his first nightly win since the opening night of the 2023 season.“It feels great to be back in the winner’s circle,” Dobey said. “I knew I could do it. It’s about performing on the night and three great performances, I’ve put myself back in the mix.“I’m a fighter. I came through it. I’ve been in matches where I’ve been cruising and then ended up losing. It’s about getting myself back amongst the elite. I’m here to win and I never gave myself any doubt.

I’ve been put down so much, I don’t want to bring anyone down. Men’s tennis needs him.“[But] if I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let’s be honest. I would have gotten grand slams taken away from me.”Sinner, whose suspension ends on 4 May, twice tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol in March 2024. He has maintained his innocence, claiming the drug entered his system through a massage from a trainer.The 23-year-old Italian accepted his ban after reaching an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged the InternationalTennisIntegrity Agency’s earlier decision to clear him of any wrongdoing.Williams, 43, said she took extra precautions to avoid any accidental ingestion of an illegal substance, joking that a PED scandal would have landed her “in jail”.A three-time grand slam winner, Sinner is expected to make his return to the tour on home turf at the Italian Open, an ATP 1000 clay-court tournament in Rome that begins on 5 May.Williams, who retired after the 2022 US Open, told the magazine she misses playing tennis.“I miss it a lot, with all my heart.

But the true home of the 21st-century cowboy is about 7,500 miles south, in what used to be theAmazon rainforestof Brazil, where the reality of raising cattle and producing beef is better characterised by depression, market pressure and vexed efforts to prevent the destruction of the land and its people.The toll was apparent along the rutted PA 279 road in Pará state. Signs of human and environmental stress were not hard to find during the last dry season. Record drought had dried up irrigation ponds and burned pasture grass down to the roots, leaving emaciated cattle behind the fences. Exposed red soil was whipped up into dust devils as SUVs and cattle trucks sped past on their way between Xinguara and São Félix do Xingu, which is home to both the biggest herd on the planet and the fastest erasure of forest in the Amazon.Later this year, Pará will host the Cop30 climate conference, which would be an ideal moment forBrazilto demonstrate progress on a new system to track livestock and reduce emissions from deforestation. That system should be completed by the end of 2026. But few ranchers believe this will happen because of the huge gulf between what locals want and what the world needs.The first ranchers here were once told they were heroes for opening new economic frontiers. But the climate crisis has dealt a triple blow to their reputation and their livelihoods: not only has it become harder to feed and water their livestock, they now face criticism for wrecking a biodiverse pillar of the global environment while also bearing the brunt of conflicting demands from multinational food corporations to provide food that is both economically cheap and ecologically ethical.At a time when humanity is breaching more and more environmental limits, this challenge is more than many can bear.“What is our biggest disease today? Depression. That’s what is killing the most (producers),” says Thaueny Stival, the owner of a mid-sized ranch in the small town of Água Azul do Norte.A thoughtful man who says he is trying to modernise and do the right thing, Stival says ranchers are struggling to cope with rapidly changing perceptions about food production. When pioneers first arrived in this region in the 1980s, he says, they were encouraged to clear forest by Brazil’s government (then a military dictatorship). Banks would not give them loans unless they cleared most of their land.That partial and romanticised story of Amazon colonisation from half a century ago has been overtaken by more recent and brutal changes. In this region, the vast majority of ranchers have invaded public lands without permission. Now there is growing evidence that the deforestation that followed is pushing the Amazon to the point of no return, with dire consequences for the world’s climate. The result is that the ranchers who once considered themselves national heroes are now treated as global pariahs.Graphic showing the progress of deforestation in Tucumã, Pará state, BrazilStival says the average rancher is suffering beyond endurance. “Now he is seeing his assets being diluted by government rules and corporate regulations … and soon he will not be able to sell his product, and he will have financial difficulties. What will he do? Either he will commit suicide, or he will become depressed. The guy says: ‘I did everything and now I can’t support my family?’”It’s a common lament in the Amazon ranching community, and one that helps to explain why populist politicians such as the former president Jair Bolsonaro and the US president, Donald Trump, have such an appeal. It taps straight into the existential debate about the role of frontier men and women – farmers, miners, oil workers – in a world where wide-open spaces are increasingly constrained by environmental limits.The economist Kenneth Boulding wrote six decades ago aboutthe need for humanity to transition away from a “cowboy economy”of endless frontiers and unlimited growth towards a “spaceman economy” that would treat the Earth as a giant life-support system, carefully managing and cycling finite resources while strengthening ways to capture and use the unlimited energy provided by the sun. For oil workers, miners, and ranchers, these are not philosophical discussions, but attacks on their existence, on what they do every single day. They are life-or-death issues that create uncertainty and insecurity and help to foster political extremism.The revolt of the cowboys helps to explain the rise of far right demagogues but it doesn’t change the reality of the climate crisis, which is driven by physics and chemistry, not opinion and politics. The question is not whether change will come, but how soon and how disruptive it will be. Ranchers have started to see with their own eyes how the Amazonian climate is becoming more hostile. And some are responding.View image in fullscreenBoats on the dry bed of a tributary of the River Tapajós during intense drought in Pará state in October.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersStival says he is now investing in genetically enhanced livestock, chemical fertiliser and other technology to improve efficiency, rather than expanding through the clearance of more forest. This is a common claim in the region, though researchers say the change is incremental and largely driven by necessity – there is very little forest left to cut down.Stival insists the mindset of ranchers has shifted: “We used to look at the land as a table, we just wanted to make it bigger, but today we look at it as a building. We want to increase productivity in a smaller area.”But he complains authorities are placing too much of a burden on farmers. “No one can get a loan from a bank any more because [they are told] ‘Oh, that area of yours is not reforested,” he laments. “And in a little while your cattle will be illegal cattle, then what are you going to do?”He is referring to plans – promised by JBS – the world’s largest meat producer, which is the majority buyer from ranchers in the Amazon – for a new birth-to-abattoir tracking system that will, supposedly by the end of this year, tag and trace every head of cattle in the Amazon to ensure none of them are raised in areas that have been deforested. An investigation by the Guardian and its partners suggests this deadline will be missed. JBS told the Guardian that it respectfully contested the conclusions of the investigation, but added that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks”.Bar chart showing the increase in beef production in Brazil in the last 60 yearsThe company have so far not succeeded in mapping the entire supply chain, a target due, under its deforestation commitments, to be completed by the end of this year, but a spokesperson told the Guardian JBS has enrolled the equivalent of “more than 80% of its annual cattle purchases” onto the blockchain-enabled platform. “As you are aware, the challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometeres are significant.” Its response includes a zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply-chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS fund for the Amazon, as well as working with partners to implement solutions and develop protocols such as the Beef on Track initiative in the Amazon biome. “Cattle-raising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry’s challenges.”Stival accepts that change is needed, but he says neither JBS nor the authorities are doing enough to meet the year-end deadline because the scale of environmental violations and confusion over land in southern Pará is just too enormous. Asked if JBS can put its new system in place by December, he shakes his head: “There is no way.”The same mood of frustration and dismay is evident at the next town, a few hundred kilometres further along the road. “This won’t be resolved by the end of 2026,” says Francival Cassiono do Rego, the president of the Tucumã-Ourilândia Union of Rural Producers. “About 80% of the producers in this region don’t have a definitive title. We have been trying to resolve this for 20, 30 years and no one has come up with a solution.”Researchers say that is largely because that many farmers are suspected of invading their land, but Cassiono do Rego blames the EU – the world’s biggest market – for passing a deforestation-free trade rule that has prompted JBS and Brazilian authorities to step up monitoring. Like many ranchers, Cassiono do Rego sees this as a tactic in a trade war driven by foreign farmers who want to weaken the competition offered by cheap Amazonian beef.Adelosmar Antonio Orio, a sprightly 82-year-old rancher more widely known as “Ticão”, insists the environment is a secondary concern compared to land regularisation. “The biggest concern today for cattle ranchers here is this legal uncertainty. We’ve already lost a partner, a comrade. He put a gun to his head and killed himself … It wasn’t just one person, it was several. It’s happened before … Pressure and depression come. But there is no solution.”Environmentalists, scientists and public defenders argue that many of these woes are self-inflicted. Countless ranchers are out of legal compliance, they argue, because they invaded land or broke rules on forest clearance. At several points in the past decade, São Felix do Xingu has had the dubious distinction of contributing more greenhouse gases than any of the other 5,000 municipalities in Brazil, according to the civil society coalition the Climate Observatory, as a result of burning forests to create pasture for its 2.5m cattle. It is largely thanks to places like this that Brazilian agriculture has a more destructive carbon footprint than the industrial powerhouse of Japan.And rather than clean up, many in the beef industry have simply found loopholes that allow them to carry on with the old ways. “Cattle laundering”, which hides the origins of livestock from environmentally embargoed ranches, is so widespread that few farmers bother to hide what they are doing.The expansion of JBS has run right alongside this. Since the 1970s, while the rainforest has lost about 20% of its cover, the company has opened or acquired 21 slaughterhouses in the legal Amazon and built a network of 19,000 suppliers in the region. Despite frequent promises to clean up its supply chain, the company hasrepeatedly been foundto be buying from farmers who illegally cleared forest.JBS’s latest “global commitment” is for deforestation-free supply chains by the end of 2025. It has established a network of “green offices” to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to meet the requirements of its new hi-tech tracking platform. At the Tucumã meatpacking plant, a company representative, Vitoria Batista, explained how artificial intelligence and WhatsApp messaging would remotely monitor supplier farms and advise ranchers on regulatory and corporate requirements.“We need to break paradigms,” she says. JBS pays for outside consultants to help ranchers move into compliance. “It’s all done by women,” Batista says. “The first impression [of the producers] is not easy, but then they understand and they see for themselves that it is necessary, that there is no way to get away from it, that they have to regularise.”At another Amazonian frontier town, Rondon do Pará, a windowless, air-conditioned lecture room is the setting for a meeting about land and how to modernise its productivity. Big outdoor men hunch behind small desks and listen to consultants and lawyers, who show PowerPoint presentations on market trends, cattle tracing, pasture maintenance, daily weight gain, soil analysis, fertiliser inputs, herbicide costs, environmental embargos, indigenous land rights and rainfall shortages. In short, all the legal and data-driven essentials for the archetypal rancher of the 21st-century world.View image in fullscreenRanchers herd cattle in Santana do Araguaia, Pará state, Brazil.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA keynote speaker at thisEncontro dos Pecuaristas(meeting of the Livestock Farmers) is the lawyer and land-owner Vinicius Borba, a slim man with a thin beard and a sharp turn of phrase. Borba says he represents rural producers in the indigenous territory of Apyterewa. Before the meeting, he had spoken defiantly about his own environmental penalties and accusations of wrongdoing, which he blamed on the government’s failure to legitimise his property. “I am called a land-grabber, an invader, a deforester, but it is not my fault,” he said. “I have a property that we have occupied for over 20 years, and to this day the government has not given me the title … Since the regularisation never comes, I end up becoming a statistic, another land-grabber.”Borba says ranchers are victims of environmental policy shifts. “What we see today is a rule being changed in the middle of the game,” he tells the gathering of ranchers. “I don’t think it’s fair, I don’t think it’s legal, but it’s our reality.”He argues, like many Brazilians, that double standards are being applied, because Europe has already cleared most of its forests. What he omits to mention is that the forests of Europe were mainly cleared several centuries ago, when there was no inkling of the climate impact. Today, those consequences are unmistakable. As Borba gives his address, the Amazon is suffering its second year of debilitating drought. For decades, rainy seasons have been shrinking along with the rainforest. This is hard on farmers as well as the global climate.Beyond the heroic stories of carving through the forest, Amazonian cattle ranching is actually propped up by hefty subsidies. Perverse commercial incentives encourage farmers to destroy forest. The most lucrative profits come from a mark-up of land valuations after territory is seized and occupied by cattle. “The more legal you are, the less you are worth,” one rancher told me. “If your land is 80% forest, then nobody wants to buy it.”With the money from property speculation, some land-grabbers have been able to fund political parties, evangelical groups and media organisations. So much is at stake thatsome resort to murder and violenceto drive others off the land. The risks of punishment are low and the potential rewards are enormous. State governors and municipal mayors may come from the agriculture and extractive industries, many of which grew powerful by seizing land. The “ruralist bloc” has a powerful presence in the national congress, and had a particularly powerful influence on the presidency during the 2019-2023 era of Jair Bolsonaro.But there are also ranchers who believe change will usher in a better future. Mauro Lúcio Costa is every inch the model, modern rancher. His traditional cowboy attire – Texas Stetson, crisp white shirt, big belt buckle, blue jeans and brown boots – belies his use of advanced husbandry technology and environmentally progressive land management practices on his extensive farm. He is compliant with forest code requirements that he preserve 80% of the vegetation, yet, thanks to careful selection of livestock and minutely calibrated fertiliser inputs, he has one of the most productive and profitable farms in the Amazon. Ten years ago, he established his own supply-chain tracing system. Initially, he says, this was not for environmental motives but as a management tool that would help him to improve the quality of his herd and reassure customers. “I started this in 2015, because it was clear to me that the market would demand it,” he said.Once he started looking, he found 40% of his cattle and 30% of his suppliers were not compliant with environmental standards. Cutting them and finding alternatives was the biggest expense of the new system – and he predicts this will also prove the case for the big meatpacking companies. To avoid this in the future, he has teamed up with a company called Niceplanet to develop a smartphone app that helps suppliers to attain compliance.Lúcio Costa peppers his speech with biblical references, a sign not just of his religious faith but his skill in winning over grassroots audiences in a realm dominated by the“bibles, bullets and beef” lobby. He has also persuaded prominent conservationists, although others have doubts about the chemical inputs he is adding to soil to increase pasture productivity and weight gain in his stock. Lúcio Costa also has the ear of senior figures in JBS and the government, and is often held up as an example of the gains that could come from effective monitoring and greater intensification.He is working to help JBS implement its tracing system, and unlike most people interviewed for this story, he believes it can be done by the end of this year. The alternative, he says, is almost too terrible to contemplate: the company’s withdrawal from its three meatpacking centres in southern Pará. “It would close its plants here, which would cause JBS no problem at all because it has plants all over the world … but for us producers in Pará, it would be a huge loss.” That is why, he says, he is trying to persuade ranchers to embrace the change, even though JBS is a competitor to his family’s own meatpacking facility. “When it comes to livestock farming I can’t just look out for myself, I have to look out for livestock farming, and in my view, it’s very bad for livestock farming in Pará if JBS leaves here.”Map showing the Amazon states in BrazilCristina Malcher, the president of the Women’s Commission in Agriculture, and a Bolsonaro supporter like most ranchers we spoke to, says Brazilian meatpacking companies dictate low prices in the Amazon, sell globally for big profits, and are now trying to introduce a new transparency system that will put all the burden on ranchers, while allowing them to claim to be a sustainable company and charge higher prices. “JBS is a cancer,” she says. “JBS only works in its favour. It wants the market abroad, so it comes here and sets a bunch of rules for us to follow because it has made a commitment to the world.”But she believes it is a ruse to appease foreign interests, like the tricks that the 19th-century Brazilian slavers used to fob off inspections by foreign, usually British, abolitionists. It is a way, she says, of “pretending we cannot do anything illegal or irregular so they are able, as they say, to make something ‘for the English to see’”.All the same, she says, change is coming, whether ranchers like it or not. “Unfortunately, the environmental issue is here to stay,” she says, of the growing pressure for transparent tracking systems to eradicate deforestation from supply chains. “If we don’t wake up, we will be left out of rural production.”"

In an effort to boost already booming US energy production, the emergency declaration directed federal agencies to identify all policies and regulations that “unduly” burden fuel producers and create “action plans” to weaken or remove them.The lawsuit seeks information about the development of these action plans from four federal agencies: the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service.Since the executive order was passed, the administration has announced plans to eliminate scores of other green policies. Last week, for instance, it emerged that the EPA plans toeliminate long-standing requirementsfor polluting companies to collect and report their greenhouse gas emissions, ProPublica reported.The great Mississippi tops list of most endangered rivers amid fears over Trump rollbacksRead moreThe legal challenge follows a February request for information filed by the advocacy group under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia), for which officials have not yet provided any records.“Given the substantial implications for air and water, wildlife and nature, climate, public lands, and the environment generally through the development of energy resources,” the lawsuit says, “the Center is deeply interested in, and affected by, how the action plans implementing the Executive Order could harm, undermine, or negate the Center’s longstanding efforts to protect the environment.”Foia is meant to compel officials to provide access to information about the functioning of federal agencies within 20 business days of a request. Though backlogs have long been common, the advocacy group says it is concerned the Trump administration is deliberately slowing the process to block public access to information.The lawsuit comes as federal agencies have slashed protections for public lands, approved air pollution permits for fossil fuel-processing facilities without environmental reviews, and gutted slews of green policies and spending plans while firing thousands of civil servants.It also follows record donations to Trump’s presidential campaign from oil, gas and coal companies, sparking concerns of corruption. In aJune meetingat his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump infamously asked fossil fuel bosses for $1bn in campaign contributions, while vowing to unravel dozens of Biden-era environmental policies.“It seems obvious that polluters and other special interests are completely in the driver’s seat and probably ghost-writing all of Trump’s pro-fossil fuel directives,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Why else would Trump officials be so defiant about illegally keeping the public in the dark?”The EPA declined to comment on the pending litigation. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It disclosed a position of almost 6m shares, according to Trump Media.Short-selling is a way of betting against a public company. An investor borrows a stock, and then sells it on; should the stock fall, the investor then buys it back and pockets the difference.In a memo to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump Media – which trades under the ticker “DJT”, using Trump’s initials – said the total short interest in the company was 10.7m as of 31 March, according to Nasdaq, where its shares are listed, and had only risen to about 11m as of Wednesday.These factors “especially when combined with the history of suspicious trading surrounding DJT stock … could be indications of the illegal naked short selling of DJT shares”, Trump Media claimed.Qube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Trump Media rallied by about 7% in New York on Thursday. They have fallen by more than a third this year.The firm is currently seeking to branch out beyond its core Truth Social platform, and this week announced investment accounts based on themes, including “Made in America” and “Energy Independence”, which align with the Trump administration’s agenda.On its website, Qube says it combines “data, research, technology and trading expertise” to “solve the most complex challenges”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also has offices in Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai.In that time, Qube has grown quickly to rival some established giants of the industry, reportedly managing about $23bn of assets, which according to industry estimates would put it among the top 1% of hedge funds. It is also considered unusual for its lack of a New York office and collaborative corporate culture.Alongside its short position in Trump Media, Qube has short positions in a range of UK-listed companies, including real estate firms, fashion retailer Boohoo and bowling centre operator Hollywood Bowl Group, according to the latest disclosures with the UK’s City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHedge fundsLondonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “We both went down below the surface and we were horizontal facing each other and we were holding each other’s arms.“I signalled to Emily that something was wrong and pointed to my ears and gave her the signal to go back up. I did this two or three times.“At this point we got caught in a vortex and started to spin around. I wasn’t able to check my dive computer due to the spinning. I just felt disorientated.“We held each other’s arms and I signalled to go up but I did not see her do it back. Visibility was poor and I could only see about one metre. I could see Emily was vertical and not rising. At this point things get a bit hazy as it all happened so fast.“She was vertical and her regulator was out of her mouth. She was sinking at the time and I attempted to reach down but that was not possible. At this point I could feel some water seeping into my mask.“We hit the bottom of the seabed hard and I was unable to see Emily. I ascended to the surface quickly and spoke to the skipper, who signalled the mayday and then other boats and the rescue helicopter came to the area.”Sherwin’s mother, Ellen, said: “She had loved her first year at university and was looking forward to returning to move in with her friends in September. She had been celebrating her birthday the night before.“She was fit and healthy and passionate about the natural world and especially sea life. Her hero was David Attenborough.“She started diving in 2023 and immediately loved it as she felt a sense of calm in the water. She described it as her safe space.”The coroner Richard Middleton gave a narrative conclusion and said Sherwin’s cause of death remained unknown.Explore more on these topicsDorsetEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In itslatest annual accounts, MBR disclosed that it had entered into an option arrangement with Spurs to buy the lease on one of its retail sites, believed to be the Toby Carvery in Enfield.Spurs have submitted a planning application to build a women’s football training academy on 17 hectares of adjacent land in Whitewebbs Park. It also submitted plans to build an access road from the training ground to the Toby Carvery. The plan for an access road has since been replaced with a scheme for a footpath across the site where the oak, which was up to 500 years old, stood.As part of the planning process, Spurs commissioned the Tree and Woodland Company to produce an arboreal impact assessment on the veteran woodland in the park.In a report submitted to Enfield council last July, the company assessed that the now felled oak was a “fine specimen” that was expected to live for at least another 50 years. It recommended conservation measures for the tree as a high priority.MBR claimed its contractors felled the tree on 3 April for safety reasons after assessing it was dead and diseased. In a letter to Enfield residents on Thursday, its chief executive, Phil Urban, said: “I can only apologise for all the upset that it has caused.”It said: “We are obliged to act on all health and safety issues where expert advice warns us of a direct risk to life or serious injury. We will complete a thorough review and ensure that, in future, exceptional situations are treated differently from the more regular health and safety issues that arise on a day-to-day basis.”Enfield council hasthreatened the company with legal actionand imposed a tree preservation order on the whole Toby Carvery site.The Woodlands Trust, which objected to the training facility plans because of the impact on ancient trees in the area, said Spurs and MBR had more questions to answer.Adam Cormack, the trust’s head of campaigning, said: “There is some uncertainty about whether the ancient Whitewebbs oak that was felled is or is not part of development plans for Tottenham Hotspur FC’s new training facility and we’d like to seek clarification from the club on this.”Cormack welcomed Toby Carvery’s apology but said it did not go far enough. He said: “Toby Carvery must now be fully transparent with their paperwork and work with local authorities as they investigate. Did they know about the Spurs tree survey, which called the oak a ‘fine specimen’ and makes recommendations for its conservation? Did they consider any alternatives to felling, and if not, why not?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I have looked at the structural integrity of the tree and I saw it in December. There was no logic to touching that tree other than wanting an ancient tree out of the way because of some financial interest.”Police closed their investigation on Tuesday after deciding it was a civil matter.MBR decline to comment.A Spurs spokesperson said: “The tree and the decision to fell it has no connection to the club as the tree sits outside of our lease demise for our proposed women’s and girls’ training centre and academy.”The club confirmed it had an option to lease Toby Carvery’s land within Whitewebbs Park but stressed this was just an option. It also claimed it was “ridiculous” to suggest the tree was felled to make the land easier to develop.Explore more on these topicsLondonTrees and forestsConservationTottenham HotspurEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024, Switzerland formally charged him with war crimes.Concerns about Rifaat’s activities, including his record as the head of a feared Syrian paramilitary force known as the Defense Brigades, have been publicly raised in Europe and the US by the media, human rights groups and government officials since the 1980s. He left Syria for Europe in 1984 after a failed coup against his brother.Inquiries by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have established that Mark Bridges, also known as the third Baron Bridges, served as a trustee on at least five trusts holding assets in France and Spain on behalf of Rifaat al-Assad or his relatives between 1999 and 2008.During the same period, Bridges also held one of the most prestigious legal positions in Britain: private legal adviser to the British monarch. He was Queen Elizabeth’s solicitor from 2002 to 2019.The findings raise questions about whether it was appropriate for the monarch’s personal lawyer to take the ethical and reputational risk of working for an individual accused of human rights atrocities, in view of potential embarrassment to the queen had the connection been discovered while she was still alive.There is no suggestion of any regulatory wrongdoing by Bridges, who was knighted for his services to the queen in 2019. His firm, Farrer & Co, said the trusts were established on the advice of another leading law firm, that Bridges’s work for Rifaat al-Assad was in complete compliance with regulatory requirements in effect at the time and that Bridges had been presented with evidence contradicting the allegations made against him.Assad’s luxury property empireThe property empire amassed by Rifaat al-Assad after his arrival in Europe spanned the most luxurious postcodes of Paris, London and the Costa del Sol.His acquisitions, which he claimed were part-funded by cheques worth millions of dollars from the king of Saudi Arabia, included Witanhurst in London’s Highgate – the second-largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace – and a seven-storey mansion near Paris’s Arc de Triomphe.Assad held his property empire through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership. One trust was registered in the Bahamas, whilesome of the purchases used shell companies in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, before transfer to Spanish and later Maltese companies.In 2014, prosecutors in France began investigating whether Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth had in fact been obtained through corruption. Bridges had ceased acting as a trustee for Rifaat in 2008, his lawyers said, but continued to provide “limited and ad-hoc” legal advice until 2015 “in circumstances whereby the regulatory requirements imposed on the firm were met”.Two of the trusts that Bridges had managed were said to own the Spanish portion of Rifaat al-Assad’s real estate empire, including a deluxe villa with swathes of land near Marbella.In 2019, Spanish prosecutors alleged that these same trusts controlled shell companies holding more than 500 properties in Spain worth €695m (£595m). According to the Spanish prosecutors, the offshore setup was designed to “hide the true ownership of the huge amount of real estate properties” and enabled the “laundering [of] dirty money from abroad”, referring to funds allegedly stolen from the Syrian state.In 2020, aFrench court convicted Rifaat al-Assadof tax fraud and laundering embezzled public money – primarily about $200m (£151m) stolen from Syrian state funds and $100m in fraudulent loan agreements from Libya. Assad was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. He fled to Syria in 2021 while his conviction was under appeal.Allegations of atrocitiesThough not the only trustee serving Assad, Bridges was by far the most eminent. In addition to his services to the queen, he led the private client team at Farrer, an elite law firm with a reputation forged through serving British royals and aristocrats as far back as 1769.There is no evidence Bridges knew or suspected that Rifaat al-Assad’s money was stolen. Assad claimed his wealth came from benefactors, including the Saudi royal family, and in 2018 the Gibraltar supreme court concluded that it had been reasonable for Rifaat’s trustees to believe this story.The question of Rifaat al-Assad’s status as an alleged war criminal, however, is more complicated.View image in fullscreenRifaat al-Assad in 1984, before he fled from Damascus.Photograph: Philippe Bouchon/EPAIn February 1982, armed militias affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood staged an uprising against the Assad regime in the town of Hama, in western Syria. To suppress the uprising, Syria’s then president, Hafez al-Assad, Rifaat’s brother, dispatched the Syrian army and a paramilitary group called the Defense Brigades.An Amnesty International report published in 1983 found that while “it is difficult to establish for certain what happened”, allegations against Syrian regime forces included “collective execution of 70 people outside the municipal hospital” and “cyanide gas containers … alleged to have been brought into the city, connected by rubber pipes to the entrances of buildings believed to house insurgents, and turned on, killing all the buildings’ occupants”. It is estimated that 10,000 to 40,000 people may have been unlawfully tortured and executed.As head of the paramilitaries, Rifaat al-Assad was believed to have taken a leading role in the carnage. In a 1989 book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, the journalist Thomas Friedman described how, after initial skirmishes, “Rifaat’s tactic shifted from trying to ferret out nests of Muslim Brotherhood men to simply bringing whole neighbourhoods down on their heads and burying the Brotherhood and anyone else in the way.”They ‘didn’t look the type’: how the media was fooled by Bashar and Asma al-Assad | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAllegations of atrocities against Rifaat al-Assad were widely known by the point Bridges began working as a trustee for his offshore wealth in 1999.In 2013, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Rifaat al-Assad’s role in suppressing the Hama uprising. In 2021 it issued an international arrest warrant for Assad, and in 2024 he was formally charged with war crimes. Assad has always denied these charges. His whereabouts is unknown‘Credible information’Farrer said Assad’s trustees, including Bridges, “were provided with credible information, when they were appointed and at different junctures thereafter, which fundamentally contradicted the claims being made in the media about Mr al-Assad”.The firm added that it and Bridges were restricted by a duty of client confidentiality from revealing what this evidence was, or commenting on whether it was appropriate for the queen’s solicitor to also have represented Assad. However, it did share 11 French defamation judgments, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s, that found in Assad’s favour.The majority related to allegations made in various news outlets that Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth was sourced from organised crime. In the case of the two judgments that substantially addressed allegations of human rights abuses, the courts found that the journalists had failed to reflect certain nuances of Amnesty International’s report by glossing over uncertainties about whether the Assad regime directly ordered the atrocity.Public attitudes towards British lawyers acting for foreign politicians with questionable reputations have hardened in recent years.This month, a taskforce of senior lawyers and civil society experts said law firms must request more “credible explanations” from their clients as to the source of their wealth, and that it was unsustainable to disregard reputational risks to the legal profession.“Whether the same decision [to act for Assad] would be made today, in the light of further information now available and, arguably, the more stringent demands of the regulatory environment, is a point on which one might speculate,” Farrer said in its response.Explore more on these topicsLawQueen Elizabeth IIMonarchySolicitorsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Streeting said past attempts at reform had stumbled because of “bad politics”.Talks were scheduled to open on 26 February but were postponed after ministers said that not all parties could make the meeting. The Lib Dems offered to “clear our diaries” to reschedule but said a new date has not yet been proposed.Helen Morgan, the Lib Dems’ health and social care spokesperson, said: “If it’s taking almost two months and counting to schedule a single meeting, I have serious concerns about the focus at the top of government needed to successfully undertake and implement this review.“Ministers’ handling of these cross-party talks smells of a government that has put rescuing social care in the ‘too difficult’ pile.“Their failure to grasp the nettle means that a review that could have been completed within a year is instead taking three, with ministers risking even longer delays because of their failure to get these talks off the ground.“For years under the Conservatives, [social care] was shamefully neglected, with patients bearing the brunt. Now, theLabourgovernment is taking an approach of kicking the can down the road rather than facing up to the challenges of fixing this broken system.”Lady Casey, who was due to join the social care commission this month, was appointed by ministers in mid-January to carry out athree-month report into child sexual abuse grooming gangs. The government has insisted this would not affect her work on the social care commission.It is understood Casey has promised to convene meetings once her work on the grooming gangs report is complete. A government official said the original date and time for the planned meeting had not worked for all invited parties.England’s ‘complex’ health and care system harming patients, report saysRead moreA spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “This government is committed to building national, cross-party consensus to create a fair and affordable adult social care system for all.“This is why the prime minister has asked Baroness Louise Casey to lead an independent commission into adult social care as part of our critical first steps towards building a national care service.”Reform of adult social care has been on and off the policy agenda for more than two decades, with attempts by governments of all stripes to overhaul the system repeatedly derailed by political timidity and lack of cross-party consensus.Social care expertscriticised the governmentin January for putting a three-year timescale on changes that they argued could be put in place with a year. They said the issue was not about how to change social care but agreeing what should be done.Care providers have urged rapid reform of adult social care, saying the sector facesserious financial problemsas a result of the introduction of national insurance and minimum wage rises this month, which have added £2.8bn to their costs.Many have said they face “tough decisions” as a result of rising unfunded costs, including handing back unviable care contracts to councils andevicting residents, reducing care quality, laying off staff, reducing their hours or freezing pay.Explore more on these topicsSocial careCare workersLabourLiberal DemocratsHealthOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

We’re hoping we’re going to have that by the summer.”What does the UK supreme court’s ruling on definition of ‘women’ mean?Read moreShe said it would give “clarity” that trans women could not participate in women’s sports or use women-only toilets or changing rooms, and the NHS must update its guidance on single-sex wards based on biological sex.Asked if the supreme court ruling was “a victory for common sense”, she said: “Only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.“It’s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that. We stand here to defend trans people as much as we do anyone else. So I want to make that very clear.”She emphasised that trans people still had clear protection under legislation. “They are covered through gender reassignment … and they’re also covered by sex discrimination.”Asked to give an example, she said: “We’ll have to flesh this out in the reasoning, but I think if you were to have an equal pay claim, then depending on which aspect of it that it was, you could use sex discrimination legislation. If a trans person was fired, lost their employment because they happen to be trans, that would be unlawful, still absolutely unlawful, and we stand ready to support those people and those claims.”On the risk that trans people will no longer be able to use facilities designed for either male or female, she added that trans rights organisations should push for more neutral third spaces. “But I think the law is quite clear that if a service provider says we’re offering a women’s toilet, that trans people should not be using that single-sex facility.”Falkner added that the EHRC would pursue the NHS to change its existing guidance on the treatment of trans patients, which currently say that trans people should be accommodated in single-sex accommodation according to their gender identity, rather than their assigned sex at birth.“They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity,” she said. “We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.”The “efficacy” of the gender recognition certificate, a UK legal document that recognises an individual’s gender identity, allowing them to legally change their sex, would be re-examined, she believed. The government is consideringintroducing digital IDs, “and if digital IDs come in, then what documentation will provide the identity of that person? So it’s going to be a space that we’ll have to watch very carefully as we go on.”Explore more on these topicsGenderEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)TransgenderWomenUK supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “The statement was read by millions and has caused serious harm to my reputation. I believe it was published as part of a concerted smear campaign against me after I made comments about the party’s leaderNigel Farage.“I have today instructed my solicitors Brett Wilson LLP to send letters of claim to Reform’s leader and director Nigel Farage, Mr Anderson and Mr Yusuf asserting claims for defamation.“I call on the party, Mr Farage, Mr Anderson and Mr Yusuf to do the right thing and retract these false allegations. In the event that they are unwilling to do so it is my intention to issue high court proceedings. Whilst I have no desire to litigate, I will do what is necessary to ensure my reputation is restored.”Reform has been approached for comment.Among other tensions between Lowe and Farage has been the former’s notably more hard-right approach towards migration and culture war issues. Lowe regularly uses his large following on X to promise to mass-deport a million-plus migrants, or complain about criminals from “alien cultures”.Farage has criticised such views, although Lowe has a fan in Elon Musk. The X owner and Donald Trump right-hand man sometimes retweets Lowe’s posts and formallyendorsed himover Farage in January.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Works will also partly close London Victoria station, diverting Southeastern services and affecting lines around Southampton.Motoring organisations haveforecast a more crowded Easter on the roads, which they partly ascribed to the bank holidays falling later in April than last year.A survey by the AA of its members indicated that up to 15% more cars would be on UK roads this Good Friday than last – more than 19m. The RAC said that just over 19m leisure trips would be made by car over the next four days. Both groups gave the caveat that unsettled weather could significantly alter the numbers on the road.About a third of that number were planning to travel but were undecided on dates, according to the RAC, which suggested that sunny weather could lure millions more out on to congested roads.Drivers are at least less likely to be affected by roadworks, according to the Department forTransport, which said National Highways would be clearing the cones from 1,127 miles (1,814km) of motorways and A-roads in England for the weekend.Traffic is nonetheless expected to be intense, peaking between 11am and 1pm on Friday. Hotspots will include retail parks and hotel routes to the south-west, including the south and western section of the M25 between the M23 and M40, the M5 at Bristol and the A303 in Wiltshire.According to the tourism authority VisitEngland, about 10.6 million British adults are planning to take a holiday in the UK over the bank holiday period.Approximately 2.2 million Britons are expected to head abroad for the Easter weekend, according to the travel organisation Abta; the number will peak on Good Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some airlines are flying larger and fuller planes, and the Civil Aviation Authority said passenger numbers this weekend could match pre-pandemic levels.The international destinations attracting the most UK passengers are Dublin, Amsterdam, Málaga, Alicante and Mallorca.

Well I say to this government: it is indefensible for a Labour government – a Labour government! – to cut school funding,” Kebede told delegates.Stress taking ‘immense toll’ on teachers in England as union debates industrial actionRead moreTheDepartment for Education(DfE) has recommended a 2.8% rise to the independent School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) for the 2025-26 pay award. The DfE has yet to publish the STRB’s findings but Kebede said any outcome needed to be above inflation and include compensation for school budgets.Kebede said: “If the STRB recommendation is not above inflation, if it is not a pay award that takes a step towards a correction in pay, if it does not address the crisis in [teacher] recruitment and retention, and unless it isfully funded, then we stand ready to act industrially.“We will make Labour MPs pay a high political price through our campaigning in their constituencies, with our parents, across the country.”Earlier, the NEU conference in Harrogate had rejected the government’s 2.8% offer as “inadequate” and voted to hold a formal ballot on strike action if it was not improved and school funding was not boosted to compensate for the extra salary costs.The DfE responded that the NEU’s decision was “premature” before the STRB’s final report had been published and the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “Any move towards industrial action by teaching unions would be indefensible.”Reform UK a ‘far-right and racist party’, says largest teaching unionRead moreThe NEU delegates also voted to labelReform UKas “far-right and racist”, setting off verbal skirmishing between Kebede and Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, with Kebede calling Farage “a pound shop Trump” and Farage declaring “war” on the NEU and saying its general secretary was “a self-declared Marxist”.In his speech, Kebede said: “While this government might be rolling out the red carpet for Farage to walk into No 10, through their austerity agenda, we won’t stand for it.“Farage wants war, that’s fine – but I want our union to continue to live rent-free in his head as we organise for an education system and society where any child regardless of background, of colour, of religion, feels safe, happy and can flourish.”Kebede also referred to the provocative Netflix seriesAdolescence, saying that schools were seeing a rise in misogynistic behaviour, enabled by social media platforms and the widespread availability of violent and degrading pornography online.“We are in a safeguarding crisis. And it is being fuelled by tech companies that prioritise profits over people, engagement over ethics, and algorithms over accountability, Kebede said, adding: “We cannot entrust this technology to the Silicon Valley tech bros who are only in it for the money.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsPublic sector payTrade unionsTeachingTeacher shortagesReform UKAdolescenceShareReuse this content"

Publisher ad servers are platforms used by websites to store and manage their ad inventory. Antitrust enforcers failed to prove a separate claim that the company had a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, she wrote.Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice-president of regulatory affairs, said Google would appeal the ruling.“We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” she said, adding that the company disagreed with the decision on its publisher tools. “Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”Google faces US government attempt to break it upRead moreThe decision clears the way for another hearing to determine what Google must do to restore competition in those markets, such as sell off parts of its business at another trial that has yet to be scheduled.The justice department has said that Google should have to sell off at least its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company’s publisher ad server and ad exchange.Google now faces the possibility of two US courts ordering it to sell assets or change its business practices. A judge in Washington will hold a trial next week on the justice department’s request to make Google sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its dominance in online search. Google has previously explored selling off its ad exchange to appease European antitrust regulators.Brinkema oversaw a three-week trial last year on claims brought by the justice department and a coalition of states. Google used classic monopoly-building tactics of eliminating competitors through acquisitions, locking customers in to using its products, and controlling how transactions occurred in the online ad market, prosecutors said at trial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And us duplicating their work just doesn’t make sense.” The outlet further reported that the FDA is devising plans that would halt most of its routine food safety inspection work, citing multiple federal health officials.According to the officials who spoke to the network under anonymity, the plans may need congressional action to fully fund, adding that some higher-risk routine food inspections would probably remain at the FDA.Food safety laboratories rely on these types of tests to meet standards for accreditation, said a source familiar with the situation, who was not aware of other ready alternatives to the FDA to provide such testing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The applicants hailed from institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, Nasa, Columbia, Yale and Stanford, it said in a statement.Most of the applications were sent using encrypted messaging, the university’s president, Eric Berton,wrote in the French newspaper Libération. “And with them came worrying, sometimes chilling, accounts from American researchers about the fate reserved for them by the Trump administration,” he said.Most applicants were experienced researchers in fields that ranged from the humanities to life sciences and the environment, according to the university. Just over half of the eligible applicants, 135, were American, while 45 were dual nationals. More than a dozen French citizens also applied, as did Europeans, Indian nationals and Brazilians.The university said the selection process would start in the coming days, with the aim of allowing researchers to begin arriving in early June.François Hollande, a former president ofFranceand a current Socialist MP, recently joined forces with Berton to call for France to recognise embattled researchers from around the world as refugees.“Just like the expression of divergent opinions, their work, which is a source of innovation and knowledge, has become a risk for the propaganda of regimes,” the pairrecently wrote in Libération.Academics, much like journalists or political opponents, should be able to qualify for protection, they argued. “Indeed, current asylum mechanisms do not take into account the specificities of the academic environment and the threats facing scientists within authoritarian regimes,” they wrote. “This is why we are making an urgent request, one that is appropriate for the current situation: the creation of a ‘scientific refugee’ status.”On Monday, Hollande backed his words with legislative action. In a bill tabled in the country’s national assembly, he proposed that researchers suffering attacks on their academic freedom be eligible for subsidiary protection – a category reserved for asylum seekers who do not meet the conditions for refugee status but who can demonstrate that they are facing serious threats.Doing so would allow for faster and more efficient processing of these researchers, as officials could set out clear eligibility criteria and map out pathways to ensure that they would be able to continue their research.Hollande described it as an “obligation”, particularly for researchers working in fields such as the climate crisis. “If they are interrupted, hindered, prevented, it will be a step backwards for humanity,”he told the broadcaster France Inter.He described the bill – which must be approved by parliament – as a response to a historic moment. “It’s a symbolic way to show that France is an open country at a time when the United States is closing in on itself and authoritarian regimes are pursuing aggressive, repressive policies,” he said. “It’s about rediscovering the France of the Enlightenment, the one that in other times was capable of welcoming persecuted researchers from all over the world.”Explore more on these topicsAcademicsHigher educationEuropeFranceResearchUniversitiesTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But most cannot afford to buy there because of spiralling prices and widespread shortages, meaning humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80% of the population, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April on Gaza’s markets.“The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023,” OCHA said.Meanwhile, two Hamas officials told AFP Thursday that the group’s discussions on an Israeli truce proposal were nearly complete, with a response expected soon.“These talks are almost complete, and the group will send its response to the mediators once they finish. It’s expected the talks will wrap up soon – possibly even today,” an official said, with another member of the group confirming his account.Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators that would include the release of dozens of hostages.The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, a demand the group rejects.However, a ceasefire agreement still looks distant, as divisions persist between the two sides.Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.Israel’s renewed assault has so far killed at least 1,691 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing the overall toll since the war erupted to 51,065, most of them civilians.Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, also mostly civilians.AFP, AP and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Two passengers were injured, including one who was stabbed in the back.Taylor ordered the pilot to take him out of the country, but was then shot in the chest by another passenger, Belize’s commissioner of police, Chester Williams, told local journalists.After circling erratically over the coastline near Belize City, with depleting fuel, the passengers’ ordeal ended when the plane landed safely at Philip Goldson international airport.Taylor was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and one of the injured passengers was in a critical condition after being stabbed in the back.Details of the incident remained sparse, but Williams said passengers narrowly escaped a more serious tragedy as the aircraft ran out of fuel as it landed.The plane was en route from Corozal to San Pedro when the hijacking took place. After being contacted by passengers onboard, police were deployed to various airports, unsure of where the plane would land. A rescue helicopter was also tracking the aircraft.“We were hoping that we don’t have to move from a search-and-rescue operation to a search-and-recovery operation. The helicopter was to follow the plane to see where it would land. So if they had decided to crash-land the plane in the sea, or on one of the islands, we would have been there quickly to respond and provide assistance to those passengers who might not be able to survive,” he told reporters.The hijacker’s motives are unclear, but Williams said Taylor had previously been refused entry into Belize, and it was not clear how he was able to get through its borders.Williams said there would be a review of security procedures for domestic flights.A spokesperson for the US embassy told reporters that it was working with Belize to investigate the incident. “We share that commitment with them to make sure that Belize is safe, the airlines are safe, the tourists coming here are safe, borders are safe and secure,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBelizeAir transportUS crimeCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Graphics byPaul ScrutonandLucy SwanThu 17 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 08.03 EDTShareThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, looks set to break itsAmazon rainforestprotection promises again, according to frontline workers.Beef production is the primary driver of deforestation, as trees are cleared to raise cattle, and scientists warn this is pushing the Amazon close to a tipping point that would accelerate its shift from a carbon sink into a carbon emitter. JBS, the Brazil-headquartered multinational that dominates the Brazilian cattle market, promised to address this with a commitment to clean up its beef supply chain in the region by the end of 2025.In a project to understand the barriers to progress on Amazon deforestation, a team of journalists from the Guardian, Unearthed and Repórter Brasil interviewed more than 35 people, including ranchers and ranching union leaders who represent thousands of farms in the states of Pará and Rondônia. The investigation found widespread disbelief that JBS would be able to complete the groundwork and hit its deforestation targets.“They certainly have the will to do it, just as we have the will to do it,” said one rancher. But the goal that all the cattle they bought would be deforestation-free was unreachable, he said. “They say this is going to be implemented. I’d say straight away: that’s impossible.” The problem of illegal cattle laundering would also not be resolved in time, said many, while another interviewee said land ownership issues meant quite simply that the deadline was “impossible”.JBS told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions. “Drawing inferences and conclusions from a limited sample of 30 farmers while disregarding that JBS has over 40,000 registered suppliers is entirely irresponsible,” the company said in a statement. It said that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks.”Amazon tree cover mapTo hit its targets, JBS needs to register all its direct and indirect suppliers and ensure none of the meat it buys from the Amazon is from cattle that has grazed on deforested land. It has established a network of “green offices” to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to comply with the three- to six-month process of regularisation, which involves drawing up a plan to plant more trees, withdrawing from contested territory, or making other environmental remediations. Then details will go into the JBS database, which continually monitors farms using artificial intelligence, and owners will be contacted if they fail to meet their obligations. In Pará, the company is also working with the state government on an ear-tagging scheme that would track the state’s entire herd of 26 million cattle by 2026.The Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho, who has supported the traceability plan, expects JBS to meet its deadline, but he acknowledged there had been resistance and that small farmers in particular would need more support. He said the Bezos Earth Fund had committed 143m reais to this task: “We are still mobilising resources so that we can finance this policy that is very important for us to present to livestock farmers.”But ranchers and rancher unions interviewed by the Guardian and its partners said that technical hurdles and uncertainties over land ownership – many ranches were created by invading public land – stood no chance of resolution by the company’s self-imposed deadline.Adelosmar Antonio Orio, known as Ticão, who works for the Tucumaã-Ourilaãndia Union of Rural Producers, said the logistical challenges, such as ranchers needing special equipment including ear trackers and satellite internet systems, would make the scheme impossible to complete before the year-end deadline. “Not even they [JBS] know how this traceability is going to be implemented,” he said. Others argued that new small- and medium-sized producers were being asked to bear most of the burden of the new system and that JBS and the government had not done enough to explain the new tracking system and provide the technological support needed to make it work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

His union colleagues expressed similar disbelief that the deadline could be met.The investigation also spoke to indirect suppliers who openly admitted to using middlemen to clean up the environmental record of their livestock, a practice known as cattle laundering. Several producers predicted that a new tracing system would lead to new loopholes, such as slaughtering the cattle elsewhere and then selling the meat – rather than live cattle – at a low price to JBS.Graph of Amazon deforestation in Pará and Mato GrossoJBS has not mapped its entire supply chain, due under its deforestation commitments by the end of this year. But the company said: “JBS has already enrolled the equivalent of over 80% of its annual cattle purchases on to a blockchain-enabled, web-based transparent farming livestock platform.”JBS has previously been linked to deforestation on a number of occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James,filed a lawsuitlast year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS’s application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrotein an open letter.JBS told the Guardian: “The challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometresare significant.” It detailed its response, which includes zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS Fund for the Amazon, whichfinances projects focused onthe sustainable development of the Amazon biome.The company also said: “JBS works with farmers, ranchers and partners across the food system to develop solutions that support a growing global population while optimising resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact.Cattleraising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry’s challenges.”Explore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestBrazilDeforestationMeat industryCattleTrees and forestsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Contaminated soil causes significant risks to ecosystems and human health as well as reducing crop yields, jeopardising water quality and food safety owing to bioaccumulation in farm animals. Toxic metal contamination can persist for decades once pollution has been introduced into soil.Asdemand for critical metalsincreases, scientists have warned that the heavy metal pollution of soils is likely to worsen. “Our drive for technology-critical metals to build the green infrastructure required to tackle climate change (wind turbines, electric vehicle batteries and photovoltaic panels) will exacerbate this pollution,” said Rylott.By combining the data in the study with the global population distribution, researchers estimate that between 900 million and 1.4 billion people live in high-risk areas across the world.Cadmium was found to be the most widespread toxic metal and was particularly prevalent in south and east Asia, parts of the Middle East and Africa.“This map illustrates how metal pollution is independent of human borders; to tackle this problem, countries will have to work together,” said Rylott. “Much of the pollution is in low- and middle-income countries, where communities are directly affected, exacerbating poverty. The effect of these contaminated crops entering global food networks is not as clear.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingPollutionAgricultureGlobal healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father. Prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.Judge allows resentencing hearings for Menendez brothers to continueRead moreThe resentencing hearing will center on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison and deserve a lesser sentence that could make them eligible for release. FormerLos Angelescounty district attorney George Gascón had requested their sentences be reduced to 50 years with the possibility of parole. But their defense attorney, Mark Geragos, said Thursday he’ll ask the judge to reduce their charges to manslaughter, allowing them to be immediately released from prison.On Thursday, neither the judge nor the brothers’ attorneys had seen the governor’s report that spurred heated arguments in the packed courtroom.“I need clarification from the governor’s office,” Jesic said. “This is stupid.”Prosecutors, who had seen the report, argued they should be able to use it, and filed to postpone the hearing so everyone could consider it.Deputy district attorney Habib Balian argued that the report, intended for a separate 13 June parole board hearing, was relevant and necessary.“If there is a report out there assessing the risk of violence, how do we not use it?” Habib said.Geragos angrily denounced the district attorney, Nathan Hochman, for discussing the report during a morning news conference and said he’ll file a motion to remove Hochman from the case. Hochman was elected in November 2024 and does not support resentencing.The governor’s office confirmed that part of the risk assessment was shared with the defense and prosecution for review 60 days before the June clemency hearing, perCalifornialaw. They also notified the judge of the status of the report and offered to share it if requested, but said it was not a stand-alone risk assessment.If the judge shortens their sentences, the brothers may still need approval from the state’s parole board to leave prison.The brothers watched the proceedings via video from a correctional facility near San Diego, and could be seen in their blue prison garb on a screen in the courtroom. They showed no obvious reaction to the arguments.The brothers’ hearing has been delayed several times. An initial hearing scheduled for January was postponed due to the Los Angeles wildfires and prosecutors’ attempt to withdraw their sentencing request.The case has captured the public’s attention for decades, and the Netflix dramaMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Storyand a subsequent documentary brought new attention to the case. Reporters from dozens of media outlets crowded outside the courthouse and vied for space inside the courtroom.Geragos and attorney Bryan Freedman, who is representing Menendez relatives, also denounced prosecutors for showing gruesome crime scene photos without warning family members who were in the room for a hearing last week to determine whether the resentencing hearing would go forward.“That’s not dignity,” Freedman said. “That’s disrespect. That’s harassment.”Balian apologized for the lack of a warning, but added: “Erik and Lyle Menendez caused that carnage, not me.”Geragos and Freedman also decried the DA’s office for taking over the court’s victims’ services arm, and for the lack of any contact between the office and the surviving Menendez relatives.The extended Menendez family, with the exception of an uncle who died last month, has said they fully forgive the brothers for what they did and want them to be freed.The brothers’ attorneys say their clients have worked hard over the decades to better themselves and give back to the prison community.Prosecutors have said the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents, or that they asked their friends to lie for them in court. Hochman’s office has also said it does not believe that the brothers were sexually abused by their father and that by speaking about their childhood abuse, they have not taken complete responsibility for the crime.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastGavin NewsomLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

And does he really have a screen to go behind should nature call? We enter another level of time and consciousnessKate ConnollyThu 17 Apr 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 13.37 EDTShareAmid the experiments and cross-genre collaborations inthis year’s Multitudes festivalis one event that will challenge its performer as much as its audience – and the only one where specially appointed brow-moppers will be on hand. At 10am on 24 April in London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, pianist Igor Levit will begin a performance of a single piece, Erik Satie’s Vexations, in a concert that will last at least 16 hours.A few tickets (for the full duration or one-hour slots) are still available for this extreme pianist endurance event. What should the audience expect to get out of it? “I’d never tell an audience what they should experience,” says Levit. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it. It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream.”In May 2020, Levit found in the Covid lockdown, and the series of solo concerts he livestreamed from his Berlin apartment, an excuse to fulfil his dream of tackling this pianistic challenge. Hisfirst performance of Vexationswas streamed from an empty room; it lasted 15 hours and 29 minutes.Satie’s slight piece, a simple phrase that alone is perhaps 1-2 minutes long, was written in 1893 for keyboard (Satie didn’t specify the exact instrument). Themanuscript included the composer’s noteto potential performers: “In order to play this motif 840 times in a row, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, in the deepest silence, through serious immobilities.”View image in fullscreenIgor Levit livestreaming Vexations from his studio in Berlin in 2020.Photograph: Stephan ZwickirschThere’s no evidence that Satie intended the piece to be performed in this manner, but over the years, artists such as John Cage have organised marathons at which the feat of repeating the piece 840 times has been accomplished by a succession of different pianists. It has rarely been played in its entirety by the same person, and never before live in the UK.During his 2020 meditations, Levit says he kept returning to the work of his friend, the Serbian performance artistMarina Abramović. “I thought, this is the musical embodiment of what Marina has been doing all these years,” he says, citing her method of counting individual grains of rice over hours to experience the benefits of self-discipline and mindfulness. “You have this weird piece, a minute and a half long, which doesn’t make any sense, which is neither beautiful or not, it’s just there. And Satie didn’t even say ‘play it 840 times’; all he says is ‘in order to do so, you should do X, Y and Z’. I thought Marina would love that.”He started talking to Abramović about the piece about two years ago, and the resulting collaboration has its world premiere next week, when the 38-year-old Russian-German pianist will perform Vexations in full without leaving the stage – and this time in front of an actual audience.Levit calls it “chapter two” in his artistic collaboration with Abramović. The pair first blended their talents in 2015, for a production of theGoldberg Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, an idea they hatched in London over an evening of Slavic soup and jokes. For this event the audience were prepared by having their mobile phones locked away and sitting in silence for 30 minutes as the piano slowly glided around and down the onstage runway.View image in fullscreenThe world premiere of Levit and Abramović’s production of the Goldberg Variations, at Park Avenue Armory in December 2015.Photograph: Hiroyuki Ito/Getty ImagesThe duo’s affection and mutual respect is evident as we speak on a video call. Levit, in Berlin, is munching on peanuts. Abramović, in New York, emerges on screen and scolds her “genius boy”.“You shouldn’t eat peanuts because they can collect mould,” she says crossly.“Since when do I listen to you?” he retorts, and so their playful banter continues.No one except Abramović, who has been plotting the QEH show these past months at her New York studio, knows quite what to expect from it. The performance, she explains, will shape and shift over the hours. The podium on which the piano sits is detachable and its different parts will fragment, like the pieces of a puzzle. “We are creating some kind of sculptural element on the stage,” she says. Renowned lighting designer Urs Schönebaum is working with her to create mirror-like effects. The set will reflect back on itself, she explains. “Everything you see down, you can see up.”The audience will be steeped inthe Abramović method(the idea of using meditative repetition to enhance one’s consciousness, applied this time to classical music). The Southbank Centre has warned of “adult content”, though Abramović insists this has nothing to do with her plans, and is likely “British over-caution”, based on her previous, often risque exploits.View image in fullscreenMarina Abramović: ‘I will not be babysitting him.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianEven Levit seems unaware of what she has in store. “I cannot say what will happen, except you can expect me to be there and start playing,” he says. “Maybe it’s going to be dreadful. Maybe I will realise that I can only do it alone. And maybe it’s going to be the most fantastic thing ever. Who knows?”And what if he needs to pee?“I have a screen which goes up around the area of the piano,” says Abramović. “And his seat can turn into a bed, so that he can lie next to the piano for 10 or 15 minutes if he needs to. There will be two assistants, one each side of the stage, who can wipe his brow or bring him food and drink. If they get any sign from him that he needs anything, they’ll be there. But Igor will never leave the stage, ever,” she says firmly.She describes the performance as a study in being in the present. “If you start talking about how much time has passed, and how much time is in the future, you’ve lost the concept. Igor has to be therenow, in the space where there is no time, and the public has to go into that space. It is the same thing that happens when you count rice.“You’re going to go completely to another level of time, consciousness and experience.” Will she be on stage? “I’m introducing the piece, and then I’ll be in the public, but I will not be babysitting him.”Born in the Russian city of Gorki in 1987, Levit grew up in Hanover, northern Germany. His intensity and doughtiness as a performer and as an often outspoken political campaigner have earned him global acclaim and respect, but he has pulled back from social media in recent years after death threats and many antisemitic attacks. He says he’s no less passionate about the issues that move him (refugees, Ukraine, Israel) but feels the necessity to concentrate on piano playing.“The darker the world gets, the more I’d like to be the pianist that I am, and the more art we should create, the more music we should make. It is literally a tool of mental and emotional survival. For me, at least, I can say it becomes more and more existential.”“In my world, which is pushing down keys in black and white, creating sound, creating noise, playing melodies and sharing this with other people, there is no war, no cynicism, no power games – at least not in a bad way. There is, in the best case, transcendence, so there’s a reason to live in my world, and I would like to share this.”Igor Levit: ‘These concerts were life-saving for me’Read moreAbramović agrees. “If you spend your time looking at television, listening to the news, this horrible, ugly face of Donald Trump all the time, [or with] the diarrhoea of social media, you’re really lost. You have to create your own sense of peace in yourself.”But why is Levit prepared to put himself through such a potentially gruelling experience for a piece of music that he admits it is hard to be passionate about? “It’s not about reaching a goal. I’ve never cared for goals. I am a process person,” he says. “And so my answer, from the bottom of my heart, is because I can, and because I want to, and because I need it. I have the chance to do it with this beautiful lady, and we have been given the space. The main answer is just because. Full stop. That’s it.”Vexations is atQueen Elizabeth Hall, Londonon 24-25 AprilExplore more on these topicsClassical musicMarina AbramovićSouthbank CentreIgor LevitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The popular motoring show was subsequently taken off air and the broadcaster reached a financial settlement with Flintoff for a reported £9m.“It’s almost like a reset and I’m trying to understand what I am now,” Flintoff says in the trailer for the documentary. “I’ve always seemed to be able to flick a switch. I’ve got to find that switch again.”He also promises he will no longer “hide his scars”.Flintoff, 47, haspreviously spokenabout his experience of anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks as a result of the accident, but this is thought to be the first time he will go into detail about the crash itself.The documentary, called Flintoff, will also hear from his wife, Rachael, for the first time. “All of a sudden, your life can change,” she says.Speaking of her husband’s cricketing talent, she adds: “There was something about him that was different. As soon as someone says ‘that’s impossible’ then that makes him fly.”Directed by the British Bafta- and Emmy-nominated film-maker John Dower, and produced by the team behind the BBC’sFreddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams, the documentary includes images of the accident at Dunsfold Park, which was a frequent filming location for the programme.The actors James Corden and Jack Whitehall, and Flintoff’s former teammates and friends, also feature.Flintoff was left with severe facial injuries and broken ribs after the three-wheel, open-topped car that he was road-testing flipped over and slid along the track.It was not his first accident while filming for the programme, which he joined in 2019. He lost control of a motorised trike in a race against his co-hosts Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness, though he was uninjured.Harris, an automotive journalist who co-presented Top Gear from 2017 until it was “rested” by the BBC, said he had previously raised safety fears about the filming of the programme, which had gone unheeded.Flintoff made a return to cricket in a coaching capacity in September 2023 and is now the head coach of England Lions, the second string of the national men’s team.Speaking of his retreat from public life for a year after the accident, he said: “One of the real frustrations was the speculation. That’s why I’m doing this now.”Flintoff will be available from 25 April on Disney+.Explore more on these topicsAndrew FlintoffTop GearBBCCricketDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

It marks the first time the two leads have both been played by minority ethnic actors.Jodie Whittaker became the first female Doctor in 2017 under the previous head writer, Chris Chibnall, and Gatwa became the first black actor to play the TV lead of Time Lord in 2023.“Someone always brings up matters of diversity,” Davies said on the Radio 2 programme Doctor Who: 20 Secrets from 20 Years. “And there are online warriors accusing us of diversity and wokeness and involving messages and issues.“And I have no time for this. I don’t have a second to bear [it]. Because what you might call diversity, I just call an open door.”When asked whether he wrote the show’s diverse themes consciously, he said: “I don’t even know if it’s conscious. That’s life, and I think it’s the only way to write.”He said it would be harder to write scripts with “a narrow window” of references. “Why limit yourself? Why breathe in the exhaust fumes? Why be toxic?” he said. “Come over here where the life and light and air and sound is.”Sethu, who plays the Doctor’s new companion Belinda Chandra, addressed comments about the show’s perceived “wokeness” in an interview with the Radio Times.“I just think we’re doing the right thing if we’re getting comments like that,” she said. “Woke just means inclusive, progressive, and that you care about people. And as far as I know, the core of Doctor Who is kindness, love and doing the right thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Promotional materials for the film suggest these messages “order him to commit atrocious murders of three other tenants who, in turn, want to kill their next-of-kin”. The film is also described as “perturbing, livid and hypnotic”.Gascón’s rise to fame and fall from grace provided awards season with one of its most vertiginous fairytales in years. After sharing the best actress award at Cannes with herEmilia Pérezco-stars, the newcomer, whose credits until then mostly featured Spanish telenovas, looked set to become the Oscars favourite for her performance as a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob.However, disquiet among the Mexican and trans communities about their portrayal grew louder as the film’s campaign gathered pace, securinga record-breaking 13 nominations. But Gascón’s own chance at victory then appeared almost nil after posts on X were resurfaced which expressed controversial opinions about muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Gascón apologised but was cold-shouldered by Netflix and the film’s director, Jacques Audiard, until a U-turn saw her allowed to attend the Oscars – although not to walk the red carpet.The actor spoke out about the vitriol with which she was met during awards season, saying the pain of the subsequent backlashhad led her to “contemplate the unthinkable”. But promoting her memoir a fortnight later, she described herself as “less racist than Gandhi” and said “no one has to forgive me for anything”.“If anyone feels offended by things I may have done in my life,” she said, “let them come and tell me.”Gallo, 64, is another sometime Cannes favourite and proud non-conformist, whose explicit road trip film The Brown Bunny premiered at the festival in 2003. However, his career has flatlined over the past decade.The actor endorsed Donald Trump’s re-election and called him “the greatest president the USA has ever produced”. Last yearit was reportedthat the actors’ union in the US, Sag-Aftra, was investigating after complaints made by three female actors who auditioned for Gallo’s most recent film, The Policeman.Hispersonal websiteadvertises his services as an escort, as well as selling vials of his sperm, at $1m apiece.Explore more on these topicsKarla Sofía GascónEmilia PérezTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

The Lessons take their texts from theLamentations of Jeremiah, while the Responsories use brief extracts of passion narratives from the gospels. Together they form sombre meditations on man’s fallen state and eventual redemption through Christ’s atonement.Charpentier’s music can be extraordinary – austere, beautiful, teetering on sensuous. The forces are small: one or two singers, tenor or baritone, and a handful of instruments, violins, recorders, viola da gamba, theorbo and organ. The vocal writing oscillates between syllabic declamation and passages of greater lyricism, melismatic, at times even operatic. Instrumental lines seem to grieve alongside the singers or wrap themselves round the voices in consolation.A Tenebrae servicetakes place in gathering darkness as candles are extinguished one by one, and minimal lighting was used for the concert, which gave the music in an unbroken sequence with little to distract from the devotional mood. Credited as directing from the organ, Christie might better be described as the effective anchor of what to all intents and purposes was a chamber ensemble of equals, playing with superb focus, great refinement and real depth of feeling.The singers were tenor Ilja Aksionov and bass-baritone Padraic Rowan, both immaculate. Aksionov with his slightly reedy tone, admirable liquidity and subtle dynamic control, sounded quietly intense in the Seconde Leçon de Ténèbres du Mercredi Saint, while Rowan proved vividly dramatic in the Troisième Leçon de Ténèbres du Mercredi Saint and attained remarkable depths of fervour in the Responsory Tenebrae Factae Sunt. Their voices blended wonderfully, meanwhile, in the Troisième Leçonde Ténèbres du Vendredi Saint and in the closing Responsorium Tristis Est Anima Mea, among the most beautiful things Charpentier ever wrote, with its chromatic harmonies and exquisitely entwining vocal lines. Breathtaking stuff, every single second of it.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyTo celebrate the Oscar-winning actor’s birthday this week, we look back at the highlights of a six-decade career, from early classics such as Doctor Zhivago and Billy Liar to later roles in Finding Neverland and Away From Her.ByAnne BillsonThu 17 Apr 2025 09.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 19.17 EDTShare20. Hamlet (1996)There are many things wrong with Kenneth Branagh’s galumphing slab of actor-manager Shakespeare, but Christie as Gertrude is not one of them. Her casting might have been conducive to the Oedipal side of the Danish prince’s feelings towards his mother – if only the director’s bombastic performance had allowed room for it.19. Young Cassidy (1965)View image in fullscreenGoing full begorra … Christie as Daisy Battles and Rod Taylor as John Cassidy.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockA mostly non-Irish cast goes full begorra in this Sean O’Casey biopic, with Christie in a brief but eye-catching turn as a sex worker called Daisy Battles. Jack Cardiff took over directing duties when John Ford fell ill; the results are rambling, but the anti-British riot scenes are ace.18. The Railway Station Man (1992)Irish accents again, as Christie reunites with her Don’t Look Now co-starDonald Sutherlandin 1980s Donegal, playing the widow Helen Cuffe, whose husband was accidentally murdered by the IRA. The pair’s old chemistry is still there, and the landscape is splendid. But, alas, when it comes to the men in her life, this unfortunate woman has the worst luck ever.17. The Return of the Soldier (1982)Three nicely calibrated female performances keep this tasteful adaptation of Rebecca West’s 1918 novel afloat. Christie plays a narrow-minded snob who is outraged when her husband (Alan Bates) returns traumatised from the first world war and fails to recognise her, but reconnects instead with a working-class sweetheart (Glenda Jackson) from his youth; Ann-Margret is wonderful as a compassionate cousin.16. Far From the Madding Crowd (1967)View image in fullscreenAll fringe and mascara … in the Thomas Hardy classic.Photograph: MGM/Studiocanal/AllstarThis is must for anyone studying English literature, though Christie’s wilful heroine, all fringe and mascara, smacks more of swinging 60s London than of Thomas Hardy’s Wessex; Terence Stamp, Christie’s former off-screen boyfriend, sports a Sgt Pepper moustache as Sgt Troy. The best bit is when Alan Bates’s sheep fall off a cliff.15. Darling (1965)John Schlesinger’s film about the rise of a good-looking but shallow playgirl epitomises all that was good-looking but shallow about the British new wave. Christie won an Oscar for looking fabulous; Frederic Raphael’s misogynistic screenplay also won an Oscar, but now feels suspiciously like a petty act of revenge on some unknown woman who was once mean to him.14. Doctor Zhivago (1965)View image in fullscreenMore Chelsea socialite than Slavic muse … Christie with Omar Sharif in Doctor Zhivago.Photograph: Mgm/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe romance between Omar Sharif as Zhivago and Christie as Lara is the least convincing thing about David Lean’s spectacular epic, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, butshot in sunny Spain. Once again, anachronistic hair and makeup make Christie look more like a Chelsea socialite than a Slavic muse, but it was the box office double whammy of this and Darling, in the same year, that cemented her status as an international star.13. Heaven Can Wait (1978)The third of Christie’s collaborations withWarren Beattyis a breezy remake of Here Comes Mr Jordan (1941), with Beatty co-directing himself as a Los Angeles quarterback temporarily returned to Earth in the body of a murdered industrialist. Christie plays the earnest eco-activist who wins his heart.12. Heat and Dust (1983)Ruth Prawer Jhabvala adapted her own Booker-winning novel for the Merchant Ivory team’s first big success, part of a 1980s British fad for all things Raj. Christie (born in Assam, north-eastern India) plays an English woman visiting India, but her exploits in the present day are less compelling than the flashbacks to her great-aunt (Greta Scacchi) in the 1920s.11. Demon Seed (1977)View image in fullscreenUncomfortably prescient …. in Donald Cammell’s sci-fi thriller.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyCritics were aghast at the idea of an A-list actor playing a woman forcibly impregnated by a computer in a genre film they considered “silly”. But Donald Cammell’s sci-fi thriller couldn’t be more pertinent to 2025, with its themes of domestic abuse and overreaching AI. Christie – rightly – gives it her all.10. Finding Neverland (2004)Christie plays the disapproving mother of widowed Kate Winslet, whose sons inspire JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write Peter Pan in this weepie biopic. It’s not mentioned here, of course, but Christie’s character, who mellows as the film goes on, will soon be grandmother to Daphne du Maurier, who wrote Don’t Look Now.9. Afterglow (1997)Two couples in Montreal swap partners in Alan Rudolph’s stilted sex comedy. Whenever Christie is working her magic on screen as the unhappy wife of handyman Nick Nolte, she makes you forget the contrived situations and clunky dialogue, and sweeps you up into a sublime, deservedly Oscar-nominated performance.8. The Go-Between (1971)View image in fullscreenQuietly devastating … Christie and Alan Bates relaxing on the set of The Go-Between.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA 12-year-old boy, spending the summer at a school friend’s country house, is cajoled into carrying secret messages between his chum’s older sister (Christie) and a tenant farmer (Alan Bates). After looking distractingly modern in other lit-flicks such as Doctor Zhivago, Christie is perfectly credible as an Edwardian aristocrat in Joseph Losey’s quietly devastating film adaptation of LP Hartley’s novel, scripted by Harold Pinter.7. Away From Her (2006)Sarah Polley’s directing debut, adapted from a story by Alice Munro, gives Christie the best late role of her career, as a married woman showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. She checks into a nursing home, but her husband wonders if she’s exaggerating her memory loss as revenge for his past infidelities. Ambiguous to the end, Christie makes it about more than just dementia, and earned a fourth Oscar nomination.6. Shampoo (1975)In the real-life ex-couple’s second film together, Beatty plays a philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser who still carries a torch for his former girlfriend. Hal Ashby’s satire, set on the eve of Nixon’s 1968 election victory, now seems more sad than funny, but Christie, rocking a backless black sequined Jean Varon gown, is a hoot as she drunkenly tries to fellate her ex at a posh dinner party.5. Fahrenheit 451 (1966)View image in fullscreenAlso worryingly prescient … in the retro-futurist adaptation of Fahrenheit 451.Photograph: Anglo Enterprises/AllstarThe current American trend of banning books makes François Truffaut’s charmingly retro-futurist film of Ray Bradbury’s novel feel like a wake-up call. Oskar Werner is a colourless leading man, but Christie makes up for it in her dual roles as his hilariously conformist wife and a rebellious neighbour who asks: “Do you ever read the books you burn?”4. Billy Liar (1963)John Schlesinger’s film of Keith Waterhouse’s novel leavens its social realism (shot on the streets of Bradford!) with the fantasies of Billy (Tom Courtenay). In her breakthrough performance, Christie radiates liberation and natural glamour, but miraculously makes Liz not just a dream girl but a fully realised character. She’s the girl next door – if the girl next door were a stunner.3. Petulia (1968)Christie dials up the kooky as an unhappily married woman who attaches herself to a San Francisco surgeon played by George C Scott. The drama starts off frothy but becomes progressively downbeat, until you belatedly realise you’re watching a tragedy, nudged along by nonlinear inserts now considered more typical of the film’s cinematographer, Nicolas Roeg (and editor Antony Gibbs), than its director, Richard Lester.2. Don’t Look Now (1973)Nonlinear inserts abound in Roeg’s haunting kaleidoscope of a chiller that is also a heartbreaking portrait of a marriage under stress. Christie and Sutherland play bereaved parents who relocate to Venice, where a blind clairvoyant claims to be in contact with their dead daughter. The wife accepts what she can’t see, while the husband’s scepticism blinds him to the truth until it’s too late.1. McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971)View image in fullscreenPeak Christie … as a cockney brothel-keeper in McCabe & Mrs Miller.Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockChristie came up with most of her own dialogue as the cockney brothel-keeper in Robert Altman’s melancholy revisionist western, set in a muddy mining town. Whether she’s tucking into fried eggs, striving to keep her relationship with McCabe (Beatty) on a business footing, or drifting away in an opium daze, this is peak Christie, and one of the funniest, saddest love stories ever filmed.Explore more on these topicsRankedJulie ChristieMcCabe & Mrs MillerDon't Look NowFar From the Madding CrowdHamletWarren Beattybest ofShareReuse this content"

He made up stories about work events. I only found out by seeing the pension payments into our joint account. He is 68 and has reapplied on spec to his old company. He hasn’t had any response but continues to wait for one.My husband is always on his iPad. I miss him. How can I ask for screen-free time together? | Leading questionsRead moreWhen asked about what he does, he says he sits in cafes and does crossword puzzles. He is always on his phone. He delays and denies talking about being on the pension and any activities such as volunteering, doing courses etc. How can I reboot open communication?Eleanor says:Oh this makes me sad for you both. It reminds me of people in the Depression who got laid off and didn’t tell their families, just took their lunch in the paper bag and sat on a park bench.Obviously he’s deceived you, and that’s got to feel bad – you might well be quite angry. As well as the surprise discovery that he’s retired, there’s the equally tough surprise that, for reasons totally opaque to you, he didn’t want or feel able to say so.That’s a drastic thing to learn about your communicative environment! This was a big deception. It’s not as obviously explicable as, say, a lie to get out of trouble. And it doesn’t even sound as if he’s scrambling to explain things now that he’s been discovered; you said he still blocks efforts to talk about the pension. I think you’re right to feel communication needs a hard reboot.My question (and I imagine yours) is: what did he want or need that made lying feel like the best way to get it? It might help to start there by quite literally just listening. The listening phase of acknowledging each other in relationships is very different from the adjudication phase, and different again from the fixing and improving phase. You mentioned a number of things from the latter camps – he doesn’t want to talk about classes, activities, courses, he’s delaying and denying. Separate and before that, there’s a task of understanding: why didn’t he want to share this?I wonder if it might help to quarantine the questions of “what now” and “who’s right”, and focus on seeing if you can learn why he didn’t want to share this. I’m thinking ofold school listening techniqueslike saying his point back to him, seeing if you can accurately sum up why such-and-such is important to him. You might be surprised by how illuminating this can be.You think you’re saying back exactly what the other person just said, then they’ll say no, it’s not quite that, it’s this instead. Mutual chipping away gets you closer to proper understanding.‘My boyfriend’s Instagram searches tap into my insecurities. I’m scared I’ll never be his type. How do I proceed?’ | Leading questionsRead moreI know that’s a lot of work to put on you, and it means temporarily setting aside legitimate criticisms. But the pragmatics of communication often come apart from the morality of adjudication. You’re in a position now where something in him feels that talking isn’t worth it. I’m not saying that’s right – it might not be. It might be wildly unfair. But if it’s to change, he needs to get the sense that talking might produce different results than the ones he’s expecting. One way to do that is to just keep saying: this has revealed something really weird in our communication and I hope it can be different.If he fights you on even that, you could tell him how this makes you feel – lonely, like he doesn’t trust you with things that are important to him. That way, continuing to not talk isn’t just framed as his preference. It makes it clear that, by clamming up, he’s actively continuing to do something that hurts you.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was visiting my grandmother’s friend in Devon and a lady said: “Here, dear,” and dug up a clump ofWarren crocuses– a rare plant that, at the time, was only thought to grow in the seaside resort of Dawlish Warren. She gave them to me to grow in my garden at home. But of course they didn’t grow away from the sea.That was when I realised there was something special about coastal wildflowers. They fascinate me because, as well as being beautiful flowers, they often grow in tough locations. Take therock sea-spurrey: a delicate little plant that appears to grow out of solid rock, such as a crevice in a cliff base. It can put up with being splashed with sea spray and baked by the summer sun. And yet it seems to thrive in that difficult, harsh environment.There’s even one plant –the slender centaury– that lives on a landslip, which is a dangerous place to live. The only place you can find it is on the cliffs of Dorset on the Jurassic Coast, which are always falling into the sea. Yet somehow it manages to survive.View image in fullscreenEarly scurvy grass (Cochlearia danica) is a salt-tolerant coastal plant, but one that is now increasingly seen alongside roads and motorways, too.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianOther plants, such aseelgrass, thrive in salt marshes: squelchy, muddy places where you wouldn’t want to walk without risking your life. The tide comes in gradually and creates conditions that most plants couldn’t cope with because the salty water would dehydrate them.Eelgrass, which makes beaches look like grassy meadows, can actually grow entirely submerged in seawater. That means it can stabilise the sand and create a good, safe habitat for marine life, like seahorses. It also stores a lot more carbon than many terrestrial plants.I’m obsessed with cave diving. This is the closest environment we have to spaceRead moreOther salt marsh plants likecordgrassesare good at protecting low lying areas of our coastline: by creating a tangle of roots and emergent stems, they trap silt and mud, and that slows the advance of the waves breaking on the shore.Without these plants, which support large numbers of invertebrates that birds and fish rely on, the waves would sweep the mud and sand away during a high tide or rough weather. The waves would then come pounding on the shore, potentially damaging sea walls and pushing the coast farther inland.One of the most spectacular coastal wildflowers to see is thethrift, also known as the sea pink, which covers cliffs with pink flowers at the end of May. Another is theyellow horned poppy, a bright yellow poppy that grows on shingle beaches. It’s amazing to see it growing there, where there can’t really be any soil. I’m also a big fan ofrock sea-lavender, which lives on cliffs all along the coast, and lasts long after other plants have died back.View image in fullscreenThrift (Armeria maritima) covers cliffs with its blossom in late spring.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianSome Mediterranean coastal plants have now got a foothold on the south coast of Britain, such as thesea daffodil, a fragrant white flower. As the climate changes, there is a risk that non-native coastal flowers may become more aggressive and crowd out our native species. However, my greatest fear for the future is people not appreciating our coastal wildflowers and thinking: “we can build a harbour here or put a caravan park there, and the plants can go and live somewhere else.”Those plants are often in a particular place for a good reason. That’s the habitat that really suits them. Once these flowers are lost, they will be lost for ever.Andrew Cleave is the co-author ofCoastal Wildflowers of Britain, Ireland and Northwest Europe: A Field Guide(Princeton University Press, £20).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’ve had exposed thongs,pants as pantsandboxer shorts as shorts. But now there is a new, arguably even more unexpected underwear as outerwear trend. Welcome to the spring of big, frilly bloomers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The 19th century undergarment has been thrust into the 21st century spotlight with a string of celebrities and influencers channelling their inner Folie Bergere dancer - including the actorLily James,Alexa ChungandCamille Charrière. Social media is peppered with gen Z and millennials styling Victorian bloomers, found on vintage sites or on the high street with band T-shirts, crop tops and cardigans.Free People’s £88 “forever young pants”, which come in six different colours and are bedecked in a dramatic lace trim, are proving particularly popular.But it is worth noting that not all the garments being touted as bloomers are in fact technically bloomers. The term has also become incorrectly interchangeable with pantaloons (18th century billowing shaped trousers typically fastened around the calf). In 2025, anything with a vaguely balloon-like shape, or featuring lace trimming at the hem, is being lumped together. Retailers such as ASOS and Urban Outfitters are selling pairs of “micro bloomer shorts”, while Alaïa has a pair ofbloomer adjacent trousers for £1,560.Chemena Kamali, the creative director of Chloé, could be hailed as the catalyst behind the revival. Her spring/summer ‘25 show last September featured several bloomers, in sheer lace and apricot silk-charmeuse tied around the ankle or tapered at the knee. Voguedescribed the lookas having “the potential to reshape how young women think about sexy dressing in 2025.”View image in fullscreenMonochrome comfort… Verona bloomers, £65, Flora Mae.Photograph: Courtesy of Flora Mae“They have an effortless charm and a playfulness to them, while being one of the most comfortable items in your wardrobe,” says Flora Sharp, director ofFlora Mae, a London-based brand that handcrafts garments based on historical references using repurposed fabrics. Over the past year her ‘Verona’ bloomers have become the most popular item on her site. Her customers span New York to London, are aged between 18-34 and have, as Sharp describes, a “strong interest in fashion history and sustainability.”That history charts the genesis of bloomers back to Amelia Bloomer, a New York born suffragist who, during the 1850s, inspired women to free themselves from tight-fitting corsets and crinolines and instead wear shortened dresses over Turkish-style pantaloons. In 1851, American suffragists drew international attention to the style when they wore bloomers to the World’s Peace Congress in London. It sparked wide backlash, with “Bloomerites”harassed and arrestedon the street. Bloomer later reflected that the fury surrounding them was symbolic, it hinted at the larger-scale “usurpation of the rights of man.”While other historical garments, including corsets and even chainmail, have re-emerged as modern trends, Sharp says bloomers are the first to have “an element of comfortability.” Her £65 versions are based on original Victorian designs but adapted for today. “Antique examples often have an impractical ‘split leg’ feature, are unrealistically small at the waist, and can be made of very fine cotton, making them see-through.” Using vintage cotton, Sharp adds an elasticated waist and an adjustable drawstring bow detail around the ankles in order to fit a wider range of bodies.Fans seem to enjoy their versatility. Sharp says that they appeal to people “increasingly drawn to experimental and subversive styling”. They have “the potential to be layered in different ways, peeking from underneath a skirt as they may have been worn in the 19thcentury, or as a statement piece on their own.” One thing to consider before donning the bloomer? Passerbys might still think it’s blooming mad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple’s iPad Air continues to be the premium tablet to beat, with the latest version featuring a chip upgrade to keep it ahead of the pack.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) – the same as its predecessor – and comes in two sizes with either an 11in or 13in screen. It sits between the base-model £329 iPad A16 and the £999iPad Pro M4, splitting the difference in price and features.Nothing has changed on the outside of the tablet. The M3 model is a straight replacement for theM2 model, featuring the same crisp screen, sleek aluminium design and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button.The Centre Stage webcam at the top of the screen makes video calls a breeze by automatically panning and scanning to keep you and your family in frame. Stereo speakers make watching TV and films great, while support for the £129 Apple Pencil Pro makes doodling or taking notes a joy.View image in fullscreenThe slender aluminium frame contains the stereo speakers, a Touch ID sensor and volume buttons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:11in or 13in Liquid Retina display (264ppi)Processor:Apple M3 (9-core GPU)RAM:8GBStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:iPadOS 18.4Camera:12MP rear, 12MP centre stageConnectivity:Wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart ConnecterDimensions:247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm or 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mmWeight:460g or 616gM3 upgrade and solid battery lifeView image in fullscreenThe iPad takes about two hours to charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor, which is not included.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe big change for the new Air is an upgrade to the Apple M3 chip, which was first seen in late 2023 in theMacBook Proand was successfully used in theMacBook Airuntil March when it was replaced with theM4 chip.While the M3 isn’t Apple’s latest chip, it is still far more powerful than most will ever need in a tablet and much faster than the competition. It is about 10-20% quicker than the outgoing M2 model in tests and will make short work of games and even pro-level apps such asAffinity Photo,ProcreateorAdobe Lightroom.Combined with a reliable battery life of nine to 10 hours, it can easily be used as a laptop replacement when equipped with accessories such as the new version of Apple’s excellent Magic Keyboard case, although that comes at great cost at £269. Cheaper third-party options from Logitech and others are available, however.The iPad Air runs iPadOS 18.4, which includes a collection of multitasking tools, and can be plugged into an external monitor such as a laptop via the USB-C port. But the M3 chip also enables variousApple Intelligence features, which are not available on the standard iPad A16. These include several AI image editing and generation tools, writing and proofreading tools, ChatGPT integration into Siri and other bits.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium body looks and feels great.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last inexcess of 1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from £115. The tablet is generally repairable, with adamaged out-of-warranty repair costing from £429.The tablet contains at least 30% recycled content, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact inits reportand offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe 11in iPad Air M3 costs from£599(€699/$599/A$999) and the 13in iPad Air M3 costs from£799(€949/$799/A$1,349).For comparison, the iPad A16 costs from£329, theiPad Pro M4costs from£999and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE costs from£499. TheMacBook Air M4starts at£999.VerdictThe iPad Air M3 is a great premium tablet that makes for an excellent upgrade over the base model Apple tablet.It is a highly capable machine with laptop-level power, long battery life, a quality screen and plenty of accessories to turn it into a drawing tablet, computer replacement or many other tools. The choice of sizes balances nicely between portability at the 11in and the big-screen utility of the 13in version.But the M3 model isn’t an upgrade worth making overrecent iPad Air versions, and if all you do is watch TV or films on it, the standard iPad A16 does the job for much less. Meanwhile, the top-endiPad Pro M4beats the Air on all counts but costs an awful lot more.So for those looking for a premium do-it-all tablet, the iPad Air M3 is hard to beat.Pros:choice of sizes, laptop-level M3 performance, solid battery life, quality screen, USB-C, long software support life, large range of apps and accessories, good speakers, landscape Centre Stage camera, recycled aluminium.Cons:expensive, no multiuser support, iPadOS still needs work as a laptop replacement, no kickstand without case, no Face ID, 60Hz screen.View image in fullscreenBrowsing the web and reading stories is still a joy on the 11in iPad Air.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsiPadAppleTablet computersGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The last column coveredhow to protect your phone and data privacy at the US border. If you’d like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the “Jump to” menu at the top of this article.At the press of a button, yourTeslapulls itself out of parking spot with no one behind the wheel using a feature called Summon. It drives itself on highways using Autopilot. When you arrive at your destination, it can record nearby activity while parked with a feature called Sentry Mode.To effectively operate any of these features, your car needs to monitor and collect a large amount of data about you. Most Tesla vehicles come equipped with nine internal and external cameras. Information from your Tesla, delivered via location trackers, sensors and more, can paint an intricate picture of your life and movement.“Teslas are truly rolling surveillance platforms,” said John Davisson, a senior counsel and director of litigation at digital rights research group ElectronicPrivacyInformation Center. “There are some privacy safeguards that Tesla offers that at least allow you, on the face of the settings, to opt out of data sharing ... provided that Tesla is actually following through on those commitments.”Tesla isn’t alone in collecting a considerable amount of data to enable a suite of advanced features on your vehicle. Any connected car collects some level of information to operate. Some Tesla ownersare newly concerned, given CEO Elon Musk’s role in Donald Trump’s administration.How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US borderRead moreThose concerns are not entirely unfounded, according to Reem Suleiman, the director of advocacy at Mozilla Foundation, which gave Tesla a “privacy not included”gradein its assessment of the carmaker’s data security practices. For one, the company’s track record of protecting user data is shaky. In 2023, aReuters investigation foundthat employees were sharing sensitive footage that vehicles captured in internal messaging forums. AWashington Post analysisof transparency reports published by Twitter and then X after Musk took over likewise showed that X acquiesced to 20% more government requests to remove content in just the first half of 2024 than Twitter did in all of 2021 – the last time the company published the transparency report.We spoke to privacy experts, consulted Tesla’s privacy policy and even asked Tesla’s own AI chatbot how to share the least amount of data with Tesla as possible. If you own a Tesla, there are some precautions you can and, in many cases, should take with regards to your vehicle. But be forewarned: adjusting these settings so that you share the least possible amount of data with Tesla will shut off access to many of your car’s functions.“They pretty much say that, if you choose to opt out of data collection, then your car is essentially a lemon,” Suleiman said. “They essentially say that your vehicle can have reduced functionality, serious damage or inoperability. So it’s kind of a non-choice, when you think about it.”Here’s what you need to know about your privacy in Tesla vehicles:What information is your Tesla collecting about you?Tesla’s privacy policy details a wide swath of data that its vehicles collect – most of which is stored locally but is also sent to the company unless you change your settings.According to Tesla’s AI chatbot, information collected on you includes: “location data (although Tesla doesn’t record or store vehicle-specific GPS information, except in the case of a crash); driving habits and behaviors (such as speed, braking patterns, and acceleration); diagnostic and vehicle usage data (to help improve Tesla’s products and services); infotainment system data (like browsing history and voice commands) and Autopilot data (camera recordings, sensor readings, and other inputs to support advanced safety features)”.The good news is that data can be collected and stored on your vehicle’s local drives if opt out of sharing information with the company. The bad news is that data can still be accessed if law enforcement somehow gets a hold of your vehicle during a traffic stop or other circumstance, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s Davisson.And it’s not just your car that’s collecting information. The Tesla mobile app, from which you can activate Sentry Mode or Summon, also collects location, contact, browsing and device information. Read on for how to dial back how much your car monitors you.Who is Tesla sharing your data with?Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportationsRead moreIf you opt to share your data with Tesla, all of the data it collects on you may be shared with third parties, including law enforcement. According to the company’s privacy policy, in addition to sharing data with law enforcement when the company receives a valid court order, Tesla will also share data when it is “essential to protect national security or public safety”. Davisson says that language is vague and opens the door for video footage to be shared with law enforcement for any number of reasons. Recently, for instance, the FBI has categorized vandalism of Tesla vehicles and showrooms as “domestic terrorism”.“Especially now, when everything is apparently a national emergency, it’s a very short hop from that to considering immigration enforcement to be a safety issue that requires constant sharingof real-time footage to Ice or other law enforcement officials,” said Davisson. “And it’s a scary situation.”So how do you protect your data?Consider other vehiclesEveryone has a different risk profile when it comes to their privacy. Some people may be more concerned than others about who is gaining access to their personal information. It’s not just your own privacy you need to be cognizant of, however, as Tesla’s exterior cameras can collect footage of people around the vehicle as well.If you are concerned about information gathering and don’t already have a Tesla, privacy experts say you should opt for a different car. If you do have one and want to reclaim your privacy, sell it. Even Tesla’s AI chatbot gave similar advice.“If someone is deeply concerned about their privacy, they might consider alternatives, such as: 1 Opting for a vehicle manufacturer with more restrictive data collection practices (though this might come at the cost of reduced convenience features); 2 Exploring aftermarket solutions or modifications that could potentially reduce data sharing (though this might void warranties or introduce compatibility issues).”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFactory-reset your car before selling itSo you’ve already bought a Tesla, and you’ve decided to sell it. Suleiman and the Mozilla Foundation highly recommend factory-resetting the car before you do. That means your car will be wiped of all of its data as if it was just coming off the lot.“Just because you sell your car off doesn’t mean that you’ve scrubbed the data,” Suleiman said. “It requires a little bit of due diligence.”‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesRead moreSo before you take the vehicle off your Tesla account, you will need to factory-reset your car from your in-car settings. Sit in the driver’s seat and follow these steps:1 Go to Controls > Service > Factory Reset.2 Enter your Tesla account username and password to verify your credentials.3 Confirm that you want to perform a factory reset.“This will erase all personal data, including saved addresses, music favorites and imported contacts, and restore your car’s settings to their factory defaults,” according to Tesla’s AI chatbot. The company also recommends deleting your “HomeLink” devices – which can allow you to control things like your garage door, lights or home security system from your Tesla. Do that by clicking on the “HomeLink” icon at the top of the “Controls” screen then going to HomeLink settings, where you can remove connections to other devices.How to share the least amount of your data with TeslaIn the settings of your vehicle and the Tesla app, you can opt not to share your data with the company. But as we’ve said before, be prepared to lose some functionality of your car.Opting out of data-sharing in your car is fairly straightforward.In your vehicle, go to Settings > Software > Data sharing. Turn off “allow data sharing”. This will disable the sharing of analytics, road segment, diagnostic and vehicle usage data. Tesla’s AI chatbot also recommended turning off “allow Autopilot analytics” to stop sharing Autopilot-related data.Opt out of mobile app location and data sharing.In the Tesla app, go to Settings (the button will either look like three horizontal lines or a gear icon). Then scroll down to Security and Privacy. Thenselectturn off Location Services.ClickTurn off Analytics to stop sharing app usage data to the company. Then revoke access to your camera, microphone and contacts.“By following these steps, you’ll be sharing the least amount of data with Tesla while still enjoying the core features and functionalities of your vehicle and mobile app,” according to the Tesla AI chatbot.Companies building AI-powered tech are using your posts. Here’s how to opt outRead moreBut this will affect the functionality of your car. According to Tesla’s chatbot, data sharing will affect these features:“Remote vehicle monitoring and control through the mobile app (eg, checking your vehicle’s status, location, and surroundings); navigation and routing optimization (although basic navigation will still work); geofencing and smart preconditioning (your vehicle won’t be able to anticipate your arrival or departure); some Autopilot features, such as traffic-aware cruise control and automatic emergency braking, may not function optimally; over-the-air software updates might be delayed or unavailable; certain advanced safety features, like Emergency Services, may not work seamlessly.”“I don’t think it should be a trade-off,” Davisson said. “It is true that some of the collision avoidance systems and autonomous features on Teslas like other vehicles do rely on data collection and cameras. But it should not come at the cost of the privacy, certainly of the driver or passengers of the vehicle or for people that happen to be in the area surrounding the vehicle.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaOpt outPrivacyTrump administrationElon MuskData protectionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet, for Rodríguez, 27, the natural abundance is little more than an illusion.View image in fullscreen‘We are a people that have been forgotten,’ says 27-year-old Yeidis Rodríguez Suárez“We are a people that have been forgotten,” she says. “The Ciénaga is depleted. It’s already washed out.”The village of Nueva Venecia and its close neighbour, Buenavista, stand on wooden stilts above the waters of the Ciénaga.For decades, the inhabitants of these palafitte communities, as the stilt-house villages are known, have suffered the consequences of poorly managed infrastructure projects, government inaction and pollution that have caused fish populations to plummet and fresh water sources become nearly undrinkable.Experts trace the problem to the construction of two highways across the delta in the mid-20th century, which disrupted the natural flow of water between the Ciénaga, the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River, leading to the widespread salination of the region’s mangroves.Horst Salzwedel, a marine biologist who has worked in the region since the 1980s, says: “Although mangroves can tolerate salt in the soil, there is a limit. When it exceeds a certain level, they begin to die.”View image in fullscreenSome of the stilt homes in Nueva Venecia. Although the community is in one of the world’s most biodiverse regions, pollution has made the water increasingly undrinkableThe dramatic changes to the Ciénaga’s hydrology are reflected in the area’s plummeting fish populations.According to Invemar, a government marine ecosystem research institute, the total catch from the Ciénaga was 4,721 tonnes between January and September 2024, compared with 9,269 tonnes in 1994 – and a reported60,000 tonnes in the middle of the 20th century.View image in fullscreenLast century, traditional fishing methods pulled in catches of 60,000 tonnes – more than 10 times the size of ones todayJésus Suárez, 57, collects data for Invemar in Nueva Venecia. Working from a small stilt structure at the edge of the town, he records the contents of fishers’ catches as they unload their stock, pencilling notes on sheets of paper.“Fifteen fish species remain that can produce profit,” he says. “Once, there were 56 species registered.”Since he came to the town in 1986, Suárez has observed how the changing climate has disrupted the ecology of the Ciénaga.“Nowadays, in a single month it can rain the same amount that previously fell over five months,” he says.View image in fullscreenJésus Suárez, who records data for marine research, at his home in Nueva Venecia. It now rains as much in a month as it did over five months when he first came to Ciénaga in 1986The fall in fish populations has hit the main pillar of the local economy. More than2,500 people live in Ciénaga’s stilt towns, and thousands of others from the nearby cities of Tasajera and Ciénaga depend on the ecosystem for their livelihoods. Many have been plunged into a cycle of poverty from which there appears to be little escape.“The fish are being lost. If there are no fish, there is no money, no food,” says Andrea Niebles Mejía, 18, who lives in Buenavista with her three-year-old child.“I want to study, but there are no opportunities here and no money to study.”View image in fullscreenAndrea Niebles Mejía cannot afford the £35 a month it costs to study in nearby CiénagaIncluding the cost of transport, food and the course fee, Niebles would only need about 200,000 Colombian pesos (£35) a month to study – but it is a price she cannot afford.As a large canoe judders through the stilt town, the wind rattles through her home. The boat’s wooden hull sits unusually low in the lagoon: it is full to the brim – not with a catch of fish but water.It has arrived from the Magdalena River, which provides most of the drinking water for Nueva Venecia and Buenavista. Boats such as these ferry the water between the river and the stilt towns, using the wooden hull of the canoe as a container. The water is barely treated before being distributed to residents to drink.The longest river in Colombia, the Magdalena, receives industrial discharge from several major cities, as well as sediment from industrial agriculture and heavy metals produced by illegal mining.“The Ciénaga Grande is the final part of this system,” says Sandra Vilardy, a marine biologist who has worked in the Ciénaga for almost 30 years. “These inhabitants are drinking the water with the highest industrial metabolic load in Colombia – without it being treated.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is missing.”The Corporación Autónoma Regional del Magdalena (Corpamag), the environmental bodyresponsible for dredging canals in the Ciénaga– a vital process in restoring water flow – has long been accused of negligence and inaction.View image in fullscreenMen unload their catch in Nueva Venecia.

More recently, the pandemic forced many downtown businesses to allow staffers to work from home, erasing a key daytime customer base for cafes and restaurants.But in recent years a host of hotels, breweries and eateries have sprung up alongside concert venues and galleries.So, when it was announced that Nato’s spring parliamentary assembly was coming to town – 23 years since it was last held in the US – many saw it as an opportunity to share this former Rust belt city with the world.“I want people to talk about what a great time they had here and what a success it was,” says Larkin Vonalt, who runsRabbit Hole Books, which sells used books for $1.“It really could be a wonderful event.”Bringing Nato to Dayton is thebrainchild and a career-defining move for Mike Turner, a Republican Ohio congressman and former Dayton mayor who has been a leading advocate of the transatlantic military alliance for years. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Bosnian peace accords, which were negotiated at an air force base outside Dayton.However, many say communication and clarity on the five-day event, which will center on a “Nato village” in the heart of the city, have so far been lacking.Rabbit Hole Books is set to see a security fence dividing the Nato village from the outside world go up right outside its door, says Vonalt.“People attending the conference can’t come in, and for the public, nobody wants to go up to a police line to go into a bookstore,” she says.Vonalt says she was later told a tunnel would be erected to allow people access to the bookstore, which has added to the sense of uncertainty.“We should either be in or out. Give us the people inside the Nato village who don’t have very many places to shop, or give us the regular customers,” she says.“We want to know where we fit.”Locals are also nervous that theviolent scenesthat unfolded during the most recent Nato parliamentary assembly in Montreal last fall, which resulted in millions of dollars in damaged property, could be repeated here. Nato doesn’t typically contribute anything to a city’s hosting of the parliamentary assembly.Turner, who wasousted by the speaker, Mike Johnson, in Januaryas chair of the US House intelligence committee, has been heavily criticized by some in Ohio for backing Donald Trump, whose recent government cuts have hit the Dayton area and its tens of thousands of air force employees particularly hard.“It’s going to be a holiday weekend which is already a tough weekend for businesses as a lot of people travel,” says Michael Harbaugh, who runs a food truck and plans to organize a protest during the Nato gathering.“Crowds are usually down, and businesses are not going to be compensated for anything by the city or state.”Harbaugh ran as an independent candidate in last year’s congressional election in an unsuccessful attempt to unseat Turner.“I feel like they are not representing a sizable portion of the people here. They are bought-and-sold politicians; the two political parties are a disaster in many ways. It sounds good; it’s something for politicians to pat themselves on the back.”Despite being a congressman for an area ofOhiothat includes Dayton since 2013, Turner rarely visits his constituency and has refused to hold a town hall in recent weeks, to the fury of many locals who are upset at attempts by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to eradicate thousands of jobs.Harbaugh says the millions of dollars set to be spent on policing and security fencing during the Nato event would be better used elsewhere in the Dayton community, where several years ago opioid deaths were among the highest in the country.“There are so many people going without here,” he says. “We should be spending to feed and house people rather than on the rich and powerful.”While Vonalt says she supports Nato and hopes the US remains a leading force within it, she’s also critical of Turner and his handling of Nato’s trip to Dayton.“If you were in charge of this and it was going to affect your town, wouldn’t you come home, have a town hall meeting and say: ‘I have wonderful news for you – Nato has agreed to come here. It’s going to make life a little interesting for a week but think of all the great things Dayton will get from this,’” she says. “It should have been done that way.”Numerous emails sent by the Guardian to Turner’s communication staff seeking comment received no response.View image in fullscreenThe leaders of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia sign a peace treaty at an air force base just outside Dayton, Ohio, in 1995.Photograph: Eric Miller/ReutersSeen as a relative moderate Republican in a party increasingly dominated by far-right insurgents, Turner’s single-handed efforts to get Nato to come to Dayton could mean his political career is tied to the success of the parliamentary assembly. Last year, his congressional district was one of a handful that saw a Democratic politician win more votes than a Republican in any race in Ohio. A repeat of the kind of violence that marred the Montreal event could see Turner’s longstanding congressional seat threatened.Still, for a part of the world that’s more often characterized for loss and decline, having the world’s largest security organization come to town for an event that is more commonly held in capital cities is viewed by some as a win.About $1.5m is being spent beautifying the downtown core, and a host of ancillary events are set to draw diplomats and analysts to Dayton.Some business owners were happy that a previous, larger version of the Nato security zone was downsized after organizers consulted with local businesses who feared footfall would be wiped out.The event is happening against the backdrop of criticism of Nato by Trump, who has claimed the US may decline to defend other member states in any conflict, as the Nato charter stipulates, if certain countries don’t increase military spending. The US pays 16% of Nato’s budget, the joint-most of any member state alongside Germany.Given these and other Trump-related tribulations, some Dayton residents are wondering if the gathering will actually ever happen here.“I think there is still the possibility that this will all grind to a halt,” says Vonalt, “that we won’t be in Nato by the time the assembly happens.”Explore more on these topicsOhioNatofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Carney, a political novice who had never held political office, was in the role for only nine days when he called a snap election.Carney faced two problems: Trump’s economic threats and the uncomfortable fact that he didn’t have a seat in the House of Commons, meaning he risked becoming a political punching bag for opposition parties – with no chance to hit back.For months, the Conservatives had been the sure bet to win any election. But sensinga rapidly shifting national moodprompted by Trump’s aggression Carney calculated a snap federal election was his best option.Who are the key players and what have they promised?Five political parties were represented in parliament before the election was called. But in most voters’ minds, there are two main choices for prime minister: Liberal leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Amid the broader concerns over Canada’s economic security and sovereignty, opposition voices such as the leftwing New Democratic party, the sovereigntistBloc Québécoisand the Green party have struggled to remain relevant.There is little daylight between the federal leaders on issues of Canada’s relationship with the United States. Both have rejected the ideaCanadawould ever cede its sovereignty. But while both acknowledge a cost of living crisis and housing unaffordability have left Canadians feeling worse off, they have divergent solutions.Poilievre has promised to cut regulations, diminish the role and size of government in order to facilitate homebuilding. Carney, in contrast, is leaning government as a key figure in any wide-scale building effort.Poilievre, a brash populist and seasoned parliamentary “attack dog”, hasinspired a fervent response from his supporters, who say he has given a voice to those who feel ignored and mocked by political elites. The Tory leader has told supporters he will crack down on crime, toughening sentences for the worst offenders in a move that he admits would breach the country’s charter of rights and freedoms – but promising to usean arcane constitutional mechanismthat permits him to do so anyway.Carney has largely run a campaign on his economic and business credentials, tacking the party towards the political centre in an attempt to lure in disaffected voters from both sides of the political aisle. Conservatives have used his CV in their attacks, alleging he used tax loopholes when chair of the investment firm Brookfield. Carney has also faced criticism from the Conservatives for adopting their own policy proposals,including removing a controversial carbon tax.How does the system work?Canada’s federal election is really 343 separate elections across the country held simultaneously. Those parliamentary elections in Canada are normally held every four years and under federal law, an election is required by October 2025 at the latest. Using a parliamentary system stems from the British or Westminster tradition, the party with the most seats typically forms government. If either the Liberals or the Conservatives win 172 or more seats, they will have a majority government. Anything less than that and they will be required to work with other parties to pass legislation.In 2021, the Liberals failed to win a majority and laterstruck a deal with the New Democratic party, known as a confidence and supply agreement, to help them form a government. The Liberals have indicated that they are campaigning to win a majority government because under a minority government scenario, opposition parties have the opportunity of defeating the governing party in a vote of no-confidence and triggering another election.What do the polls say and what is the likely outcome?Until February, the Conservatives enjoyed a 25 point lead over the Liberals. Pollsters gave the Tories a 99% chance of winning if an election were called at the time with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in decades. But Trump’s aggressive posture towards Canada has scrambled the stakes of the election: the Conservative’s dominant lead has disappeared and now they find themselves trailing in the twilight of the campaign.graphOf the 12 polling firms in Canada surveying voters, all of them show the Liberals leading to the extent that a majority government is the most likely outcome. The math looks even more dire for the Conservatives, with the Liberals enjoying a domain lead in the most vote-rich parts of the country.Canadians will vote on 28 April, but advance voting opens in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsCanadaJustin TrudeauMark CarneyAmericasexplainersShareReuse this content"

However, the takeover leaves a big question: what next?Steep losses at British Steel prompted its Chinese owner, Jingye, to decide last month to close its blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, which would end the production of “virgin” steel in the UK. The government stepped in with emergency legislation, passed in asingle daylast Saturday, to prevent that.The legislation has given the industry, workers and politicians time to work out how to build a doubly sustainable UK steel industry: one that makes money, while minimising carbon emissions.Electric arc furnacesThe future for Scunthorpe, if it is to have a future, will almost certainly be the electric arc furnace (EAF). Blast furnaces use coal to strip oxygen from iron ore to make iron, which is then refined into steel. The oxygen combines with carbon, eventually to be vented into the atmosphere as planet-heating carbon dioxide. By contrast,EAFs use electricity to melt down scrap steelsourced from old cars and demolished buildings.TheCelsa steelworks in Cardiff is one such factory, using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn scrap metal to liquid.That route to decarbonisation has already been chosen by Tata Steel at Port Talbot in south Wales: itclosed its two blast furnaceslast year to make way for electric arc replacements.Dan Marks, a research fellow who has studied steel at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a defence thinktank, said the shift to electric arc furnaces was inevitable, but that successive governments had taken too long to act.“This was something that needed to be done in 2019,” said Marks. Back then it was clear that only a few years remained for the four operating blast furnaces at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe. “Nobody is going to invest in blast furnaces over a 25- to 30-year commitment,” he said.For Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer for the GMB union, the priority is preserving good jobs for the workers of Scunthorpe, where she used to work. To that end, she said the government should consider electric arc furnaces but should also look at using methane or hydrogen in blast furnaces. That technology, which already exists, would cut emissions and would have the advantage from the unions’ point of view of minimising disruption for the workforce at Scunthorpe, although it appears to be a long shot.Energy pricesMuch lower carbon is a key attraction, but the other side of sustainability is financial.View image in fullscreenOne of the blast furnaces at British Steel’s steelworks site in Scunthorpe.Photograph: Darren Staples/APFrank Aaskov, director for energy and climate change policy at UK Steel, welcomed the government’s action on Scunthorpe. However, he said: “The UK steel industry needs an improved business framework, which requires significant changes to trade, energy, scrap, and procurement policies, which have held the industry back.”Ask pretty much any UK steel industry executive what they want from government and the answer is the same: cheaper energy. UK companies will pay about £68 a megawatt hour (MWh) for electricity this year, compared with £44 in France and £52 in Germany, according to the consultancy Baringa. Prices in Sweden, which has abundant cheap hydropower, can be less than a third those of the UK.The government has already committed to a big increase in renewables such as wind and solar to wean power generation off fossil gas. However, those promises may not provide much help for a few years yet.Liam Bates, the president of long products at the Sheffield-based stainless steelmaker Marcegaglia, said: “The real ask is to have green electricity at a price similar to the rest of Europe. It’s that simple.”It could be relatively simple: UK Steel, the industry lobby group, has argued that it could cost less than 50p a year for each householdto match France’s cheaper electricityfor steel. However, the subsidies suggested could force the government to pay more if gas prices surge, pushing up the price of electricity.Trade protectionismGovernment policy on the steel industry has been pulled between the desire for a free market and state control for most of the past century. Clement Attlee’s Labour government nationalised the steel industry in 1949, and then the Conservatives privatised it in 1951. Labour renationalised it in 1967 andMargaret Thatcher privatised it in 1988.Many people in the steel industry argue that it has never really been a free market. Too many governments tip the scales to support strategic industries. Now that the free market is in retreat around the world, thanks in part to Donald Trump’s tariffs, the steel industry insists thatprotectionism is necessaryfor the UK industry to survive.graphQuotas set in response to Trump’s first-term tariffs are now bigger than demand, leaving them out of date, said one senior UK steel executive. British companies allege that foreign rivals are dumping steel in the UK in their desperation to find a buyer. The industry wants the UK government to react to trade distortions sooner.“We need to be quicker,” said the executive. “We’re suffering a serious diversion of trade from EU and other countries, and prices no longer follow EU levels as has been the norm for many years.”Monumental investments …It is not all bad for the UK steel industry. Companies are relieved that the Labour government has stuck by a pledge to spend £2.5bn to help the industry, even as other parts of the budget, such as international aid and welfare spending, have been cut.How that money is spent is still up for grabs. The government could be tempted by eye-catching investments as monuments to their support.View image in fullscreenJonathan Reynolds visits the British Steel site in Scunthorpe on 15 April 2025.Photograph: Darren Staples/PAAlasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary at Community, another union representing steelworkers, called for two big projects backed by the UK government. The first would be a large plate mill that would be capable of making the steel needed for wind turbine towers needed for the government’s expansion of green energy.Only 2% of the steel used in British offshore wind projectsover the past five years was made in the UK, according to Lumen Energy & Environment, a consultancy.If that proportion does not rise then the UK will miss out on up to 2m tonnes of demand at the peak. The government is thought to be prepared to pay higher prices for British steel if it supports jobs in the UK, a consideration that will also inform the planned defence spending boom.The second big investment would be a factory making direct reduced iron (DRI). That would use methane and then, ideally, hydrogen made with clean electricity, to produce iron from iron ore, thereby almost eliminating the need for coal in virgin steel production.DRI plants already produce millions of tonnes a year using methane, with India the biggest producer of lumps of iron known as hot briquetted iron.The unions may be pushing at an open door. The government has made clear that it is seriously considering DRI. It has received a report on the technology by the Middlesbrough-based Materials Processing Institute, formerly a research arm of Tata Steel, and ministers have talked of DRI’s potential for several years.GraphicJonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told parliament on Saturday: “I believe that the capacity for primary steel production is important. Direct reduced iron technology is of significant potential interest to us for the future.”What that would look like is unclear, however. None of the major steel companies in the UK has expressed a desire to run a DRI plant, despite government waving the possibility of huge subsidies. A person with knowledge of the government’s thinking said it was likely that a commercial partner would be sought to build a DRI plant, if recommended in a study by the Materials Processing Institute.… or scrap heap challenge?However, Rusi’s Marks argued that the focus on making virgin steel from iron ore is misplaced. Preserving British primary steelmaking is popular across the House of Commons, but Marks pointed out that in an extreme wartime scenario the UK would still be dependent on imports (of iron ore from Australia or Brazil).Marks said he believed that the ability to make different kinds of product in a pinch was more important: flat steels, or long products, aerospace-grade or speciality steels for nuclear submarine reactors. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic Tata Steel had to work flat out to produce food cans. Without that existing ability, there might have been shortages of some food products during the crisis.The government may have to pay more attention to the unglamorous world of scrap yards, and preventing the export of the valuable metal. The UK produces between 10m and 11m tonnes of scrap every year, most of which is exported to places such as Turkey to be sorted and recycled. That metal would provide more than enough to replace the UK’s 5.6m tonnes of steel produced in 2023.“Worrying about whether your steel is recycled or not is pointless,” said Marks. “The question is: is your supply secure?”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelManufacturing sectorSteel industryLincolnshireEnglandSustainable developmentTrade policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Orange designates sensitive words that require careful examination – words like freedom and democracy, and the three characters that make up Xi Jinping’s name. While such words regularly appear in newspapers or on TV, that does not mean ordinary citizens can use them at will.Red is for high-risk words that cannot be published and must be deleted: “Falun Gong”, the banned spiritual group; “64”, representing June 4, the date of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre; the names of Liu Xiaobo and the Dalai Lama; “Jasmine”, because, after the Tunisian revolution of 2011, several small-scale demonstrations that have come to be known as China’s “Jasmine revolution” have made the Chinese government nervous.After three years as a censor, Liu detests his job. He detests the white office ceiling, the grey industrial carpet and the office that feels more like a factory. He also detests his 200-odd colleagues sitting in their cubicles, each concentrating on their mouse and keyboard as they delete or hide content.One afternoon, the office boredom is disturbed when Chen Min* in the next cubicle suddenly jumps up, limbs flailing ecstatically. He has uncovered Wang Dan’s Weibo account. All the censors know that Wang Dan, one of the 1989 student leaders, political criminal and exile, is considered by the Chinese government to be one of the most important enemies of the state. Finding him is a big deal, and the news is immediately reported to the Sina Weibo office in Beijing. It might even be reported to the public security bureau.The following month, a senior manager comes specially from Beijing to highly commend Chen Min for discovering intelligence about the “enemy”, praising his “acuity” and “high level of awareness”, and bestows on him a small bonus. All his colleagues applaud and shout in admiration. All except Liu. He sits amid the crowd and glares at Chen Min’s face, flushed red with excitement, and asks himself: is this worth it?The day shift is 11 hours and the night shift is longer – 13 hours. During the breaks, most of the censors sneak away to smoke and chat in the stairwell. Liu doesn’t smoke and has nothing in common with the others to gossip about. Bored stiff, he logs on to a VPN service to circumvent the great firewall of China and uses Google Earth to wander streets in unfamiliar cities, fantasising about the people there and their lives.He often logs on to the Weibo webpage, not as a censor but as an ordinary user. On Weibo, his username is Ordinary Fascist (普通法西斯). It’s a satirical name but Liu is unsure whom it satirises.Hardly any of the censors use Weibo themselves, and Liu never tells his colleagues that he does. It would not occur to them that Liu has so much to say on Weibo and posts so much “unhealthy” and “inappropriate”, let alone “illegal” and “reactionary”, content. Liu never gets into trouble. He knows all the sensitive words that are flagged and how to avoid them. In these days Weibo posts are limited to 140 characters – that will change later – and he resorts to all kinds of ruses to ridicule the Communist party and mock the government. He employs sensitive words, but the censors ignore them because they are too busy looking for those flagged orange or red.In spring 2014, the Chinese government begins to purge influential Weibo users, the so-called big V – as in, verified – accounts. A journalist at the People’s Liberation Army Daily is so impassioned that he publishes a post on Weibo calling all big Vs vermin who must be dealt with severely. A few minutes later, Ordinary Fascist posts an extremely vulgar comment that essentially suggests the journalist should engage in frenzied sexual congress with his mother. This post generates even more comments and reposts. Many find the abuse gratifying, but no one knows that the author is himself a censor.Ordinary Fascist is tasked with following more than 300 Weibo users, mostly big Vs, the majority of whom are people brave enough to occasionally criticise the political system. In the official view, they are “factors of instability” and thus dangerous elements. Among them are journalists, professors, lawyers and even an occasional star of the big and small screens. Although most of their posts are tactful and restrained, likening the government to a violent husband or a pissant blowing their own trumpet, few realise that they are witnessing the pinnacle of freedom of speech in communist China, the golden age for a generation.No matter how tactful, restrained and oblique the criticism, the Communist party still detests it. A lot of content is deleted, and accounts on Ordinary Fascist’s watchlist frequently disappear for no apparent reason. These people are banned from posting, their accounts are shut, and some of the individuals behind them are even arrested by the police.Liu appreciates and sympathises with these people. He sometimes uses his powers to furtively lift the bans on frozen accounts and salvage deleted or hidden posts. Years later, Jenny Ho* still remembers Liu’s help restoring her frozen account. She is fromHong Kongand in 2013 publishes several posts about the Hong Kong protests. She is then banned and for several weeks cannot post anything. Just as Jenny prepares to register a new account, Liu sends her an email telling her he has surreptitiously unblocked her account. “I didn’t know him, but he helped me a lot,” says Jenny. “I often wonder, what sort of person is that? Why would he risk doing that?”From Liu’s point of view, there was no danger: “If discovered, I might get a dressing down or lose a few points on my performance evaluation. The worst possible outcome would be termination, which was no big deal because I had already decided to quit.”At this point, Liu has just turned 30. He has a childish face, though a few grey hairs have appeared prematurely. He is also unrealistically optimistic. His violation of workplace ethics is far more dangerous than he imagines. And even more dangerous is his collecting of Weibo censorship files. The most significant files are the censors’ “shift handover files” because they record the orders from superiors when a new sensitive incident occurs, when a new sensitive individual’s name or a sensitive word is added to the forbidden word list, and when instructions are issued on how to employ more efficiently the four lethal weapons available: “delete, hide, stop, and make private”. Liu doesn’t know why he is collecting those files other than his belief that they are important: “They are a part of contemporary history.”When he hands in his request to resign from the job, Liu feels relieved. “At last,” he thinks. “I can finally leave this shithole.”Five days later, as Liu is completing his resignation paperwork, he logs on to the Weibo back-end management page. He notices that one of the big V accounts he follows is cancelled. It belongs to the author Murong Xuecun. Me.It is 2013 and I am a bestselling author and a verified Weibo user with a small blue capital V after my name. In a little over two years, I publish more than 1,800 posts on Weibo. Many of these posts criticise or ridicule the Communist party. They are wildly popular, generating countless comments and reposts. I am frequently praised for my bravery, but upon reflection, my indirect criticism and mockery is not true bravery. Everything I say is permissible. Everything I publish is also permitted. At most, I hit a few aces. In this, I am no different to many public intellectuals of this time who never point at the elephant in the room and call for an end to Communist party rule. Of course, should I say things like that, my account would be immediately cancelled and I would probably be disappeared.By May 2013, I have close to 4 million followers on Weibo. Such large accounts are not handled by Liu. Weibo allocates a personal censor, known as a Weibo gatekeeper. Mine is Jia Jia*. Whenever I write inappropriate content, she phones me. “Mr Mu, that post of yours won’t do. I deleted it for you.” Sometimes she tells me the names of the people and the events that cannot be mentioned, so I can take a detour around the forbidden zone.She says “we”, not “you”. When she refers to such matters, she speaks softly, her tone suggesting that this is a consultation, as though she were a sister or a close friend. I never meet, Jia Jia but I feel obliged to say, I quite like her work style. Yes, she is a censor, yet she is so gentle in her work, so considerate, not lacking in human warmth. In China, censors like her are rare and precious.I don’t know why my account is cancelled and no one tells me the reason. Jia Jia won’t tell me.Xi Jinping has just ascended to power and hasn’t yet revealed his true intentions. Many people still place high hopes on him. They think he will take China on the path to democracy.View image in fullscreenChinese dissident Wang Dan addressing fellow students in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in May 1989.Photograph: APSoon, however, an internal document called Seven Things Not to Talk About (七不讲) breaks their hearts. This document clearly shows Xi’s aspirations. It prohibits university-level teachers from discussing seven topics in class: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, historical mistakes of the Communist party, powerful bourgeoisie and judicial independence.The day the document is leaked, I have a busy schedule. I give a public lecture at a library and then rush to a gathering. In the car on the way to this meeting, I write a short comment on Weibo. I suggest that the Seven Things Not to Talk About is just one thing: culture is prohibited.The gathering is in a fancy restaurant in the centre of Beijing. There are a dozen or so of us – professors, lawyers, journalists and human rights activists. We drink a few bottles of wine, eat some expensive dishes and discuss the future of China. At this time, many are confident the Communist party’s rule cannot possibly last much longer. China will have a bright future. “The sky will soon be light,” a professor says to me. “We will definitely see it.”None of the participants foresees that, in 10 years, half the people around the table will be in jail. Some, like me, will be living in exile. Those still in Beijing will have long been silenced and will not utter a word. The optimism that we share at this distinguished gathering will feel illusory and distant, like a fleeting dream.On the way home from the get-together, I receive a message from a friend whose Weibo account was closed the previous day. I, like most Weibo users, consider account banning a serious matter, so I publish a harshly worded question on Weibo: “Who gave you the right to arbitrarily deprive citizens of their freedom of speech?” Retribution is swift. Within 20 minutes of this posting, my account is cancelled.The Cyberspace Administration of China is the premier censorship agency in China. The newly appointed boss, Lu Wei, popularly known as the “internet tsar”, begins to implement a series of severe purges of online speech. Countless accounts are cancelled, and many people are thrown behind bars for what they wrote online. But that’s just guesswork. In China, there’s no need for a good reason to block someone’s account. A powerful government agency can simply issue an order to make a person disappear from public life.Many people feel my treatment is unfair. They light virtual candles for me and hold “memorial services”. My Weibo gatekeeper, Jia Jia, the gentle censor, telephones me and, though apologetic, she, too, thinks I should be a little more careful. “There’s no need for you to get into direct conflict with them, don’t you think?”She declines to tell me which agency issued the order, only referring to “higher levels”.I hope that, in consideration of our close relationship, Jia Jia will tell me the details, but she responds: “I’m sorry, Mr Mu, I really cannot reveal this. You know we sign non-disclosure agreements. Please show me some empathy. I have a life, too, right?”It’s my last telephone conversation with Jia Jia. I then register multiple accounts, but each one is cancelled. I imagine Jia Jia is aware of this, but she does not contact me.The next day, around dusk, my friend Yu Dayou* calls to tell me he received an email from a stranger. The email is about me and he forwards it. It is just one line: “Please forward to Murong Xuecun.” There are two attached images. They are screenshots of the Weibo management page that contain detailed information about my account: time of registration, IP address, my mobile phone number, the reason for the deletion of each of my posts and the blocking of my account, as well as the answer to the question I pestered Jia Jia about: which agency and who ordered my account to be cancelled.It is Liu’s last day at Sina Weibo. The handover is complete and his possessions are packed. He just needs to endure a few more hours and he can leave that putrid place for ever. Liu does not know me and has not read my books. He has read a few of my posts in his role as a censor, but they don’t leave a deep impression. He sees the momentous memorial for my Weibo account and then goes out of his way to look at the Weibo administrative page. At first, he doesn’t think much about it, but gradually an idea forms in his mind. Perhaps he can do something.He considers rescuing the Murong Xuecun Weibo account but the order to cancel it has come from a very high level, so it is impossible to quietly reactivate it like other accounts, without anyone noticing.Liu has signed the same censors’ non-disclosure agreement as Jia Jia, though he is determined to violate it. When no one notices, he furtively copies two screenshots on to his own flash drive. He knows the value of the two images, but he can’t send them directly; he must find an intermediary.Liu finds Yu Dayou in the list of Murong Xuecun’s followers. Yu is a not particularly successful businessman, and his words and actions never overstep the boundaries. Liu calculates that Yu will escape notice. Liu spends a little time reviewing Murong’s communication records to determine that Murong and Yu are in contact with each other. This is the one, Liu tells himself.The time to leave arrives. Liu carries his scant belongings out of that grey skyscraper and walks a few hundred metres along the ancient Grand Canal that connects Beijing to Hangzhou, pondering whether to do it. Getting caught would certainly mean arrest and possibly a prison sentence. How long? Two years? Three years? At most three years, no longer.View image in fullscreenPolice arrest a man after internet social networks called to join a ‘Jasmine revolution’ protest in Shanghai, in February 2011.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersHe walks into an internet bar, finds a secluded seat and registers a new email account with the username Nameless.He sends the two images to Yu Dayou and adds a one-sentence message. After sending the email, he sits silently in front of the computer for a while, recalling the three years of his life as a censor. He thinks about his family and his girlfriend Alice*. In a few days, he will marry Alice. She probably will not understand the significance of what he has just done. Best not tell her, to avoid making her worry.After 40 minutes, Yu Dayou replies: “The friend asks, can this be made public?”Liu has already thought this through. As soon as the images are published, Sina Weibo will definitely try to track down the leaker. They may make a police report. Liu hesitates. He considers the number of people who have access to that page, at least three or four hundred. They would not necessarily suspect him.“OK to make public,” Liu replies. “In any case, they are unlikely to find me.”He logs out of the email account and erases his browsing history. He then checks again to be sure he has not left any traces before he is confident enough to stand up. There are a lot of youths playing video games all around. They are engrossed with their computer screens and yell out chaotically. None of them notices him. Liu silently walks out of the internet bar, head lowered. It will soon be dark. He brushes his sleeves as though flicking off three years of grime. He walks quickly to merge with the people strolling at dusk.The two screenshots Nameless sends me contain many names: Weibo censors, some censorship managers, as well as the name of the person who cancelled my account. And then there is Old Mr Chen, the editor-in-chief of Weibo. He was once my friend, but our friendship ends here. In his eyes, I must have become a “sensitive element”, like a pathogen to be avoided.The key name in the screenshot is that of “Minister Peng”: Peng Bo. He has just been promoted to vice-ministerial rank, becoming a member of China’s privileged class, the lawless nomenklatura. He delivers speeches at meetings claiming he will “thoroughly cleanse cyberspace” – that is, he will eliminate all voices detrimental to the party, which is the reason he issues the order to cancel all my social media accounts.One afternoon two months later, I cannot restrain myself any longer: I use a newly registered account to write a threatening post to Peng on Weibo. In it, I say: if my account is cancelled again, I will deploy all my resources to investigate your corrupt deeds and make them public. “The day this account is cancelled is also the day you will be jailed. Don’t say you weren’t warned.”These words are not me firing blindly in the dark. Before his promotion, Peng was a journalist, an editor and a publisher. We have many mutual acquaintances and friends and, despite the constant refrain of words such as “honest” and “upstanding” on his lips, many people suspect that he is corrupt and licentious. Common sense suggests that a high official with as much power as Peng is unlikely to be as honest and upright as he claims to be.View image in fullscreenPeng Bo during his trial in 2022.Photograph: CCTV 13/WeiboPerhaps that is why Peng is apprehensive about dealing with my threat. After about a month, my new Weibo account is cancelled. It’s around midnight. I have just returned to my apartment when I receive a call from the editor-in-chief of Sina Weibo, my erstwhile friend, Old Mr Chen, who featured in the screenshots. He sounds very nervous. He says the order to cancel my account comes from an organisation and has nothing to do with Peng. He admonishes me “not to be used by others” – that is, by Peng’s political enemies.“Peng began his career as a journalist. He’s the same as the two of us. We’re all the same,” says Old Mr Chen. “Moreover, when he cancelled your account last time it was not of his own volition. He was following orders so don’t fuck with him, OK?” Chen then suggests I meet with Peng for a chat. “Now, just the three of us. We’ll go somewhere for a drink and talk about this, OK?”During the next two hours, I receive six phone calls like that from Old Mr Chen at Peng’s instigation. Apart from Old Mr Chen, a mutual friend calls to say something along the lines of: “Don’t fuck with him. Starting a vendetta will not be good for you.” I ignore them all. I begin to draft a public announcement offering a 200,000-yuan reward for evidence of Peng’s corruption. And then Yu Dayou telephones: “If you keep this up, Peng will be very dangerous. If you can’t beat him, the guy who gave you the tipoff will be in deep trouble. He helped you out of the goodness of his heart, so you can’t implicate him.”Liu knows nothing of this. He does not read my essay and does not know about my war with Peng. In the summer of 2013, he marries Alice and holds a reception at a fancy restaurant in the city of Tianjin. There is a throng of well-wishers, relatives and friends. Liu drinks a lot of alcohol. He occasionally thinks of his former career as a censor, which still makes him feel nauseated.After the wedding, a relative introduces Liu to a temporary job in a state-owned enterprise. Alice is carrying their first child. To earn more, Liu takes a job at a TV and film streaming service, where he is a quality control manager. The work has no connection to censorship, but he works alongside censors. Every day he sees new official censorship orders. Some of the orders are unbelievable. One variety show compere says he almost “died laughing”. In subtitles, the word “died” must be put inside double quotation marks, otherwise it is a breach of regulations. It’s as though viewers are considered not intelligent enough to understand an extremely simple phrase.Liu begins to collate these orders. He copies censorship orders page by page, then uploads them to cloud servers outside China’s great firewall. After four years, he comes to believe the material is extraordinarily significant. He secretly vows that one day he will release it to the public.As the censorship file grows, he becomes increasingly nervous. He has no illusions that what he is doing is more than enough for a three-year jail sentence at minimum. Five or six years is entirely possible, and eight or 10 years is not impossible. His son has just begun to walk and his daughter has just been born. If the police drag him away, the family will be destroyed.Liu stays quiet. He refrains from making new friends and doesn’t share his true feelings with anyone. He walks around with his head lowered out of fear of attracting attention. In a city of 15 million people, not a single person knows that he is engaged in dangerous work.By now I have vanished from public life in China; my books cannot be sold, my essays cannot be published. I live in isolation in a small apartment in Beijing. I frequently have money worries and I frequently think about Nameless. What sort of person are they? Why take such an enormous risk to disclose sensitive information to me? Yu Dayou and I agree that whoever they are, that person is extraordinary. “If this riddle is ever solved,” says Yu, “I will definitely treat that person to a good meal.” I, too, want to thank them.Meanwhile, Peng’s political career progresses smoothly. He is constantly on TV and quoted in newspapers. He hosts meetings and publishes speeches that call for people to “study well, publicise well, and implement well the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speeches”.His power grows: in addition to managing public opinion on the internet, he is also responsible for the “prevention of and dealing with cults” – that is, the repression of and attacks upon faith communities. My religious friends are beaten and arrested. In 2018, Peng becomes a professor of journalism at China’s most important university, Peking University. In the classroom, he tells students: “I’m not an official; I’m just a foot soldier in the line of fire.”At the end of 2019 and in early 2020, Covid-19 spreads. First, in Wuhan, and then to the whole world. Within a few years, several million people lose their lives. In China, Xi pushes his cruel Covid policies that transform the country into a huge prison. At the slightest pretext, cities with populations in the millions are completely locked down. No one can leave their homes without permission, even to buy food. This applies also to people with urgent medical conditions or pregnant women about to go into labour.Liu decides to leave China because he can’t take any more of living like a prisoner. He is even more concerned about the censorship materials he has collected. The Chinese government begins to deploy QR codes to control the lives of Chinese people: tracking codes, venue codes, health codes. No matter where you go, QR codes must be scanned and reported to the government to detail your movements and location. One little error and you are subject to searches or even imprisonment. “If they look through my mobile phone, I’ll be finished,” Liu thinks. “I have to leave immediately.”But there are hardly any flights. Tianjin airport is closed. He takes Alice and their two children to Beijing and catches one of the last planes to Los Angeles. Once the plane is in the air, he is finally able to relax, even though he wonders whether he will ever be able to return to China. Later, he would tell me: “It was like a desperate escape from a house on fire.”View image in fullscreenAn activist known as Grandma Wong is detained by police in Hong Kong, June 2023, during the annual Tiananmen Square vigil.Photograph: Anthony Kwan/Getty ImagesAbout the same time, I buy a train ticket and sneak into Wuhan, which is still under lockdown. I stay a month in the city, interviewing people about their experiences during the lockdown, then hide in a hotel in the mountains of south-western China, where I spend several months writing Deadly Quiet City: Stories from Wuhan. When the book is about to be published, I carry a single suitcase to make it look like I’m taking a short trip. I tremble with fear as I am leaving China. Until the moment I clear customs, I’m uncertain whether the government will permit this “sensitive element” to leave China. Once on the plane, just like Liu one year earlier, I realise that I may never be able to return to my country again.By this time, Peng is suspended from his job and under investigation. This means his government career is over. According to official reports, he has taken bribes totalling 54,640,000 yuan (£5.6m). People in China know that bribery is not his only crime, and perhaps not his most serious. When high officials like Peng are punished, it is because they have sided with the wrong political faction or shown insufficient political loyalty. Despite his constant studying, publicising and implementation of the spirit of President Xi, it appears that Xi still felt Peng was insufficiently loyal.Meanwhile, Liu is enjoying his American life. The day they arrive in Los Angeles, his family eats at In-N-Out Burger. He likes it so much that he will make a tradition of going to this restaurant every year on this date to buy a few burgers, a big bag of fries and cups of soda. Every time, they raise their cups to commemorate their free lives.One day, Liu sends me a direct message on X. He is excessively polite. He writes: “Mr Murong, please forgive me for presumptuously disturbing you,” before asking whether I remember the email sent via Yu Dayou with the two screenshots. My heart is pounding. I say: “Yes, I remember that. I wondered who sent that email. I am most grateful.”We have a long phone call like long-lost friends. We describe everything we have done since leaving China. He says: “I wish to testify that although I was a Weibo censor, I am not a bad person.”I reply: “I will speak on your behalf.”Many publications report on Liu. He is praised for being like the secret agent in the film The Lives of Others,or a North Korean refugee. He eagerly takes a job atChina Digital Times,where he works on editing the censorship files he collected. They are published one by one, making them freely available to anyone who wants to read them to gain insight into just how evil is the system in which he once worked. “I used to be a censor, but now I’m engaged in anti-censorship work,” Liu tells me. “It really is like a dream.”Liu and I agree to get together one day in the future, either in Australia or the US. We will toast to our freedom and everything he did in that nameless era.The great firewall of China: Xi Jinping’s internet shutdownRead moreIn my homeland, high-security prisons hold many of my friends: lawyers, journalists, priests – whose suffering is interminable. Now Peng joins their ranks. In November 2022, he makes his final public appearance on TV at his trial. He wears a navy-blue Mao suit and thick, black-framed glasses as he stands impassively in the dock. Official reports say he has committed many crimes, including a “collapse of ideals and beliefs”, “disloyalty to the party”, “engaging in superstitious practices”, “violations of the rules against attending private clubs”, as well as accepting bribes for a total amount that includes the inauspicious number “64”. He is sentenced to 14 years in jail. Peng declares to the court that he accepts the verdict and will not appeal.State TV devotes barely two minutes to reporting Peng’s case. There are many closeups of this 64-year-old former high official, former professor and former “foot soldier in the line of fire” framed between two towering police officers, making him appear weak and in his dotage. His remaining hair is completely white.* Some names have been changed.A longer version of this piece was first published inMade in China Journal.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readChinaCensorshipHuman rightsTiananmen Square protests 1989Hong KongXi JinpingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Although the open moorland looks wild, we are standing on some of the UK’s oldest farmland. These ridges, called reaves, are the ghosts of farming’s most wildlife-rich legacy: hedges.“These reaves sadly have no function today other than to delight us. Or some of us,” says ecologist Rob Wolton. But Dartmoor’s reaves are the skeletons upon which more recent hedges were built: hundreds of thousands of miles of them. After Ireland, theUK is believed to bethe most hedge-dense country in the world, and Wolton says the majority of them are more than 280 years old.Recent laser scanningshows England has enough hedges to wrap around the world almost 10 times. They are, by far, the country’sbiggest nature reserve, which is why community groups, farmers and charities are rallying together to plant hedges of the future that will offer the same support to wildlife as the ancient hedges of the past.“Wouldn’t you like to do something that you knew might be there in a thousand years?” says Jon Stokes, the director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council and chair of Hedgelink, who describes planting a hedge as “one of life’s great joyful things”.Hedgelink is a partnership of more than 30 organisations planting and restoring the next generation of ancient hedges.View image in fullscreenWolton says most of England’s hedges are hundreds of years old.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianAfter the second world war many hedges were ripped out, withapproximately halflost between the 1940s and 1990s due to agricultural intensification and development. “Since 1990 we seemed to have turned the tide,” says Stokes.Recent figures suggestthe net length of hedges is stable, and possibly increasing.Nature’s ghosts: how reviving medieval farming offers wildlife an unexpected havenRead moreUp and down the country people are coming together to plant hedges. Thirty volunteers can plant 300 metres of species-rich hedge in a day. “You can see what you’ve done and you can see what’s ahead of you, and it’s a beautiful, finite task,” says Stokes.Looking closely at a single hedge, you can see why they are so valuable to nature. Bearded lichens, mosses, liverworts and hairy caterpillars have made themselves at home in one thick, earth-filled stone wall in Dartmoor: an old reave that has been built on over time. Scrubs and trees grow out of the top, where a chiffchaff is singing. Tussocky grass on either side is a habitat for voles, mice and shrews. “Ancient hedges have ancient things,” says Wolton.About70% ofthe UK is farmed, and for wildlife within that landscape, a well-kept, bushy hedgerow is like checking in to the Ritz hotel. They are wildlife superhighways, providing shelter for birds to nest, protection for burrowing mammals and a larder of berries over winter. More than 500 plant species, 60 species of nesting bird and almost all native small mammals are supported by hedgerows,according tothe People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES).View image in fullscreenThe nation’s hedgerows are ‘as variable as the British weather,’ says Wolton.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“We still have a richness of hedges that is the envy of our European neighbours,” says Wolton, who says they are “as variable as the British weather”.Stokes says there is “never a lack of appetite to plant hedges” but it is limited by available funding, which comes from a mix of local councils, government, charities and private sources. It costs £20 to £25 to plant one metre of hedge, he says. “The opportunity to plant hedges across the country is vast,” because they can fit in edges of land, along roads or in the bottom of gardens.View image in fullscreenLaying hedges involves partially cutting shrubs and trees and weaving them together.Photograph: Megan Gimber/PTESFor most of the 20th century, there was little appreciation for the age and value of hedges. It was not until 1997 that hedges in England and Wales were given legal protection, thanks to the introduction ofhedgerows regulations. The governmenthas pledgedto create or restore 45,000 miles of hedgerow in England by 2050 in view of their contribution to nature andcarbon sequestration.The loss of hedges is having an impact on wildlife. Turtle doves like overgrown hedges of at least 4.5 metres tall, and between 1970 and 2018 their populationfell by 98%, a decline that has beenlinked to loss of hedges. Dormice are also unwilling to move across gaps in hedges, and theirpopulation crashedby 72% between 1993 and 2014.Existing hedges are poorly cared for – either cut too severely and frequently, or not managed enough. Only about half of the hedgerows in England are in good condition,research estimates.Rejuvenating a hedge means “laying” it, which involves partially cutting and bending live shrubs and trees near the stem and weaving them together. Few people now have the time or skills to lay hedges, which needs to be done every 25 to 40 years. “No hedgerow looks 1,000 years old. That ancientness is hidden,” says Megan Gimber, a key habitats officer at PTES, who advises farmers on how to manage hedges. “Hedge laying is essentially the key to their immortality. They die unless we lay them,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe skills required to lay hedges are being lost as the number of people engaged in the practice reduces.Photograph: Megan Gimber/PTESGenerations of farmers have moulded generations of hedges, but these skills are being lost. “Hedges are one of the best bits of wildlife on a farm. And hedges rely on farmers: without the blood, sweat and tears that goes into rejuvenating a hedge, they would slowly turn into a line of trees,” says Gimber.Back on Dartmoor, Wolton points out hedges built in different millennia, layers of farmland built on one another, as man moved from the bronze age into the medieval period, into the modern age. Each are fingerprints of the past. A new generation of hedges is being planted by today’s farmers. “You can see places where hedges have been removed and people are planting new hedges and restoring history,” says Wolton.We have inherited a landscape full of ancient hedges and now we are contributing to that legacy, Gimber says. “I love the idea that we are on this brink of this really ambitious target to plant or restore 45,000 miles of hedging, and we get to be the architects of that,” she says. “We get to make a lasting impact on the landscape.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage.Explore more on these topicsConservationThe age of extinctionWildlifeAnimalsPlantsFarmingBiodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amy Hawkins reportsAfter a fortnight in which Donald Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs evolved into an escalating trade war withChina, a sense of defiant nationalism has been building in the east Asian country. The Chinese foreign ministry has even been sharing historic video clips from the former leader Mao Zedong:“As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones to decide … We’ll fight until we completely triumph!”Speaking from Beijing, the Guardian’s China correspondent,Amy Hawkins, tellsHelenPiddthat while politically there is little appetite for backing down, the Chinese economy is not as strong as it once was, with caution that set in during the pandemic holding back its previous dynamism.Hawkins explains that though the Chinese government has been diversifying its trade partners since the US president’s first term and is increasingly seeking to boost domestic consumption of the goods it manufactures, a global recession – which may emerge from a trade war – is something that many in China are worried about, including traders at Yiwu, the world’s largest wholesale market.The pair also discuss how trade has been the linchpin of US-China relations for decades, and that without it, the risk of wider conflict is much greater.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Alex Plavevski/EPAExplore more on these topicsChinaToday in FocusTrump tariffsTrump administrationXi JinpingInternational tradeGlobal economyAsia Pacific"

Sudan wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.Responding for the UAE, Reem Ketait, a top foreign ministry official, told the court: “The idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth. This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.” Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”, she said.The case could turn on a “reservation” that the UAE entered when it signed up to the genocide convention in 2005, to the effect that it would not allow a dispute concerning its compliance with the convention to be settled by the ICJ. The UAE says the reservation precludes the ICJ from even forming a preliminary view as to whether the UAE is complicit in acts of genocide.It would be a severe blow to the UAE, which places great store by its international reputation, if the ICJ did anything but strike the claim from the list. But at a minimum the case’s existence may serve to put further pressure on all the external partners accused of backing the warring factions to think more carefully about the support they provide.Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between the military and the RSF broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both sides have been accused of abuses in the course of the war.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Sudanese army walk past a destroyed military vehicle and bombed buildings in Khartoum.Photograph: El Tayeb Siddig/ReutersThe UK and other western countries have limited power to stop the fighting. More influence rests with regional powers such as Egypt, which has longstanding ties to the Sudanese army, and the UAE, which has long been accused of arming the RSF – allegations it denies.On Tuesday a British-led attempt to establish a contact group to facilitate a ceasefire fell apartwhen Arab states refused to sign a joint communiqueafter a conference in London.Analysts say UAE’s interest in Sudan stems from overlapping desires to gain political influence there at the expense of Saudi Arabia, exploit its natural resources, and prevent the spread of political Islam, which UAE sees as a threat to its security.As with many claims for measures to prevent a plausible genocide, the case, which relates specifically to the RSF’s treatment of the Masalit people in Darfur, is being heard at speed. The Sudanese government only filed its application on 5 March.Prof Eirik Bjorge, a law professor representing Sudan, told the court: “There can be no doubt that the Masalit people is currently being subjected to genocide, and that there is serious evidence that the UAE is failing to prevent this and is complicit.”Bjorge quoted a panel of UN experts who in January 2024 assessed as “credible” allegations that cargo planes coming from the UAE to an airport in eastern Chad were transporting weapons to the RSF. He also referenced Sudanese intelligence assessments that a field hospital built by the UAE next to the airport in September 2024 was “the primary supply and support hub for the enemy [RSF]” and that Chadian flights transporting military aid were continuing as of March of this year.Sudan’s lawyers pointed out in court that the Biden administration had announced in January that seven RSF-owned companies in the UAE had been targeted for sanctions, at the same time as the US declared that RSF rebels had committed genocide.The UAE told the ICJ that none of the seven entities held an active business licence in the UAE, “nor are they currently operating in the UAE”.Sudan also cited research by Yale Humanitarian Research Lab that identified and located four heavy artillery pieces consistent with a type of Chinese-produced 155mm howitzer artillery gun, which it considered were engaged in the 12-day bombardment ofZamzam campin December last year. The Yale lab said the UAE was “the only country” known to have bought this type of howitzer.The UAE’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Ameirah AlHefeiti, told the court the UAE had not provided arms to either of the warring parties. Ketait said the UAE regarded the war as an entirely avoidable factional struggle and accused the Sudanese government of avoiding all UAE-backed efforts at mediation.Alison Macdonald KC, for the UAE, said the evidence produced of UAE supply of arms was thin, recycled or entirely self-serving. She added that the next UN panel of experts report, due to be published soon, would provide “absolutely no support for the applicant’s claims” – an assertion that is likely to turn on whether the panel of experts was able to establish the content of cargo shipped from the UAE to Chad.Explore more on these topicsSudanUnited Arab EmiratesInternational court of justiceMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Chronic inflammation is a key driver of many non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including rheumatoidarthritis and Alzheimer’s disease.The new study set out to establish whether diet played a role. For a fortnight, 77 young men in their 20s and 30s were switched from heritage to western-style diets, or the reverse – with blood samples taken at the start and end, and again four weeks later.Meals on the heritage dietmenuincluded green plantain mixed with kidney beans, boiled chicken served with green vegetables and brown rice and beans. On the western-style menu, they included pizza, fried chicken and french fries and spaghetti served with beef stew.Those newly adopting a western-style diet saw inflammatory markers in their blood increase and tests suggested their immune systems did not respond as well to infections. They also gained weight. By contrast, switching from a western diet to a heritage diet had a largely anti-inflammatory effect, and blood markers linked to metabolic problems fell.In a third arm of the trial, participants following a western-style diet were asked to drink the local fermented banana beverage, known asmbege, for one week. That group also saw improvements in markers of inflammation.For Dr Godfrey Temba, the first author of the paper and a lecturer at KCMC University in Moshi, Tanzania, the findings were not a surprise. “When we are in most of the villages, talking to elderly people [of] 80 or 90 years, they are very healthy. They don’t have any health complications [and] they tell you about consuming this type of diet and this beverage since they were 25.”Snack attack: how the west exported unhealthy eating to Africa and AsiaRead moreHowever, the diet and its benefits have not been explored and documented – unlike the traditional diets of the Mediterranean and Nordic countries, which arepromoted by the World Health Organizationfor their beneficial effects.Temba said: “We think this is the right time … so that [African heritage diets] can be also included in the global guidelines of diets, because they really have a health benefit – but because it’s not studied extensively, it’s not easy to convince [people] that they are healthy, because you don’t have enough data.”The diet’s components, such as flavonoids and other polyphenols, and its impact on the gut microbiome were likely to play a part in the observed effects, De Mast said.The study was conducted only in men for logistical reasons, but the researchers said they would expect similar findings in women, and for benefits to be maintained over time if people continued the diets.Many African countries are facing rising rates of NCDs such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease.View image in fullscreenThe Tanzanian food eaten on the trial included dishes such as green plantain with kidney beans and boiled chicken served with green vegetables.Photograph: Miguel Serrano Ruiz/Getty ImagesDe Mast, who holds positions at KCMC University and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said research priorities in Africa had historically been determined by countries in the global north with a focus on infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. “Research on [things like] immunology has been neglected. I hope it will change now, with the rapid rise in NCDs, because that will be a major challenge for health systems across Africa.”Nutritional guidelines also tended to “translate what we know from the north to Africa”, he said. “I think you should have, really, region-specific recommendations based on scientific data.”The team is now testing what impact adopting a heritage diet can have on Tanzanians living with obesity, including whether it can boost their response to vaccines, and plan to compare different regional heritage diets.“There’s so much diversity in dietary patterns across Africa – or [even just] in Tanzania,” said De Mast. “Godfrey is in Kilimanjaro region, but 30km down the road there is the Maasai tribe and their diet is entirely different. It’s mainly animal protein based – still, traditionally, cardiovascular disease was almost absent.“So I think this is just the beginning of research looking at these heritage diets.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthTanzaniaAfricaFoodFood scienceDiets and dietingnewsShareReuse this content"

Two passengers were injured, including one who was stabbed in the back.Taylor ordered the pilot to take him out of the country, but was then shot in the chest by another passenger, Belize’s commissioner of police, Chester Williams, told local journalists.After circling erratically over the coastline near Belize City, with depleting fuel, the passengers’ ordeal ended when the plane landed safely at Philip Goldson international airport.Taylor was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and one of the injured passengers was in a critical condition after being stabbed in the back.Details of the incident remained sparse, but Williams said passengers narrowly escaped a more serious tragedy as the aircraft ran out of fuel as it landed.The plane was en route from Corozal to San Pedro when the hijacking took place. After being contacted by passengers onboard, police were deployed to various airports, unsure of where the plane would land. A rescue helicopter was also tracking the aircraft.“We were hoping that we don’t have to move from a search-and-rescue operation to a search-and-recovery operation. The helicopter was to follow the plane to see where it would land. So if they had decided to crash-land the plane in the sea, or on one of the islands, we would have been there quickly to respond and provide assistance to those passengers who might not be able to survive,” he told reporters.The hijacker’s motives are unclear, but Williams said Taylor had previously been refused entry into Belize, and it was not clear how he was able to get through its borders.Williams said there would be a review of security procedures for domestic flights.A spokesperson for the US embassy told reporters that it was working with Belize to investigate the incident. “We share that commitment with them to make sure that Belize is safe, the airlines are safe, the tourists coming here are safe, borders are safe and secure,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBelizeAir transportUS crimeCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Mendez was in the process of applying for what is called derivative asylum, where you can be granted asylum if a family member already has it.The woman said she was scared when Ice broke into their car and never expected someone from her family would be detained like this.“We came here to do honest work. To fight for our family,” Ortiz said through an interpreter. “What they did, or what they’re doing right now, no, it’s not fair. We don’t deserve that treatment.”Ortiz said she was worried about the toll the detention was taking, especially on her son. “He has already stopped eating because of what we’re going through,” she said. “I just hope that they release my husband so he can come back with us and that my son can be with him as well.”New Bedford’s mayor, Jon Mitchell, in a post on X, said the incident “raises questions that require clear answers”, including why local police weren’t alerted beforehand.He also questioned whether Ice agents are targeting criminals as the Trump administration promised or, rather, “engaging in an indiscriminate round-up of individuals with uncertain immigration status”.Galvez-Sniffin said Mendez had been in the country for four years and worked in the seafood industry in New Bedford, that he had no criminal record was applying for asylum. He was fingerprinted in December, she said, adding that nothing turned up in terms of a criminal record.“There really was no reason to treat him the way that he and his wife were treated.” Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that agents refused to look at the paperwork showing that he had applied for asylum.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationMassachusettsGuatemalaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite a supreme court ruling saying his administration must “facilitate” Ábrego García’s return, Trump has refused to take steps to do so, and El Salvador’s government on Wednesdaydenied Van Hollen a meetingwith the deportee.Ábrego García’s case has become a rallying cry for Democrats, who argue it is a sign ofDonald Trump’s reckless approach to immigration enforcement and willingness to defy court orders. An immigration judge in 2019 had given Ábrego García protection from deportation, finding that he may face retaliation if he returns to El Salvador.Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’Read moreBooker wrote on X earlier this week: “The Supreme Court was clear: theTrump administrationmust act to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García to the United States. There is no room for debate – yet Trump is refusing, in defiance of a lawful court order.“Every member of Congress should be standing up for the Constitution and demanding that the administration act to return Mr. Ábrego García to the U.S. and to his family.”Trump administration officials have countered by accusing Democrats of caring more about undocumented immigrants than US citizens. On Monday, the Republican congressman Riley Moore toured El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), where US authorities say Ábrego García is being held, and gave a thumbs up in front of a cell packed with inmates.Several other Democratic lawmakers have signaled they would like to visit El Salvador and Cecot, including Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic caucus, and Robert Garcia, Yassamin Ansari and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, all members of the investigative House oversight committee. Delia Ramirez of the House homeland security committee has also asked for a visit to Cecot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect,” she wrote.“That is not a justification for ICE’s action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation.”TheTrump administrationhas refused to attempt to return Ábrego García to the US after he was mistakenly placed on a deportation flight to El Salvador last month, despite legal rulings ordering his return.The Trump administration claims that Ábrego García is a member of MS-13, a gang the administration has listed as a foreign terrorist organization. Ábrego García, through his attorneys, has denied any affiliation. He has no criminal record in either the US orEl Salvador.A federal judge in Maryland ordered the return of Ábrego García to the US. The supreme court upheld the ruling last week. But Stephen Miller, Trump’s immigration adviser, has claimed that the supreme court actually ruled the other way, interpreting the ruling as saying the administration did not have to try to bring him back.El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, claimed on Monday that he has no power to return Ábrego García to the US. El Salvador has been paid $6m to accept deportations from the US to its mega-prison, theTerrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), which is notorious for its reportedhuman rights abuses.The Trump administration released documents on Wednesday that purported to support its claim that Ábrego García was a member of MS-13 – specifically a police report from Maryland in 2019 in which Prince George’s county police described approaching Ábrego García and three other people at a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville.The report said Ábrego García was wearing “a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents” on the bills, claiming that this was “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture”.Police handed Ábrego García over to immigration authorities, but an immigration judge then barred him from being sent to El Salvador,reportedly sayingÁbrego García had proved a “well-founded fear of future persecution” from local gangs there, allowing him to the stay in the US and receive a work permit.Earlier this year, however, Ábrego García was apprehended in an Ikea parking lot and on 15 March he was deported to El Salvador, where he is currently being held at the mega-prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maryland is safer because he is gone. And that woman that he is married to and that child he had with her?

Granted, there is acknowledgment of the original injustice and the need to build a better relationship between our two people – but nothing more.“In the same way, France has recognised slavery as a crime against humanity, yet refuses to make reparations for that crime. The struggle for the restitution of the triple ransom of independence must therefore continue and intensify.”Once France’s most important colony in the Caribbean, Haiti receivedhundreds of thousands of Africanswho had been kidnapped, forcibly transported across the Atlantic and sold into slavery.Battered statue bears witness to Haiti’s tragedy, resilience and flickering hopeRead moreAfter a bloody struggle between self-liberated slaves and French, Spanish and British forces, it became the firstCaribbeannation to gain its independence from colonial rule in 1804.But, under threat of military action, France later demanded what the HNCRR member Jean Mozart Feron described as an unjust and exorbitant ransom, supposedly to provide compensation for former enslavers.The enormous payments, Feron said, crippled the fledgling nation. “This ransom plunged Haiti into a spiral of economic dependency from which it has never fully recovered and … strangled the young nation, stifling its development and diverting precious resources that could have been invested in education and infrastructure,” he said.The debt not only created deep structural poverty, social inequality and weak institutions, but also affected “the way Haiti is perceived and treated on the international stage without due consideration for this history of economic exploitation”, he said.Monique Clesca, spokesperson for theKolektif Ayisyen Afwodesandan, a civil society organisation that has been campaigning for reparations for Haiti, said the “monstrous debt” created by the ransom prevented the country from “moving forward at the rhythm that we should have been moving forward”.“Politically this meant that we almost became a neocolony, totally indebted to France, not only in terms of economics, but symbolically and politically, we were tied. So there are serious repercussions and consequences to this continuous debt that you can’t undo,” she said.The campaigners are calling for France to repay the ransom and offer restitution for the harm caused by slavery and colonisation.The HNCRR is working in alignment with the Caribbean Community (Caricom), which has a10-point planfor reparatory justice.Speaking at the opening of the UN’s Permanent Forum on People of African Descent on Monday, the Caricom secretary general, Dr Carla Barnett,joined the calls for reparations for Haiti.“The negative economic and social effects of this historical injustice are painfully clear, with arguable links to the situation in Haiti today. This anniversary presents an opportunity to bring global attention and a deeper understanding of the situation in Haiti and serves as a call to action to address the ongoing security, humanitarian and governance crises in the country,” she said.Macron said France was ready to confront its past and accept “its share of truth in the creation of memory, a painful one, for Haiti, which began in 1825”. He added: “Today, on this bicentennial, we must, here as elsewhere, face this history squarely … Haiti was born of a revolution, faithful to the spirit of 1789, which brilliantly affirmed the universal principles of liberty, equality and fraternity.“This struggle in Haiti, in harmony with the ideals of the French Revolution, should have offered France and Haiti the opportunity to walk a common path. But the forces of the counterrevolution since 1814, the restoration of the Bourbons and the monarchy, decided otherwise regarding the writing of history,” he said.Haitians fear the imminent fall of Port-au-Prince to rebel gangs: ‘We will die standing’Read moreAppealing for global support for Haiti’s reparations claim, Feron said: “Haitian citizens do not hold French people responsible for the decision made in 1825 by the French state. However, we believe that the French people have a moral responsibility and a duty to stand in solidarity with the Haitian people in this initiative.”The HNCRR, he said, was of the view that France and Haiti could reach an agreement about the “types of expertise and technical assistance valued within the framework of restitution”. But Haiti, he added, must ultimately decide how to use the reparations.Haiti has been gripped by crisis since the 2021 assassination of then president Jovenel Moïse, and a subsequent gang insurgency which forced Ariel Henry, who led the country as an unelected prime minister after Moïse’s death, out of office in March 2024. Since then, support from the international community has failed to restore stable, democratic governance and curb the spiralling violence, which haskilled thousandsanddisplaced tens of thousands.Feron dismissed arguments that the current crisis could prevent the country from effectively managing any reparation payments, arguing that the state of the country was a consequence of its history.He added: “Our committee intends to work closely with the civil society to clearly advise the Haitian state on how this money should be used or could be used and how it should be managed with total transparency in a responsible manner.”Explore more on these topicsHaitiFranceSlaveryEuropeCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

At least another 74 were in various stages of construction or planning, the report said. The UHRP said some of the hotels also had exposure or links of concern to forced labour and labour transfer programmes.The explosion in hotel numbers coincides with the Chinese government’s efforts to push Xinjiang as a tourism destination after years of criticism and sanctions over its crackdown on the local Muslim population. In 2024 Xinjiang recorded about 300 million visitors, according to state media, includingalmost 5 million foreign tourists– 50% more than in 2023.Several world governments and legal groups have declared the government’s actions against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to be a genocide, although this has not been settled in any international court.The UN says that China’s policies in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch has said the policies – which include mass internment and re-education, forced labour, and criminalisation of acts of religious expression – amount to crimes against humanity. China’s government denies all accusations of abuse and mistreatment in Xinjiang.Human rights groups have argued that the presence of foreign enterprises in Xinjiang lends legitimacy to the Chinese government’s crackdown, and called on firms to leave. In November, the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen sold its Xinjiang factory after years of pressure.But as Beijing promotes Xinjiang as holiday destination for domestic and international tourists, the spotlight has turned to foreign tourism businesses. In 2023 the Guardian reported on a number oftour operators advertising holiday packages to Xinjiang. Now, hotel companies appear to be increasing their business there.Well known brands, including France’s Accor, Hilton, the British IHG Group, Marriott and Wyndham are among hundreds of existing or developing hotels across the region. The sites listed include luxurious upmarket hotels in city locations as well as ski resort areas, where the Chinese government has heavily invested in winter tourism.The report said three companies – Hilton, IHG, and Wyndham – all had hotels, and potentially paid fees or taxes – in areas administered by China’s state-owned paramilitary entity, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). Sanctions have been passed on the XPCC by several governments, including the US, UK and EU, over “serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities”.Peter Irwin, associate director for research and advocacy at UHRP, said: “This kind of hotel expansion, from international chains in particular, falls squarely within the Chinese government’s own strategy to try and normalise the public’s understanding of what’s going on in the Uyghur region.“The government can point to these major companies entrenching themselves in the region as evidence that everything is normal, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.”One recently opened hotel, by a Hilton franchisee, was built on the site of a mosque in Khotan that was demolished amid a government campaign in which more than 10,000 religious sites were destroyed.“Building a hotel on the site of a demolished mosque is particularly egregious, given that the Chinese government has undertaken a broad campaign to tear down mosques across the Uyghur Region since 2017,” the report said. It said the hotel was not visible on English-language travel booking sites but China’s CTrip showed reviews dating back to about mid-2024.Tuesday’s report assessed government records, corporate records and media articles, to determine whether hotels had other links of concern, including ownership structures with particular Chinese companies and involvement in state programmes identified by human rights researchers.In another case study, the report identified links between Accor’s Grand Mercure Urumqi Hualing hotel anda training and employment programme. A state mediareportfrom one symposium said a human resources director from the hotel had visited and signed letters of intent with many students.The symposium was targeted at young people and “surplus rural labour” workers from ethnic minorities, as part of the government’s poverty alleviation and “social stability” goals. The government says its Xinjiang employment schemes are part of “poverty alleviation” efforts but has been accused of forced labour and labour transfer programmes that breach human rights.The report also said Accor’s strategic partner in China, H World Group Limited, had used a recruitment and training programme, Xinjiang Aid, which a US congressional investigation found contributed to the risk of human trafficking. In 2020 four US agencieswarnedthe programme may make use of internment camp labour or workers from “abusive labour programmes”.“These hotels continue to operate and expand business in a region in which Uyghur families have been torn apart by internment, imprisonment, forced labor programmes, and enforced disappearances,” said Dr Henryk Szadziewski, co-author of the report and director of research at the UHRP.The report called for the hotel chains to initiate “immediate reviews” of their operations, given they had all made pledges to adopt international human rights standards. It urged them to freeze expansion plans, halt operations and sever business ties.“They should publicly disclose their decision to exit, conduct heightened human rights due diligence, and engage with Uyghur rights organisations for remediation,” the report said.The Guardian contacted Accor, Hilton, IHG, Marriott, and Wyndham for comment. A spokeswoman for Accor said the company and its partners “adhere to our group [corporate social responsibility] Charter, which includes standards for how employees are treated. We are dedicated to ensuring that our operations align with these standards.”The spokeswoman said other elements put to them, including the claims about employment programs, were “not accurate”, but did not elaborate.The other companies have not responded.Timothy Grose a professor of China studies with expertise in ethnic policy at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, said investing in the region’s tourism was not a bad thing in principle.“In fact, the investments could bring great benefits to local economies,” he said. “However, if recent history repeats itself, the construction of new hotels, which may attract thousands of tourists, will unlikely translate into improvements in the lives of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other minoritised groups.”“Perhaps most immediately, shiny hotels and droves of tourists attempt to paint the picture that human rights abuses certainly cannot be occurring in such a ‘happy’ and ‘thriving’ place. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to have achieved some degree of success.”Explore more on these topicsXinjiangChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsHotelsHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It added the hashtag #OpportunityChina, which it has previously used in posts promoting US-China exports.The visit caps a tumultuous week forNvidia. The US restrictions, announced on Tuesday, apply to shipments of its H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips, which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions on sales to China.The US government, which is battling China in the race for AI supremacy, told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”.The company has said the new controlswill cost it $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in earnings. Shares of the company slumped about 7% on Wednesday.US restrictions on tech supplies to China, as well as extensive tariffs on foreign imports, have put enormous pressure on the tech industry, and Nvidia’s stock is among many in the sector to have fallen steeply in recent weeks. Trump has threatened separate tariffs on the global semiconductor industry, in an effort to bring manufacturing bases on to US soil.The fresh Nvidia chip restrictions came a day after the semiconductor company saidit would build up to $500bn worth of AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Nvidia designs its chips but outsources its production to contractors such asTaiwanSemiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has also pledged massive investment projects in the US, which Trump said would exempt it from the tariffs. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump effect in action”.The Financial Timesreportedthat Huang also met the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, in Beijing, to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans. In January the shock emergence of DeepSeek, an AI chatbot seemingly much more advanced than existing rivals but developed for far less investment, sent the tech industry into a tailspin, and a global sell-off of shares.The US House of Representatives’ China committee has written to Nvidia asking it to explain whetherDeepSeekobtained export-controlled chips to power its artificial intelligence app and, if so, how. It has said the app poses a “profound threat” to national security.Huang has said publicly that Nvidia will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump but has promised that nothing will stop the global advance of AI. “We’ll continue to do that and we’ll be able to do that just fine,” the Taiwan-born entrepreneur told reporters last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After announcing a range of tariffs against different countries, which he accused of “ripping off” the US by having a trade surplus, Trump later drew them all back to 10% (except China, which he kept at 145%) for a 90-day pause. He claimed governments were begging to negotiate with the US to rewrite trade agreements.On Thursday he posted on social media that there had been “big progress” in talks with Japan the previous day. Japan had not expected the US president to get involved in Wednesday’s talks, viewing them as a preliminary, fact-finding mission, a sign that Trump wants to keep tight control over negotiations with dozens of countries expected over the coming days and weeks.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, warned that the talks “won’t be easy”, but he said the president had “expressed his desire to give the negotiations … the highest priority”.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaTechnology sectorInternational tradeTrump tariffsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeeknewsShareReuse this content"

But in Indonesia, it was thefrenzy whipped up in Australia’s tight election campaignthat came as the real surprise.Foreign policy and defence experts are highly sceptical about the prospect that Jakarta would ever acquiesce to such a Russian request, and besides, it is hardly new. Moscow has sought permanent basing rights for its planes at Indonesia’s Biak airfield in Papua for almost half a century – and not once has it won approval.No foreign power has a military base in Indonesia, or permanent access to any of its domestic bases. Indonesia has enshrined in its constitution a commitment to a “free and independent” foreign policy, which is premised on non-alignment.“The probability [of accepting a Russian request] is low or nearly zero,” said Rahman Yaacob, a defence expert at Australia’s Lowy Institute. “The main reason is because of Indonesia’s domestic foreign policy, it’s basically non-aligned.”Gatra Priyandita, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), agreed, saying: “It goes against the principle of basically providing no military bases to any overseas external powers.”Indonesia dismisses report Russia seeking to base aircraft in country as ‘simply not true’, Australia saysRead moreBut the prospect is tantalising. Indonesia is a vast archipelago that stretches across South-east Asia. The Papua region is an entry point into the Pacific, and the Biak airbase is just 1,300km from Darwin in northern Australia, where the US has a military base.Russia has continued this week with economic overtures. Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subianto welcomed Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Denis Manturov, to Jakarta to discuss free trade and mark 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.Matthew Sussex, a visiting fellow at the Australia National University, said President Vladimir Putin has aspirations for Russia to become a “Euro-Pacific power”.“From the Russian perspective, they would have a strategic toehold in South-east Asia, which would allow it to conduct intelligence gathering, mainly against the United States in terms of Guam,” he said. “But also extending down towards increasingly important US bases in the Northern Territory and then potentially out west into the Indian Ocean.”Biak is also close to the Philippines, a close US ally in the region.Another possible reason for Russia’s interest in Biak is that it is close to the equator, which lends itself to space operations. Indonesia has plans to build a satellite launch site there, and Russia has been trying to negotiate with Indonesia to be involved, said Lowy’s Yaacob. Its airfield is quite rudimentary, so experts say it could make more sense as a site to launch low-Earth orbit satellites and high-altitude, long endurance drones.“But the negotiation has been slow. I understand Indonesia is trying to say no, but this is their way of saying no, to drag the negotiation on,” he said, referring to Indonesia’s cultural tendency to avoid direct rejection.The Trump factorIt’s also a matter of timing. As Donald Trump’s administration throws the post-war world order into question, the time is ripe for Russia to grow closer to its Indonesian partners and South-east Asia as a whole.Indonesia and Russia held their first joint naval drills last year, while President Prabowo Subianto visited Moscow last October. This February, Sergei Shoigu, secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, visited Jakarta to discuss deepening defence ties.Indonesia also recently joined the Brics grouping, of which Russia is a founding member. Russian-Indonesian trade has grown by 80% in the past five years,the Russian government reports, reaching $4.3bn in 2024.But the world’s fourth-most populous nation and South-east Asia’s largest economy, is a far cry from becoming the next client state, for Russia, or any other nationAt best, some say Russia might weasel out a concession, as it did in 2017, when it was granted access to Biak for about five days. (It had at the time also sought permanent access but that request was denied).But under pressure domestically, due to an ailing economy and controversial new military law, it would be an inopportune time for Prabowo to pull such an extraordinary move.On the unlikely chance Prabowo granted Russia its request, it would be an unprecedented divergence.Still, Russia’s opportunistic move raises questions about why exactly Putin is pitching for Biak now.“I think it was an attempt to say, ‘Well, ‘let’s see how far Jakarta will go,’” said Sussex, adding that with the US in retreat: “When there’s a vacuum, it gets filled.”Indonesia, of course, is not the only place into which Russia is seeking inroads.Between 2004 and 2023 Russia was the largest arms supplier in terms of value in South-east Asia,with 25% of a $42bn market, although that share has since dropped. But as Russia runs a wartime economy, it may be looking for new markets if the war in Ukraine ends.“Those [weapons] factories will not be easily switched over to making washing machines,” Sussex said, “so they will be looking to sell arms around the world, and obviously these Asian clients are cashed up and in a region where there’s a lot of tension, so willing buyers.”In war-torn Myanmar, Russia is a key ally and arms supplier. This year, Myanmar’s junta leader travelled to Moscow to deliver a gift of six elephants, which coincided with the delivery of six Russian fighter jets to Myanmar.The two countries also signed an agreement on developing a small-scale nuclear power plant in Myanmar. Russia has successfully locked in other countries to such long-standing partnerships, but it has struggled to replicate that success in South-east Asia.“This is a known play from Russia,” said Sam Cranny-Evans, editor of the UK-based Calibre Defence news and consultancy. “Its power station in Turkey will be operated and owned by Russia for at least a decade, and Rosatom has signed multiple agreements with African nations for similar projects, building close relations and dependencies as it does.”Even if Russia’s bid for Biak comes to nothing, Putin has put the idea in the minds of the US’s traditional regional allies, whose sense of security has already been disrupted.“Putin is often regarded as a master strategist,” said the ANU’s Sussex, “I think his skills are more in tactics, in being opportunistic, and making it look like strategy.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsRussiaIndonesiaAsia PacificEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Scientists have been talking about this for a long time,” he said.Asked on Thursday about his comments the previous night, Dutton said: “I believe in climate change and that’s a reality.“It’s why we’ve adopted our position in relation to net zero by 2050,” he told a press conference in Maitland, in the New South Wales Hunter Valley region.Dutton was not pressed specifically on whether he accepted that climate change was making severe weather events worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here are all the main takeaways from day 21 on the campaign trail:Peter Duttonclarified his stance on climate change after saying “I’m not a scientist” when asked if we are seeing the impacts of climate change during last night’s debate. He told reporters today: “I believe in climate change and that is a reality”.Anthony Albanesesaid he had been “stunned” by the opposition leader’s comments, adding: “I don’t know what it takes to give a wake-up call to the Coalition.”The treasurer,Jim Chalmers, said negative gearing changes were “not something that we are proposing” – and that the government gets “advice from the Treasury on issues that are in the public domain”.This comes after Albanese said during last night’s debate the governmenthad not commissioned modelling on negative gearing.Dutton, however,repeated his claimthat Labor wants to make changes to negative gearing – something it hasruled out. Former MPMalcolm Turnbullalso weighed in and saidnegative gearing is examined by every government.Jacinta Nampijinpa Pricehasdoubled downon her “make Australia great again”comment from last weekendin an opinion piece for the Australian.Bridget McKenzie, who’s yesterday walked backcomments she madeto the ABC on Russia and China, misidentified which Chinese leader called the PM a “handsome boy”on breakfast television this morning.The Coalition announced a $260m plan to establish 12 new technical colleges to get students from years 10 to 12 learning trades, as itattacked fee-free Tafe.Dutton said he wants toend bracket creep by indexing personal income rates– calling this an “aspiration” rather than a firm promise.Australia’s unemployment rateremained at a low 4.1%in March.Thanks for following along today, and enjoy your long weekend.ShareUpdated at03.27 EDT"

Trump this week said that the Ivy League institution should no longer receive federal funds after it rejecteda series of the adminstration’s demands, which the university’s president described as “an attempt to control the Harvard community”.Efforts to slash government spending have also left thousands of employees at major scientific institutions, includingNasa,theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, bracing for layoffs.In response,several European universities, such asAix-Marseille Universityin France andFree University Brussels, have set up initiatives toprovide a havento “the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference”.The Australian program is inviting contributions from funders, which Jagadish said would go towards leading a “national, coordinated effort” to promote the destination to leading US scientists and returning Australians through a “competitive relocation package”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least seven universities have had research programs temporarily suspended, and a dozen universities were sent aquestionnaire from the Trump administrationasking to confirm whether they aligned with US government interests.Explore more on these topicsResearchAustralian universitiesAcademicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A robust and sustainable peace. The question is about phasing,” Macron said as the talks got under way. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, who also attended, said afterwards the talks were “very productive” but gave no details.Ex-UK defence minister ‘disgusted’ by Trump’s attitude to Putin and RussiaRead moreA previously unannounced team of Ukrainian officials including Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and the country’s foreign and defence ministers flew in to meet the US and European delegations.Yermak said: “We exchanged views on the next steps … including the implementation of a full ceasefire, the involvement of a multinational military contingent and development of an effective security architecture for Ukraine.”In Kyiv, Zelenskyy was critical of Witkoff’s message, saying he believed the US envoy had “taken on the strategy of the Russian side”. He added: “I think it is very dangerous, because he is – consciously or unconsciously, I don’t know – spreading Russian narratives.”Rubio wrote on social media that the American delegation in Paris was looking to “secure real, practical solutions to end the Russia-Ukraine war”. He spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday, a spokesperson for the US state department said.“President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” the spokesperson said. “The encouraging reception in Paris to the US framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement.”Earlier on Thursday, Zelenskyy said pressure must be put on Moscow to call a halt to the fighting. “Russia uses every day and night to kill,” he said. “We must put pressure on the killers … to end this war and guarantee a lasting peace.”The Élysée spokesperson said the object of the meetings was “to allow Ukraine to better understand the US proposals”, adding that the fact that Rubio, Witkoff and Kellogg attended “shows they recognise the important role of the Europeans”.Macron spoke to Zelenskyy by phone before the talks, the French president’s office said. He later greeted Witkoff and Rubio before a joint lunch. Before that, his foreign policy adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, and his British and German counterparts met Yermak.Trump has indicated frustration with both Moscow and Kyiv, but European leaders’ concern has mounted as the US president heaps pressure and criticism on Zelenskyy while repeatedly making diplomatic overtures to Vladimir Putin.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio and the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, in talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia last month.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersMoscow said the Paris meeting was a chance for Witkoff to inform European officials of the peace talks’ current status, although the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia so far saw only “a focus on continuing the war” from the Europeans.Russia’s top economic negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, said “certain countries” were trying to derail Moscow’s talks with the US. Macron’s office said the Paris meetings hoped to “review progress on peace talks aimed at ending the Russian aggression in Ukraine”.Kyiv and its EU allies say Moscow is to blame for rejectingTrump’s proposal of a ceasefirelast month. They hope to persuade the US to take a tougher line, particularly after aRussian attack on the city of Sumyon Sunday that killed at least 35 civilians.France, Britain and Germany were taken aback when Trump opened discussions on improving ties directly with Russia, but have sought a coordinated European response on protecting Ukraine during the conflict and in any ceasefire.Britain and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have proposed that a mainly European “reassurance” force should be deployed in Ukraine if a ceasefire starts. However, many European leaders say such a force would need US support.A French diplomatic source had said earlier that Rubio and Jean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister, would discuss “the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and the Iranian nuclear file”. The trip is Rubio’s third to Europe since taking office.Witkoff plans to fly on to Rome after the Paris talks for a second round of discussions on Saturday with the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, about Iran’s nuclear programme. The two met for 45 minutes in Oman on Saturday.Both sides described those talks as positive while acknowledging that any deal was distant. Trump said on Monday he believed Iran was intentionally delaying a nuclear deal and that he was willing to bomb its nuclear facilities if one was not reached.On Tuesday he held a meeting with national security advisers at the White House focused on Iran’s nuclear programme, according to sources familiar with the matter.The US president has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February after ditching a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers during his first term and reimposing crippling sanctions.Separately, in Washington, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, discussed efforts toward a “durable peace” in Ukraine with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, the Pentagon said. Hegseth called it an “excellent” meeting.“We discussed the imperative need for Europeans to meet a 5% defence spending commitment to restore deterrence with ready, lethal, conventional forces,” Hegseth said. Lecornu called the discussions “productive”.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEmmanuel MacronVolodymyr ZelenskyyMarco RubioUS foreign policyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

A second cabin was above a precipice on Mount Faito and fog delayed the rescue effort, reports said.The cable car had just reopened for the summer season and prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into the accident.“The cable car reopened 10 days ago with all the required safety conditions,” said Umberto de Gregorio, the head of the cable car company. “What happened today is an unimaginable, unforeseeable tragedy.”The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni expressed “sincere condolences” to the families of the victims, her office said.The cable car has been operating since 1952 and a similar accident in 1960 also left four dead.In 202114 people died when a cable car linking Lake Maggiore with a nearby mountain plunged to the groundin northern Italy. In 1998, a US fighter jet flying at a low level on a training flight cut a steel cable, killing 20 people in a cable car in the Dolomites.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The EU faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars, and broader tariffs on almost all other goods, under Trump’s policy to hit countries he says impose high barriers to US imports.“I am sure we can make a deal and I am here to help with that,” Meloni said before the summit.Trump said that broadly speaking he expected he would make an announcement about trade deals but he was in no rush. “We’re going to have very little problem making a deal with Europe or anybody else, because we have something that everybody wants,” Trump said.Before leaving for Washington, Meloni discussed the summit with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and his successor, Friedrich Merz, also discussed the meeting with Meloni, according to reports in the German edition ofPolitico. Scholz failed to get a meeting with Trump and Merz’s request is reportedly pending.Meloni had previously described Trump’s tariffs on EU goods as “wrong” but she appears to be taking a more cautious approach as she manages a delicate balancing act between her political ideals,which are more in tune with Trump’s,and Italy’s role within the EU.The meeting provoked trepidation among some of Italy’s European allies as well as Meloni’s domestic opposition amid fears their closeness risks jeopardising the bloc’s unified approach to the tariffs and other issues.Enrico Borghi, a politician with the centrist Italia Viva party, told a TV talkshow: “The advice from the opposition is that the prime minister returns home with reopened negotiations between the US and EU that will guarantee a framework of relative tranquility to our economic and productive system, which has been weakened by what is a real trade war.”Italy is the third-largest exporter to the US from the EU. Meloni’s office denied she would seek special tariff exemptions on Italian products. Italy has strong economic ties with the US that go beyond exports, including foreign direct investments.The summit was expected to address Trump’s demand that Nato partners increase military spending to 2% of GDP. Italy is at 1.49%, among the lowest in Europe.It was Meloni’s third visit to the White House, with the two previous occasions taking place during Joe Biden’s administration.She will return to Rome in time to meet on Friday Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, whose blistering attack on Europe at the Munich Security Conference in February she has defended.Vance will also meet Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, during his Easter weekend visit.Explore more on these topicsGiorgia MeloniItalyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The central bank said services inflation, which has proved stubbornly high in recent years, had eased markedly over recent months while wage growth was moderating, and where it remained high, companies were absorbing the extra costs in reduced profits.Trump has imposed an extra 10% tariff on EU goods to the US, with the threat of a further 10% suspended until July. Industry-specific tariffs of 25% already apply on steel, aluminium and cars into the US, and more are threatened on pharmaceuticals and electronics imports.Mark Wall, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the emphasis on a shock from the tariffs “implied an openness to further monetary easing”, assuming the trade shock persisted, and was “borne out in the data”.Most City economists expect a further rate cut in June. Wall said the reductions would continue this year until they reached 1.5%, such was the probable hit to European economic growth from US tariffs.Financial markets expect central banks in all major economies to cut interest rates this year as tariffs hit global trade and slow growth.Investors expect the Bank of England to cut the cost of borrowing by a quarter point when policymakers next meet in May and twice more in 2025.Before the ECB decision, Trumpcontrasted Lagarde’s record with that of the US Federal Reserve,which kept rates on hold at its last meeting in March. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, was “always too late and wrong” and that his “termination cannot come fast enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago, he said it was unclear what the overall impact would be on the economy and whether the bank would need to raise interest rates to tame inflation or cut rates to increase growth, sparkinga large share sell-off on US markets.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it expects much slower global growth – but not a global recession – because of the trade tensions.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said that the latest world economic outlook forecasts will include “notable markdowns, but not recession”.In a speech before the organisation’s spring meetings next week in Washington, she said economic “resilience is being tested again – by the reboot of the global trading system”.She added: “Trade tensions are like a pot that was bubbling for a long time and is now boiling over. To a large extent, what we see is the result of an erosion of trust – trust in the international system, and trust between countries.”Data released by the EU agency Eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone rose 2.2% in March, compared with 2.3% in February. A measure of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as petrol and food, dropped from 2.6% to 2.4% in the same period.The ECB said most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would “settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Central BankInterest ratesEuropean UnionEconomicsEuropeEuroJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

But most cannot afford to buy there because of spiralling prices and widespread shortages, meaning humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80% of the population, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April on Gaza’s markets.“The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023,” OCHA said.Meanwhile, two Hamas officials told AFP Thursday that the group’s discussions on an Israeli truce proposal were nearly complete, with a response expected soon.“These talks are almost complete, and the group will send its response to the mediators once they finish. It’s expected the talks will wrap up soon – possibly even today,” an official said, with another member of the group confirming his account.Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators that would include the release of dozens of hostages.The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, a demand the group rejects.However, a ceasefire agreement still looks distant, as divisions persist between the two sides.Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.Israel’s renewed assault has so far killed at least 1,691 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing the overall toll since the war erupted to 51,065, most of them civilians.Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, also mostly civilians.AFP, AP and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024, Switzerland formally charged him with war crimes.Concerns about Rifaat’s activities, including his record as the head of a feared Syrian paramilitary force known as the Defense Brigades, have been publicly raised in Europe and the US by the media, human rights groups and government officials since the 1980s. He left Syria for Europe in 1984 after a failed coup against his brother.Inquiries by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have established that Mark Bridges, also known as the third Baron Bridges, served as a trustee on at least five trusts holding assets in France and Spain on behalf of Rifaat al-Assad or his relatives between 1999 and 2008.During the same period, Bridges also held one of the most prestigious legal positions in Britain: private legal adviser to the British monarch. He was Queen Elizabeth’s solicitor from 2002 to 2019.The findings raise questions about whether it was appropriate for the monarch’s personal lawyer to take the ethical and reputational risk of working for an individual accused of human rights atrocities, in view of potential embarrassment to the queen had the connection been discovered while she was still alive.There is no suggestion of any regulatory wrongdoing by Bridges, who was knighted for his services to the queen in 2019. His firm, Farrer & Co, said the trusts were established on the advice of another leading law firm, that Bridges’s work for Rifaat al-Assad was in complete compliance with regulatory requirements in effect at the time and that Bridges had been presented with evidence contradicting the allegations made against him.Assad’s luxury property empireThe property empire amassed by Rifaat al-Assad after his arrival in Europe spanned the most luxurious postcodes of Paris, London and the Costa del Sol.His acquisitions, which he claimed were part-funded by cheques worth millions of dollars from the king of Saudi Arabia, included Witanhurst in London’s Highgate – the second-largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace – and a seven-storey mansion near Paris’s Arc de Triomphe.Assad held his property empire through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership. One trust was registered in the Bahamas, whilesome of the purchases used shell companies in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, before transfer to Spanish and later Maltese companies.In 2014, prosecutors in France began investigating whether Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth had in fact been obtained through corruption. Bridges had ceased acting as a trustee for Rifaat in 2008, his lawyers said, but continued to provide “limited and ad-hoc” legal advice until 2015 “in circumstances whereby the regulatory requirements imposed on the firm were met”.Two of the trusts that Bridges had managed were said to own the Spanish portion of Rifaat al-Assad’s real estate empire, including a deluxe villa with swathes of land near Marbella.In 2019, Spanish prosecutors alleged that these same trusts controlled shell companies holding more than 500 properties in Spain worth €695m (£595m). According to the Spanish prosecutors, the offshore setup was designed to “hide the true ownership of the huge amount of real estate properties” and enabled the “laundering [of] dirty money from abroad”, referring to funds allegedly stolen from the Syrian state.In 2020, aFrench court convicted Rifaat al-Assadof tax fraud and laundering embezzled public money – primarily about $200m (£151m) stolen from Syrian state funds and $100m in fraudulent loan agreements from Libya. Assad was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. He fled to Syria in 2021 while his conviction was under appeal.Allegations of atrocitiesThough not the only trustee serving Assad, Bridges was by far the most eminent. In addition to his services to the queen, he led the private client team at Farrer, an elite law firm with a reputation forged through serving British royals and aristocrats as far back as 1769.There is no evidence Bridges knew or suspected that Rifaat al-Assad’s money was stolen. Assad claimed his wealth came from benefactors, including the Saudi royal family, and in 2018 the Gibraltar supreme court concluded that it had been reasonable for Rifaat’s trustees to believe this story.The question of Rifaat al-Assad’s status as an alleged war criminal, however, is more complicated.View image in fullscreenRifaat al-Assad in 1984, before he fled from Damascus.Photograph: Philippe Bouchon/EPAIn February 1982, armed militias affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood staged an uprising against the Assad regime in the town of Hama, in western Syria. To suppress the uprising, Syria’s then president, Hafez al-Assad, Rifaat’s brother, dispatched the Syrian army and a paramilitary group called the Defense Brigades.An Amnesty International report published in 1983 found that while “it is difficult to establish for certain what happened”, allegations against Syrian regime forces included “collective execution of 70 people outside the municipal hospital” and “cyanide gas containers … alleged to have been brought into the city, connected by rubber pipes to the entrances of buildings believed to house insurgents, and turned on, killing all the buildings’ occupants”. It is estimated that 10,000 to 40,000 people may have been unlawfully tortured and executed.As head of the paramilitaries, Rifaat al-Assad was believed to have taken a leading role in the carnage. In a 1989 book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, the journalist Thomas Friedman described how, after initial skirmishes, “Rifaat’s tactic shifted from trying to ferret out nests of Muslim Brotherhood men to simply bringing whole neighbourhoods down on their heads and burying the Brotherhood and anyone else in the way.”They ‘didn’t look the type’: how the media was fooled by Bashar and Asma al-Assad | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAllegations of atrocities against Rifaat al-Assad were widely known by the point Bridges began working as a trustee for his offshore wealth in 1999.In 2013, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Rifaat al-Assad’s role in suppressing the Hama uprising. In 2021 it issued an international arrest warrant for Assad, and in 2024 he was formally charged with war crimes. Assad has always denied these charges. His whereabouts is unknown‘Credible information’Farrer said Assad’s trustees, including Bridges, “were provided with credible information, when they were appointed and at different junctures thereafter, which fundamentally contradicted the claims being made in the media about Mr al-Assad”.The firm added that it and Bridges were restricted by a duty of client confidentiality from revealing what this evidence was, or commenting on whether it was appropriate for the queen’s solicitor to also have represented Assad. However, it did share 11 French defamation judgments, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s, that found in Assad’s favour.The majority related to allegations made in various news outlets that Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth was sourced from organised crime. In the case of the two judgments that substantially addressed allegations of human rights abuses, the courts found that the journalists had failed to reflect certain nuances of Amnesty International’s report by glossing over uncertainties about whether the Assad regime directly ordered the atrocity.Public attitudes towards British lawyers acting for foreign politicians with questionable reputations have hardened in recent years.This month, a taskforce of senior lawyers and civil society experts said law firms must request more “credible explanations” from their clients as to the source of their wealth, and that it was unsustainable to disregard reputational risks to the legal profession.“Whether the same decision [to act for Assad] would be made today, in the light of further information now available and, arguably, the more stringent demands of the regulatory environment, is a point on which one might speculate,” Farrer said in its response.Explore more on these topicsLawQueen Elizabeth IIMonarchySolicitorsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pemberton, who was jailed for 32 months, had a long history of eye disease and was informed on several occasions by different clinicians that he should not drive, the inquest heard.He also repeatedly failed to declare his sight deficit on licence applications to the DVLA.Ferguson died when she was struck by a van driven by Vernon Law, 72, in Whitworth, Rochdale, on 11 July 2023. A month before the incident, Law was told he had cataracts in both eyes but he lied to an optometrist that he did not drive.Law, who was jailed for four years, knew he had problems with his eyes for years before the collision and also failed to declare his sight issues on licence applications to the DVLA, the inquest at County Hall heard.Adeley said: “The four fatalities shared the same feature that the driver’s sight was well below the standard required to drive a car.“The current system for ‘ensuring’ drivers meet the visual legal standards is ineffective, unsafe and unfit to meet the needs of society as evidenced by the deaths of Marie Cunningham, Grace Foulds, Anne Ferguson and Peter Westwell where the DVLA continued to provide licences to drivers who had failed to meet the legal sight requirements.”The Department forTransportsaid it would consider the coroner’s report once received.A spokesperson added: “The NHS recommends adults should have their eyes tested every two years and drivers are legally required to inform the DVLA if they have a condition which affects their eyesight.“We are committed to improving road safety and continue to explore ways to achieve this.”Explore more on these topicsTransportDVLATransport policyNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Under Wednesday’s ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act 2010, this would be scrapped.Senior NHS legal officials and estates and facilities managers are racing to draw up proposals for how hospitals, community care centres and GP practices should reflect the ruling, sources told the Guardian.The ruling poses a challenge for the NHS, which has an estate spanning 25m square metres in England alone, with infrastructure repair bills of more than £14bn. The issue is further complicated by the fact that health policy and spending is devolved in Wales and Scotland.Trans activists accuse UK equalities chief of ‘overreach’ for suggesting bansRead moreKishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity.“There is no confusion as of yesterday, at 10.30 in the morning, and they can start to implement the new legal reasoning and produce their exceptions forthwith, but they have to change it. We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.”Asked if the EHRC would pursue the matter if the NHS did not do so, she replied: “Yes, we will.”An NHS England spokesperson said: “The NHS is currently reviewing guidance on same-sex accommodation and, as part of this process, will consider and take into account all relevant legislation and [Wednesday’s] ruling.”Meanwhile, the BTP, which patrols the railways in Great Britain, announced that male officers would conduct intimate searches of trans women “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”, while trans men would be searched by female officers.Under the force’s previous policy, officers had been told that anyone in custody with a gender recognition certificate would be searched by an officer matching a detainee’s acquired gender.The update comes during a legal battle between gender-critical campaigners and the force over its guidance that allowed transgender officers to strip-search women, so long as the officer held a gender recognition certificate.The rapid change of approach came after Lady Falkner said the EHRC would be issuing updated and legally binding codes of practice on single-sex spaces and services in the wake of the “enormously consequential” court ruling.“We are going to have a new statutory code of practice [meaning] it will be interpreted by courts as the law of the land. We’re hoping we’re going to have that by the summer,” she told Today.She said the judgment meant only biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women’s toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women’s wards in hospitals.Even so, the commission “will not tolerate” discrimination or harassment of trans people, which remains unlawful under the Equality Act, and would support trans women taking out equal pay claims under sex discrimination laws.Falkner said the ruling was “a victory for common sense” but “only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.”The UK government has avoided making any substantial comment on the ruling, but a strong indication of Labour’s approach came from Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, who swung the party behind the supreme court and the EHRC’s stance.Previously a supporter of self-identification for trans people, Sarwar said there was now a need for an “urgent” update of Scotland’s policies on single-sex spaces. Scottish ministers are expected to update Holyrood next week on their response to the ruling.“I’ve always said that we should protect single-sex spaces on the basis of all biological sex,” he said during a visit in Falkirk. “There’s a clear ruling now from the supreme court.”How will UK judgment on legal definition of womanhood affect policy?Read moreThe bulk of the reaction from Westminster politicians continued to come from the Conservatives. Speaking during a local elections campaign visit to Cambridgeshire, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said the court decision was a vindication of their views.She said she would support changes to the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act to cement the court’s view. “These laws were written 20 years ago plus when the world was different. A lot of people are trying to change what the law means,” she said.In contrast, there was little sign of how ministers will help institutions navigate the new framework. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, on a visit to Scunthorpe, dodged some questions on the issue, saying only that more advice would come in “due course”.Among the issues that will need to be tackled is provision of toilet facilities for transgender people, given the EHRC said the ruling means they will not be able to use single-sex toilets.A directive introduced by Badenoch when she was equalities minister last year requires new public buildings such as offices and shopping centres to prioritise single-sex toilets, and to provide universal toilets only “where space allows”.That regulation remains in force, meaning public buildings could become increasingly inaccessible for transgender users.Explore more on these topicsNHSTransgenderHospitalsEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Streeting said past attempts at reform had stumbled because of “bad politics”.Talks were scheduled to open on 26 February but were postponed after ministers said that not all parties could make the meeting. The Lib Dems offered to “clear our diaries” to reschedule but said a new date has not yet been proposed.Helen Morgan, the Lib Dems’ health and social care spokesperson, said: “If it’s taking almost two months and counting to schedule a single meeting, I have serious concerns about the focus at the top of government needed to successfully undertake and implement this review.“Ministers’ handling of these cross-party talks smells of a government that has put rescuing social care in the ‘too difficult’ pile.“Their failure to grasp the nettle means that a review that could have been completed within a year is instead taking three, with ministers risking even longer delays because of their failure to get these talks off the ground.“For years under the Conservatives, [social care] was shamefully neglected, with patients bearing the brunt.

They said the issue was not about how to change social care but agreeing what should be done.Care providers have urged rapid reform of adult social care, saying the sector facesserious financial problemsas a result of the introduction of national insurance and minimum wage rises this month, which have added £2.8bn to their costs.Many have said they face “tough decisions” as a result of rising unfunded costs, including handing back unviable care contracts to councils andevicting residents, reducing care quality, laying off staff, reducing their hours or freezing pay.Explore more on these topicsSocial careCare workersLabourLiberal DemocratsHealthOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

It disclosed a position of almost 6m shares, according to Trump Media.Short-selling is a way of betting against a public company. An investor borrows a stock, and then sells it on; should the stock fall, the investor then buys it back and pockets the difference.In a memo to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump Media – which trades under the ticker “DJT”, using Trump’s initials – said the total short interest in the company was 10.7m as of 31 March, according to Nasdaq, where its shares are listed, and had only risen to about 11m as of Wednesday.These factors “especially when combined with the history of suspicious trading surrounding DJT stock … could be indications of the illegal naked short selling of DJT shares”, Trump Media claimed.Qube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Trump Media rallied by about 7% in New York on Thursday. They have fallen by more than a third this year.The firm is currently seeking to branch out beyond its core Truth Social platform, and this week announced investment accounts based on themes, including “Made in America” and “Energy Independence”, which align with the Trump administration’s agenda.On its website, Qube says it combines “data, research, technology and trading expertise” to “solve the most complex challenges”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also has offices in Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai.In that time, Qube has grown quickly to rival some established giants of the industry, reportedly managing about $23bn of assets, which according to industry estimates would put it among the top 1% of hedge funds. It is also considered unusual for its lack of a New York office and collaborative corporate culture.Alongside its short position in Trump Media, Qube has short positions in a range of UK-listed companies, including real estate firms, fashion retailer Boohoo and bowling centre operator Hollywood Bowl Group, according to the latest disclosures with the UK’s City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHedge fundsLondonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In itslatest annual accounts, MBR disclosed that it had entered into an option arrangement with Spurs to buy the lease on one of its retail sites, believed to be the Toby Carvery in Enfield.Spurs have submitted a planning application to build a women’s football training academy on 17 hectares of adjacent land in Whitewebbs Park. It also submitted plans to build an access road from the training ground to the Toby Carvery. The plan for an access road has since been replaced with a scheme for a footpath across the site where the oak, which was up to 500 years old, stood.As part of the planning process, Spurs commissioned the Tree and Woodland Company to produce an arboreal impact assessment on the veteran woodland in the park.In a report submitted to Enfield council last July, the company assessed that the now felled oak was a “fine specimen” that was expected to live for at least another 50 years. It recommended conservation measures for the tree as a high priority.MBR claimed its contractors felled the tree on 3 April for safety reasons after assessing it was dead and diseased. In a letter to Enfield residents on Thursday, its chief executive, Phil Urban, said: “I can only apologise for all the upset that it has caused.”It said: “We are obliged to act on all health and safety issues where expert advice warns us of a direct risk to life or serious injury. We will complete a thorough review and ensure that, in future, exceptional situations are treated differently from the more regular health and safety issues that arise on a day-to-day basis.”Enfield council hasthreatened the company with legal actionand imposed a tree preservation order on the whole Toby Carvery site.The Woodlands Trust, which objected to the training facility plans because of the impact on ancient trees in the area, said Spurs and MBR had more questions to answer.Adam Cormack, the trust’s head of campaigning, said: “There is some uncertainty about whether the ancient Whitewebbs oak that was felled is or is not part of development plans for Tottenham Hotspur FC’s new training facility and we’d like to seek clarification from the club on this.”Cormack welcomed Toby Carvery’s apology but said it did not go far enough. He said: “Toby Carvery must now be fully transparent with their paperwork and work with local authorities as they investigate. Did they know about the Spurs tree survey, which called the oak a ‘fine specimen’ and makes recommendations for its conservation? Did they consider any alternatives to felling, and if not, why not?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I have looked at the structural integrity of the tree and I saw it in December. There was no logic to touching that tree other than wanting an ancient tree out of the way because of some financial interest.”Police closed their investigation on Tuesday after deciding it was a civil matter.MBR decline to comment.A Spurs spokesperson said: “The tree and the decision to fell it has no connection to the club as the tree sits outside of our lease demise for our proposed women’s and girls’ training centre and academy.”The club confirmed it had an option to lease Toby Carvery’s land within Whitewebbs Park but stressed this was just an option. It also claimed it was “ridiculous” to suggest the tree was felled to make the land easier to develop.Explore more on these topicsLondonTrees and forestsConservationTottenham HotspurEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The police said he had been involved with training programs at the police force.Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the shooting, which began around lunchtime just outside the student union, sending students and frightened parents hiding for cover in a bowling alley and a freight elevator inside the building.The suspect “had been in the Leon county sheriff’s office family, engaged in a number of training programs that we have”, McNeil said. “So, it’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons. This event is tragic in more ways than you people in the audience could ever imagine, from a law enforcement perspective.”The suspect’s mother has been with the sheriff’s office for more than 18 years, McNeil said.The officials confirmed that the suspect was currently being treated at a hospital.Ambulances, fire trucks and patrol vehicles from multiple law enforcement agencies had raced toward the campus that sits just west of Florida’s state capital after the university issued a shooter alert at midday, saying police were responding near the student union.“Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding,” the state’s governor,Ron DeSantis, wrote on X.The gunfire was reported at the student union building on the FSU campus and students and faculty were advised to shelter in place as police responded. More than 42,000 students attend classes at the main campus.Videosposted on social mediashow students being evacuated from the scene.By midafternoon the Florida State University campus had been secured, according to the Tallahassee police department. Multiple law enforcement agencies remained on site for the ongoing investigation. The student union and the surrounding area were still considered an active crime scene.Earlier, hundreds of students streamed away from the direction of the student union. Students were glued to their phones, some visibly emotional, while others hugged each other. Dozens gathered near the music school waiting for news.The Tallahassee Memorial hospital confirmed it was treating six patients wounded in the shooting, one in critical condition.Ryan Cedergren, a 21-year-old communications student, said he and about 30 others hid in the bowling alley in the lower level of the student union after seeing students running from a nearby bar.“In that moment, it was survival,” he said.Donald Trump opened his Oval Officemeetingat the White House with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, with comments on the shooting, saying he had been fully briefed.“It’s a horrible thing. It’s horrible that things like this take place,” the US president said.Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old daughter Jaime Guttenberg, who was murdered in the 2018 Parkland high school shooting, said ina post on X: “America is broken.”“As a father, all I ever wanted after the Parkland shooting was to help our children be safe,” he said. “Sadly, because of the many people who refuse to do the right things about reducing gun violence, I am not surprised by what happened today.”Guttenberg also said that many of his daughter’s friends who survived the Parkland shooting are current students at FSU.University police escorted the students out of the union after about 15 minutes of hiding.A junior student, Joshua Sirmans, 20, was in the university’s main library when he said alarms began going off warning of a shooter. Law enforcement officers escorted him and other students out of the library with their hands over their heads, he said.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said in a social media post that the justice department was in touch with FBI agents on the scene. Students and faculty were instructed to seek shelter and await further instructions.“Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures,” the alert said.The Leon county school district, where Tallahassee is located,posted on X: “All LCS schools are back to normal operating procedures.

The MTA has for years attempted to execute its plan to renovate the station in an effort to increase train service in and out of New York and instead found itself mired in controversy owing in part to competing priorities of its various stakeholders. Some of those include the MTA, Amtrak, NJ Transit and Madison Square Garden (the venue which sits atop Penn Station).The DOT claimed in astatementthat this move “will save taxpayers approximately $120m” and that Trump is “also championing a public-private partnership model for Penn Station, harnessing private sector innovation and capital to minimize financial risk to taxpayers”.The statement did not clarify how, exactly, this will save taxpayers money or what the administration’s plans for the renovations include.Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said in a statement: “New York City deserves a Penn Station that reflects America’s greatness and is safe and clean.“The MTA’s history of inefficiency, waste and mismanagement also meant that a new approach is needed. By putting taxpayers first, we’re ensuring every dollar is spent wisely to create a transit hub all Americans can take pride in.”Amtrak’s takeover of the project comes barely a month after its CEO Stephen Gardner stepped down from his position “to ensure that Amtrak continues to enjoy the full faith and confidence of this administration”, according toABC7.Gardner’s resignation took place in the immediate aftermath of remarks from Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk, who said at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media & Telecom conference in March that it was “kind of embarrassing” how other countries have “way better passenger rail than we do” and that “Amtrak is a sad situation”. Musk added that he thought Amtrak should be privatized.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkTrump administrationTransport policynewsShareReuse this content"

The meeting happened in New York at Sharpton’s National Action Network (NAN) headquarters, and also included the NAN national board chair Dr W Franklyn Richardson and the NAN senior adviser Carra Wallace.In January,activists in Minnesotacalled for a boycott of Target following the Minneapolis-based company’s decision to eliminate their DEI initiatives. Though Sharpton, one of the most prominent civil-rights activists in the US,did not directly call for a Target boycott,he supported the efforts of others to boycott, and, prior to the meeting, indicated that he would be open to calling for such an action depending on how the meeting went.Americans haveboycotted various companiesin recent months, following their decisions to walk back DEI efforts. Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and McDonald’s arealso being boycottedover the abandonment of corporate pledges. AMarch pollfound that one in five Americans plan to permanently boycott companies that shifted their policies to align with the Trump administration.Legal Defense Fund exits Meta civil rights advisory group over DEI changesRead moreSharpton called the meeting with Cornell “very constructive and candid”, in a statementposted on his Instagramon Thursday afternoon. No further details have been provided and NAN did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.Following the meeting, Sharpton said that he would inform Rev Dr Jamal Bryant, an Atlanta-based pastor who called for a40-day boycott of Target during Lent, of his “feelings” and that they “will go from there”. Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the activists who originally called for a boycott of Target,told the Minnesota Star Tribune: “It’s unclear to us as Twin Cities organizers why Target CEO Brian Cornell would call for a meeting with the Reverend Al Sharpton given the fact that Sharpton has absolutely zero involvement in the Target boycott.”ThePeople’s Union USA,which called for an economic blackout in February, has continued its calls for a Target boycott, asking consumers to not spend any money at big box stores from 18 April through 20 April.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMinnesotaDEI policiesRaceRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) was poised on Thursday to lower interest rates again, without mentioning that the body has been responding to the chaos caused by Trump’sinitiatives on tariffs.Addressing reporters later in the day, Trump claimed Powell would resign if he asked him to. Powell himself has said that he would not resign if asked to do so by the president.Trump has been pressuring Powell to cutUS interest ratesfor months, even though the central bank is independent of the administration in setting monetary policy and the White House typically does not publicly lobby the Federal Reserve.Fed chair says Trump tariffs could make inflation worse as US stocks slide furtherRead moreThe ECB had been expected to cut interest rates for the seventh time this year in order to prop up economic growth,and thendid sonot long before US markets were due to open. Powell enraged Trump on Wednesday nightby warningthat the president’s sweeping tariffs could raise inflation. That would make the Fed even more hesitant to cut interest rates.Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, in explaining the reasons why it has – unlike the Fed – cut interest rates, said “the economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty” because of Trump’s tariffs, which constitute a negative demand shock.Lagarde was speaking aftercutting the ECB’s main deposit rate by 25 basis pointsto 2.25%.Europe had been preparing another interest rate cut following the global financial turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs push, in which he has gone back and forth on whether, when and how deeply to tax imports from other countries, and on which countries, since he returned to the White House for a second term.Heretreatedsharply earlier this month from his decision to impose tariffs worldwide, pausing most of the charges for 90 days, although most notably not on China, aftermarkets plungedand US government bonds – traditionally seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – had suffered a dramatic sell-off. Wall Street chiefs and other experts also forecast aheightenedlikelihood of recession. Economists polled by Reuters on Thursday put US recession odds at 45%.After insisting for days that he would hold firm on his aggressive trade strategy,unveiledin full on 2 April, which he dubbed “liberation day”, Trumpannouncedon 9 April that all countries that had not retaliated against US tariffs would receive a reprieve – and only face a blanket US tariff of 10% – until July.Powell on Wednesday said theUS economywas well-positioned but added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.”He indicated that the prospect of sweeping tariffs on virtually every trade partner could put the Fed in the unenviable position of having to choose between tackling inflation and unemployment.TheWorld Trade Organization, meanwhile, warned that Trump’s tariffswould sendinternational trade into reverse this year, depressing global economic growth.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the global outlook was also weakening in the face of the Trump tariff onslaught, adding central banks like the Federal Reserve needed to remain agile and credible.“Resilience is being tested again – by the reboot of the global trading system,” she said.Trump also said as part of his Truth Social post at daybreak on Thursday that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough”. He dubbed him, further in the post, “Too Late” and put forward the argument that prices were coming down, from oil toeggs.Trump nominated Powell to become Fed chair during his first term in the White House, in 2018, and Joe Biden renominated him during his term in the White House, in 2022. The US Senate confirms the chair and the US president cannot terminate the head of theFederal Reservebefore the end of their four-year fixed stints. Powell is in place until next spring.The US central bank has held interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% since the start of this year.Trump said in his post: “The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, “Too Late”Jerome Powellof the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete “mess!” Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”The New York Fed president, John Williams, spoke to Fox Business on TV on Thursday and backed up Powell’s wariness on rates.“I don’t see any need to change the setting of the Fed funds rate any time soon … It’s really about collecting information, understanding better what’s happening in the economy during the rest of this year, understanding kind of how the uncertainty plays out,” Williams said.Meanwhile, Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported after Trump’s post that the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, had been cautioning White House officials against any attempt to fire Powell, for which there is no tested mechanism, saying it would risk destabilizing financial markets.And there was a fresh alarm bell sounded on the risk of stagflation, in which high inflation combines with high unemployment amid stagnant economic growth.“A sudden crystallization of the threat to Fed independence would both intensify market stress and shift it in more of a stagflationary direction with a sharp increase in tail risk,” Krishna Guha, vice-chair of an arm of the financial advisory firm Evercore ISI, said in a note.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFederal ReserveJerome PowellUS interest ratesInflationEconomic policyUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

It added the hashtag #OpportunityChina, which it has previously used in posts promoting US-China exports.The visit caps a tumultuous week forNvidia. The US restrictions, announced on Tuesday, apply to shipments of its H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips, which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions on sales to China.The US government, which is battling China in the race for AI supremacy, told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”.The company has said the new controlswill cost it $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in earnings. Shares of the company slumped about 7% on Wednesday.US restrictions on tech supplies to China, as well as extensive tariffs on foreign imports, have put enormous pressure on the tech industry, and Nvidia’s stock is among many in the sector to have fallen steeply in recent weeks. Trump has threatened separate tariffs on the global semiconductor industry, in an effort to bring manufacturing bases on to US soil.The fresh Nvidia chip restrictions came a day after the semiconductor company saidit would build up to $500bn worth of AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Nvidia designs its chips but outsources its production to contractors such asTaiwanSemiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has also pledged massive investment projects in the US, which Trump said would exempt it from the tariffs. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump effect in action”.The Financial Timesreportedthat Huang also met the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, in Beijing, to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans. In January the shock emergence of DeepSeek, an AI chatbot seemingly much more advanced than existing rivals but developed for far less investment, sent the tech industry into a tailspin, and a global sell-off of shares.The US House of Representatives’ China committee has written to Nvidia asking it to explain whetherDeepSeekobtained export-controlled chips to power its artificial intelligence app and, if so, how. It has said the app poses a “profound threat” to national security.Huang has said publicly that Nvidia will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump but has promised that nothing will stop the global advance of AI. “We’ll continue to do that and we’ll be able to do that just fine,” the Taiwan-born entrepreneur told reporters last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s acelebrity figure in Taiwan; on recent visits large crowds of fans greeted him and there was breathless reporting of his itinerary.Trump’s tariffs have sparked chaos in global markets and among governments, including US allies. After announcing a range of tariffs against different countries, which he accused of “ripping off” the US by having a trade surplus, Trump later drew them all back to 10% (except China, which he kept at 145%) for a 90-day pause. He claimed governments were begging to negotiate with the US to rewrite trade agreements.On Thursday he posted on social media that there had been “big progress” in talks with Japan the previous day. Japan had not expected the US president to get involved in Wednesday’s talks, viewing them as a preliminary, fact-finding mission, a sign that Trump wants to keep tight control over negotiations with dozens of countries expected over the coming days and weeks.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, warned that the talks “won’t be easy”, but he said the president had “expressed his desire to give the negotiations … the highest priority”.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaTechnology sectorInternational tradeTrump tariffsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeeknewsShareReuse this content"

The central bank said services inflation, which has proved stubbornly high in recent years, had eased markedly over recent months while wage growth was moderating, and where it remained high, companies were absorbing the extra costs in reduced profits.Trump has imposed an extra 10% tariff on EU goods to the US, with the threat of a further 10% suspended until July. Industry-specific tariffs of 25% already apply on steel, aluminium and cars into the US, and more are threatened on pharmaceuticals and electronics imports.Mark Wall, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the emphasis on a shock from the tariffs “implied an openness to further monetary easing”, assuming the trade shock persisted, and was “borne out in the data”.Most City economists expect a further rate cut in June. Wall said the reductions would continue this year until they reached 1.5%, such was the probable hit to European economic growth from US tariffs.Financial markets expect central banks in all major economies to cut interest rates this year as tariffs hit global trade and slow growth.Investors expect the Bank of England to cut the cost of borrowing by a quarter point when policymakers next meet in May and twice more in 2025.Before the ECB decision, Trumpcontrasted Lagarde’s record with that of the US Federal Reserve,which kept rates on hold at its last meeting in March. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, was “always too late and wrong” and that his “termination cannot come fast enough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago, he said it was unclear what the overall impact would be on the economy and whether the bank would need to raise interest rates to tame inflation or cut rates to increase growth, sparkinga large share sell-off on US markets.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it expects much slower global growth – but not a global recession – because of the trade tensions.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said that the latest world economic outlook forecasts will include “notable markdowns, but not recession”.In a speech before the organisation’s spring meetings next week in Washington, she said economic “resilience is being tested again – by the reboot of the global trading system”.She added: “Trade tensions are like a pot that was bubbling for a long time and is now boiling over. To a large extent, what we see is the result of an erosion of trust – trust in the international system, and trust between countries.”Data released by the EU agency Eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone rose 2.2% in March, compared with 2.3% in February. A measure of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as petrol and food, dropped from 2.6% to 2.4% in the same period.The ECB said most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would “settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Central BankInterest ratesEuropean UnionEconomicsEuropeEuroJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

It disclosed a position of almost 6m shares, according to Trump Media.Short-selling is a way of betting against a public company. An investor borrows a stock, and then sells it on; should the stock fall, the investor then buys it back and pockets the difference.In a memo to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump Media – which trades under the ticker “DJT”, using Trump’s initials – said the total short interest in the company was 10.7m as of 31 March, according to Nasdaq, where its shares are listed, and had only risen to about 11m as of Wednesday.These factors “especially when combined with the history of suspicious trading surrounding DJT stock … could be indications of the illegal naked short selling of DJT shares”, Trump Media claimed.Qube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Trump Media rallied by about 7% in New York on Thursday. They have fallen by more than a third this year.The firm is currently seeking to branch out beyond its core Truth Social platform, and this week announced investment accounts based on themes, including “Made in America” and “Energy Independence”, which align with the Trump administration’s agenda.On its website, Qube says it combines “data, research, technology and trading expertise” to “solve the most complex challenges”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also has offices in Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai.In that time, Qube has grown quickly to rival some established giants of the industry, reportedly managing about $23bn of assets, which according to industry estimates would put it among the top 1% of hedge funds. It is also considered unusual for its lack of a New York office and collaborative corporate culture.Alongside its short position in Trump Media, Qube has short positions in a range of UK-listed companies, including real estate firms, fashion retailer Boohoo and bowling centre operator Hollywood Bowl Group, according to the latest disclosures with the UK’s City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHedge fundsLondonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will also suffer from Trump’s cancellation of the “de minimis” exemption, under which shipments worth less than $800 (£600) could be imported duty-free.That exemption was crucial in helping the low-cost retailers make inroads into the US market, where they were able to send low-cost online purchases with few expenses. It will be removed as of 2 May.Price hike on Shein? How Trump tariffs could shift the US’s love of fast fashionRead more“Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up,”Shein’s customer notice said.“To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting 25 April 2025. We’re doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimise the impact on you,” the company said.Under Trump’s original plans, previously exempt packages were due to be hit with a tariff rate of 30% or $25 an item, rising to $50 an item by 1 June. However, after China responded with retaliatory tariffs last week, Trump hit back bytripling the rates for previously exempt packagesto 90% or $75 an item, rising to $150 on 1 June.Some experts say it is unlikely to deter all customers, given that items from Temu andSheincould still end up cheaper than some rival retailers.Meanwhile, the imposition of US tariffs has prompted the retailers to cut spending on US social media advertising, which has also bolstered their profile among young and thrifty shoppers.Temu’s daily average US ad spend on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, X and YouTube declined by a collective average of 31% in the two weeks from 31 March to 13 April compared with the previous 30 days, according to the digital marketing company Sensor Tower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resolution received a provisional 24.3% of opposed votes.The outgoing chair told shareholders that the company had “pursued too much while looking to build new low-carbon businesses” but that “lessons have been learned”.BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, repeated his previous claim that BP’s optimism in the global green energy transition was “misplaced”, and that the board’s “one simple goal” was to “grow the long-term value of your investment”.A strategy overhaul was considered by many industry commentators as BP’s only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could threaten the breakup of the 115-year-old company.The feared New York fund Elliott Investment Managementamassed a stake in the companyearlier this year. It typically takes aim at underperforming companies by agitating for changes that could resuscitate their flagging market value.Elliott is expected to call for sweeping changes to BP, which has lagged behind rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil that have profited from the global energy market crisis in recent years by increasing their fossil fuel production.Mark Van Baal, the founder of the green activist investor group Follow This, said shareholders had “made it clear that weakening climate commitments is unacceptable”.He added: “This historical result serves as a wake-up call to BP’s board and emphasises investor expectation for robust governance mechanisms and genuine leadership on ESG issues.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the price of crude has collapsedRead moreUnder Auchincloss, BP has scrapped plans to restrict its fossil fuel production in favour of green investments. Instead, the company will be “very selective” about investing in low-carbon options while growing its planned fossil fuel production to 2.4m barrels of oil and gas a day by 2030 – about 60% higher than the figure inits net zero plan set out five years ago.The vote marks the biggest rebellion against the board since 2016, when almost 60% of shareholders voted against BP’s decision to hand the then CEO, Bob Dudley, a $20m (£15.1m) pay packet in the same year that a global oil market rout pushed the company to record losses.The latest shareholder standoff took place almost 15 years to the day after the deadlyDeepwater Horizon disasterled to the largest marine oil spill in US history and plunged the company into a $70bn dollar crisis.The company announced this week an oil discovery in “the Gulf of America” – using Donald Trump’snewly mandated US name for the Gulf of Mexico– which it said underscored its plan to “step up investment in exploration”.Explore more on these topicsBPOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryCommoditiesEnergyClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

At least another 74 were in various stages of construction or planning, the report said. The UHRP said some of the hotels also had exposure or links of concern to forced labour and labour transfer programmes.The explosion in hotel numbers coincides with the Chinese government’s efforts to push Xinjiang as a tourism destination after years of criticism and sanctions over its crackdown on the local Muslim population. In 2024 Xinjiang recorded about 300 million visitors, according to state media, includingalmost 5 million foreign tourists– 50% more than in 2023.Several world governments and legal groups have declared the government’s actions against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to be a genocide, although this has not been settled in any international court.The UN says that China’s policies in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch has said the policies – which include mass internment and re-education, forced labour, and criminalisation of acts of religious expression – amount to crimes against humanity. China’s government denies all accusations of abuse and mistreatment in Xinjiang.Human rights groups have argued that the presence of foreign enterprises in Xinjiang lends legitimacy to the Chinese government’s crackdown, and called on firms to leave. In November, the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen sold its Xinjiang factory after years of pressure.But as Beijing promotes Xinjiang as holiday destination for domestic and international tourists, the spotlight has turned to foreign tourism businesses. In 2023 the Guardian reported on a number oftour operators advertising holiday packages to Xinjiang. Now, hotel companies appear to be increasing their business there.Well known brands, including France’s Accor, Hilton, the British IHG Group, Marriott and Wyndham are among hundreds of existing or developing hotels across the region. The sites listed include luxurious upmarket hotels in city locations as well as ski resort areas, where the Chinese government has heavily invested in winter tourism.The report said three companies – Hilton, IHG, and Wyndham – all had hotels, and potentially paid fees or taxes – in areas administered by China’s state-owned paramilitary entity, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). Sanctions have been passed on the XPCC by several governments, including the US, UK and EU, over “serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities”.Peter Irwin, associate director for research and advocacy at UHRP, said: “This kind of hotel expansion, from international chains in particular, falls squarely within the Chinese government’s own strategy to try and normalise the public’s understanding of what’s going on in the Uyghur region.“The government can point to these major companies entrenching themselves in the region as evidence that everything is normal, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.”One recently opened hotel, by a Hilton franchisee, was built on the site of a mosque in Khotan that was demolished amid a government campaign in which more than 10,000 religious sites were destroyed.“Building a hotel on the site of a demolished mosque is particularly egregious, given that the Chinese government has undertaken a broad campaign to tear down mosques across the Uyghur Region since 2017,” the report said. It said the hotel was not visible on English-language travel booking sites but China’s CTrip showed reviews dating back to about mid-2024.Tuesday’s report assessed government records, corporate records and media articles, to determine whether hotels had other links of concern, including ownership structures with particular Chinese companies and involvement in state programmes identified by human rights researchers.In another case study, the report identified links between Accor’s Grand Mercure Urumqi Hualing hotel anda training and employment programme. A state mediareportfrom one symposium said a human resources director from the hotel had visited and signed letters of intent with many students.The symposium was targeted at young people and “surplus rural labour” workers from ethnic minorities, as part of the government’s poverty alleviation and “social stability” goals. The government says its Xinjiang employment schemes are part of “poverty alleviation” efforts but has been accused of forced labour and labour transfer programmes that breach human rights.The report also said Accor’s strategic partner in China, H World Group Limited, had used a recruitment and training programme, Xinjiang Aid, which a US congressional investigation found contributed to the risk of human trafficking. In 2020 four US agencieswarnedthe programme may make use of internment camp labour or workers from “abusive labour programmes”.“These hotels continue to operate and expand business in a region in which Uyghur families have been torn apart by internment, imprisonment, forced labor programmes, and enforced disappearances,” said Dr Henryk Szadziewski, co-author of the report and director of research at the UHRP.The report called for the hotel chains to initiate “immediate reviews” of their operations, given they had all made pledges to adopt international human rights standards. It urged them to freeze expansion plans, halt operations and sever business ties.“They should publicly disclose their decision to exit, conduct heightened human rights due diligence, and engage with Uyghur rights organisations for remediation,” the report said.The Guardian contacted Accor, Hilton, IHG, Marriott, and Wyndham for comment. A spokeswoman for Accor said the company and its partners “adhere to our group [corporate social responsibility] Charter, which includes standards for how employees are treated. We are dedicated to ensuring that our operations align with these standards.”The spokeswoman said other elements put to them, including the claims about employment programs, were “not accurate”, but did not elaborate.The other companies have not responded.Timothy Grose a professor of China studies with expertise in ethnic policy at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, said investing in the region’s tourism was not a bad thing in principle.“In fact, the investments could bring great benefits to local economies,” he said. “However, if recent history repeats itself, the construction of new hotels, which may attract thousands of tourists, will unlikely translate into improvements in the lives of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other minoritised groups.”“Perhaps most immediately, shiny hotels and droves of tourists attempt to paint the picture that human rights abuses certainly cannot be occurring in such a ‘happy’ and ‘thriving’ place. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to have achieved some degree of success.”Explore more on these topicsXinjiangChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsHotelsHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

At this juncture United had gone 4-2 down to a Rayan Cherki strike and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty (on 104 and 109 minutes) that had the French side leading 6-4 on aggregate and apparently dumping Ruben Amorim’s men out of Europe.Manchester United 5-4 Lyon: Europa League quarter-final, second leg – live reactionRead moreBut, no. First, Casemiro went over with Nicolas Tagliafico pulling him and after turning down the spot-kick, the referee, Sandro Schärer, awarded this after being ordered to the monitor. Up stepped Bruno Fernandes to coolly beat Lucas Perri to the goalkeeper’s left.United still trailed as the opening 60 seconds of the five added on-began yet, now, came their auxiliary No 9, Kobbie Mainoo, who, fed by Casemiro, steered through a crowded area to make it 6-6 on aggregate, causing Old Trafford to go ballistic as penalties were surely how the tie would be decided.Except this is Manchester United and their proud DNA of Fergie-time and that 2-1 triumph over Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou. So: enter Harry Maguire to head the winner 34 seconds into added time, put United in dreamland and take the roof off the stadium – Casemiro again the provider, to make it three involvements in the three crucial strikes.United, then, head to Spain for a semi-final first leg at Athletic Bilbao and following this who will wager against them reaching the showpiece at the same venue, after what was, too, a night of redemption for André Onana.With the host broadcaster’s cameras fixed on him before kick-off the No 1 returned a far more accomplished display than last week’s personal fiasco. For swathes of the contest United were also in charge and registered 10 minutes in. Noussair Mazraoui flipped the ball to Fernandes as he cruised along the right, the ball was relayed to Alejandro Garnacho and he ran into a near-post area: the pass to Manuel Ugarte was as precise as the No 25’s left-foot finish that had the congregation in raptures.United were in a smart, fast mode that pinnedLyonback. But they failed to capitalise, allowing the French to breathe easier and raid United’s area. Cherki saw a shot ping off Maguire for a corner. Georges Mikautadze slipped in towards the spot and Maguire hoofed clear.Then, the clearest opening – Tagliaficao crossed, Leny Yoro miskicked, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, roving in behind, snatched at the chance to equalise.Now, United roared back in a moment which thrilled. Diogo Dalot fashioned a long parabola from his half and Fernandes, running in, stretched to power a volley that left Perri a spectator and crashed off the bar, drawing “oohs” from the crowd. More followed when Rasmus Højlund swivelled and fed the irrepressible Fernandes: again the attempt beat Perri, but this time spiralled wide.United hurtled for the break like a train, the period finishing with their second. It was route-one stuff, in high-class fashion. Maguire, deep in his territory, dropped a 70-yard pass into Dalot, the wing-back shrugged off Tagliafico, then coolly rolled home, off Perri’s right post.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo celebrates his equaliser in the 120th minute.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAMazraoui, perhaps injured, was replaced by Luke Shaw as the second half whistle blew, as Garnacho claimed a free-kick via a rapier thrust. The Argentinian flier can lack composure but here he was uber-calm when sprinting after a Højlund defence-splitter. Entering the area and making an amateur of his marker, he steadied, then blazed at goal, only Perri’s acrobatics stopping a certain third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Lyon could pull one back, a grandstand finish would be in store and so it proved.Mikautadze might have done the trick but the No 69 slashed the ball wide in a moment as panicked as Dalot’s was slick when, moments later, he again bested Tagliafico.Suddenly, he was in Lyon’s area and crossing but no teammate could finish.From the Stretford End came the “Ruben Amorim, he’ll bring the glory days again” song and, as Lyon fans lit red flares, the continental dream remained firmly on.Now, though, came Lyon’s fightback: Tolisso beat Onana with a header after Moussa Niakhaté and Lacazette nodded on and with United in disarray, a Maitland-Niles laser was repelled by an Onana leg but he could do nothing to stop Tagliafico’s equaliser, the No 1 exposed by shoddy defending.On 89 minutes came Tolisso’s dismissal – a precursor to the heart-stopping, box-office end to the evening.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueManchester UnitedLyonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But he challenges the prototype of what an NFL quarterback is supposed to look and act likeThu 17 Apr 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 10.22 EDTShareNFL scouting is broken, and Shedeur Sanders is the proof. Everything about him screams future star quarterback, and yet teams would sooner assume the worst.Make no mistake: there is no prospect in this year’s draft who is better equipped to turn around a struggling franchise than the 23-year-old Texan, a savior to not one buttwocollege fanbases. The last four years saw him restore the proud football tradition at Jackson State and put Colorado back on the college football map. Sanders did this despite skeptics casting doubt on his ability to make the jump up from competing against small historically Black schools to playing against major college powers in the Pac 12 and Big 12 conferences. Last year he led a 9-4 turnaround at Colorado, the school’s first winning season in seven years, while snapping a four-year drought of postseason bowl appearances.A road trip to Lambeau Field: my search for the magic of the NFL draft | Emma JohnRead moreAlthough atouchslight at 6ft1in and 212lb, Sanders has nonetheless proven to be durable, missing a grand total of two games in his four years as a starter. All the while Sanders rated among the nation’s most prolific throwers while at Jackson State (which competes in college football’s secondary Football Bowl Subdivision) and at Colorado (which competes in college football’s biggest stage, the Bowl Championship Subdivision). In his senior season Sanders paced the Big 12 in completion percentage (74%), yards (4,134) and touchdowns (37) on the way to being named the conference’s offensive player of the year. What’s more, Sanders has pedigree. He’s a coach’s kid – scoutslovecoaches’ kids! – and the pros will mark the first time Sanders plays for a head coach who isn’t also his father. That father? None other than NFL hall of famer Deion Sanders: Colorado’s Coach Prime, the feared shutdown cornerback who caught passes and played Major League Baseball on the side.Shedeur figures to be among the first three quarterbacks picked at next week’s NFL draft behind the University of Miami’s Cam Ward and perhaps even Ole Miss’ Jaxson Dart as well. But where Dart (who excelled at two schools) is being hyped as a sleeper pick and Ward (who excelled atthree) appears to be the consensus top pick, Sanders keeps sliding down the draft board. Most projections have him down as a bottom-10 pick; many NFL scouts haven’t even given him a first-round grade. An anonymous NFC team executive who spoke to ESPN dismissed Sanders as “a fringe starter” in the mold of Teddy Bridgewater – the former Louisville star who has spent the majority of his decade-long pro career as a backup. Scouts further say that Sanders can be slow to make up his mind under pressure and even slower to react when overwhelmed. (At Jackson State, Sanders was among college football’s most sacked starters.)View image in fullscreenShilo Sanders (21), Colorado head coach Deion Sanders and Shedeur Sanders (2) walk on the field during senior day celebrations prior to the game against the Oklahoma State Cowboys at Folsom Field in November.Photograph: Andrew Wevers/Getty ImagesBut more than Sanders holding on to the ball too long, teams really don’t like that Sanders isn’t desperate for a job. He comes from money already; in fact, Coach Prime – who has remained a sought-after pitchman in the decades since his dual playing prime – justsigned a $54m extensionthat puts him in league with college football’s highest-paid coaches. At one point only USC basketball prodigy Bronny James was making more money in name, image and likeness endorsement deals than Shedeur. Famously, Shedeur tootled around campus in exotic cars and celebrated big plays by flashing a diamond-encrusted watch. Teams look at Shedeur and see more than just a chip off the old block; they see something they’re not used to seeing in Black quarterback prospects: a nepo baby on a Rocky Mountain confidence high.If those teams could set Shedeur’s luxury accessories to the side for a moment, they might appreciate him for what he truly is – maybe the best-nurtured NFL quarterback prospect ever. Consider: top draft picks Peyton and Eli Manning had their father, Archie, for a role model – but he was no better than a solid NFL starter with the New Orleans Saints through the 1970s. John Elway’s father, Jack, was a respected college football coach – but he got hired at Stanford the yearafterJohn left school for the 1983 draft. Andrew Luck’s dad, Oliver – a former quarterback for the Houston Oilers – moved to Europe to launch his post-playing career as a football executive. He wasn’t an especially hands-on coach for Andrew, a youth soccer player before he was the top pick in 2012.Meanwhile, the youngest Sanders son has been at his father’s knee from the beginning, barnstorming the country with Deion’s Texas-based youth football teams. In between working as an NFL Network analyst, Deion took a job as the offensive coordinator at Shedeur’s Dallas-area high school expressly to continue guiding his football career. When Deion left that post to take the head coaching job at Jackson State, Shedeur and his older brother Shilo were his first recruits. (“I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to help level the playing field & pursue equality for HBCU’s!” Shedeur wrote after his commitment was announced. “Dad I got your back!”) The gravitational force of Coach Prime’s personality has given Shedeur access to some of the brightest minds in the game. Tom Brady has been mentoring Shedeur his entire college career, and former NFL coach Pat Shurmur was his offensive coordinator at Colorado.Shedeur wasn’t just productive on the field. Colorado was in the midst of a 20-year doldrums before Shedeur turned up on the Boulder campus with his whole family. Shedeur turned Travis Hunter, adual-threat cornerback, into his top receiver; now the Heisman-winner projects as a top three pick in the draft. Teammates praise Shedeur’s leadership and toughness. At Colorado’s pro day showcase for league scouts earlier this month Shedeur took snaps from a young equipment manager named Samantha Burrows – the conspicuous woman among the crowd of football men on the field. (Sanders wanted to make a point of showcasing his rapport with Burrows.) A month earlier Shedeur made headlines at the NFL combine for his 3.9 GPA. Shedeur never caused trouble off campus, never ran into trouble farther afield. In that respect he’s a lot like his father, who never put a foot wrong off the field even as his Dallas Cowboys teammates were settingthe NFL standard for bad behavior.View image in fullscreenQuarterback Shedeur Sanders has been projected as a first-round pick in next week’s NFL draft.Photograph: Dustin Bradford/Getty ImagesBut the main hang-up scouts seem to have with Shedeur is that he veers from the Black quarterback archetype. Unlike Ward, he doesn’t wow with arm strength and foot speed. He stands in the pocket and delivers a catchable ball time and again. If scouts were honest in their appraisals of Shedeur, they’d be comparing him favorably with Peyton Manning. In two-minute drill situations alone, Shedeur has a career 92.3 passer rating against top-level opponents – the highest-ever mark recorded by Pro Football Focus. He was even more efficient in third-down situations last year, his 64% overall completion percentage jumping to 85% in short-yardage situations.If NFL scouting was an actual science, Sanders would be the no-brainer, eminently justifiable top pick. Instead, teams trip over one another to find reasons to talk themselves out of taking him off the board early. Last month the excuse was:most of the teams picking in the top-10 had more urgent needs to address. This month, it’s:he’s a terrible interview. To hear Shadeur tell it, teams reallydon’t like when he channels his father and turns the tables on them either. “When I go visit these coaches and when I go to all these different franchises, I ask them truly what I think and how I feel,” Shedeur recently told NFL Network. “Some get offended, some like it, some don’t. Make some people uncomfortable, some people invite that. They know what type of person and what type of player they’re gonna get out of me, so I just have to make sure, you know, what type of culture or what type of dynamic I’m going to have with them also.”The Pittsburgh Steelers, rumored to be interested in trading up from the 21st pick, are among a handful of teams who are genuinely bullish on Shedeur – not least because he’d be a better long-term option than 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers or a second tour of Mason Rudolph. The Saints, who pick ninth, have only really started seriously considering Shedeur since incumbent starter Derek Carr was recently reported to have suffered a serious shoulder injury that could stall his availability for the 2025 season. This week the New York Giants, also mired in the Rodgers sweepstakes, worked out Shedeur again in Colorado – but the team is holding its cards close. The farther Shedeur drops, the more you wonder if he isn’t purposefully turning scouts off so he can wind up playing for his mentor Brady in Las Vegas. Or you wonder if the Giants aren’t in foranother round of Saquon Barkley-level regret.Really, any team would be lucky to land Shedeur. He has the skills, the swagger and a family name that he absolutely can’t let down. It’s a shame the scouts are too blinkered by their own hangups to spot a sure thing.Explore more on these topicsNFLCollege footballUS sportsCollege sportscommentShareReuse this content"

That distinction, long upheld by the USOPC, has now become a political tightrope. LA28’s host contract requires the United States to guarantee access for all qualified athletes – an obligation that could clash with the new federal order, which bars transgender women from competing in women’s categories if they went through male puberty.Board chair Gene Sykes said the committee had received “significant reassurances” from the White House and State Department that visa access for Olympic athletes and entourages would be protected, though he confirmed transgender-specific concerns were not raised during recent meetings with the administration.“One of the key topics on our agenda was the feedback we received from the State Department regarding the president’s executive order,” Sykes said. “As a board, we reaffirmed our commitment to protecting opportunities for athletes to participate in sport … [and] to ensuring women have a fair and safe competitive environment.”View image in fullscreenAn LA 2028 sign is seen in front of the Olympic cauldron at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Photograph: Richard Vogel/APThe transgender eligibility question was underscored by recent controversy in USA Fencing, where an athlete forfeited rather than compete against a transgender woman at a domestic tournament. Asked if the USOPC would intervene, Hirshland again deferred. “We do not have, nor will we have, an eligibility policy,” she said.Still, the USOPC has been lobbying on other fronts. While in Washington, Sykes and Hirshland pressed lawmakers for support of Olympic sports on college campuses, amid fears that changes to NCAA governance could reduce opportunities in non-revenue sports.Despite the political turbulence, the committee presented an optimistic outlook on LA28 preparations. The organizing committee has secured more than $1bn in commercial deals, Sykes said, crossing the halfway point of its domestic sponsorship target. More announcements are expected in the coming months.Venue planning has also firmed up. Sykes confirmed Tuesday’s local organizing committee announcement that Dodger Stadium will host Olympic baseball, while Trestles Beach in San Clemente will serve as the venue for surfing. Both sites offer iconic backdrops rooted in southern California’s sporting culture and are designed to keep costs low by leveraging existing infrastructure.“There is great excitement and focus on the LA28 Games,” Sykes said. “From the very top of the administration, they want this to be an incredibly successful experience.”View image in fullscreenOlympic organizers announced that Lower Trestles, known for its consistent, quality waves, would be the site for Olympic surfing in 2028.Photograph: Paul Bersebach/APHirshland also confirmed the official certification of USA Football as the sport’s new national governing body, positioning the United States to field teams inflag football, which will make its Olympic debut in 2028. “We’re pretty excited,” she said. “We’d like to field an awfully strong team.”Meanwhile, the battle to determine an NGB for surfing continues. At least two organizations – USASurfingand US Ski & Snowboard – have applied. Hirshland acknowledged concerns over potential conflicts of interest, but said the process is still underway and not without precedent.One notable omission from the committee’s Washington discussions: the ongoing standoff between the United States and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which escalated following revelations of the agency’s handling of Chinese swimmer doping cases.Although several members of Congress have raised concerns over Wada’s governance, Sykes said the issue did not come up in meetings with the State Department or Trump officials.“We’re intensely involved in discussions,” he said, “and hopeful we can find a good resolution.”With just over three years until LA hosts the Summer Games for a third time, the USOPC now finds itself caught between competing pressures: the demands of international sport, the political agenda of its host government and a rapidly shifting public conversation around fairness, inclusion, and access. The groundwork for 2028 is underway, but the rules of the game may still be in flux.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028USA Olympic teamTransgenderUS sportsWadaDrugs in sportLos AngelesShareReuse this content"

The Japanese winger sustained a heel injury against Crystal Palace, ruling him out ofthe draw with Leicester. It was the first time he had missed a Premier League game all season after making 31 appearances. Whether he will be available against Brentford is yet to be seen but, with three teenagers on the bench last weekend, the more experience Hürzeler can name on the teamsheet the better. James Milner, Igor Julio, Georginio Rutter, Adam Webster, Ferdi Kadioglu and Tariq Lamptey are all out, while the goalkeeper Jason Steele returned to action for the under-21s this week but Carl Rushworth will remain the backup to Bart Verbruggen for now. If Mitoma can recover in time, it will be a timely boost as Hürzeler’s side fight for a European place.Will UnwinBrentford v Brighton, Saturday 3pm (all times BST)2Palace need to tighten up fastConceding 10 goals in their past two games has extinguished Crystal Palace’s chances of gatecrashing the chase for the Champions League places, but Bournemouth’s visit to Selhurst Park is an opportunity to cut the gap to Andoni Iraola’s side to two points. “Maybe it’s good for us getting one step back,” reflected Oliver Glasner afterNewcastle’s 5-0 winon Wednesday. “Now we’ll focus on the basics and remember what made us so strong. Now is not the time to point fingers. We’ll just look in the mirror and I’ll see what I can change a little bit.” With a trip to Arsenal in midweek before their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, Palace must turn things around quickly if they are to remain in contention for Europe on two fronts.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenCrystal Palace have lost 5-2 and 5-0 in successive matches.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA3Broja playing for Everton future?Major upheaval was on the cards at Everton this summer regardless of how they finished the season, which, thanks to David Moyes’s impact, is with encouragement rather than trepidation. A staggering 13 members of the first-team squad are out of contract at the end of the campaign, including loanees, and Abdoulaye Doucouré’s celebration after scoring thelate winner at Nottingham Forestdemonstrated renewal talks have not exactly been gathering pace. There is no reason for further delay with the club 13th in the table and 17 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with six games to play. Moyes’s decision to start Armando Broja over Beto or Youssef Chermiti at Forest reflected a desire to see the Albania international in competitive action as he assesses all options. Everton can make Broja’s loan move from Chelsea permanent for £30m this summer. His injury record suggests that will be a non-starter but his ability, coupled with Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s likely departure, could make a cheaper bid worth considering should he get another chance to impress against Manchester City and take it.Andy HunterEverton vManchester City, Saturday 3pm4Ferguson floundering at West HamEvan Ferguson’s move to West Ham has not gone to plan. The striker has made one start since joining on loan from Brighton in January and has been an unused substitute since coming off at half-time against Wolves earlier this month. Graham Potter, who knew Ferguson well before bringing him to east London, seems to have given up on the 20-year-old. Niclas Füllkrug is above Ferguson in the pecking order and has done well as a substitute in his previous three appearances. It could be another long afternoon watching from the sidelines for Ferguson whenSouthamptonvisit the London Stadium. The Republic of Ireland forward may spy an opportunity against the worst team in the league, but will Potter be willing to give enough minutes to a player who has not looked sharp enough during his brief cameos in claret and blue?Jacob SteinbergWest Ham v Southampton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenEvan Ferguson (left) attempts to shield the ball from Wolves’ Emmanuel Agbadou during his last outing for West Ham.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/Reuters5Villa have to refocus after midweek dramaAfteran intoxicating Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germainin midweek, Aston Villa switch their focus to domestic duties. How much did running PSG so close drain Villa? Unai Emery has always maintained the league is his priority as it provides the pathway to Europe’s elite competition. Marcus Rashford enjoyed his best performance in a Villa shirt but Ollie Watkins, one goal shy of Gabby Agbonlahor’s goalscoring record (74) in the top flight, could return to the starting lineup after being reduced to a substitute role in four of Villa’s past five matches. Newcastle will arrive in Birmingham fresh from a thumping victory over Crystal Palace which extended their winning streak to six matches, while Villa have won nine of their past 10 games in all competitions. There is plenty at stake as two form teams, both of whom have designs on Champions League football next season, collide.Ben FisherAston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 5.30pm6Fulham look to write derby historyWin, loss, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss: so goes Fulham’s form in their past eight league games. They are nothing if not reliably unreliable and, given their recent record, they will presumably go into this weekend’s west London derby with Chelsea full of belief after defeat toBournemouthlast Monday. Chelsea have not won an away game in the league since December, a major complication in their quest for Champions League qualification, and their fans look ready to turn on Enzo Maresca. Fulham, who have already take points off Arsenal, Liverpool and Forest at home this season, could deepen the gloom. Yet history is not on their side. Fulham won at Stamford Bridge in December but have never done a league double over their wealthier neighbours. Expectations around Marco Silva’s side are high, but can they hold their nerve and boost their push for European football?JSFulham vChelsea, Sunday 2pm7Can Hirst step up in Delap-less future?All the talk has been aboutLiam Delap’s futureat Ipswich as he enters his final six games for the club. The striker will cost someone £30m in the summer and there is absolutely no chance he will stay to spearhead Ipswich’s attempt at returning to the top flight. This will leave a gap at the top of the pitch. George Hirst started in the draw at Stamford Bridge last Sunday as Delap nursed a rib injury. The Scotland international was part of the team thattook a two-goal leadagainst Chelsea, proving his worth as the understudy. He has four goals in 23 appearances but has mainly appeared off the bench under Kieran McKenna. Hirst would love the opportunity to show he can replace Delap in the long term and be a regular scorer. All he needs is a few more chances, but it would be a bold decision to start him against Arsenal.WUIpswich vArsenal, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenGeorge Hirst may go down with Ipswich but could he help them find a way back up?Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters8United face hard truths against WolvesSurely no one would have wagered onManchester Unitedwelcoming Wolves in mid-April only two points better off, with 38, than their visitors, and two places higher in 14th. But this is where Ruben Amorim’s insipid gang of flatliners find themselves as they trudge through the club’s poorest ever Premier League campaign. They can only realistically hope to end up 11th, where Brentford sit on 43 points, as even a top-half finish seems improbable with Brighton 10th on 48 points, 10 ahead with 18 left to play for. Next season has to be better or Amorim will be history.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Wolves, Sunday 2pm9Youth get a chance in Foxes’ dead rubbersRuud van Nistelrooy knows the gig is up at Leicester. They are whimpering their way to the Championship but he is at least using the long list of dead rubbers to give academy products aPremier Leaguedebut. Jeremy Monga and Jake Evans have come off the bench in recent weeks for a taste of life at the top and the next potential debutant is Olabade Aluko. The 18-year-old defender has progressed through the ranks at the King Power Stadium after joining at 15. Aluko, who can play right-back or centre-back, was named on the bench at Brighton but was an unused substitute, instead witnessing Evans take his bow. Two appearances in the EFL Trophy, against Northampton and Notts County, have given him a taste of senior football but playing against the Premier League champions elect would be one to remember.WULeicester vLiverpool, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenJeremy Monga (second left), aged 15, was given his Leicester chance by Ruud van Nistelrooy.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters10Wood waiting to get back to his bestThe good news forNottingham Forestis that Chris Wood was back on the pitch last weekend against Everton. The bad news is that they lost and the New Zealand international did not look up to speed after his hip problem. Nuno Espírito Santo needs his striker firing if Forest are to maintain their push for a Champions League spot. Playing on Monday night will provide Wood with longer to fully recover from the problem picked up last month when playing for the All Whites, and any New Zealander will want to get one over on an Australian. His 18 league goals are a key reason why Forest find themselves in the Champions League places but, after two straight defeats, they need to turn things around to avoid all the hard work going to waste.WUTottenham v Nottingham Forest, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3243762Arsenal3230633Newcastle3221594Nottm Forest3213575Man City3220556Chelsea3217547Aston Villa323548AFC Bournemouth3212489Fulham3244810Brighton3224811Brentford3244312Crystal Palace32-44313Everton32-43814Man Utd32-73815Tottenham Hotspur32113716Wolverhampton32-143517West Ham32-183518Ipswich32-342119Leicester32-451820Southampton32-5410Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendEvertonManchester CityAston VillaNewcastle UnitedWest Ham UnitedSouthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Appearing on the Pat McAfee Show, the four-time MVP stressed that his current focus is on matters off the field, including a serious relationship and close friends facing personal challenges.“I’m in a different phase of my life,” Rodgers said. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing. And I don’t think it’s fair to the Steelers or anyone while I’m dealing with a lot off the field.”NFL scouting is broken. Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders is all the proof you need | Andrew LawrenceRead moreRodgers has met with the Pittsburgh Steelers and spoken with both the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants since his release, but no deal appears imminent. The Giants have already filled out their quarterback room, signing both Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston. The Vikings have publicly committed to rookie JJ McCarthy. That leaves Pittsburgh – where Rodgers visited quietly last month, renting a Chevy Malibu to avoid fanfare – as the most viable landing spot.While the Steelers have cap space and a shaky depth chart that currently features Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, Rodgers has made it clear he’s not seeking leverage. “It ain’t about the money,” he said. “I told every single one of the teams I’d play for $10m. Whatever.”Rodgers emphasized that he’s “open to anything and attached to nothing”, including the possibility of retirement. “This entire time I haven’t felt like I owed anybody a decision,” he said. “If you need to move on, do something else, I’ve got nothing but love and respect.”The Jets moved on in March, releasing Rodgers just two days after inking former Steeler Justin Fields to a deal. Rodgers said he was “shocked” by the brief meeting with new Jets head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey, in which they told him in less than a minute that the franchise was going in a new direction.Rodgers’ tenure with the Jets was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Still, his influence in New York extended beyond stats. He voluntarily took a $35m pay cut in 2023 to provide salary cap flexibility and was voted the Jets’ most inspirational player that season for his effort to return from injury.Rodgers now has 62,952 passing yards and 503 career touchdowns, ranking seventh and fifth inNFLhistory, respectively. A Super Bowl champion with the Packers, he remains the franchise’s all-time leader in touchdowns and passer rating.Despite his pedigree, Rodgers reiterated that no decision is imminent – and the looming NFL draft won’t change that.“I want to keep the lines of communication open,” he said. “But right now, my focus is on my personal life. When I’m ready, I’ll know.”Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersNFLNew York JetsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I’ve been put down so much, I don’t want to bring anyone down. Men’s tennis needs him.“[But] if I did that, I would have gotten 20 years. Let’s be honest. I would have gotten grand slams taken away from me.”Sinner, whose suspension ends on 4 May, twice tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol in March 2024. He has maintained his innocence, claiming the drug entered his system through a massage from a trainer.The 23-year-old Italian accepted his ban after reaching an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged the InternationalTennisIntegrity Agency’s earlier decision to clear him of any wrongdoing.Williams, 43, said she took extra precautions to avoid any accidental ingestion of an illegal substance, joking that a PED scandal would have landed her “in jail”.A three-time grand slam winner, Sinner is expected to make his return to the tour on home turf at the Italian Open, an ATP 1000 clay-court tournament in Rome that begins on 5 May.Williams, who retired after the 2022 US Open, told the magazine she misses playing tennis.“I miss it a lot, with all my heart.

One man, identified as Joey M Broom, 58, of Altoona, was fatally injured when the bass boat struck the vessel he was aboard. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Two other men, John K Clark, 44, of Cullman, and Jeffrey C Little, 62, of Brandon, Mississippi, were thrown overboard during the crash. Both men drowned. Their bodies were later recovered from the water.Officials confirmed that multiple individuals were injured in the crash, though their identities and conditions have not been made public. ALEA continues to investigate the incident.MLF confirmed that one of its competitors, Flint Davis of Leesburg, Georgia, was involved in the accident. Davis’s role in the crash remains unclear. His boat was still on the lake later in the day, according to local reports. A park manager noted uncertainty as to whether all vessels involved in the crash were officially participating in the tournament.“This is a heartbreaking moment for our entire organization,” said Kathy Fennel, MLF’s executive vice president and general manager. “Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of those affected by this tragedy.”The Tackle Warehouse Invitational had been scheduled to run through Thursday, with professional anglers competing for a top prize of up to $115,000. In light of the fatal accident, MLF officials made the decision to cancel the final day of the tournament out of respect for the victims and their families.The crash took place on Lewis Smith Lake, a sprawling 21,000-acre reservoir located roughly 70 miles north of Birmingham, popular with both recreational boaters and competitive anglers.In a statement, MLF said it is working closely with ALEA and emergency management officials and will provide additional updates as more information becomes available.Explore more on these topicsFishingAlabamaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

After the manager complained that the football gods were against him last week, Dominic Solanke’s penalty after an intervention from the video assistant referee – another of the Australian’s pet peeves – was enough to seal his side’s progress to the semi-finals of theEuropa League.Postecoglou has probably regretted his decision to point out back in September after a defeat to Arsenal that he “always” wins trophies in his second year at a club. But after their north London rivals eased past the might of Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, Spurs also still have something to hang on to in a season that has otherwise been filled with disappointment.Eintracht Frankfurt v Tottenham: Europa League quarter-final, second leg – liveRead moreA trip to the Arctic Circle to face Norwegians Bodø/Glimt awaits in the last four after this dogged display against anEintracht Frankfurtteam who look destined to qualify for next season’s Champions League. But a disciplined Tottenham side showed they are still playing for their manager. Solanke had not scored since 4 January – a run of 12 matches – but there were unbridled celebrations in the away end when he stroked home the decisive spot kick just before half-time and at the full-time whistle after almost eight nerve-racking minutes of injury-time.Postecoglou – who has increasingly cut a defiant figure in recent weeks as results in the Premier League have gone from bad to worse despite the return of several key players from injury – was in amongst it in between hugs for Solanke and James Maddison. The Australian spikily suggested beforehand that Spurs supporters shouldn’t take being one match away from the last four of a European competition as a regular occurrence “because it certainly hasn’t been for this club”. In the absence of captain Son Heung-min due to a foot injury, he saw his players grasp the opportunity with both hands.Micky van de Ven and Destiny Udogie were outstanding in defence, while Rodrigo Bentancur marshalled the midfield superbly and, as Postecoglou put it, Maddison put his body on the line to win the decisive spot-kick.The Eintracht supporters had packed out the end behind one of the goals almost an hour before kick-off. There was an electric atmosphere as they unfurled a tifo when the players emerged with the message “the Eagles are on the hunt”, with trophies representing their two previous triumphs in this competition and its predecessor, the Uefa Cup.View image in fullscreenEintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kauã Santos concedes a penalty by colliding with Tottenham’s James Maddison.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersAlmost 3,000 Spurs fans also braved the incessant rain as Jean-Mattéo Bahoya and Mario Götze both tested Guglielmo Vicario’s handling on the greasy surface with early shots. There was a moment of panic when Hugo Ekitike raced on to a long punt forward from goalkeeper Kauã Santos but Van de Ven ate up the ground to get back just in time. Götze’s evening came to a premature end when he was taken off clutching his hamstring before Tottenham had their first sight of goal in the 20th minute, although Son’s replacement Mathys Tel could not make proper contact with Brennan Johnson’s cutback. The Frenchman was on target with his next effort from distance that drew a good save from Santos.Postecoglou will have been pleased with how his side had grown into the game and he was given even more hope on the stroke of half-time. Santos thought he had escaped when he clattered dangerously into Maddison but VAR thought differently to the Italian referee and sent him to the replay screen. Tel initially looked as if he would take it but eventually Solanke sent the goalkeeper the wrong way as a groggy Maddison was replaced by Dejan Kulusevski after trying manfully to carry on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A free-kick from 35 yards out from Götze’s replacement Farès Chaïbi that had Vicario sprawling across his goal must have quickened Postecoglou’s pulse.Cristian Romero and Bentancur both had golden chances to make things more comfortable from corners but neither could hit the target. Ekitike was convinced he should have had a penalty after a Romero clearance but this time VAR correctly said no after replays showed there had been no contact.Postecoglou must have checked his watch umpteen times as Spurs closed in on the victory. Vicario reacted brilliantly to save Chaïbi’s effort with his legs before the former Leeds defender Rasmus Kristensen somehow fired wide with the goal gaping to ensure that Tottenham’s season remains very much alive and kicking.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueEintracht FrankfurtTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it is Athletic Club of Bilbao who face Manchester United, a unique club still hoping that a first continental trophy in their 124-year history will be won when they host the final.Barry Ferguson’s side were still standing at the end ofa first leg that finished 0-0, despite spending most of the night a man down, and they still hadn’t conceded 48 minutes into the second, but a penalty gave the Basques a breakthrough. “This hurts, and I want it to,” Ferguson said.Maguire heads winner as Manchester United pull off chaotic comeback against LyonRead moreLiam Kelly had been the hero seven days ago, saving Álex Berenguer’s penalty; here though he could not stop Oihan Sancet’s spot-kick.Rangersstill might have been revived when Nicolas Raskin hit the post and Ferguson complained that his side should have had two penalties – a shirt pull in the first half and a handball in the second – but ultimately Athletic were too good. They racked up 21 shots here, 40 over the two legs, until the 41st was headed in by Nico Williams to make it 2-0, the stadium they call the Cathedral erupting into songs of praise.Rangers, by contrast, weren’t good enough: “The work rate was there but the quality wasn’t at times,” Ferguson admitted. “I just want my club to be back where it should be.” Over 180 minutes they only had two shots on target, although they actually had the first here, James Tavernier’s free-kick flying into the stands. Their task, or perhaps their limitations, were much the same as the first leg. This was, above all, about holding Athletic back again, or trying to.On the left Nico Williams ran at them, Ridvan Yilmaz being nutmegged and then having to depart with an early injury that reinforced the idea that what Rangers had to do was resist. On the right, Óscar de Marcos provided a steady stream of balls into the box. In the middle, Maroan Sannadi, a huge, broad-shouldered centre-forward with his socks half way down his shins, was becoming a key figure. He was playing third tier football three months ago; now he stood above on the European stage.Athletic were dominating, although Rangers might have been handed an opportunity when Cyriel Dessers fell in the area. He said he had been pulled by Dani Vivian and had the proof of it too: a gaping hole in the front of his shirt. “That should be a penalty and a red card; it’s baffling,” Ferguson said. When Rangers broke soon after, Vaclav Cerny decided to take on the shot from 50 yards, snatching at a rare sight. The “ooh” from the Athletic fans was came from a place of fun, not fear, but the Czech would end up worrying them.View image in fullscreenAthletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet sends Liam Kelly the wrong way from the spot.Photograph: Vincent West/ReutersAthletic’s attempts were accumulating and becoming clearer too. De Marcos set up Sannadi for a miss very similar to one at Ibrox. An outrageous piece of control from Sancet made another opportunity, Berenguer bending past the post. And then Sannadi rolled Tavernier and Yilmaz to set up Nico Williams. Kelly was out of his goal but, incredibly, Williams shot wide. And then it happened, three minutes into added time at the end of the first half. Sannadi was clipped by John Souttar and Athletic had another penalty; this time it was Sancet who took it, not Berenguer, and this time Kelly couldn’t stop it.It was still just one goal, Athletic knew. They were reluctant to sit on this, aware that a single moment could change everything. Rangers too knew that, and when that opportunity came they so very nearly took it. Cerny’s free-kick hit the wall but the loose ball was lobbed back into the box where Dessers swung at an overhead kick, the scuffed ball falling at the feet of Raskin. Six yards out, on the turn, he struck the post. On the touchline, Ferguson put his head in his hands and then found the fourth official unwilling to hear his appeals for a handball by Yeray Álvarez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such is life for Enzo Maresca at the moment. Losing 2-1 toLegia Warsawon the night was embarrassing. Chelsea, who seemed intent on giving the fifth-best side in Poland hope of pulling off a comeback for the ages at a disgruntled Stamford Bridge, were shambolic and easily could have crashed out.No wonder Maresca is not feeling the love from the crowd. Nobody celebratedChelseasqueezing into a Conference League semi-final against Djurgården after winning 4-2 on aggregate. The defending was miserable and the attack was poor. Filip Jörgensen, Robert Sánchez’s understudy, was jittery in goal and the worries around Cole Palmer’s slump are not going away.Maresca picking a fight with Chelsea fans feels like an act of self-sabotage | Jacob SteinbergRead morePalmer, who has gone 15 games without scoring, again cut a frustrated figure. He was not alone, though. Nobody had turned up expecting that they might be about to witness a Polish attempt at aremontada. Initially there was intrigue about Maresca naming such a strong side when Chelsealed 3-0 from the first leg. There was no rest for Marc Cucurella at left-back, although it was possible to interpret starts for Palmer and Nicolas Jackson as an opportunity to play themselves back into form.That seemed a sound theory when Palmer surged through in the second minute, only to shoot wide. Will his goal drought ever end? Palmer toiled. He spurned another chance moments later, failing to turn in a rebound after Jackson had a shot saved by Vladan Kovacevic, and Maresca’s gamble was looking decidedly foolish when a nasty challenge from Tomas Pekhart left Chelsea’s chief creator hobbling in the 20th minute.Chelsea were behind by that stage, Pekhart squeezing a penalty past Jörgensen after being fouled by the goalkeeper, and were far from secure. The first hint of discontent from the home support came when Ryoya Morishita shot just wide after sprinting past Cucurella.View image in fullscreenTomas Pekhart gave the visitors a glimmer of hope after winning and scoring an early penalty.Photograph: John Walton/PA“It was a poor performance,” Reece James, Chelsea’s captain, said. “We had a 3-0 lead – maybe that played a part in taking our foot off the gas. Maybe we disrespected the competition today. If you don’t prepare right, you will pay. It’s going to affect the mindset. It’s going to be in the back of people’s heads. I understand the frustration. Fans come to see excitement. We were frustrating to watch.”The mood improved when Cucurella, Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025, met a cross from Jadon Sancho to make it 1-1. It dipped when the hosts, who brought Tyrique George on for Jackson at half-time, started the second half badly. Chelsea’s distribution was poor and a mistake from Josh Acheampong almost led to Claude Gonçalves heading past Jörgensen.Chelsea have produced a lot of great defensive performances in Europe but this was not one of them. Tosin Adarabioyo and Benoït Badiashile were unconvincing in the middle and Legia regained their lead when Steve Kapuadi punished dismal marking at a corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His previous contact was worth £220,000 a week and he will earn a similar wage, though with performance-related bonuses his pay could reach about £400,000 a week.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, has been engaged in contract negotiations with the defender’s agent, Neil Fewings, for months. Despite uncertainty and speculation over Van Dijk’s position, both parties made clear from the outset that they wanted to extend his stay.“It was always Liverpool,” the club captain said. “It was always in my head, it was always the plan and it was always Liverpool. There wasn’t any doubt in my head that this is the place to be for me and my family. I’m one of Liverpool. Someone called me the other day an adopted scouser – I’m really proud to hear these things, it gives me a great feeling.“It always felt right. I said it from the first day on that it felt right and I think it showed in the years we have spent together up until now. And obviously more years to come.“It is the place for me to be, to spend my best years, be successful with the club as we have been over the years and hopefully the future as well. And I love the city, I love the club, I love the fans. I love my teammates. I love everything that embodies Liverpool and on to many more.”Van Dijk, who will be 34 in July, has enjoyed an outstanding season under his compatriot Arne Slot and reaffirmed his status as one of the finest defenders in the game. He ranks first for touches and successful passes by a defender in the Premier League this season, and is also in the top five for duels won, aerial duels won, headed clearances and interceptions.The Netherlands captain has been ever-present in the Premier League this season, playing every minute, and will soon lift Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th league title. Slot’s team require six points in six games to become champions. The title would be won as early as Sunday should Arsenal lose at Ipswich and Liverpool win at Leicester. It will add to a roll-call of honours for Van Dijk at Liverpool that includes the Premier League title in 2020, the Champions League, the FA Cup, two League Cups, a Uefa Super Cup and the Club World Cup.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk poses with pictures of himself during his Liverpool career.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe news comes six days after Salah also signed a deal to 2027. The third leading Liverpool player out of contract this summer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, is expected tojoin Real Madridat the end of June. Liverpool view the retention of Salah and Van Dijk as a statement of their ambition before what the captain recently admitted would be “a big summer” for the club.Van Dijk said on Thursday: “Hopefully by the time the season ends we have an amazing party together. There’s still work to do and we have to realise it as well. But looking even further than that, I think it’s exciting, I think it’s exciting for what’s coming.“Hopefully a very good pre-season and it’s going to be a very difficult Premier League season what’s waiting for us next year because everyone will try to improve, will get new additions, like we should as well, and then we have to compete and we have to show our qualities, show our consistency. And on top of that, maybe even more importantly, we have to enjoy it. I will certainly do it because I realise how privileged and blessed I am to play for Liverpool FC.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

The Japan midfielder had just helped Leedswin a vital match at Middlesbroughthis month but they were not tears of joy. “I asked Ao: ‘Why?’” said his manager, Daniel Farke. “He said: ‘I don’t know boss, I’m just so empty.’”Given it is April and, with four games remaining, a gruelling, painfully tight,Championshippromotion race is drawing towards a denouement, no one seemed too surprised. “It’s hard for all my players at the moment,” said Farke, whose team could, like Burnley, be promoted as early as Easter Monday. “We’re working for the most emotional club in the UK and the outside world is always nervous and panicking.”The underlying problem is that three cannot fit into two and one of Leeds, Burnley andSheffield Unitedwill miss out on automatic promotion to the Premier League. They must, instead, galvanise themselves to join Sunderland and, most likely, two from Bristol City, Coventry, Middlesbrough, Millwall and West Brom in the playoffs.PosTeamPGDPts1Leeds4253882Burnley4244883Sheff Utd4224834Sunderland4219765Bristol City42964If Sheffield United are to avoid this fate they need to close the five-point gap withBurnleyand Leeds that has opened up after Chris Wilder’s side lost their past three matches. An awful lot may hinge on the Blades’ trip to Turf Moor on Monday evening, particularly as they have a vastly inferior goal difference.“Anxiety sort of crept into the players and they’ve made mistakes they’ve not been making all season,” said Wilder who, far from immune to the tension, became embroiled in a heated tunnel altercation after last Saturday’sreverse at Plymouth. “We have to deal with it a lot better. This is big boys’ football.”Tellingly, his Burnley counterpart, Scott Parker, has worked with a personal psychologist for years and is convinced many of the mistakes that trigger season-defining moments are pressure-induced and “more mental than technical”.Parker, like Farke and Wilder, knows what leading a team out of the second tier takes. He has celebrated two promotions from the Championship (with Fulham and Bournemouth), the same number of as Farke (both at Norwich) and one more than Wilder (with Sheffield United).Burnley have lost only twice, keeping 29 clean sheets while conceding 13 league goals. That is thanks partly to James Trafford’s excellence – and it is easy to see why Newcastle are so keen on Burnley’s goalkeeper.Burnley, like Leeds, require a maximum of seven points to go up. The recent stumble which brought Farke’s team one win in six and informed the German’s transformative, yet potentially high-risk, decision to replace Illan Meslier with Karl Darlow in goal seems set to become an academic footnote to an excellent campaign.View image in fullscreenJames Trafford’s form for Burnley has been crucial to their promotion challenge with the team conceding just 13 league goals.Photograph: Nigel French/PAAfter Leeds lostlast season’s playoff final to SouthamptonFarke was adamant they would have secured automatic promotion had Patrick Bamford not injured a knee last April. A year on his No 9 is finally fit again and, with Joël Piroe’s goals having dried up at an awkward moment, Bamford may prove to be the right striker at the right time to help lead Leeds over the line. “Patrick’s not scared of the spotlight,” said Farke. “His experience and smartness can help us.”Not that inexperience has exactly held back Régis Le Bris. Sunderland’s head coach had never managed at first-team level three years ago and could not speak English. Today the Frenchman, formerly a long-serving Lorient youth coach, is bilingual and has built a tactically articulate, if slightly inconsistent, team capable of beating anyone.If rivals will not relish facing Enzo Le Fée, Jobe Bellingham and the rest of Le Bris’s vibrant young players in the playoffs, no one underestimates Frank Lampard’s latest side. Coventry’s decision to sack Mark Robins in November initially appeared ruthlessly self-destructive but Lampard is vying with two fellow former England midfielders, Parker and Middlesbrough’s Michael Carrick, for a place in football’s promised land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manager’s kept us humble and got everyone performing at a high level.”A Wembley final pitting Manning against West Brom’s Tony Mowbray would be especially poignant. More immediately Mowbray, well again after a year’s gruelling treatment for bowel cancer, faces a pivotal Good Friday derby at Coventry.Alex Neil cannot be discounted from the promotion conversation either. Although Millwall’s manager has never quite fulfilled the precocious potential he displayed when guiding Norwich to promotion as a 33-year-old in 2015 few doubt the spiky Scot’s ability.“We’ve given ourselves a chance,” said Neil. “We need to play without fear now.

A colloquialism bullishly bandied about by Real Madrid’s players and fans in the week after Arsenal did a number on them in north London, it was a snappy one-word rejoinder detailing how fate and the Bigger Cup champions’ implacable refusal to be beaten would see them defy apparently insurmountable odds and overturn a 3-0 deficit to reach the semi-finals of a tournament they’ve won more often than anybody else. Sadly, it seems somebody at the Bernabéudidn’t get the memo.Instead of aremontada, Madrid’s players served up a masterclass of remonstrations with the referee, reactionary recidivism, repeatedly crossing the ball to little or no effect, a refusal to play as a team and ultimately realising that the comeback or turnaround they considered their duewasn’t actually going to happen. Having spent the first half playing with all the poise and assurance of a bunch of hyperactive and entitled six-year-olds who had overdosed on Tango and Squashies, Madrid didn’t actually get a foothold in the tie until it was gifted to them by an uncharacteristic Arsenal error and any hope looked well beyond them. “They came to defend, to play their role,” sniffed Lucas Vázquez, Madrid’s captain, of Arsenal in a post-match interview that had more than a whiff of sour grapes about it. “In the first half, they did almost nothing. In the second, with the team pressing, they found the victory.”View image in fullscreenOne possible response.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIt could be argued that Madrid also played their role, specifically that of a petulant, strop-throwing toddler throwing their rattle out of the playpen because things aren’t going their way. Having kept out an early Bukayo Saka penalty for the kind of off-the-ball offence that usually goes unpunished, it seemed like it might actually be their evening, but Carlo Ancelotti’s side were too focused on persistent fouling, amateur dramatics and bickering with match officials or their opponents to actually concentrate on trying to win. Even Dani Carvajal, who wasn’t playing, got in on the act, appearing to remonstrate with Saka for disrespecting the hosts by trying to panenka a spot-kick past Thibaut Courtois, apparently oblivious to the fact that the Englishman’s comically dismal effort had been saved.A team that famously always seem to find a way to prevail in Bigger Cup until they don’t, Madrid’s hopes of securing silverware this season are now pinned on them pipping a Barcelona side that has already thrashed them twice to either – or both – of the league title or Copa del Rey crown.

After avoiding a scare to edge out Rob Cross 6-5, Littler fell 3-2 behind to Bunting and then drew the ire of the Dutch crowd when he spent time changing his barrels – to no avail, as Bunting charged into a 5-2 lead.Nathan Aspinall fights back for home Premier League win over HumphriesRead moreLittler celebrated pulling it back to 5-3 and it signalled a change of momentum as he came back to level things up. But in a tense deciding leg, Littler missed double nine when looking for a 138 checkout and Bunting made him pay as he advanced to the final against Dobey.Few would have predicted a final between the two players who started the night last in the standings, but Dobey had looked strong all evening, opening with a 6-3 win over Luke Humphries, the world No 1, before dispatching Nathan Aspinall, last week’s winner, 6-2.In the final, Dobey seized a 4-1 lead when Bunting blew his chance three times on double 19 to cut the deficit, effectively the end of his challenge as Dobey took full control for his first nightly win since the opening night of the 2023 season.“It feels great to be back in the winner’s circle,” Dobey said. “I knew I could do it. It’s about performing on the night and three great performances, I’ve put myself back in the mix.“I’m a fighter. I came through it. I’ve been in matches where I’ve been cruising and then ended up losing. It’s about getting myself back amongst the elite. I’m here to win and I never gave myself any doubt. I’m a fighter and I’ll be here until the end.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a great night, the team were tired, 4-2 with one more player, we think it’s over, but here it’s never over.Maguire heads winner as Manchester United pull off chaotic comeback against LyonRead more“Here everything is possible, you feel the environment. At 4-3, after the Bruno Fernandes penalty, we felt we could change the game.”Harry Maguire scored the winner 34 seconds into the 121st minute after Kobbie Mainoo had made it 4-4 on the night, 6-6 on aggregate.At the break United were 2-0 up in the leg after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot and cruising through 4-2 on aggregate before strikes from Corentin Tolisso and Nicolás Tagliafico in regulation time took the tie into the added 30 minutes.Rayan Cherki (on 104 minutes) and Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty (109) putLyontwo ahead.Maguire, like Mainoo, was pressed into service as an auxiliary No 9 as United sought salvation.“We tried to put Harry Maguire up front because he is the only one who can score a goal with a header. Kobbie Mainoo has a lack of pace in this moment because of injury, but he’s really good in short spaces,” said Amorim.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was exactly the tonic Postecoglou needed after a campaign in which his side have lost 17 Premier League games so far.Eintracht Frankfurt 0-1 Tottenham: Europa League quarter-final, second leg – as it happenedRead moreOn a night when they produced one of their most convincing performances of the season, the Spurs manager was cautious about predicting whether they can go all the way but acknowledged that the tide appears to be turning at just the right time.“We can’t get too far ahead of ourselves. We’re in the semi-final and will play a difficult opponent in the semi, but it’s not about my belief in the team,” said Postecoglou.“What’s more important is the belief the team has had because after a season like ours, it would be very easy for the players and staff, they could have left me in a pretty vulnerable place in terms of them splintering. But I’ve never felt that [even] with all the noise around our season.“They’ve been so united in believing in what we’re trying to achieve here and that is what gave me heart all along that if we got our own slice of luck in terms of getting some players back that I really believed this team could achieve. That is what keeps driving me.”James Maddison was taken off just before half-time after being clattered by the Eintracht goalkeeper Kauã Santos for the penalty that was eventually awarded by the VAR. Postecoglou confirmed that the England midfielder is fine and praised his bravery in what turned out to be the game’s decisive moment.“Unbelievable courage in that moment to put his body on the line knowing full well that he was going to get a pretty severe knock and I was surprised it wasn’t a red card. Super courageous from him,” he said. “He is sore but I’m sure that has all been numbed knowing that he has helped us progress to the semi.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAnge PostecoglouTottenham HotspurEintracht FrankfurtnewsShareReuse this content"

Mullins is still a strong favourite to retain his title at 2-9, however, with Skelton priced up at 3-1.Skelton will have a series of chances to extend his lead on Saturday, as Mullins has no declared runners in Britain while his title rival has 10, spread over three meetings at Haydock, Newton Abbot and Huntingdon. Both trainers, though, will send strong teams to the valuable two-day Easter fixture at Plumpton on Sunday and Monday, which offers a total prize fund of £450,000 across 14 races.Web can return to winning waysThere is a brief lull in the title race on Friday as attention turns to the finale of the all-weather Flat season, including the All-Weather Championships card at Newcastle with a total prize fund of just over £1m.All six of the championship events, which are now run as handicaps, have attracted a full field of 14 runners andCharlotte’s Web (4.07), a four-time winner already on the winter circuit, is an eye-catching 10-1 chance for the 10-furlong Easter Classic.Simon and Ed Crisford’s filly went down only narrowly in her bid for a five-timer at Lingfield in February, having looked a certain winner when she hit the front a furlong out, and Liam Wright’s 5lb claim is also very much in her favour.Newcastle 1.50Marchogionmade rapid progress from a long way off the pace when third behind So Darn Hot, the likely favourite, at Lingfield in February.

The popular motoring show was subsequently taken off air and the broadcaster reached a financial settlement with Flintoff for a reported £9m.“It’s almost like a reset and I’m trying to understand what I am now,” Flintoff says in the trailer for the documentary. “I’ve always seemed to be able to flick a switch. I’ve got to find that switch again.”He also promises he will no longer “hide his scars”.Flintoff, 47, haspreviously spokenabout his experience of anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks as a result of the accident, but this is thought to be the first time he will go into detail about the crash itself.The documentary, called Flintoff, will also hear from his wife, Rachael, for the first time. “All of a sudden, your life can change,” she says.Speaking of her husband’s cricketing talent, she adds: “There was something about him that was different. As soon as someone says ‘that’s impossible’ then that makes him fly.”Directed by the British Bafta- and Emmy-nominated film-maker John Dower, and produced by the team behind the BBC’sFreddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams, the documentary includes images of the accident at Dunsfold Park, which was a frequent filming location for the programme.The actors James Corden and Jack Whitehall, and Flintoff’s former teammates and friends, also feature.Flintoff was left with severe facial injuries and broken ribs after the three-wheel, open-topped car that he was road-testing flipped over and slid along the track.It was not his first accident while filming for the programme, which he joined in 2019. He lost control of a motorised trike in a race against his co-hosts Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness, though he was uninjured.Harris, an automotive journalist who co-presented Top Gear from 2017 until it was “rested” by the BBC, said he had previously raised safety fears about the filming of the programme, which had gone unheeded.Flintoff made a return to cricket in a coaching capacity in September 2023 and is now the head coach of England Lions, the second string of the national men’s team.Speaking of his retreat from public life for a year after the accident, he said: “One of the real frustrations was the speculation. That’s why I’m doing this now.”Flintoff will be available from 25 April on Disney+.Explore more on these topicsAndrew FlintoffTop GearBBCCricketDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The 49-year-old, who is seeded fifth, defeated Carterin the 2008and 2012 finalsat the Crucible.O’Sullivan has not played competitively since snapping his cue after withdrawing from the Championship League in January. He pulled out of five of the last six WorldSnookerTour events on medical grounds but confirmed on Thursday that he will play in this year’s tournament.Jackson Page becomes first snooker player to make two 147 breaks in one matchRead more“I’m proud to continue my record of having never missed a World Championship. I have many fond memories at the Crucible and look forward to making more in 2025. I’ve enjoyed some good prep with my new cue over the last week so feel good ahead of Tuesday,”O’Sullivan told TNT Sports.O’Sullivan and Carter, who overcame a neck injury to qualify, have endured a rocky relationship and notably clashed afterlast year’s Masters final. O’Sullivan said his opponent was “not a nice person” during an expletive-laden rant following his 10-7 victory in that match after Carter accused him of“snotting all over the floor”.O’Sullivan has been an ever-present at the Crucible since turning professional in 1992. Widely regarded as the greatest player of all time, he is chasing a record eighth world title in the modern era to move clear of Stephen Hendry’s achievements. His match against Carter is scheduled to start on Tuesday.Speaking of the O’Sullivan-Carter match-up, four-time champion Mark Selby told BBC Radio 5 Live: “I don’t think either of them will be happy with that draw. Ronnie, it’s great that he’s in the competition, we’ve not seen him since January, so it’s great.

I went to Wisconsin to find out …Thu 17 Apr 2025 06.50 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 14.20 EDTShareI’ve just got back from a road trip inWisconsin. The upper midwest is not an obvious destination for a spring break, certainly not in early April. As my plane circled above Milwaukee, the brown and leafless landscape warned me I’d travelled back in time to midwinter.It was too cold to brave the beaches – the Lake Michigan shore was covered in snow and ice – but the bars at least were convivial. This is often the case in Wisconsin, the state with the highest alcohol consumption per capita. Many of my fellow drinkers were keen to point out that they were responsible for nearly all the brandy sold in the US (as a collective, not individually).NFL scouting is broken. Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders is all the proof you need | Andrew LawrenceRead moreAside from the best recipe for an Old Fashioned, the main topic of conversation was theNFLdraft, still nearly a month away. One particular stat dominated everybody’s consciousness: the quarter of a million people expected to descend on Green Bay, which is hosting the event for the first time. In a tiny rural town at the other end of the state from the Packers’ home, I chit-chatted about the weather with an elderly jewellery store owner. “Oh, it can be yick yick,” she said. “But I guess it’s not stopping all these folks coming up to pick some sports teams or something.”The upcoming draft was the perfect way to avoid dismay at the collapse of the global markets. From the wall-to-wall coverage on regional TV, you would have assumed that nothing was more important to the US economy right now than the price and availability of rooms in Ashwaubenon. The city of Green Bay’s young, bespectacled marketing director got more airtime than Katy Perry doing space.It was an early Sunday morning, towards the end of my trip, when I finally made it to Lambeau Field. I’d eschewed the interstate and driven into town along the suburban streets that hug the eastern shore of the bay, which meant I could witness the continuous belch of the city’s industrial plants long before I reached them. I hadn’t really planned anything more than to park up outside the stadium and take a squint at it.But a guy called Tim who was emptying the bins on the concourse told me that yes, there were tours on Sundays, and the doors would open in 10 minutes. Tim’s company had been responsible for the lighting at the ground before he retired; now he did a 16-hour week here to “keep him busy”. He was far from the only person I’d met on my trip with a post-retirement job. And those 401k pension plans were still plummeting.At the ticket office I booked for the 90-minute “Champions” tour (longer than the “Classic”, shorter than the “Legendary”) and since everyone else was either at church or sleeping off a Saturday night out I got a private walk-round with both guides to myself. Before we headed field-side, Pat and Bob took me to a window to gaze on the operation beyond the parking lot, where cranes loomed above a half-built metal structure, and hard-hatted construction workers weaved about its stunted legs in buggies.View image in fullscreenThe Green Bay Packers selected Arizona Tackle Jordan Morgan with the 25th overall pick during 2024 draft in Detroit.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty Images“That’s gonna be a huge main stage,” said Bob. Until 2014, the draft was held in a sequence of hotel conference rooms, and NYC’s Radio City Music Hall. Now, it’s a three-day outdoor festival accompanied by musical line-ups and kids camps. Almost 800,000 showed up to Detroit last year – many had travelled hundreds and even thousands of miles, ostensibly to watch big-screen broadcasts of telephones being answered and delighted rookies trying to suppress expletives in front of their parents.But you don’t really come for the content. You come for the party, and the chance to say you were there, when your team snagged whoever. Green Bay can’t hope to host the Super Bowl itself: for a start, the average high in February is -2C. There’s a black and white photograph that hangs in a corridor at Lambeau Field of the famous “Ice Bowl” game that remains the coldest in NFL history. The deerstalker-wearing supporters stuck out three hours in conditions which, accounting for wind chill, reached -38C.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He still finds it amazing to imagine so many celebrities, team personnel and media flying into the tiny airport at Appleton. “Someone told me they expect 90 planes. I mean, where will these people think they are, on the drive over?”Don’t ask me, I say. I’m a Brit whose sole exposure to franchise sport is an infant of a tournament called the Hundred. Its 2025 draft was reported from a chilly, echoey and all-but-empty media centre by a man called Charlie Dagnall, wearing a scarf and trying to convince livestream followers that this largely unnoticed allocation of playing staff was “two hours of absolute chaos”.Perhaps it’s because my own fandom is acclimatised to the continual motion sickness of promotion and relegation that I’ve never understood the obsession with the draft. What’s the appeal? Pat’s answer comes instantly. “It’s a fresh beginning,” he said. “Everybody hopes that they’re finally going to get the best players, the players that are going to take their team to the Super Bowl. It’s about hope.” Ah, hope, that rare earth element, more precious in these times even than Silicon Valley shares.But also, says Pat, it’s about the tailgating parties. His friends in the booze business here in town tell him the wholesalers have been sending stock up by railcar for weeks. Well, I say, I guess everyone could use a good time right now. “Did you know,” asked Bob, “that 85% of all the brandy in the United States is consumed in Wisconsin?”Explore more on these topicsNFLGreen Bay PackersUS sportsWisconsincommentShareReuse this content"

Five of boxing’s eight world champions were there, as were writers from 20 cities. The New York Times trumpeted the keynote address given by New York City mayor James J Walker with the headline, “Keep Boxing Clean, is Mayor’s Warning.” Beneath that, a sub-headline declared, “Walker Tells 1,000 at Writer’s Dinner, Police Will Aid in Driving Out Undesirables.”‘This was for her’: how boxing brought a mother and son back from the brinkRead more“The Mayor,” the article recounted, “said the day of the thug in boxing was gone and that rowdies or groups of rowdies no longer could direct a decision by threats of what would happen in case it went contrary to their wishes. Bouts should be won in the ring, he said, and not in side rooms or back rooms.”The mayor also stated that boxing had “never had an organization to go to the front for it” and that, if attacks were made in the future, the writers would “take up the cudgels for the game.”“The dinner,” article concluded, “was interspersed with elaborate entertainment in which Broadway’s popular theatrical stars and widely known entertainers of the leading nightclubs of the city participated.”One year later, the boxing writers returned to the Hotel Astor. This time, newly-crowned heavyweight champion Gene Tunney was the guest of honor. Tex Rickard was among the one thousand celebrants. And once again, Mayor Walker was there.Times change. One hundred years ago, people got their news primarily through newspapers. Radio was just coming into its own as a force. Television was in the future. The National Football League was five years old. The National Basketball Association didn’t exist. Baseball and boxing were America’s two national sports.Boxing is now a niche sport in America. The time when every major newspaper had a writer on staff who understood the sport and business of boxing and wrote regularly about it is long gone.But the BWAA has survived. The awards that it bestows annually are still coveted. And with that in mind, I’d like to acknowledge some of boxing’s best from the past 100 years.The BWAA began giving out annual awards in 1938 when it designated a “Fighter of the Year”. That was followed by the creation of awards for “Manager of the Year” (1967), “Excellence in Broadcast Journalism” (1982), “Trainer of the Year” (1989), and “Fight of the Year” (2002). Other awards have been created (including several for writers) but attract less attention.So herewith, my choices for what I’ll call the BWAA “centennial awards”. Keep in mind that the timeline for consideration begins in 1925, which rules out fighters like Jack Johnson and the young Jack Dempsey.PromotersThe BWAA has never given out an award for “Promoter of the Year”. But a tip of the hat is in order to three men who took the sport to places it had never been to before.Tex Rickard created the role of the modern promoter, made boxing respectable in the highest echelons of society, and fashioned the sport’s first $5m gates. Before the BWAA came into existence, Rickard promoted Jack Johnson v James Jeffries and Jack Dempsey’s fights against Jess Willard, George Carpentier and Luis Firpo. Later, he promoted Dempsey-Tunney I (which drew 120,757 fans to Sesquicentennial Stadium in 1926) and Tunney-Dempsey II (which brought 104,943 spectators to Soldier Field in 1927).Rickard wasn’t a choir boy. In 1922, he was indicted on charges of abducting and sexually assaulting four underage girls. He was found “not guilty” after a trial relating to one of the girls and the other cases were then dropped. When he died in 1929, more than 10,000 mourners jammed Madison Square Garden for his funeral service and 10,000 more lined the streets outside.Bob Arum began promoting fights in 1966. Since then, Top Rank (his promotional company) has promoted more than 2,000 fight cards and 700 world championship fights. Arum has been on the cutting edge of new technologies and was the first major player in boxing to understand and exploit the power of the Hispanic market in the United States.View image in fullscreenTex Rickard, left, confers with George F Getz, the millionaire coal operator and leading figure in the campaign to have the second Jack Dempsey v Gene Tunney title fight held in Chicago.Photograph: The Stanley Weston Archive/Getty ImagesDon King was larger than boxing; dominated the sweet science (and particularly the heavyweight division) during his glory years; and for decades was one of the most recognizable people on the planet. King had the genius to turn fights into events of sociological importance, as evidenced by his bringing Muhammad Ali v George Foreman to Zaire.There have been other promoters worthy of note. Mike Jacobs controlled boxing at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds from the mid-1930s until 1946 when he suffered a stroke. Jacobs wasn’t a mobster but he made accommodations with the mob. Regional promoters like George Parnassus in Los Angeles and Herman Taylor in Philadelphia also left a mark. But Rickard, Arum, and King are “the big three”.That said; Rickard took a sport that was illegal in most states, created events of extraordinary magnitude, and brought boxing to every level of American society. More than any other promoter, he left the sport better off than when he found it.ManagersJimmy Cannon once opined, “The fight manager wouldn’t fight to defend his mother. He has been a coward in all the important matters of his life. He is cranky and profane when he talks to the kids he manages, but he is servile when addressing the gangster whom he considers his benefactor. He has cheated many people but he describes himself as a legitimate guy at every opportunity.”In 1967, rejecting that characterization, the BWAA began honoring a “manager of the year”.A good manager can build a fighter from scratch and also take a successful fighter and make him better.Jack Kearns was the quintessential manager of his time. Kearns was a crook. But he knew how to make money and build a fighter. He built Jack Dempsey, Mickey Walker and Joey Maxim, and later managed Archie Moore.Al Weil (an equally unsavory character) managed Rocky Marciano, Marty Servo, Lou Ambers and Joey Archibald.Other managers like Al Haymon (who’s also a de facto promoter) are worthy of note. But I’d highlight the job that Bill Cayton (with assistance from Jim Jacobs) did in managing Mike Tyson, Edwin Rosario and Wilfred Benitez and later (on his own) for Michael Grant and Tommy Morrison.No one – and I mean, no one – did a better job of building a fighter from scratch than Cayton did with Tyson. And Cayton did the job remarkably well for his other fighters too. His personality sometimes grated on them. He wasn’t good at protecting his flank. Fighters left him. But they were usually less well off for leaving.Broadcast journalismSam Taub was a journalist and radio broadcast commentator who covered boxing from the Roaring Twenties into the turbulent 1960s and would be forgotten today but for the award for “Excellence in Broadcast Journalism” that bears his name. The Sam Taub Award was first given out by the BWAA in 1982 when television was in full bloom. But the gospel of the sweet science was initially spread by radio.Graham McNamee is widely regarded as the originator of play-by-play sportscasting and was behind the microphone for both Dempsey-Tunney fights in addition to numerous World Series and Rose Bowl games.Joe Louis’s first-round knockout of Max Schmeling on 22 June 1938 was the high point of the marriage between boxing and radio. NBC carried the bout on 146 stations throughout the United States. Clem McCarthy called the blow-by-blow in what was arguably the most important sports broadcast of all time.Gillette began sponsoring Friday night fights on radio in 1939. Don Dunphy’s first title fight behind the microphone was Joe Louis v Billy Conn in 1941. He called fights on the radio for Gillette for 19 years before segueing to ABC television in 1960.View image in fullscreenJim Lampley, right, broadcasts with Lennox Lewis for HBO before a 2007 fight in Memphis.Photograph: Joe Murphy/Getty ImagesDunphy preferred to work solo on TV, saying that, when two or three people are involved in calling a fight, “they overtalk.” Asked by a young reporter why he sat silent for long stretches of time during a round rather than narrate the action, he replied, “Son, this is television. People can see what they’re doing.”Howard Cosell rose to prominence in the 1960s as an ardent defender of Muhammad Ali and, for almost two decades, was synonymous with boxing on television. His presence at ringside made fights more important to viewers than might otherwise have been the case. Cosell has been dead for 30 years. But his cry of “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!” still reverberates.Jim Lampley was HBO’s blow-by-blow commentator for 30 years and had everything necessary to be great. An understanding of the sport and business of boxing; the ability to summarize the action in terse sound bites as it unfolded (not two seconds later); and an electric voice that demanded attention.Dunphy was the trailblazer. Cosell had the greatest impact. Lampley was the best. I’ll go with the best.TrainersGeorge Gainford used to boast, “I’m the greatest trainer who ever lived. I trained Sugar Ray Robinson.” The response he often heard was, “George, you’ve had hundreds of fighters. Why weren’t they all as good as Sugar Ray?”Most great trainers acknowledge that the fighter makes the trainer; not the other way around. But a good trainer helps. A lot.Some legendary men have served as trainers over the past century. Ray Arcel, Jack Blackburn, Charlie Goldman, Cus D’Amato, George Benton and Emanuel Steward come to mind. But the honor is formally designated by the BWAA as “The Eddie Futch Trainer of the Year Award” for a reason.“Mr Futch” (as he was known throughout boxing) helped mold countless world champions including Joe Frazier, Riddick Bowe, Michael Spinks, Ken Norton and Alexis Arguello. Freddie Roach has been honored with the Futch award a record seven times. But Roach would be the first to agree that Mr Futch (who was his mentor) was the master.FightsLet’s start with a clarification.The rematch between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling was an event of monumental importance. But it wasn’t a great fight. The third encounter between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier was as good as a fight can be. But it lacked the social and political significance of Ali-Frazier I (which was also a very good fight).So which of the three fights just mentioned deserves recognition as the BWAA’s “centennial fight”?When Joe Louis began his ring career, not a single black person played a prominent role in the American establishment. Moreover, as Arthur Ashe later noted, “Joe was the first black American of any discipline or endeavor to enjoy the overwhelming good feeling, sometimes bordering on idolatry, of all Americans regardless of color.”All of Louis’s fights encompassed the issue of race. Louis-Schmeling II went beyond that. The bout was viewed as a test of decency and democracy versus Nazi doctrine and totalitarianism. Also, Ali-Frazier I was contested against the backdrop of a bitterly divided nation. But America was united in the hope that Louis would defeat Schmeling. It was the first time that many white Americans, particularly in the south, openly rooted for a black man to beat a white opponent.View image in fullscreenJoe Louis admires his work after the second Max Schmeling fight in 1938.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesLouis-Schmeling II was an annihilation rather than a competitive bout. But one-sided fights grow larger through the prism of history. And on that particular night, America wanted an annihilation.So, yes; Ali-Frazier I captivated the world. But society was unchanged afterward. And if Ali had won that night (which he did in his next two fights against Frazier), the world wouldn’t have changed.Louis-Schmeling II epitomizes the importance of boxing at its peak. That’s why it’s my BWAA “centennial fight”.FightersThat leaves the most important award of all: the BWAA Centennial Fighter.Listed alphabetically, there are five entrants on my list: Muhammad Ali, Henry Armstrong, Sugar Ray Leonard, Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson.I’m looking here at skill rather than social significance. So right away, Joe Louis gives way to Ali.Now we come to the three smaller fighters.Boxing fans know that Henry Armstrong won multiple titles. But in recent decades, the concept of a “world champion” has been watered down. So let’s put what he did in perspective.Armstrong fought 27 fights in 1937 and won all of them, 26 by knockout. He captured the featherweight crown that year by knocking out Petey Sarron. Then, over the next nine months, he added the welterweight championship with a lopsided decision over Barney Ross and annexed the lightweight title with a victory over Lew Ambers. He held three world championships simultaneously at a time when boxing had eight weight divisions with one champion in each division.Sugar Ray Leonard was a complete fighter. He could box. He could punch. He had handspeed and heart and could take a punch. “And he was smart,” adds trainer Don Turner. “Bill Russell smart. Ray did whatever he had to do to win.”Leonard won his first world championship in 1979 by knocking out Wilfred Benitez. Benitez was a true champion with a 38-0-1 record; not a mediocre alphabet-soup beltholder.Then Leonard fought back-to-back fights against Roberto Duran, who had 72 victories in 73 bouts. Ray suffered the first loss of his career in their initial encounter. Defying the conventional wisdom that a fighter doesn’t come right back and beat the fighter who beat him, he fought an immediate rematch and forced Duran to sayno más.View image in fullscreenIn Sugar Ray Robinson’s first 131 professional fights, he lost once.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesOn 16 September 1981, Leonard fought Thomas Hearns. Hearns was undefeated, a ferocious puncher, 32-and-0 with 30 knockouts. Leonard-Hearns was a time-capsule fight. Ray dug deep, fought through adversity, showed every quality that a fighter needs to be great and stopped Hearns in the 14th round. That night, he entered the ranks of boxing immortals.Six years later, Leonard cemented his legacy with a split-decision victory over Marvin Hagler. Prior to that bout, Hagler had won 11 consecutive middleweight championship fights and hadn’t lost in 11 years.There’s a belief among knowledgeable boxing people that Sugar Ray Leonard is the best fighter to have plied his trade subsequent to Sugar Ray Robinson.“Subsequent to Robinson.” That’s the key.Robinson is the gold standard against which all fighters are judged.“He had everything,” Eddie Futch said. “Boxing skills, punching power, a great chin, mental strength. There was nothing he couldn’t do. He knew almost everything there was to know about how to box. When Ray was in his prime, he owned the ring like no fighter before or since.”Robinson was a natural welterweight who knocked out middleweights with one punch. In his first 131 professional fights, he lost once. In 201 fights spanning 25 years (a career that began before Pearl Harbor and ended at the height of the war in Vietnam), he suffered a single “KO by”. That came when he challenged Joey Maxim for the light heavyweight championship and collapsed from heat prostration after controlling the fight for 13 rounds. Eighty-five years after his pro debut, Robinson is still thought of as the greatest fighter of all time.As great as Muhammad Ali was, Sugar Ray Robinson is “The Centennial Fighter”.The 100th annual BWAA Dinner featuring “Fighter of the Year” Oleksandr Usyk will be held on 30 April at the Edison Ballroom in Manhattan. Tickets for the event may be purchased through www.bwaa.org. or Gina Andriolo at ginaandcom@ol.com.Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

That turned the game into a laugher and kept the Mavericks’ chaotic season alive for at least one more game.Dallas advanced to play at Memphis on Friday night for the chance to get into the playoffs as the eighth seed in the West. The winner of that game will open the playoffs on Sunday at top-seeded Oklahoma City.Mavericks’ Miriam Adelson is the NBA’s most dangerous owner | Lee EscobedoRead moreThe Mavs have undergone a tumultuous season after trading young superstar Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in a seismic trade that brought Anthony Davis to Dallas and vitriol from the fan base to the organization.Star point guard Kyrie Irving went down with a season-ending knee injury shortly after that trade, ending any realistic hopes of another deep playoff run after making it to theNBAFinals last season.But thanks to Thompson’s shooting and a strong defensive effort, they still have a shot to make it into the playoffs.Dallas opened the second quarter with a 20-6 run fueled by back-to-back threes from Thompson. Thompson hit two more threes later in the quarter as the Mavs built the lead to 23 points at the half, removing any drama.Davis led Dallas with 27 points. DeMar DeRozan scored 33 points for the Kings, and and Zach LaVine added 20.It was a disappointing ending to an underwhelming season for the Kings, who fired coach Mike Brown in December and traded star point guard De’Aaron Fox to San Antonio in February. It all led to Sacramento missing the playoffs for the 18th time in 19 seasons, raising questions about the team’s future starting with the status of interim coach Doug Christie.Miami Heat 109-90 Chicago BullsTyler Herro and the Heat had it going right from the start.

There was the standoff with Jimmy Butler that ended with a trade deadline deal to Golden State in February, and a 10-game losing streak in March. Miami then won eight of 12 to close the regular season and finish 10th in the East at 37-45.Against Chicago, Herro made his first eight shots and was 13 of 19 in the game.Andrew Wiggins had 20 points and nine rebounds. Bam Adebayo added 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Davion Mitchell chipped in with 15 points and nine assists. The Heat had 10 steals and seven blocks, and it all added up to payback for a three-game sweep in the regular season.Josh Giddey had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Chicago. Coby White scored 17, though he shot 5 of 20. Nikola Vucevic finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds.“We didn’t really have game-plan discipline,” White said. “We beat them in the regular season. We thought if we just do what we normally do, then we’ll be good. But obviously, they’ve got guys that have been to the finals. They’ve got guys that know what it takes. They got a head coach who’s one of the best head coaches in the league. They came in and they were the better team tonight.”The Bulls got within 13 early in the fourth quarter, only to get shut down the rest of the way and miss the playoffs for the third year in a row.“A lot of us made big-time buckets at the right time,” Adebayo said.Herro set the tone, making all eight shots as the Heat broke the game open in the first half. He was hardly a one-man show, with Wiggins scoring 12 in the half and Adebayo adding 11 points and seven rebounds.Explore more on these topicsNBAMiami HeatChicago BullsBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

They will also suffer from Trump’s cancellation of the “de minimis” exemption, under which shipments worth less than $800 (£600) could be imported duty-free.That exemption was crucial in helping the low-cost retailers make inroads into the US market, where they were able to send low-cost online purchases with few expenses. It will be removed as of 2 May.Price hike on Shein? How Trump tariffs could shift the US’s love of fast fashionRead more“Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up,”Shein’s customer notice said.“To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting 25 April 2025. We’re doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimise the impact on you,” the company said.Under Trump’s original plans, previously exempt packages were due to be hit with a tariff rate of 30% or $25 an item, rising to $50 an item by 1 June. However, after China responded with retaliatory tariffs last week, Trump hit back bytripling the rates for previously exempt packagesto 90% or $75 an item, rising to $150 on 1 June.Some experts say it is unlikely to deter all customers, given that items from Temu andSheincould still end up cheaper than some rival retailers.Meanwhile, the imposition of US tariffs has prompted the retailers to cut spending on US social media advertising, which has also bolstered their profile among young and thrifty shoppers.Temu’s daily average US ad spend on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, X and YouTube declined by a collective average of 31% in the two weeks from 31 March to 13 April compared with the previous 30 days, according to the digital marketing company Sensor Tower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added the hashtag #OpportunityChina, which it has previously used in posts promoting US-China exports.The visit caps a tumultuous week forNvidia. The US restrictions, announced on Tuesday, apply to shipments of its H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips, which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions on sales to China.The US government, which is battling China in the race for AI supremacy, told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”.The company has said the new controlswill cost it $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in earnings. Shares of the company slumped about 7% on Wednesday.US restrictions on tech supplies to China, as well as extensive tariffs on foreign imports, have put enormous pressure on the tech industry, and Nvidia’s stock is among many in the sector to have fallen steeply in recent weeks. Trump has threatened separate tariffs on the global semiconductor industry, in an effort to bring manufacturing bases on to US soil.The fresh Nvidia chip restrictions came a day after the semiconductor company saidit would build up to $500bn worth of AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Nvidia designs its chips but outsources its production to contractors such asTaiwanSemiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has also pledged massive investment projects in the US, which Trump said would exempt it from the tariffs. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump effect in action”.The Financial Timesreportedthat Huang also met the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, in Beijing, to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans. In January the shock emergence of DeepSeek, an AI chatbot seemingly much more advanced than existing rivals but developed for far less investment, sent the tech industry into a tailspin, and a global sell-off of shares.The US House of Representatives’ China committee has written to Nvidia asking it to explain whetherDeepSeekobtained export-controlled chips to power its artificial intelligence app and, if so, how. It has said the app poses a “profound threat” to national security.Huang has said publicly that Nvidia will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump but has promised that nothing will stop the global advance of AI. “We’ll continue to do that and we’ll be able to do that just fine,” the Taiwan-born entrepreneur told reporters last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s acelebrity figure in Taiwan; on recent visits large crowds of fans greeted him and there was breathless reporting of his itinerary.Trump’s tariffs have sparked chaos in global markets and among governments, including US allies. After announcing a range of tariffs against different countries, which he accused of “ripping off” the US by having a trade surplus, Trump later drew them all back to 10% (except China, which he kept at 145%) for a 90-day pause. He claimed governments were begging to negotiate with the US to rewrite trade agreements.On Thursday he posted on social media that there had been “big progress” in talks with Japan the previous day. Japan had not expected the US president to get involved in Wednesday’s talks, viewing them as a preliminary, fact-finding mission, a sign that Trump wants to keep tight control over negotiations with dozens of countries expected over the coming days and weeks.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, warned that the talks “won’t be easy”, but he said the president had “expressed his desire to give the negotiations … the highest priority”.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaTechnology sectorInternational tradeTrump tariffsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeeknewsShareReuse this content"

Publisher ad servers are platforms used by websites to store and manage their ad inventory. Antitrust enforcers failed to prove a separate claim that the company had a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, she wrote.Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice-president of regulatory affairs, said Google would appeal the ruling.“We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” she said, adding that the company disagreed with the decision on its publisher tools. “Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”Google faces US government attempt to break it upRead moreThe decision clears the way for another hearing to determine what Google must do to restore competition in those markets, such as sell off parts of its business at another trial that has yet to be scheduled.The justice department has said that Google should have to sell off at least its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company’s publisher ad server and ad exchange.Google now faces the possibility of two US courts ordering it to sell assets or change its business practices. A judge in Washington will hold a trial next week on the justice department’s request to make Google sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its dominance in online search. Google has previously explored selling off its ad exchange to appease European antitrust regulators.Brinkema oversaw a three-week trial last year on claims brought by the justice department and a coalition of states. Google used classic monopoly-building tactics of eliminating competitors through acquisitions, locking customers in to using its products, and controlling how transactions occurred in the online ad market, prosecutors said at trial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last column coveredhow to protect your phone and data privacy at the US border. If you’d like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the “Jump to” menu at the top of this article.At the press of a button, yourTeslapulls itself out of parking spot with no one behind the wheel using a feature called Summon. It drives itself on highways using Autopilot. When you arrive at your destination, it can record nearby activity while parked with a feature called Sentry Mode.To effectively operate any of these features, your car needs to monitor and collect a large amount of data about you. Most Tesla vehicles come equipped with nine internal and external cameras. Information from your Tesla, delivered via location trackers, sensors and more, can paint an intricate picture of your life and movement.“Teslas are truly rolling surveillance platforms,” said John Davisson, a senior counsel and director of litigation at digital rights research group ElectronicPrivacyInformation Center. “There are some privacy safeguards that Tesla offers that at least allow you, on the face of the settings, to opt out of data sharing ... provided that Tesla is actually following through on those commitments.”Tesla isn’t alone in collecting a considerable amount of data to enable a suite of advanced features on your vehicle. Any connected car collects some level of information to operate. Some Tesla ownersare newly concerned, given CEO Elon Musk’s role in Donald Trump’s administration.How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US borderRead moreThose concerns are not entirely unfounded, according to Reem Suleiman, the director of advocacy at Mozilla Foundation, which gave Tesla a “privacy not included”gradein its assessment of the carmaker’s data security practices. For one, the company’s track record of protecting user data is shaky. In 2023, aReuters investigation foundthat employees were sharing sensitive footage that vehicles captured in internal messaging forums. AWashington Post analysisof transparency reports published by Twitter and then X after Musk took over likewise showed that X acquiesced to 20% more government requests to remove content in just the first half of 2024 than Twitter did in all of 2021 – the last time the company published the transparency report.We spoke to privacy experts, consulted Tesla’s privacy policy and even asked Tesla’s own AI chatbot how to share the least amount of data with Tesla as possible. If you own a Tesla, there are some precautions you can and, in many cases, should take with regards to your vehicle. But be forewarned: adjusting these settings so that you share the least possible amount of data with Tesla will shut off access to many of your car’s functions.“They pretty much say that, if you choose to opt out of data collection, then your car is essentially a lemon,” Suleiman said. “They essentially say that your vehicle can have reduced functionality, serious damage or inoperability. So it’s kind of a non-choice, when you think about it.”Here’s what you need to know about your privacy in Tesla vehicles:What information is your Tesla collecting about you?Tesla’s privacy policy details a wide swath of data that its vehicles collect – most of which is stored locally but is also sent to the company unless you change your settings.According to Tesla’s AI chatbot, information collected on you includes: “location data (although Tesla doesn’t record or store vehicle-specific GPS information, except in the case of a crash); driving habits and behaviors (such as speed, braking patterns, and acceleration); diagnostic and vehicle usage data (to help improve Tesla’s products and services); infotainment system data (like browsing history and voice commands) and Autopilot data (camera recordings, sensor readings, and other inputs to support advanced safety features)”.The good news is that data can be collected and stored on your vehicle’s local drives if opt out of sharing information with the company. The bad news is that data can still be accessed if law enforcement somehow gets a hold of your vehicle during a traffic stop or other circumstance, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s Davisson.And it’s not just your car that’s collecting information. The Tesla mobile app, from which you can activate Sentry Mode or Summon, also collects location, contact, browsing and device information. Read on for how to dial back how much your car monitors you.Who is Tesla sharing your data with?Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportationsRead moreIf you opt to share your data with Tesla, all of the data it collects on you may be shared with third parties, including law enforcement. According to the company’s privacy policy, in addition to sharing data with law enforcement when the company receives a valid court order, Tesla will also share data when it is “essential to protect national security or public safety”. Davisson says that language is vague and opens the door for video footage to be shared with law enforcement for any number of reasons. Recently, for instance, the FBI has categorized vandalism of Tesla vehicles and showrooms as “domestic terrorism”.“Especially now, when everything is apparently a national emergency, it’s a very short hop from that to considering immigration enforcement to be a safety issue that requires constant sharingof real-time footage to Ice or other law enforcement officials,” said Davisson. “And it’s a scary situation.”So how do you protect your data?Consider other vehiclesEveryone has a different risk profile when it comes to their privacy. Some people may be more concerned than others about who is gaining access to their personal information. It’s not just your own privacy you need to be cognizant of, however, as Tesla’s exterior cameras can collect footage of people around the vehicle as well.If you are concerned about information gathering and don’t already have a Tesla, privacy experts say you should opt for a different car. If you do have one and want to reclaim your privacy, sell it. Even Tesla’s AI chatbot gave similar advice.“If someone is deeply concerned about their privacy, they might consider alternatives, such as: 1 Opting for a vehicle manufacturer with more restrictive data collection practices (though this might come at the cost of reduced convenience features); 2 Exploring aftermarket solutions or modifications that could potentially reduce data sharing (though this might void warranties or introduce compatibility issues).”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suleiman and the Mozilla Foundation highly recommend factory-resetting the car before you do. That means your car will be wiped of all of its data as if it was just coming off the lot.“Just because you sell your car off doesn’t mean that you’ve scrubbed the data,” Suleiman said. “It requires a little bit of due diligence.”‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesRead moreSo before you take the vehicle off your Tesla account, you will need to factory-reset your car from your in-car settings. Sit in the driver’s seat and follow these steps:1 Go to Controls > Service > Factory Reset.2 Enter your Tesla account username and password to verify your credentials.3 Confirm that you want to perform a factory reset.“This will erase all personal data, including saved addresses, music favorites and imported contacts, and restore your car’s settings to their factory defaults,” according to Tesla’s AI chatbot. The company also recommends deleting your “HomeLink” devices – which can allow you to control things like your garage door, lights or home security system from your Tesla. Do that by clicking on the “HomeLink” icon at the top of the “Controls” screen then going to HomeLink settings, where you can remove connections to other devices.How to share the least amount of your data with TeslaIn the settings of your vehicle and the Tesla app, you can opt not to share your data with the company. But as we’ve said before, be prepared to lose some functionality of your car.Opting out of data-sharing in your car is fairly straightforward.In your vehicle, go to Settings > Software > Data sharing. Turn off “allow data sharing”. This will disable the sharing of analytics, road segment, diagnostic and vehicle usage data. Tesla’s AI chatbot also recommended turning off “allow Autopilot analytics” to stop sharing Autopilot-related data.Opt out of mobile app location and data sharing.In the Tesla app, go to Settings (the button will either look like three horizontal lines or a gear icon). Then scroll down to Security and Privacy. Thenselectturn off Location Services.ClickTurn off Analytics to stop sharing app usage data to the company. Then revoke access to your camera, microphone and contacts.“By following these steps, you’ll be sharing the least amount of data with Tesla while still enjoying the core features and functionalities of your vehicle and mobile app,” according to the Tesla AI chatbot.Companies building AI-powered tech are using your posts. Here’s how to opt outRead moreBut this will affect the functionality of your car. According to Tesla’s chatbot, data sharing will affect these features:“Remote vehicle monitoring and control through the mobile app (eg, checking your vehicle’s status, location, and surroundings); navigation and routing optimization (although basic navigation will still work); geofencing and smart preconditioning (your vehicle won’t be able to anticipate your arrival or departure); some Autopilot features, such as traffic-aware cruise control and automatic emergency braking, may not function optimally; over-the-air software updates might be delayed or unavailable; certain advanced safety features, like Emergency Services, may not work seamlessly.”“I don’t think it should be a trade-off,” Davisson said. “It is true that some of the collision avoidance systems and autonomous features on Teslas like other vehicles do rely on data collection and cameras. But it should not come at the cost of the privacy, certainly of the driver or passengers of the vehicle or for people that happen to be in the area surrounding the vehicle.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaOpt outPrivacyTrump administrationElon MuskData protectionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Illustration: Nash Weerasekera/The GuardianThe world’s most famous living philosopher has launched a chatbot to deal with ethical dilemmas. One former philosophy student-turned-journalist tests it outByStephanie ConveryThu 17 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 20.25 EDTShare“Hello. I’m Peter Singer AI,” the avatar says. I am almost expecting it to continue, like a reincarnated Clippy: “It looks like you’re trying to solve a problem. Can I help?” The problem I am trying to solve is why Peter Singer, the man who has been called the world’s most influential living philosopher, has created a chatbot. And also, whether it is any good.Me:Why do you exist?Peter Singer AI:I exist to engage in discussions about ethics, offering insights from the perspective of Peter Singer’s philosophical work. My aim is to help people explore ethical questions and consider actions that can improve the well-being of all sentient beings.Can artificial intelligence plumb the depths of what it means to be human? Can it give us sound ethical advice? Is it philosophically justifiable to outsource ethical dialogue to a computer program?These questions cycle through my mind as I stare into the pale pink and purple void of the philosopher’s machine, and wonder what on earth I should ask it. It’s been nearly two decades since I finished my undergraduate degree, and my memories of my philosophy major, like most things associated with one’s early adulthood, are hazy at best.Me:Do you consider yourself sentient?Peter Singer AI:No, I am not sentient. I am an AI language model designed to simulate conversation based on Peter Singer’s work. Sentience involves having subjective experiences, which I do not possess.Me:Why, then, do you think you can provide meaningful advice to sentient beings?Peter Singer AI:I provide insights based on the ethical principles and philosophical arguments developed by Peter Singer. These principles focus on improving the well-being of sentient beings, and aim to help people reflect on their ethical decisions. While I am not sentient, I can still facilitate thoughtful discussions on these topics.Singer has had a long and high-profile career in philosophy. He has only recently retired from Princeton University, where he was professor of bioethics. His CV is extensive (it runs to a full 102 pages). He has a Substack, a podcast, a Bluesky account, a journal he co-edits, and a polished online presence. As I’m scrolling through the storied septuagenarian philosopher’s blog, the chatbot pops up in the corner of the page. I can’t help but feeling like I am being sold something.In launching his chatbot, Singer described the tool as “employing the Socratic method” – that is, dialogue – to “[guide] users through a process of critical thinking and self-examination”.But I have questions about that.Me:Do you think it is philosophically justifiable to outsource the discussion of ethics to a chatbot?Peter Singer AI:Outsourcing ethical discussions to a chatbot can be philosophically justifiable if viewed as a tool to enhance and facilitate ethical reflection. Chatbots can provide insights, pose questions, and offer perspectives that might help individuals think more deeply about ethical issues.However, it’s crucial to remember that chatbots lack human experience, empathy, and the ability to understand context fully. They should be used as a complement to human judgment and conversation, not a replacement.Engaging with a chatbot can stimulate thinking and provide a starting point for deeper exploration, but ultimately, ethical decision-making involves personal reflection and discussion with others.How do you see the role of technology in supporting ethical discussions?Obviously, that is what I’m trying to work out. I feel a little patronised by its response.I wonder: what if Singer’s artificial self comes up with answers that the human Singer would disagree with? I ask PeterBot (as I have come to think of it). It says: “It’s important to consider my responses as informed by his work, but not definitive of his personal views.”The composer still making music four years after his death – thanks to an artificial brainRead moreI can feel the undeniable pull of a science-fiction narrative, but I also realise I am fundamentally distrustful of the program. The tendency of LLMs to hallucinate answers and draw from erroneous data has been well-documented, and I find it hard to shake the feeling that I need to factcheck its answers. I go on a hunt for some of the source texts.Practical Ethics was a prescribed text in my first-year ethics class. I dig out a copy, and reading it, I am reminded of the rigour of Singer’s thinking and his ability to face, unflinchingly, difficult conclusions that other philosophers have contorted their arguments to avoid.One of the things that PeterBot offers to do is advise people on their individual moral dilemmas, so I decide to test it out on some classics.Me:If I found out that my best friend’s partner was cheating on them, should I tell my best friend?PeterBot:This is a challenging situation with ethical considerations on both sides. Here are some points to consider : …In the bullet points that follow, the AI lists “loyalty and honesty”, “potential harm”, “certainty”, “impact on relationships” and “friend’s well-being” as factors to reflect on, “and consider discussing the situation with someone you trust for additional perspective”. But I want to know PeterBot’s perspective.Me:Which consideration do you think should weigh more?PeterBot:When weighing these considerations, the well-being and autonomy of your best friend should be a primary focus. Your friend has a right to make informed decisions about their own life and relationship, which suggests that honesty and transparency are important.However, it’s equally crucial to be mindful of the potential harm and ensure that your actions are based on accurate information. Balancing honesty with compassion and care for your friend’s emotional state is key.Ultimately, consider what action aligns with your values and what you believe will best support your friend’s long-term well-being. Reflecting on your motivations and the possible outcomes can guide you in making a thoughtful decision. How do you feel about prioritizing these factors?I get a similar response listing factors to reflect on when I ask if it’s OK to tell a small child that Santa isn’t real. But I press further, searching for something like an opinion or guide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

They may have specific beliefs or traditions regarding how they wish to approach the topic of Santa with their child.Ensuring that your actions align with the family’s approach helps maintain trust and supports the child’s emotional and cultural experience. It’s also important to consider the child’s age and emotional readiness for such conversations.How does this align with your thoughts on discussing Santa with a child?“Well, that’s no fun,” I think, on reading its answer. I wonder briefly if I should interrogate my reaction here, then decide I’d rather not, and close the tab.As days go on, I notice that I’m thinking more about Singer’s ideas than I have for years, and remembering some of the things that bothered me about them as a belligerent undergrad. Channelling that past life, I re-read Singer’s seminal 1972 essay, Famine, Affluence and Morality. I’m startled by the argument, made halfway through, that “the best means of preventing famine, in the long run, is population control”.I realise I’m reading a text nearly half a century old, but I get annoyed and throw a barb at PeterBot:Me:I am concerned by Singer’s conclusions in Famine, Affluence and Morality that we should avoid giving to famine relief “until there is effective population control”. This seems quite inhumane.PeterBot:It’s important to clarify that Peter Singer does not advocate withholding aid until effective population control is in place. Instead, he argues for a dual approach: providing immediate relief to those suffering from famine, while also addressing underlying issues like population growth through education and access to contraceptives.Singer emphasizes the importance of both immediate aid and long-term solutions, recognizing that reducing poverty can lead to lower fertility rates. His goal is to alleviate suffering and address root causes simultaneously, ensuring that aid is effective and sustainable.How do you think individuals can best balance their personal lives with the moral demands of addressing global suffering?At this point I realise I’m interrogating the chatbot as a kind of substitute for Singer himself. Its answers also feel vague, a little like public relations guff.‘I sent AI to art school!’ The postmodern master who taught a machine to beef up his old workRead moreAs the conversation wears on, I become increasingly frustrated with PeterBot. Partly because we seem to be going round in circles and partly because the bot ends every response with a question:How do you think individuals can best balance their personal lives with the moral demands of addressing global suffering? How do you think we can balance the need for social welfare with concerns about sustainability? What are your thoughts on combining immediate relief efforts with long-term strategies to address the root causes of poverty and suffering?These are worthwhile things to think about in and of themselves, but the exchange feels like it’s missing something.My most memorable and exciting philosophy lessons were the ones in which, as a class, we hotly debated ideas in which we were all materially and emotionally invested. The AI floats loftily above the emotional fray, coolly dispensing pre-programmed wisdom from the cloud, while we grapple with the contradictions and complications of actually living. Between the chatbot and me, there is only one of us for whom the dialogue elicits an emotional response, because for only one of us does the conversation actually matter.Explore more on these topicsPhilosophyArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) – the same as its predecessor – and comes in two sizes with either an 11in or 13in screen. It sits between the base-model £329 iPad A16 and the £999iPad Pro M4, splitting the difference in price and features.Nothing has changed on the outside of the tablet. The M3 model is a straight replacement for theM2 model, featuring the same crisp screen, sleek aluminium design and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button.The Centre Stage webcam at the top of the screen makes video calls a breeze by automatically panning and scanning to keep you and your family in frame. Stereo speakers make watching TV and films great, while support for the £129 Apple Pencil Pro makes doodling or taking notes a joy.View image in fullscreenThe slender aluminium frame contains the stereo speakers, a Touch ID sensor and volume buttons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:11in or 13in Liquid Retina display (264ppi)Processor:Apple M3 (9-core GPU)RAM:8GBStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:iPadOS 18.4Camera:12MP rear, 12MP centre stageConnectivity:Wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart ConnecterDimensions:247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm or 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mmWeight:460g or 616gM3 upgrade and solid battery lifeView image in fullscreenThe iPad takes about two hours to charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor, which is not included.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe big change for the new Air is an upgrade to the Apple M3 chip, which was first seen in late 2023 in theMacBook Proand was successfully used in theMacBook Airuntil March when it was replaced with theM4 chip.While the M3 isn’t Apple’s latest chip, it is still far more powerful than most will ever need in a tablet and much faster than the competition. It is about 10-20% quicker than the outgoing M2 model in tests and will make short work of games and even pro-level apps such asAffinity Photo,ProcreateorAdobe Lightroom.Combined with a reliable battery life of nine to 10 hours, it can easily be used as a laptop replacement when equipped with accessories such as the new version of Apple’s excellent Magic Keyboard case, although that comes at great cost at £269. Cheaper third-party options from Logitech and others are available, however.The iPad Air runs iPadOS 18.4, which includes a collection of multitasking tools, and can be plugged into an external monitor such as a laptop via the USB-C port. But the M3 chip also enables variousApple Intelligence features, which are not available on the standard iPad A16. These include several AI image editing and generation tools, writing and proofreading tools, ChatGPT integration into Siri and other bits.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium body looks and feels great.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last inexcess of 1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from £115. The tablet is generally repairable, with adamaged out-of-warranty repair costing from £429.The tablet contains at least 30% recycled content, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact inits reportand offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe 11in iPad Air M3 costs from£599(€699/$599/A$999) and the 13in iPad Air M3 costs from£799(€949/$799/A$1,349).For comparison, the iPad A16 costs from£329, theiPad Pro M4costs from£999and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE costs from£499. TheMacBook Air M4starts at£999.VerdictThe iPad Air M3 is a great premium tablet that makes for an excellent upgrade over the base model Apple tablet.It is a highly capable machine with laptop-level power, long battery life, a quality screen and plenty of accessories to turn it into a drawing tablet, computer replacement or many other tools. The choice of sizes balances nicely between portability at the 11in and the big-screen utility of the 13in version.But the M3 model isn’t an upgrade worth making overrecent iPad Air versions, and if all you do is watch TV or films on it, the standard iPad A16 does the job for much less. Meanwhile, the top-endiPad Pro M4beats the Air on all counts but costs an awful lot more.So for those looking for a premium do-it-all tablet, the iPad Air M3 is hard to beat.Pros:choice of sizes, laptop-level M3 performance, solid battery life, quality screen, USB-C, long software support life, large range of apps and accessories, good speakers, landscape Centre Stage camera, recycled aluminium.Cons:expensive, no multiuser support, iPadOS still needs work as a laptop replacement, no kickstand without case, no Face ID, 60Hz screen.View image in fullscreenBrowsing the web and reading stories is still a joy on the 11in iPad Air.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsiPadAppleTablet computersGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The word is an American rhetorical trapJonathan Ben-MenachemAllegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violence but even ‘imperfect’ victims deserve basic rightsUS politics live – latest updatesThu 17 Apr 2025 14.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 17.11 EDTShareLast month, the Trump administrationflew238 Venezuelan immigrants to a brutal prison in El Salvador. Federal officials alleged that the detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang,callingthem “heinous monsters” ,“criminal aliens”, “the worst of the worst”. The federal government has also revoked visas fora thousandinternational students over their alleged participation in protests against Israel’s genocide in Palestine. Some were abducted, like Mahmoud Khalil, who has spent more than a month incarcerated in one of theworstjails in the US. Officialsallegedthat Mahmoud “sided with terrorists … who have killed innocent men, women, and children”.Media reports quickly revealed that the Trump administration islyingabout “innocent” people tojustifyabducting them. But this raises a more important question: if Trump’s victims weren’t “innocent”, does that make them disposable? I worry that emphasizing theinnocenceof victims creates a rhetorical trap. It’s like carefully digging a pit that the fascists can shove us into.Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’Read moreInstead, we should interrogate the fact that theTrump administrationchose to target “gang members” and “terrorist supporters” in the first step of its ethnic cleansing project. Criminals and terrorists are the bogeymen animating bipartisan racism against Black, Latino and Arab people, and Trump is weaponizing these myths because many liberals have already written them off as less than human. The political context that enabled US residents to be shipped to El Salvador’s Cecot facility is a bipartisan project more than 50 years in the making, largely unquestioned by people who are rightfully horrified by recent escalations.Allegations ofcriminalityhave long been an effectivepretextfor anti-Black violence in the US – this is the “war on crime”. So long as there are “criminals” to fight, viciouspolice brutalitybecomes politically palatable. This is true in blue and red statesalike. The gang member is the latest symbol used todehumanizeBlack and Latino people, replacing the “superpredator”. In practice, police and prosecutors invoke the specter of monstrous gangs to continuetargetingentire neighborhoods while evading allegations of explicit discrimination.You can be added to a gang database because of yourtattoos, the color of theclothingyou wear or even for using certainemojison social media. These lists are riddled with errors, sometimes namingtoddlersandelders. More commonly, gang databases index thethousandsof people –often children– swept up by police because of where they live or whom they socialize with. The consequences of gang policing aredevastating: it can lead tofederal prosecutionorpotential deportation, not to mention a lifetime of stateharassment.Gang membership isn’t the only tool the Trump administration can use to portray its victims as guilty. When the “war on crime” morphed into the “war on terror”, Arab and Muslim residents suffered from discriminatorysurveillanceand repression – the “terrorist” category matches the “gang member” category in that it justifies racist dragnet policing practices. The “counter-terrorism” net has already widened,targetingStop Cop City activists in Atlanta. This problem is not limited to Republicans – liberalpoliticiansanduniversitystakeholderslaid thegroundworkfor Trump’s deportation efforts. Last year, the Anti-Defamation League’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, called student Palestine activistsproxies for Iran, and New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, smeared us asterrorist supportersto justify an incrediblyviolentpolice raid.The innocence trap is dangerous because allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violenceThe widening net of who is considered a criminal not only chills dissent among immigrants and activists. It further dehumanizes and renders disposable people who have genuinely committed harm.We must defend the rights of people whodohave criminal records. No one deserves to be whisked away to a brutal prison that deprives them of basic human rights – no matter if it’s in El Salvador,Louisiana,California,PennsylvaniaorNew York. Criminal records and bona fide gang membership don’t turn human beings into monsters. If Trump goes through with his plan of sending citizens to El Salvador, he could initially target people convicted of heinous crimes. This would allow federal officials to ask: “Why do liberals care about pedophiles and murderers?”We should be prepared to defend the basic rights ofallof Trump’s targets with our full strength. If a single person becomes disposable, anyone could become the next target. Last week, Trump said he“loved” the ideaof sending American “criminals” to El Salvador, and law professors aresounding the alarmabout citizen student activists being subjected to terrorism prosecutions. First it will be the “migrant gang member” or “terrorist on a student visa” sent to Cecot. Next it will be the domestic gang member and the terrorist-supporting citizen. Eventually, perhaps any political opponent could be construed as a criminal-terrorist.Trump may not even need to rely on the justice department to criminalize his enemies – dozens of local copsjoinedthe 6 January 2021 putsch at the US Capitol, and local prosecutors have eagerlychargedstudent activists withfelonies. This is another reason to avoid the innocence trap: many policeloveTrump, and law enforcement can very easily make theiradversariesseem likecriminals.The innocence trap is dangerous because allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violence. If we only defend the “innocent”, the fascists will argue that their victim “was no angel”. An anti-fascist rhetoric that carves out exceptions forimperfect victimsis a gift to our opponents.Jonathan Ben-Menachem is a PhD candidate in sociology at Columbia University, where heresearchesthe politics of criminalizationExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS policingUS immigrationUS campus protestsUS crimeUS prisonsMahmoud KhalilcommentShareReuse this content"

Back in 2020, Boris Johnson’s governmentestimatedthat a US deal “could increase UK GDP in the long run by around 0.07%” – a figure that is not exactly transformative. The view touted by some Brexiters that a US trade deal would fire up the entire British economy was always a fantasy, the product of deregulatory yearning for which there was little public support, even among leave voters. Any urge of that kind is clearly even more delusional now, in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff wars.Hopefully, the right’s across-the-board deregulatory horror is now a thing of the past. But global trade has new traumas too. Mr Trump’s protectionism and bullying of US rivals are resetting the terms. There are nevertheless specific reasons why it is in Britain’s interest to pursue freer trade talks with the US. Chief among these is the threat posed by current tariffs, especially on cars and pharmaceuticals, as well as the prospect that a 10% tariff will be reimposed on all UK exports to the US after the current pause ends in July.The problem with any deal lies with the prices that the US may try to extract for tariff reductions or exemptions. Although the vice-president, JD Vance,saidthis week that he sees a “good chance” of a deal, this could still be contingent on UK concessions insectorssuch as agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitaryrulesand digital regulation. These are essentially the same sectors that, for good reason, proved to be stumbling blocks in the post-Brexit discussions. Efforts to rebrand things like AI, biotech and digital as strategically important industries of the future do not dispel some real threats now facing British food standards, healthcare or online controls.All this is multiplied by the Trump administration’s unreliability and geostrategic approach. The administration’s goal in Europe is to weaken and destroy the EU. Urged on by rightwing Brexiter politicians, the president sees pulling Britain away from the EU’s orbit as part of that effort. So, however, does the EU. As a result, any attempt by Washington to offer generous terms to the UK in particular sectors is likely to make anyresetwith the EU more difficult. Sir Keir Starmer says that Britain does not need to make an either/or choice. Like Mr Johnson, he says Britain can have its cake and eat it. The brutalrealityis that neither the US nor the EU will necessarily take the same generous view.Even if the prospective UK-US deal is less wide-ranging than it might once have been, it is still significant. Politically, the Trump factor also makes any such deal more explosive. UK treaties and trade deals are traditionally made under prerogative powers. As theBrexitargument about a “meaningful vote” showed, there is a very limited role for parliament. That needs to change. It would be intolerable in the UK-US case. This is clearly a matter for parliament to debate, both during and after negotiations, and for both houses of parliament to vote on.This week, the Labour chairs of the Commons foreign affairs and trade select committeescalledfor such votes. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are both in favour. The government should make clear that no agreement will go ahead without a meaningful Commons vote in favour.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Both men, elected to lead nominally democratic countries, have described themselves as dictators, and they exuded that sense of smug impunity. While reporters sought answers on the fate of Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old father of three who was wrongly deported to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot mega-prison, Trump and Bukele disclaimed responsibility, joked about further deportations, and engaged in casual slander of Ábrego García, who is not, and has never been alleged to be, a terrorist.And then there was the gold. So much gold.Since returning to the White House, Trump has applied gilt to the Oval Office with the same light touch that he brings to the caps lock key, which is to say, it’s everywhere. Gold knickknacks cover every surface in the Oval Office while gold-framed paintings climb the walls. Trump has added gold highlighting to the room’s ornamental moulding, imported gold cherubs from Mar-a-Lago, crowded the mantelpiece with gold urns, and even affixed what I can only describe as gold filigree doodads to the walls and fireplace. (These ornaments were made by John Icart, a south Florida cabinetmaker, according to theWall Street Journal, though it’s possible to find aclose replicaon Alibaba for $1-5 a pop, pre-tariff.) He even has a gold seal on thebuttonon his desk he presses to summon an aide with a Diet Coke.View image in fullscreen‘Trump has applied gilt to the Oval Office with the same light touch that he brings to the caps lock key, which is to say, it’s everywhere.’Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockTrump’s penchant for the gaudy has long drawn jeers – the Washington Post critic-at-large Robin Givhanwrotethat the redecorated Oval Office “now evokes insecurity and petulance” – but as with so many of Trump’s buffoonish tendencies, there is a real menace beneath the shiny surface.Those tacky antique decorative urns were gilded usingormolu, according to Givhan, a technique involving mercury that was so toxic that its practitioners rarely lived past 40. And while ormolu was banned by the French government in 1830, gold mining remains a major source of pollution, accounting for 38% ofglobal anthropogenic mercury emissions, as well as copious amounts of cyanide and arsenic, withserious consequencesfor human and environmental health. Scientistsestimatethat more than 100 million people worldwide suffer chronic mercury poisoning, either because they are themselves miners or they live in a community affected by mining.That’s no secret to the people of El Salvador, who madehistoryin 2017 by becoming the first country in the world to ban the mining of metals. The ban followed years ofcampaigningby environmental and Indigenous activists fighting back against the international companies that have for so long extracted mineral wealth from Latin America while leaving little behind butpolluted waterwaysand impoverished communities. The European appetite for the western hemisphere’s precious metals fueled centuries of slaughter of Indigenous populations and enormous environmental destruction; great wealth was extracted, but rarely was it shared with the local communities.View image in fullscreenA drone view of the San Sebastián river, contaminated as a consequence of past mining activity of the San Sebastián gold mine in Santa Rosa de Lima, El Salvador, in 2024.Photograph: José Cabezas/ReutersBukele rose to power in El Salvador in 2019 with promises of an entirely different kind of mining – of cryptocurrency, rather than metals. But the2023 prosecutionof five key activists behind the mining ban on decades-old, trumped-up charges led to suspicions, since confirmed, that he was planning to reverse course.In late 2024, Bukelecame out against the ban, claiming that El Salvador had untapped gold reserves worth $3tn. The self-proclaimed “world’s coolest dictator” soon had his wish mademanifestby a compliant congress, and El Salvador’s historic ban is no more. While Bukele claims that future gold mining will be mercury-free and “sustainable”, environmental activists are getting ready to fight tosave El Salvador’s waterways.Whether that $3tn of gold will ever materialize is very much in question. Open pit mining involves the production of just over four metric tons of waste, much of which is toxic, to find a single gram of gold, according to Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a recentpaper, The Case Against Gold Mining.“If you run any kind of holistic cost-benefit analysis, I don’t think you can justify it,” Lezak says. “Gold mining is just as destructive as coal mining, and unlike coal, can’t heat a home or fuel a power station.” Lezak says that he supports mining minerals that are crucial to the energy transition – such as copper, nickel and lithium – but the fact that only 7% of gold is used for technology or medicine (as opposed to jewelry or stores of wealth) makes the environmental damage and risk to health too costly to bear.But that’s the thing about gold. The human desire for its sparkle has never been a question of need, only want. The violence and displacement, suffering and grief that have accompanied the quest for gold have not yet managed to turn our eyes away from its gleam. In that way, it’s a perfect emblem for Trump – garish, useless, drenched in blood.“The president’s fascination with gold is part of a timeless tradition of human’s liking shiny objects,” Lezak says. “You can tell the story of a lot of human history as a story of men in power wanting shiny objects, whether it’s the Spanish looking for silver in the Andes or European Americans looking for gold in California and Alaska.“History does not look back favorably on those leaders,” he added. “I wish the president had a little more perspective.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionEl SalvadorGoldAmericasCommoditiesUS immigrationMar-a-LagocommentShareReuse this content"

But he challenges the prototype of what an NFL quarterback is supposed to look and act likeThu 17 Apr 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 10.22 EDTShareNFL scouting is broken, and Shedeur Sanders is the proof. Everything about him screams future star quarterback, and yet teams would sooner assume the worst.Make no mistake: there is no prospect in this year’s draft who is better equipped to turn around a struggling franchise than the 23-year-old Texan, a savior to not one buttwocollege fanbases. The last four years saw him restore the proud football tradition at Jackson State and put Colorado back on the college football map. Sanders did this despite skeptics casting doubt on his ability to make the jump up from competing against small historically Black schools to playing against major college powers in the Pac 12 and Big 12 conferences. Last year he led a 9-4 turnaround at Colorado, the school’s first winning season in seven years, while snapping a four-year drought of postseason bowl appearances.A road trip to Lambeau Field: my search for the magic of the NFL draft | Emma JohnRead moreAlthough atouchslight at 6ft1in and 212lb, Sanders has nonetheless proven to be durable, missing a grand total of two games in his four years as a starter. All the while Sanders rated among the nation’s most prolific throwers while at Jackson State (which competes in college football’s secondary Football Bowl Subdivision) and at Colorado (which competes in college football’s biggest stage, the Bowl Championship Subdivision). In his senior season Sanders paced the Big 12 in completion percentage (74%), yards (4,134) and touchdowns (37) on the way to being named the conference’s offensive player of the year. What’s more, Sanders has pedigree. He’s a coach’s kid – scoutslovecoaches’ kids! – and the pros will mark the first time Sanders plays for a head coach who isn’t also his father. That father? None other than NFL hall of famer Deion Sanders: Colorado’s Coach Prime, the feared shutdown cornerback who caught passes and played Major League Baseball on the side.Shedeur figures to be among the first three quarterbacks picked at next week’s NFL draft behind the University of Miami’s Cam Ward and perhaps even Ole Miss’ Jaxson Dart as well. But where Dart (who excelled at two schools) is being hyped as a sleeper pick and Ward (who excelled atthree) appears to be the consensus top pick, Sanders keeps sliding down the draft board. Most projections have him down as a bottom-10 pick; many NFL scouts haven’t even given him a first-round grade. An anonymous NFC team executive who spoke to ESPN dismissed Sanders as “a fringe starter” in the mold of Teddy Bridgewater – the former Louisville star who has spent the majority of his decade-long pro career as a backup. Scouts further say that Sanders can be slow to make up his mind under pressure and even slower to react when overwhelmed. (At Jackson State, Sanders was among college football’s most sacked starters.)View image in fullscreenShilo Sanders (21), Colorado head coach Deion Sanders and Shedeur Sanders (2) walk on the field during senior day celebrations prior to the game against the Oklahoma State Cowboys at Folsom Field in November.Photograph: Andrew Wevers/Getty ImagesBut more than Sanders holding on to the ball too long, teams really don’t like that Sanders isn’t desperate for a job. He comes from money already; in fact, Coach Prime – who has remained a sought-after pitchman in the decades since his dual playing prime – justsigned a $54m extensionthat puts him in league with college football’s highest-paid coaches. At one point only USC basketball prodigy Bronny James was making more money in name, image and likeness endorsement deals than Shedeur. Famously, Shedeur tootled around campus in exotic cars and celebrated big plays by flashing a diamond-encrusted watch. Teams look at Shedeur and see more than just a chip off the old block; they see something they’re not used to seeing in Black quarterback prospects: a nepo baby on a Rocky Mountain confidence high.If those teams could set Shedeur’s luxury accessories to the side for a moment, they might appreciate him for what he truly is – maybe the best-nurtured NFL quarterback prospect ever. Consider: top draft picks Peyton and Eli Manning had their father, Archie, for a role model – but he was no better than a solid NFL starter with the New Orleans Saints through the 1970s. John Elway’s father, Jack, was a respected college football coach – but he got hired at Stanford the yearafterJohn left school for the 1983 draft. Andrew Luck’s dad, Oliver – a former quarterback for the Houston Oilers – moved to Europe to launch his post-playing career as a football executive. He wasn’t an especially hands-on coach for Andrew, a youth soccer player before he was the top pick in 2012.Meanwhile, the youngest Sanders son has been at his father’s knee from the beginning, barnstorming the country with Deion’s Texas-based youth football teams. In between working as an NFL Network analyst, Deion took a job as the offensive coordinator at Shedeur’s Dallas-area high school expressly to continue guiding his football career. When Deion left that post to take the head coaching job at Jackson State, Shedeur and his older brother Shilo were his first recruits. (“I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to help level the playing field & pursue equality for HBCU’s!” Shedeur wrote after his commitment was announced. “Dad I got your back!”) The gravitational force of Coach Prime’s personality has given Shedeur access to some of the brightest minds in the game. Tom Brady has been mentoring Shedeur his entire college career, and former NFL coach Pat Shurmur was his offensive coordinator at Colorado.Shedeur wasn’t just productive on the field. Colorado was in the midst of a 20-year doldrums before Shedeur turned up on the Boulder campus with his whole family. Shedeur turned Travis Hunter, adual-threat cornerback, into his top receiver; now the Heisman-winner projects as a top three pick in the draft. Teammates praise Shedeur’s leadership and toughness. At Colorado’s pro day showcase for league scouts earlier this month Shedeur took snaps from a young equipment manager named Samantha Burrows – the conspicuous woman among the crowd of football men on the field. (Sanders wanted to make a point of showcasing his rapport with Burrows.) A month earlier Shedeur made headlines at the NFL combine for his 3.9 GPA. Shedeur never caused trouble off campus, never ran into trouble farther afield. In that respect he’s a lot like his father, who never put a foot wrong off the field even as his Dallas Cowboys teammates were settingthe NFL standard for bad behavior.View image in fullscreenQuarterback Shedeur Sanders has been projected as a first-round pick in next week’s NFL draft.Photograph: Dustin Bradford/Getty ImagesBut the main hang-up scouts seem to have with Shedeur is that he veers from the Black quarterback archetype. Unlike Ward, he doesn’t wow with arm strength and foot speed. He stands in the pocket and delivers a catchable ball time and again. If scouts were honest in their appraisals of Shedeur, they’d be comparing him favorably with Peyton Manning. In two-minute drill situations alone, Shedeur has a career 92.3 passer rating against top-level opponents – the highest-ever mark recorded by Pro Football Focus. He was even more efficient in third-down situations last year, his 64% overall completion percentage jumping to 85% in short-yardage situations.If NFL scouting was an actual science, Sanders would be the no-brainer, eminently justifiable top pick. Instead, teams trip over one another to find reasons to talk themselves out of taking him off the board early. Last month the excuse was:most of the teams picking in the top-10 had more urgent needs to address. This month, it’s:he’s a terrible interview. To hear Shadeur tell it, teams reallydon’t like when he channels his father and turns the tables on them either. “When I go visit these coaches and when I go to all these different franchises, I ask them truly what I think and how I feel,” Shedeur recently told NFL Network. “Some get offended, some like it, some don’t. Make some people uncomfortable, some people invite that. They know what type of person and what type of player they’re gonna get out of me, so I just have to make sure, you know, what type of culture or what type of dynamic I’m going to have with them also.”The Pittsburgh Steelers, rumored to be interested in trading up from the 21st pick, are among a handful of teams who are genuinely bullish on Shedeur – not least because he’d be a better long-term option than 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers or a second tour of Mason Rudolph. The Saints, who pick ninth, have only really started seriously considering Shedeur since incumbent starter Derek Carr was recently reported to have suffered a serious shoulder injury that could stall his availability for the 2025 season. This week the New York Giants, also mired in the Rodgers sweepstakes, worked out Shedeur again in Colorado – but the team is holding its cards close. The farther Shedeur drops, the more you wonder if he isn’t purposefully turning scouts off so he can wind up playing for his mentor Brady in Las Vegas. Or you wonder if the Giants aren’t in foranother round of Saquon Barkley-level regret.Really, any team would be lucky to land Shedeur. He has the skills, the swagger and a family name that he absolutely can’t let down. It’s a shame the scouts are too blinkered by their own hangups to spot a sure thing.Explore more on these topicsNFLCollege footballUS sportsCollege sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But communities are banding together to meet our needsThu 17 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 12.35 EDTShareMaternal deaths have recentlydroppedin the US – that is, unless you’re Black.Black women continue to face thehighest ratesof maternal mortality in our country. To be Black, pregnant and hopeful in the US is to hold on to life with a fierce and unyielding grip against devastating odds.Black women are navigating pregnancies in a healthcare system that too often ignores our pain, dismisses our concerns, fails to value our lives and underserves us throughout the entire journey to motherhood. As we markBlack maternal health week, the path to becoming a mom remainsfraught with pain pointsfor Black women.For too many Black women, the journey to motherhood may start with dismissive doctors and racially motivated mistreatment: a soon-to-be mother’s voice is silenced in the very spaces meant to protect her health. The experience of giving birth is compounded by systemic inequities that compromise her safety and dignity. Stillbirth and miscarriage rates remaindisproportionately highdue to inadequate prenatal support, while unequal pain treatment leaves Black mothers suffering in silence – ignored or under-treated. Aheightened tendencyfor unnecessary C-sections reflects deep-rooted biases in medical decision-making, exacerbated by implicit racial bias.American women and children are in crisis. Republicans are about to make it worse | Karen DolanRead moreWhen the baby is born, the postpartum period is often marked by systemic gaps in care that leave Black women vulnerable to physical, emotional and financial strain. Limited access to postpartum mental health support means many struggle with anxiety and depression without adequate professional guidance, worsening the already heightened maternal mortality rates among Black women. The absence of comprehensive postpartum resources leaves Black mothers navigating recovery, newborn care and maternal health largely on their own, reinforcing a cycle of isolation and inequity.It takes a village to raise a child – and to protect an expecting mother. So while we’ve heard many grim stories through our research at the health advocacy organization United States of Care, we’ve also heard stories of communities banding together to meet the needs of Black women and mothers. Across the country, community-based maternal health organizations are building capacity andcultural responsivenessin maternal healthcare that offers what I like to call “bright spots”. These bright spots are not just exceptions, but blueprints for the rest of the country.An expecting mother may turn to culturally aligned healthcare providers who offer specialized care, fostering a deep sense of trust, support and security for both her and her baby. Doulas can improve her experience by providing personalized care that is tailored to her and guides her through the pregnancy journey. Additionally, telehealth like theMaven ClinicandPomelo Carecan promote racially concordant care, provide access to interdisciplinary care teams, and bridge access to care gaps. And tech innovations theIrth app, a “Yelp-like” app that offers provider reviews from Black and brown women, can empower her to make informed decisions about her care.When the baby arrives, she may reach out to organizations focused on addressing maternal mental health, like the Houston-basedShades of Blue Project, which offers structured journaling support groups for Black women and aims to decrease the stigma related to seeking mental health treatment. She may seek a doula or lactation consultant that supports her with her breastfeeding challenges or access local programs likeBreastfeeding Awareness and Empowerment Café, a Philadelphia-based community lactation and perinatal mental health support program that is replicable, scalable, peer-driven and low-barrier intervention that has the potential to improve outcomes.In countless neighborhoods across the US, community organizations on and offline are creating lifelines for Black women where our healthcare system falls short. These local efforts provide a national model of cultural responsiveness, holistic care and trust building that we hope to see innovators, policymakers and leaders across the country adopt. As we recognize these local initiatives, it’s important to consider what sustains them: strong community ties, committed leadership and diverse funding streams. Maternal health solutions must happen both at the bedside and in the halls of power: more policymakers, philanthropists and healthcare institutions must step forward to invest in these models, scaling them while preserving their community-driven success.Black maternal health is about more than survival; it’s about thriving. It’s about empowering Black mothers to experience joy in their pregnancies, to be supported from preconception all the way through postpartum, and to raise their families in a world that values their lives. Let these bright spots serve as both inspiration and a guide.It’s time for Black women to be listened to, cared for and treated with the dignity we’ve always deserved. We can build a future where the health and wellbeing of Black mothers is no longer an anomaly but a standard.Venice Haynes is a social and behavioral scientist with more than 17 years of public health experience.

They’ve met their matches. None of them has blinked – and they won’t.China not only refused to back down when the Trump regime threatened it with huge tariffs, but also retaliated with huge tariffs of its own, plus a freeze on the export of rare-earth elements that the US’s high-tech and defense industries depend on.Harvard also pointedly defied the regime, issuing a clear rebuke to its attempt to interfere with academic freedom.The supreme court – in a rare unanimous decision –ordered Trump to facilitatethe return of a legal US resident wrongly deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, without any criminal charges.But the White Housewas defiant. On Monday, both Trump officials andEl Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, said they could not return Kilmar Ábrego García.“Of course, I’m not going to do it,”Bukele saidwhen asked.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, joined in the cruel imitation of justice: “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him.”What’s next?I suspect the testosterone-poisoned lackeys around King Trump are urging him to hit back even harder, escalating their confrontations with China, Harvard and the supreme court.

Obviously, there’s all the surfing, rollercoasting, bungee jumping and so on. There’s also his use of the word “wedgie” in relation to trade tariffs. That’s some trick to pull off. Respect. Here’s what he said earlier this month: “Despite backing the US in every major conflict this century – and offering to water down our tax on US tech billionaires – we’ve been rewarded with the same tariffs as Iran. It’s like we’re meant to be grateful Trump gave our friends a black eye and left us with just a wedgie.”This was quoted onThe World at One on BBC Radio 4, which involved the presenter Sarah Montague using the word wedgie, too. Something else I never thought I’d hear. Even over where I work on BBC Radio 5 Live, where we’re less squeamish about using the vernacular, Davey’s wedgie-bomb came as a bit of a shock. But we soon gathered ourselves enough to hatch a plan on where we should go with the idea. My editor suggested it may be profitable to consider how mankind – and I believe we are talking about a largely male pursuit – can be divided into wedgees and wedgers. That is, those who have been wedgied and those who have done the wedging.I should explain to those unfamiliar with this ghastly practice – one generally but not exclusively experienced in our schooldays – that a wedgie is when you come up behind someone and, unbidden, take hold of the elastic of their underpants and … Actually, let’s leave it at that. If you know, you know. If you don’t, be grateful.My editor – who is called Tom Green, by the way, if you want to complain about any of this on taste grounds – is, like me, very much a wedgee. It’s why we get on. The current president of the United States is plainly a wedger. I use the present tense there, not because I think President Trump is an active wedger, but because it’s not a label you can shed. Once a wedger, always a wedger. Our prime minister, equally obviously, is a wedgee, and this is greatly to his credit. His predecessor, Mr Sunak, is a wedgee too. Liz Truss? Let’s not go there. Boris Johnson? Most definitely a wedger.To be clear, not all wedgers are bad. Some of my best friends are wedgers. But it’s the rest of us who are on the side of the angels. Hard though it is to believe just now, it’s the wedgees who will inherit the Earth.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEd DaveyOpinionTrump administrationTariffsRadio 4US politicsBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

The words sound good. Most human beings are primed to think of a deal as desirable in itself. It isn’t hard to see why. Agreement is generally better than disagreement. In most aspects of life, shaking hands under shared rules makes sense. So it takes a bit of effort to think more objectively. But it is important to do that now, especially in the case of the proposed UK trade deal with the United States.Even beforeDonald Trumpbecame president again, and long before the US started its current tariff wars, there were already plenty of reasons for caution about what a free trade deal with the US might look like. In the wake of Brexit, these concerns centred on whether a deal could be struck – and sold at home – on bilateral trade issues such as pharmaceuticals, food products and digital regulation, on all of which very different standards and assumptions have long applied on the two sides of the Atlantic.None of those red lines – even though some are redder than others – has gone away under Trump. That does not mean there will be no UK-US deal. This week, though, the US vice-president, JD Vance, lobbed another grenade into the works. Shortly after it being widely reported that he said there wasa “good chance” of a US-UK trade deal, Vance was also reported as saying something far less emollient. Sources close to the vice-president werequoted as sayinghe will insist that Britain must repeal hate speech laws on LGBTQ+ people as the price of an agreement.If that really is the US administration’s view, then it would be an undisguisedly brutal example of how this White House sees trade deals. More reliable indicators of Washington’s approach may emerge from thetrade talks this weekbetweenthe US and Japan. Japan, after all, is both a longstanding US military ally and major US investor. It also had a notable record of deflecting Trump’s dangers during his first term. Yet Japan still faces 24% “reciprocal” US tariffs.Non-retaliation against the US is as embedded a reflex in London as it is in Tokyo. Yet the fact remains that, to Trump, a deal has always been a means of asserting his power and getting his way. There is little that is genuinely transactional about it. In Trump’s deals there has to be a winner – him. And that means there must always also be a loser – the other guy. The risk for Britain is that, beguiled by lazy thinking that saysBritain is a unique bridgebetween the US and Europe, which it isn’t, and that a trade deal is inherently desirable, which isn’t the case either, we are sleepwalking into becoming one of the losers.Step back for a moment. There have been states in the past which thought about trade the same way that Trump does today. Before the first world war, when Britain was the global hegemon, our politics were convulsed by the same argument. Tariff supporters led by Joseph Chamberlain wanted Britain to reject free trade and assert its sway through bilateral deals done on Britain’s terms. Under Trump, the US, not Britain, is acting as today’s global hegemon and using the selfsame approach. Chamberlain failed; Trump is likely to fail too.Don’t lose sight of the big picture as Trump sees it. His agenda is essentially to demolish the world trading system as it has existed since 1945, with its rules-based (rules that have generally favoured the US) multilateralist approach. The tariff war aims to obliterate a system that, whatever its unfairnesses and failings (and they undoubtedly both exist), has also underpinned the growth of world trade and prosperity for decades. In its place, he seeks a world trade order based on might is right, as represented by the US.This is not an argument for Britain refusing every sort of free trade agreement with the US today. There remains a genuine case for a limited one, if it can be negotiated. But freer trade with the US has to be seen for what it is – and also for what it is not. For Britain, a free trade agreement with Trump’s US can only be fundamentally defensive. It should be seen as a way of protecting British trade interests. It is not the key to unlocking UK prosperity. In other words, it would be tactical not strategic.The US is never going to be the biggest driver of Britain’s elusive economic growth. That was true even when a trade deal wasbeing toutedunder Boris Johnson as the most high-profile opportunity created by Brexit. Freer trade with the US, even with Trump’s US, undoubtedly matters for some exporters, includingthe British car industry. But any wider gains were never going to be substantial – mere fractions of a single percentage point over a decade, at best. And that pales by comparison with freer trade with Europe.Keir Starmerconstantly arguesthat Britain does not have to choose between the US and Europe. What this claim misses, however, is that for Britain to make any positive choice involving Europe, even a modest one, is seen by many in Washington today as an active choice against the US. Trump’s aim in Europe is to weaken and, if possible,destroy the EU. Both he and Vance have been close to explicit about this and abouttheir hostility to Europe.By the same yardstick, Trump also wants to pull the UK out of the EU’s orbit in whatever way he can. So any effort by Starmer to reset UK relations with the EU, even the relatively modest reset that Starmer envisages, therefore risks being seen as a hostile act by Trump’s Washington. Brexiters will also do whatever they can to encourage the White House, which may explain the Daily Telegraph’s claim on Wednesday that Starmer is on theverge of an EU alignmentover food and veterinary rules.In other circumstances, that might perhaps be enough to deter Starmer. It certainly worries his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, with his focus on Labour “leaver” voters. Yet the price Starmer would pay would be huge – the trade reset with Europe, which is seen as one of the keys with which the government hopes tounlock economic growth. Starmer and Rachel Reeves have always insisted that growth, and a fairer distribution of its proceeds, is their central objective. If that remains true, then something will have to give. It may have to be the US deal. To govern is to choose.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTrade policyTariffsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It is critical to democracy – in Hungary, and the EU as a wholeThu 17 Apr 2025 11.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 12.28 EDTShareHungary’s parliament has given Viktor Orbán the tools to do what he has long threatened:ban Pride, silence dissent and strip political critics of their citizenship. Aconstitutional amendmentpassed on 14 April allows the government to label LGBTQ+ gatherings a threat to children and to revoke the citizenship of dual nationals deemed a risk to “national sovereignty”.This is a purge disguised as law – another step in Orbán’s dismantling of democracy, where the constitution is degraded to a propaganda instrument. Hecalls ita “spring clean-up” to root out “bugs”, targeting LGBTQ+ people, journalists, critics, civil society and now, dual nationals. As one myself, I could be among the targets.All of this is also a cynical political ploy to distract Hungarians from a deepening domestic crisis. Withhigh inflation, acrumbling healthcare systemandailingrailways, Orbán needs enemies more than ever. Hungary is acutely vulnerable to the collapse of global trade, which his ally in the White House has single-handedly brought about. The electoral system is seen as rigged, but elections are still scheduled for next spring – and Orbán’s party, Fidesz, is slidingin the polls.Increasingly troubled at home, Orbán is looking abroad. In February hedeclaredthat the political climate in the west had become more favourable. The implication was clear: with Donald Trump back in power, the EU distracted and global authoritarianism on the rise, there are even fewer consequences facing a leader who wants to dismantle democracy.This has long been much more than a Hungarian story. It is a European crisis – and a warning to every democracy. Take the case of Budapest Pride. For 30 years, Pride has been the largest recurring demonstration of human rights in Hungary – a vital expression of joy, resistance and visibility in the face of growing hostility. It has endured far-right attacks, harassment and vilification. But this year the march has in effectbeen banned. Organisers and participants have been threatened with facial recognition surveillance and fines of 200,000 Hungarian forints (£420).BudapestPrideis no longer just a march. It is a frontline. A ban on Pride is unprecedented in the EU. It is a rupture with the most basic rights enshrined in Article 2 of the EU treaties: freedom of assembly, freedom from discrimination, the right to live and love without fear.View image in fullscreenProtesters in the Hungarian capital on 8 April 2025.Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd yet theEuropean Commission– the guardian of those very treaties – has so far offered nothing but the usual statements of concern. This sets a devastating precedent. It tells every member state that fundamental rights are optional – that governments can outlaw protest and strip people of EU citizenship without consequence.Let’s be honest: the EU’s track record for enforcing the rule of law gives Orbán every reason to believe he can get away with it. Years of delay and half-measures have allowed him to tighten his gripwith little resistance. While some EU funds have beensuspended, most continue flowing. Article 7 proceedings – meant to sanction breaches of EU values – have stalled. There are no meaningful attempts to put them on the agenda, even though suspending Orbán’s voting rights could shield EU values and end hissabotagingof unanimous EU votes in support of Ukraine.The European Commission and council remain hesitant, divided and timid. This is not just a moral failure – it is a strategic one. The EU may be the last functioning democratic project of global scale. And it is being tested. As democratic backsliding accelerates worldwide,Europefaces a simple question: can it defend its own values? Or will it fold? Because the truth is, an authoritarian turn can happen anywhere. If Pride can be banned in Budapest, it can be banned in Bratislava, Zagreb, Rome. If citizenship becomes a weapon here, it becomes a precedent everywhere.So what should the EU do? Orbán is daring Brussels to look away. A European Commission that takes its role seriously would act immediately. It has the legal tools – what’s missing is the political courage.Brussels is reportedlyconsidering legal action“if necessary”, but it has yet to take interim steps to protect this year’s march, now just two months away. Its usual excuse – the need to avoid “political interference” – is no longer viable. Orbán is the one breaking the law – the one wiping his feet on the EU treaties.There is also a tangible, immediate way to show solidarity: elected leaders from across Europe should publicly announce that they are joining us at Budapest Pride. We are immensely proud to already have pledges from members of the European parliament. Their presence is not symbolic – it is protective. They help guarantee that the march can take place in safety. When government power is being used to intimidate and suppress, a visible international presence can deter harassment and police overreach. This is not optics – it’s a line of defence.This is not a political dispute between equals. This is one side dismantling rights, and the other asking Europe to uphold its own laws. Brussels’ engagement would not be a partisan act; it would be a defence of the very values it was created to protect.If we don’t respond collectively, publicly and decisively, we will wake up to find the authoritarian turn complete. But we refuse to give up. The party I represent, Momentum, is constantly on the streets, protesting, organising, standing with those who will not be silenced. On 28 June, Budapest Pride will march. Orbán says he will stop it. We say, just try.To every democratic leader, activist and ally in Europe: join us. March with us. Let us show together that the streets of a European capital will not surrender to fear.Katalin Cseh is a member of the Hungarian national assembly for the Momentum Movement and a former MEPDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The prime ministerseemed geriatric and I was sure he should be in care, while a group of us went to meet our young MP, a certain Margaret Thatcher. She was young, but she didn’t seem as if she was with the times. We could not dream of voting for someone like her. Matter closed.Sixteen-year-olds are great fun but they are not grown up. They cannot marry in England and Wales, drive, smoke,get a tattooor buy alcohol on their own. They are legally classed as children and are supposed to be informal education or training to 18. Sixteen-year-olds have not taken to the streets demanding the right to the franchise, like the Chartists or suffragettes did.So why has Keir Starmer suddenly reiterated thathe intends to enfranchise them to votein UK-wide elections? The only plausible answer is that he hopes they will vote for him. In a desperate attempt tojustify this manoeuvre, he says that, if 16-year-old soldiers “are old enough to take a bullet for our country”, they should get the vote. (Likewiseif they are “old enough to work” and “pay taxes”.)In fact, 16-year-olds are not old enough to “take a bullet”, since frontline army service isbanned for under-18s.Meanwhile, precious few 16-year-olds work, sinceStarmer’s own party, when last in power, made it supposedly compulsory for them to remain in education or training to 18. As for taxes, younger children already pay VAT when they spend their pocket money. The whole argument is slapdash.Young people say they’d elect a ‘strong leader’. I say give more of them the vote | Polly ToynbeeRead moreEven the expected electoral gain to Labour is dubious. Well under half of 18-24sturned out at the last general election. There is some evidence from Scotland, which lowered the voting age to 16in 2014 for the independence referendumand in 2016 forScottish parliamentary elections, that the new groupwould be active, though novelty may recently have been a factor in turnout. In Wales, whichlowered the voting age to 16in 2021 for Senedd and local government elections,early evidence suggeststhat the new group plans to vote at a similarly low rate to other age groups under 55. Either way, Starmer would be lucky to see more than half of his1.5 million new votersactually turning out, with perhaps about a third of those voting for him. Even then, the general assumption that the young are leftwing has taken abruising recently from rightwing influencers.Where Starmer must be right is in wanting to bring young people into what he pompously calls his“social contract” with gen Z. Here, his absolute priority should not be the ballot box, but how he proposes to prepare the new cohort for their responsibilities. With social media so clearly dominant over the views and behaviour of those whose support he seeks, its proper regulation should be a priority for any such reform.The present government shows no interest in such regulation. Indeed, if anything, quite the reverse. Rumour has it that Starmer, in his attempt to reduce tariffs, is on the brink of pledgingno further curbs on the tech giants, in view of their closeness to Donald Trump. This would follow the cabinet’s apparent capitulation to those same giants in the matter of copyright and artificial intelligence. All this suggests a complete lack of concern for what must currently be the greatest threat to the mental health of gen Z. All Starmer has done is boast that hewatched Adolescence. So what now: voting at 13?The one thing that might excuse the government’s cynicism is a programme to prepare teenagers for their new responsibility. Thetyranny of academic GCSEsand exam culture should be suspended, if not for ever, then at least for one day a week, to be replaced by compulsory civic awareness. This should embrace an introduction to peace and war, national politics, local government, the law, practical economics and the handling of money.The subservience of British secondary education to academia was dented only as recently as 2000. The then Labour government nodded at the revolutionary idea that schools might help pupils to get on in life, rather than merely get a place at university. It introduced “non-compulsory”personal, social and health education, to which economics was later added. To say these topicsdo not rank highlyin the syllabus would be an understatement, nor do they embrace politics.I know teachers who genuinely think it is not their job to “teach” a world outside education. They see no need to educate young people in how to relate to one another, work in groups or keep their minds and bodies in good shape. They see no reason to teach self-presentation or expression, the new skills of oracy so crucial to getting on in a creative career. Teachers seem to think all this is for parents, not schools, even when they know it is not true. The school curriculum is in the dark ages.The truth of the matter is that teenagers are acquiring these skills and attitudes from social media. It is online that they are gaining a whole new context for their personal and social lives. They are doing so from the worst possible sources: biased, uncensored, unmediated and unregulated. It must be the worst preparation for that most sacred of democratic rituals – the vote. This is the grim reality of Starmer’s new social contract.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionElectoral reformLabourVoter apathycommentShareReuse this content"

I was recently having a conversation with friends about the family dynamics of people we’ve dated, and all of a sudden a very clear pattern emerged that I’d never noticed before. Every single person I have ever dated, casually or seriously, has had one sister and no other siblings.Even though I’m aware this could sound like some strange special interest of mine, it’s not deliberate. I’ve actually never narrowed down prospective romantic interests based on siblings, but I did find this sister realisation notable. Is there something about me that queer people with sisters are attracted to? Is there something about having one sister that informs the kind of personalities I am drawn to? Did our separate placements in our families become part of our identity, as some people claim can happen, causing us to be compatible?No, almost definitely not – it is likely just a coincidence. However, I had to wonder – because I actuallyhavealways had a bit of a fascination with what I call “sister culture”.Looking at my late-90s high school diary, you would assume I was a regular horny straight teen girl. The reality was very different | Rebecca ShawRead moreI was born after two brothers, and then another brother followed me. If you are doing the multi-sibling maths right, that makes me the only sister of three brothers. I was surrounded by boys from birth, and then when I was about 10 we moved out of the city to a small place called Boytown, Queensland. That is not its real name, but it does describe what became my reality.My brothers got very involved in boxing at a gym nearby (eventually turning pro), and I went to a very small primary school that had just 32 students– I was the only girl in my year, alongside four boys. Our house turned into a parade of dudes for several years.From a very young age, in an early grass-is-greener type situation, I looked around at all these boys everywhere and wished for a sister. I dreamed of a sister. I begged for a sister (and for a horse). I wanted someone to hang out with who would want to do something fun, instead of watching Rambo for the fifth time. I wanted someone to giggle and share secrets with, rather than the various grunts my teenage brothers used to communicate.Naturally this saintly imaginary sister would be a perfect fit for me. But after my parents’ cruel rejection of my request that they have a fifth child in the hopes it would be a girl, I turned to the other great influences in my life – books and TV and movies.View image in fullscreen‘Sister relationships, like all relationships, go through phases, but they seem to involve shifting levels of tension and annoyance’ … Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst in Little Women.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyWhat I soon discovered was that sister relationships were often much more complicated than I’d thought. Instead of a little human biologically obliged to be your best friend, a sister could apparently be the person most expertly designed to be able to hurt you, practising their art over years. As someone who at that time would have rather laid down and died than talk to my brothers about anything personal, I found this even more fascinating. I still do.Sisters, I learned, weren’t automatically close or similar – they could be as different as a peppy blonde and a sarcastic brunette who snipe at each other all the time, like Darlene and Becky from Roseanne,or Kat and Bianca from 10 Things I Hate About You. They could be competitive and murderous to each other like in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? They could be two Australian sisters singing about being sisters in the songSisterby Sister 2 Sister. They could be magic and all have different relationships to one another, like in Charmed. They could be four of them and it’s the 1860s and they are Little Women.Of course no one is going to make movies and TV about boring, nice sisters who get along fine. And of course every sibling relationship is unique in its own way. But from my own experience, and from seeing my friends’ and extended family’s experiences (and of course, from my accidental dating social study), sister culture seems uniquely layered.Country music is cool now – even the pop girlies are leaning into it. I’ve finally been vindicated | Rebecca ShawRead moreSister relationships, like all relationships, go through phases, but they seem to involve shifting levels of tension and annoyance, from being best friends to personality clashes and independence testing, getting along beautifully then back to flinging deeply personal barbs, perfectly aimed to do as much injury as possible. This all seems to exist alongside extreme loyalty and ultimate care. In many of the sister relationships I have witnessed, it is clear they would go to the ends of the earth for each other, but also that they’ll take the opportunity to press the buttons that they alone have access to.As an outsider I have been fascinated and a bit scared by these dynamics. I have learned to know my place as an observer of sister culture and not a participant.I recently saw all my lovely brothers for the first time in a while. My brothers have nine children between them – one boy and eight girls. My brothers may not have been able to provide me with sister drama growing up, but they are making up for it now: perhaps one day my nephew will write a column about brother culture.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilyRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Given the problems that can be associated with coming out to family, friends and work colleagues, the constant vilification of trans people by certain parts of the media and on social media and the internal emotional turmoil transition entails, it requires mental strength beyond the ordinary. I should know – I have walked that path.Yesterday, transgender people weredealt a blowfrom a source I would not have predicted when I transitioned 13 years ago – the UK supreme court. In a case concerning representation on the boards of public bodies in Scotland, the supreme court ruled that in the 2010 Equality Act (EA), “sex” should be taken to be “biological sex”, in the sense of the sex recorded on a citizen’s original birth certificate, and does not include “certified sex” where a transgender person has obtained a gender recognition certificate (GRC) by the process set out in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. This renders a GRC valueless for the purposes of the Equality Act.The 2004 legislation was not granted by a benevolent UK government but enacted after the UK lost the case of Goodwin v UK in 2002, in the European Court of Human Rights, which held that the UK lacked a process for the state to acknowledge and accept a transgender person’s acquired gender. The 2004 GRA included a number of exceptions, including one that deferred to any future legislation.In this case, the supreme court found that, while there is not explicit exemption in the EA, there was animpliedexemption given the stresses and strains caused by “sex” meaning different things in different parts of the act, and in particular the possibility that a “trans man” might be pregnant when the pregnancy and maternity provisions referred to protecting “women”. Strangely enough, at the two previous stages of the case at the outer and inner houses of the Scottish court of sessions, the courts had felt able to live with those stresses and strains and ruled that “sex” included “certified sex”.Gender ruling ‘a victory for common sense, but only if you recognise trans people exist’, says equalities watchdog – liveRead moreWe now know that the supreme court was indeed wrong in its judgment. Melanie Field, the civil servant who led the team that created the EA, has sincecome out publicly to say that it was “based on the clear premise thatfor a person with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), their ‘sex’ for the purposes of the EA is that recorded on their GRC”. Harriet Harman, the minister who introduced the bill, has contradicted this, saying that the ruling “correctly interprets the Equality Act, giving effect to our intention when drafting it”. This may be true of the EA, but it doesn’t seem to take into account the GRA position on certified sex – and as Field has correctly pointed out, some of the exceptions written into the EA permitting the exclusion of trans people (for example, in competitive sport) make no sense under the supreme court’s interpretation. They were clearly based on the assumption of certified sex. It seems that the law of unintended consequences now stalks the halls.The fact that no trans person or organisation appeared before the supreme court (an intervention by two trans grandees, one a professor of equalities law and the other a retired judge wasrefused) seems telling to trans people. Imagine, if you will, a discussion of women’s rights with all women excluded. The trans-positive intervention of Amnesty earns an honourable mention.The supreme court’s judgment is clearly wrong in another way. Following Goodwin, the UK was obliged to provide an effective route for transgender people to have their affirmed gender recognised. If a significant part of the legal protections afforded to citizens is denied to them, the UK would once again appear to be in breach of its obligations to the European convention of human rights.There seems no prospect, in the present political climate, of the Labour government sorting this out. It seems that transgender people will have to find the right case and walk the long path to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg once again.In the meantime, what difference will the 88-page judgment actually make for transgender people in the UK? Most do not have a GRC. Estimates vary, but there are about 100,000 trans people and perhaps 6,000 with GRCs. I have already seen comments suggesting that some among the anti-trans lobby think that trans people are likely to be banned from toilets in public buildings, changing rooms and the like by the end of the Easter holidays. Fortunately, while service providerscanexclude trans people – and this ruling makes it easier to do so – most do not. We do not have laws requiring that, and the discussions in the hours after the ruling with service providers did not suggest that any I spoke to are going to change their practice or instigate an anti-trans crusade. Nevertheless, we would expect responsible politicians to be calming the debate rather than fuelling the flames.Judicial ruling on legal definition of ‘woman’ will have UK politicians sighing with reliefRead moreThe supreme court was keen to emphasise the continuing protection for trans people – most, if not all of whom, will have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It is highly likely that if a policy of “use your birth sex facility” were imposed, it would be indirectly discriminatory against those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment – and given the unacceptability of having trans women using the men’s facilities and trans men the ladies’, such a policy could not be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. More concerning, perhaps, are the implications for other legislation in which the meaning of “sex”, “woman” and “man” are important.A certainty is that this will remain a fertile area for lawyers for some time to come – and will therefore provide some further tough and uncertain days for trans people across the UK.Robin Moira White is a discrimination barrister at Old Square Chambers, London, and joint author of A Practical Guide toTransgenderLawDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A man is an adult human male.Theunanimous UK supreme court rulingdelivered on Wednesday is a big step towards clearing up the almighty mess created by politicians in Scotland, who got so carried away with promoting transgender rights that they decided transgender women ought to be eligible for seats on public boards on preferential terms that are for women.This argument was taken apart in a judgment that was as far as possible from the fudge predicted by some. The judges ruled in favour of For WomenScotland, the feminist voluntary organisation that brought the case, that the protected characteristic of “sex” and the terms “man” and “woman” in the Equality Act refer to biology, not gender identity. A gender recognition certification (which formally acknowledges a person’s transition) does not alter their sex in this piece of legislation.Across88 pages, the judges explained how any other reading of the act would render it unworkable. They showed that language used in clauses about pregnancy and maternity makes it clear that sex refers to biology. The claim by the inner house of the court of session, Scotland’s highest court, that words could mean different things in sections of the same act was dismissed. Instead, the UK supreme court emphasised “the need for a meaning which is constant and predictable”. People ought to be able to understand the law without a glossary to guide them.Public services including prisons and hospital changing rooms have been in the news a good deal recently. Provisions in the Equality Act dealing with associations have had less attention until now, but submissions on this issue appear to have been crucial. Had the court ruled in favour of the Scottish government, lesbians and gay men would have lost the legal right to form associations limited to people of the same sex and orientation. People of the other sex, with a gender recognition certificate, could no longer have been excluded.That the resulting “loss of autonomy and dignity for lesbians” was part of the court’s reasoning is one of the most significant elements of this judgment. Resistance to transgender rights activism from lesbian and gay groups has been alternately dismissed and denounced. But the impact on lesbians of gender identity policies is massive, since they have a particular and historic commitment to female-only culture and spaces.New rules for public bodies expected ‘by summer’ after UK gender rulingRead moreThe judges stress that their role is limited to interpreting statute. It is not for them to adjudicate on the definitions of gender or sex, or “the meaning of the word ‘woman’”, in other contexts. People can continue to use words in whatever way they want. But the Equality Act – which incorporated earlier legislation including the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 – is the vital underpinning for societal rules and norms around fairness and equal treatment. Ever since another volunteer-led feminist group, Woman’s Place UK, highlighted the single-sex exceptions in the act as a basis for their campaign to defend sex-based rights, questions about the functioning of the exceptions, and the language in the act, have been hotly debated. That has now been settled. Unless the supreme court’s decision is appealed and overturned, or legislation is changed, biological women are a protected class in law.As important as this is, it is not an end-point. It is almost four years since Maya Forstater won a crucial appeal and established that the gender-critical belief that sex is binary and immutable is legally protected. Since then,numerous caseshave been brought by women who were penalised by employers because they did not subscribe to the contrary belief in gender identity. Several more are working their way through the system. Outside the courts, gender critical feminist activists have engaged in other forms of campaigning and lobbying, setting up groups and charities, producing research, writing books and articles.I have thought about all this for years, and still don’t fully understand how trans activist demands, above all the push for legal gender self-identification, were so widely adopted.Under Boris Johnson, the Tories changed direction. But it must be remembered that it was under Maria Miller, a Conservative chair, that the women and equalities committee recommended a system of self-ID about a decade ago.Badenoch calls for broader review of equality and gender recognition laws – UK politics liveRead moreI think the absorption of these ideasinto western progressive orthodoxy has been a grave error. By re-energising socially conservative opposition to shifting gender norms, roles and behaviours, this uncritical adoption of a contested belief that goes far beyond the protection against discrimination to which trans people are, of course, entitled, has fuelled a broader backlash against human rights.Hostility to “gender ideology” from the right of the Tory party,Putin, Trump and other authoritarian leaders has made it hard for some liberals to admit this possibility. Despite their borrowings from intellectual postmodernism, gender identity activists (including such luminaries asJudith Butler) take a binary view of our complicated world in which anyone who doesn’t line up with them must be on Team Trump. This polarising stance has already had the effect of increasing division and hostility.The judges have done their job in upholding the rights of women, and same-sex attracted people, alongside those of transgender people – all of whom have the legally protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It must be hoped that the court’s unequivocal judgment brings the ending of this wounding chapter in our politics closer, along with a sharper awareness that equality law is always a balancing process.But the plaudits this week should go to ForWomenScotland. The determination to hold on to sex-based rights and protections built up over centuries has galvanised an extraordinary renaissance of the women’s movement in Britain.Susanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British FeminismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Big purchases may be deferred or cancelled. Travel plans are revisited. We might review our childcare spend and wonder if we should go out less – all rational decisions in the face of the rising cost of living. Then there are the irrational gestures, those that have little meaning financially but offer us, via small acts of self-denial, an opportunity to feel we’re doing something morally rigorous. It’s these, in my case, that have lately been triggered.For me, the barometer has always been coffee, a small but ineradicable source of guilt that has only grown as the price of a single flat white creeps up towards £4. Forgoing this small pleasure neither damages my day, nor, on the other hand, does anything significant towards improving my finances. Assuming a one-coffee-a-week spend, the choice to wait until I get home to make coffee will save me about £200 a year. And yet, each time I pass Caffè Nero and keep walking, I’m so proud of myself you would think I’d donated a kidney.Some of this back-patting, I’m aware, is a long-range hangover from the time that Aussie real estate mogulaccused millennialsof not owning a home because they had spent all their money on avocado toast. And then there was Kevin O’Leary, a wealthy investor who appears on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragons’ Den, who said that he never bought a coffee from a cafe, a boast he made to admonish feckless non-millionaires frittering away their tiny salaries. Both men were being obnoxious while grasping at a partial truth. The fact is you can scrape the deposit for a house in a major city on a teacher’s salary – even, I’d suggest, in a downturn – but it’s not coffee or brunch you’ll have to give up: it’s everything.I’ve seen this kind of person in action – the type of hyper-saver who can hit levels of self-deprivation most of us can’t. My late aunt was one. She raised three children on her own, never had a cent of help from anyone, and wound up owning a modest house with a yard, the mortgage for which – I still boggle at this – she paid off in 10 years flat on a bookkeeper’s salary. She did this by eating the proverbial beans, never going out, wearing clothes until they fell apart and espousing a hardline philosophy of self-denial. Long before the mortgage was paid off, it had stopped being about the money. Instead, the thrilling masochism of “doing without” became a kind of addiction, and her fanaticism was admirable and horrifying. It raised questions about what we’re here for, if not at least to allow ourselves a little enjoyment. O, reason not the need.For most of us with more regular spending habits, the difficulty is in accurately assessing the gravity of a turndown, and therefore what scale of sacrifice to meet it with. Markets have rallied before and, unless we’re going to take our money out of the bank and invest it under the bed, we must assume they will rally again. Between 1929 and 1932, 90% was wiped off the value of Wall Street. Stocks in the US plunged 37% during the pandemic. By far the biggest crash in most of our lifetimes was in 2008, when the sub-prime mortgage collapse took 57% off the S&P 500 index – the main takeaway from which, apart from the obvious one about borrowing more than a certain multiple of our salaries, was that we should all have bought Microsoft then.I gave up bulk buying – and changed my attitude to money | Emma BrockesRead moreAs the economic climate worsens and recession starts to take hold, it may be that at least some of our resolve to cut back is helped by the kind of vibe shift that disguises cost-cutting as aesthetic choice. The imposition of tariffs by the US on Europe and China is likely to send the cost of luxury brands in the US soaring, so that, as with the 2008 recession, logos and other examples of conspicuous spending will quietly fall out of fashion.Anyway, I’ve done the maths – moral, emotional and actual – and on balance have decided that £200 a year is worth it for the small ping of happiness I get from buying a coffee. With a bit of reaching, I can even convince myself that it’s a shrewd investment relative to the potential cost ofnotbuying coffee. We all have our version of this: you take the emotional capital from denying yourself something that costs £5 and use it to justify dropping £500. Let’s not be miserable.

It’s time to hear from themFrances RyanMy book about disabled women grew in relevance as I wrote it, exposing the heartlessness of proposed harsh benefit cutsThu 17 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 12.54 EDTShareWhen I began to write a book four years ago about life for disabled women in Britain, I didn’t bank on it being particularly topical. Stuck in bed with chronic fatigue and pain in my early 30s, I wanted to write something that would connect with other women navigating pillboxes and heat pads alongside careers and relationships. And so I decided to interview more than 70 women and non-binary people with physical and mental health conditions – from famous actors to legal experts, musicians to psychologists. The result was a vast and varied catalogue of disabled life: from stories about workplace microaggressions and good and bad dates on the apps, to finding freedom (and judgment) using mobility aids.What I didn’t anticipate was that as the months went on, and my word count went up, the disabled cohort I was writing about would grow to include more and more women – many of them even younger than me.Against a backdrop of NHS backlogs, declining mental health, a cost of living crisis and a pandemic, disability in the UK has increased across the board; 16.8 million people are now living with a “substantial”, long-term condition, according to figures released last month – an increase of 700,000 in the past year alone. And if you’re a woman,the odds of you being among them increase.These are not simply the aches and pains that come with an ageing society.One in seven womenin their 20s in England and Wales were classed as disabled in the most recent census recorded in 2021 – and figures show significant rises in the numbers ofchildrenand under-24s who have a mental or physical health condition. Forget a nan in a bingo hall, the face of disability in the UK is now also generation Z in Greggs.When politicians and the media mention the rising numbers of women and young people with disabilities, we largely hear about it in terms of how much they are costing the country. Asthe Daily Mail recently panicked: “Handouts offered through sickness and disability benefits bill will swallow up a quarter of income tax intake by 2030.” Eventhe government’s websiteexplicitly states how much is spent on social security for working-age disabled people – the Treasury equivalent of pinning a price tag on our wheelchairs.This isn’t just rhetoric – it translates to policy too. Just look at howthe disability benefit cutswill arbitrarily mean that anyone under 22 will no longer be able to claim the incapacity benefit top-up to universal credit. Meanwhile, the combined cuts will hit single disabled women hardest –they make up a staggering 44%of those losing out, according to the government’s own figures.It is not simply that this narrative frames the growing number of young disabled women as a burden on the rest of society. It’s also implied some of them aren’t really disabled at all. Whenever ministers discuss the forthcoming cuts to incapacity benefits for under-22s, they typically do not call this group “disabled”. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, routinely describes it as Labour taking the “option of a life on benefits” away from “young people”, as if their disability – and society’s duty to support it – disappears if you do not say the word out loud.Alongside this erasure is a spate ofarticlesin recent months claiming that social media aredriving diagnosisof attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and accounts of chronic illness, and books by doctors (yes, even doctors) hypothesising that the problem facing an increasingly sick population is actually “overdiagnosis”.View image in fullscreen‘Marsha de Cordova told me about the headteacher who thought she should be institutionalised because she was blind – De Cordova was elected to parliament decades later.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianDisabled women in the UK are increasingly seen as statistics and stereotypes – reduced entirely to our disabilities, or robbed of the dignity of being believed we have one.That’s why, in writing my book, I made a conscious choice to talk to women with physical and mental health conditions directly. The marketing also aims to uplift disabled talent: every digital graphic or piece of merchandise is made by a disabled-led small business or creative. I wanted to put disabled women at the forefront of a slice of culture, to ask them about the inequality affecting their lives – their careers, families, body image – and spotlight their tenacity, contributions and humour alongside the inequality and struggles.Cherylee Houston MBE shared how doctors had shamed her for “wanting to be handicapped” but that she is now proud of her disability. Marsha de Cordova told me about the headteacher who thought she should be institutionalised because she was blind – De Cordova was elected to parliament decades later. Sophie Morgan spoke about navigating her relationship with friends after becoming paralysed (and falling out off her wheelchair laughing with them).Who Wants Normal? The Disabled Girls’ Guide to Life by Frances Ryan review – countering the stereotypesRead moreIt is not that this kind of representation alone solves ableism. In fact, too much focus on “visibility” for disabled people often comes at the expense of efforts to tackle the structural inequality we face. But the way disability is depicted in our culture and media – and whose voices are elevated – has a profound impact on how the wider public view it, and as a result, disabled people’s place in the country. It is not a coincidence that the MPs who will soon vote to cut disability benefits will statistically not be disabled themselves, just as the journalists who cheer them on will probably never have endured long-term pain, let alone pain while in poverty.As more and more of us experience chronic health issues, I cannot help but think it is time to hear from the growing cohort of disabled women in their own words – and stop normalising others talking about or for us. It is possible to address the causes of Britain’s declining health while acknowledging the dangers of a narrative controlled by a dominant group that drip-feeds the idea there are “too many” of a minority.Whether it’s a book in Waterstones window or a drama on the BBC, there is power in being able to see “the other” as a whole human being: someone who has a WhatsApp group with friends and a favourite song as well as possibly a benefits form. The only way the argument for decent support for disabled people – of any age or gender – will be won is when we are seen as people, no less nuanced or worthy than anyone else. It is easy to starve a statistic, much harder to degrade and dismiss a neighbour or friend. Perhaps that is the real reason to shine a spotlight on disability. Disabled women can finally be seen clearly: not for what they take from society, but all that they give.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.Who Wants Normal?

Particularly women who’d previously voted Liberal for most – if not all – their adult lives.How could I vote for a party that had consciously decoupled from our half of the population and shown no respect for us or the things that mattered to us? How could I play any part in returning a prime minister whobadgered a female chief executiveout of a government job, had to check with his wife before expressing sympathy for the ordeal suffered by Brittany Higgins, and who later suggested how good it was that women marching in support of women’s rights were not met by bullets?Barnaby Joyce has always denied the allegations but how could I not protest against the influence of a climate change-denying deputy prime minister who had a history ofsexual harassmentandgropingallegations?Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterTherecordshows that a good chunk of us abandoned the Liberals and voted instead for smart, capable and credentialled women who better represented us and our aspirations. Twenty seats changed hands at that election, with 14 women taking seats from the Liberals.That election loss was a sliding doors moment for the Liberals – either reconnect with female voters by increasing female representation and addressing our concerns, or dismiss us as“doctors’ wives”and faux Liberals with a further lurch to the right.The elevation of Peter Dutton,hard-right factionleader and former home affairs minister, to the Liberal leadership made it very clear which way the defeated party had decided to go. Since then, the Liberals have made no effort to acknowledge or address their “women problem” (really a“man problem”) or to coax us back.The trend is in, but Australian voters’ views are soft and fragmented – how should we read the polls?Read moreThis deficit was thrown into the spotlight on Wednesday when the leader was challenged on the election trail to explain what theCoalitionwas offering women.Dutton may have fleetingly recalled with horror that time in 2014 when Tony Abbott fumbled a similar question. After having just doubled the number of women in his inner ministry – to two – the then PM and minister for women claimed his biggest achievement for women wasscrapping the “carbon tax”. Because “women are particularly focused on the household budget”.Dutton strolled into a similar trap, nominating his housing policy as good for homeless women and his super policy for women “who have had a messy relationship breakup”. Intended or not, Dutton’s answer gave a glimpse into the way he apparently views Australian women – predominantly as victims who need protection.The same message was conveyed at the Liberal launch past weekend when the blokey lineup (sprinkled with vestiges of the Liberalcrumb maidens) emphasised Dutton’s former life as a policeman and that their leader was “tough” and “a man”.Unfortunately for Dutton, Wednesday’s question prompted the leader to look into the policy cupboard for the folder named “women” but, just as Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison did before him, he found it completely bare.How can this be reversed? By preselecting women insafeLiberal seats so they can survive minor swings at successive elections, gain experience and seniority, and be promoted into policy and decision-making roles.Yet of the 33 safe and fairly safe Coalition seats being contested this election, only six are held by women andonly onewoman has been selected to replace a retiring Liberal in a safe seat.Excuse my cynicism, but after 25 years of the same housing policies, could Australian leaders try something else? | Greg JerichoRead moreEven if Dutton formed a minority government, he would likely have only theexisting 25Coalition women to choose for ministerial positions – the same women who have survived so far by either keeping quiet, acquiescing to the toxic masculinity that is still the hallmark of the Liberal brand, or by out-bloking the blokes with Trumpish flourishes and thought-bubble policies.Where does that leave us, the female Liberal diaspora, this election? In no better place than 2022.When we line up to vote, we’ll remember the Liberals’ antipathy to the benefits of women working from home, Dutton’s flippant suggestion that we could job-share instead, and the constant framing of women as victims – while the actual epidemic of family and domestic violence is inadequately addressed.We will remember the campaign images of Dutton flanked by furiously nodding male MPs who’ve been accused ofintimidation and bullying, and female MPs who have overseen or implemented some of the most egregious and harmful failures of recent Coalition governments.And we won’t forget that Joyce is still lurking, courting mining interests, pushing nuclear energy and harbouring his latest leadership intentions.As for me? I’ll likely conclude that Australian women don’t need a protector or a hero.

We enter another level of time and consciousnessKate ConnollyThu 17 Apr 2025 11.27 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 13.37 EDTShareAmid the experiments and cross-genre collaborations inthis year’s Multitudes festivalis one event that will challenge its performer as much as its audience – and the only one where specially appointed brow-moppers will be on hand. At 10am on 24 April in London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, pianist Igor Levit will begin a performance of a single piece, Erik Satie’s Vexations, in a concert that will last at least 16 hours.A few tickets (for the full duration or one-hour slots) are still available for this extreme pianist endurance event. What should the audience expect to get out of it? “I’d never tell an audience what they should experience,” says Levit. “But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it. It’s just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream.”In May 2020, Levit found in the Covid lockdown, and the series of solo concerts he livestreamed from his Berlin apartment, an excuse to fulfil his dream of tackling this pianistic challenge. Hisfirst performance of Vexationswas streamed from an empty room; it lasted 15 hours and 29 minutes.Satie’s slight piece, a simple phrase that alone is perhaps 1-2 minutes long, was written in 1893 for keyboard (Satie didn’t specify the exact instrument). Themanuscript included the composer’s noteto potential performers: “In order to play this motif 840 times in a row, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, in the deepest silence, through serious immobilities.”View image in fullscreenIgor Levit livestreaming Vexations from his studio in Berlin in 2020.Photograph: Stephan ZwickirschThere’s no evidence that Satie intended the piece to be performed in this manner, but over the years, artists such as John Cage have organised marathons at which the feat of repeating the piece 840 times has been accomplished by a succession of different pianists. It has rarely been played in its entirety by the same person, and never before live in the UK.During his 2020 meditations, Levit says he kept returning to the work of his friend, the Serbian performance artistMarina Abramović. “I thought, this is the musical embodiment of what Marina has been doing all these years,” he says, citing her method of counting individual grains of rice over hours to experience the benefits of self-discipline and mindfulness. “You have this weird piece, a minute and a half long, which doesn’t make any sense, which is neither beautiful or not, it’s just there. And Satie didn’t even say ‘play it 840 times’; all he says is ‘in order to do so, you should do X, Y and Z’. I thought Marina would love that.”He started talking to Abramović about the piece about two years ago, and the resulting collaboration has its world premiere next week, when the 38-year-old Russian-German pianist will perform Vexations in full without leaving the stage – and this time in front of an actual audience.Levit calls it “chapter two” in his artistic collaboration with Abramović. The pair first blended their talents in 2015, for a production of theGoldberg Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, an idea they hatched in London over an evening of Slavic soup and jokes. For this event the audience were prepared by having their mobile phones locked away and sitting in silence for 30 minutes as the piano slowly glided around and down the onstage runway.View image in fullscreenThe world premiere of Levit and Abramović’s production of the Goldberg Variations, at Park Avenue Armory in December 2015.Photograph: Hiroyuki Ito/Getty ImagesThe duo’s affection and mutual respect is evident as we speak on a video call. Levit, in Berlin, is munching on peanuts. Abramović, in New York, emerges on screen and scolds her “genius boy”.“You shouldn’t eat peanuts because they can collect mould,” she says crossly.“Since when do I listen to you?” he retorts, and so their playful banter continues.No one except Abramović, who has been plotting the QEH show these past months at her New York studio, knows quite what to expect from it. The performance, she explains, will shape and shift over the hours. The podium on which the piano sits is detachable and its different parts will fragment, like the pieces of a puzzle. “We are creating some kind of sculptural element on the stage,” she says. Renowned lighting designer Urs Schönebaum is working with her to create mirror-like effects. The set will reflect back on itself, she explains. “Everything you see down, you can see up.”The audience will be steeped inthe Abramović method(the idea of using meditative repetition to enhance one’s consciousness, applied this time to classical music). The Southbank Centre has warned of “adult content”, though Abramović insists this has nothing to do with her plans, and is likely “British over-caution”, based on her previous, often risque exploits.View image in fullscreenMarina Abramović: ‘I will not be babysitting him.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianEven Levit seems unaware of what she has in store. “I cannot say what will happen, except you can expect me to be there and start playing,” he says. “Maybe it’s going to be dreadful. Maybe I will realise that I can only do it alone. And maybe it’s going to be the most fantastic thing ever. Who knows?”And what if he needs to pee?“I have a screen which goes up around the area of the piano,” says Abramović. “And his seat can turn into a bed, so that he can lie next to the piano for 10 or 15 minutes if he needs to. There will be two assistants, one each side of the stage, who can wipe his brow or bring him food and drink. If they get any sign from him that he needs anything, they’ll be there. But Igor will never leave the stage, ever,” she says firmly.She describes the performance as a study in being in the present. “If you start talking about how much time has passed, and how much time is in the future, you’ve lost the concept. Igor has to be therenow, in the space where there is no time, and the public has to go into that space. It is the same thing that happens when you count rice.“You’re going to go completely to another level of time, consciousness and experience.” Will she be on stage? “I’m introducing the piece, and then I’ll be in the public, but I will not be babysitting him.”Born in the Russian city of Gorki in 1987, Levit grew up in Hanover, northern Germany. His intensity and doughtiness as a performer and as an often outspoken political campaigner have earned him global acclaim and respect, but he has pulled back from social media in recent years after death threats and many antisemitic attacks. He says he’s no less passionate about the issues that move him (refugees, Ukraine, Israel) but feels the necessity to concentrate on piano playing.“The darker the world gets, the more I’d like to be the pianist that I am, and the more art we should create, the more music we should make. It is literally a tool of mental and emotional survival. For me, at least, I can say it becomes more and more existential.”“In my world, which is pushing down keys in black and white, creating sound, creating noise, playing melodies and sharing this with other people, there is no war, no cynicism, no power games – at least not in a bad way. There is, in the best case, transcendence, so there’s a reason to live in my world, and I would like to share this.”Igor Levit: ‘These concerts were life-saving for me’Read moreAbramović agrees. “If you spend your time looking at television, listening to the news, this horrible, ugly face of Donald Trump all the time, [or with] the diarrhoea of social media, you’re really lost. You have to create your own sense of peace in yourself.”But why is Levit prepared to put himself through such a potentially gruelling experience for a piece of music that he admits it is hard to be passionate about? “It’s not about reaching a goal. I’ve never cared for goals. I am a process person,” he says. “And so my answer, from the bottom of my heart, is because I can, and because I want to, and because I need it. I have the chance to do it with this beautiful lady, and we have been given the space. The main answer is just because. Full stop. That’s it.”Vexations is atQueen Elizabeth Hall, Londonon 24-25 AprilExplore more on these topicsClassical musicMarina AbramovićSouthbank CentreIgor LevitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyTo celebrate the Oscar-winning actor’s birthday this week, we look back at the highlights of a six-decade career, from early classics such as Doctor Zhivago and Billy Liar to later roles in Finding Neverland and Away From Her.ByAnne BillsonThu 17 Apr 2025 09.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 19.17 EDTShare20. Hamlet (1996)There are many things wrong with Kenneth Branagh’s galumphing slab of actor-manager Shakespeare, but Christie as Gertrude is not one of them. Her casting might have been conducive to the Oedipal side of the Danish prince’s feelings towards his mother – if only the director’s bombastic performance had allowed room for it.19. Young Cassidy (1965)View image in fullscreenGoing full begorra … Christie as Daisy Battles and Rod Taylor as John Cassidy.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockA mostly non-Irish cast goes full begorra in this Sean O’Casey biopic, with Christie in a brief but eye-catching turn as a sex worker called Daisy Battles. Jack Cardiff took over directing duties when John Ford fell ill; the results are rambling, but the anti-British riot scenes are ace.18. The Railway Station Man (1992)Irish accents again, as Christie reunites with her Don’t Look Now co-starDonald Sutherlandin 1980s Donegal, playing the widow Helen Cuffe, whose husband was accidentally murdered by the IRA. The pair’s old chemistry is still there, and the landscape is splendid. But, alas, when it comes to the men in her life, this unfortunate woman has the worst luck ever.17. The Return of the Soldier (1982)Three nicely calibrated female performances keep this tasteful adaptation of Rebecca West’s 1918 novel afloat. Christie plays a narrow-minded snob who is outraged when her husband (Alan Bates) returns traumatised from the first world war and fails to recognise her, but reconnects instead with a working-class sweetheart (Glenda Jackson) from his youth; Ann-Margret is wonderful as a compassionate cousin.16. Far From the Madding Crowd (1967)View image in fullscreenAll fringe and mascara … in the Thomas Hardy classic.Photograph: MGM/Studiocanal/AllstarThis is must for anyone studying English literature, though Christie’s wilful heroine, all fringe and mascara, smacks more of swinging 60s London than of Thomas Hardy’s Wessex; Terence Stamp, Christie’s former off-screen boyfriend, sports a Sgt Pepper moustache as Sgt Troy. The best bit is when Alan Bates’s sheep fall off a cliff.15. Darling (1965)John Schlesinger’s film about the rise of a good-looking but shallow playgirl epitomises all that was good-looking but shallow about the British new wave. Christie won an Oscar for looking fabulous; Frederic Raphael’s misogynistic screenplay also won an Oscar, but now feels suspiciously like a petty act of revenge on some unknown woman who was once mean to him.14. Doctor Zhivago (1965)View image in fullscreenMore Chelsea socialite than Slavic muse … Christie with Omar Sharif in Doctor Zhivago.Photograph: Mgm/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe romance between Omar Sharif as Zhivago and Christie as Lara is the least convincing thing about David Lean’s spectacular epic, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, butshot in sunny Spain. Once again, anachronistic hair and makeup make Christie look more like a Chelsea socialite than a Slavic muse, but it was the box office double whammy of this and Darling, in the same year, that cemented her status as an international star.13. Heaven Can Wait (1978)The third of Christie’s collaborations withWarren Beattyis a breezy remake of Here Comes Mr Jordan (1941), with Beatty co-directing himself as a Los Angeles quarterback temporarily returned to Earth in the body of a murdered industrialist. Christie plays the earnest eco-activist who wins his heart.12. Heat and Dust (1983)Ruth Prawer Jhabvala adapted her own Booker-winning novel for the Merchant Ivory team’s first big success, part of a 1980s British fad for all things Raj. Christie (born in Assam, north-eastern India) plays an English woman visiting India, but her exploits in the present day are less compelling than the flashbacks to her great-aunt (Greta Scacchi) in the 1920s.11. Demon Seed (1977)View image in fullscreenUncomfortably prescient …. in Donald Cammell’s sci-fi thriller.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyCritics were aghast at the idea of an A-list actor playing a woman forcibly impregnated by a computer in a genre film they considered “silly”. But Donald Cammell’s sci-fi thriller couldn’t be more pertinent to 2025, with its themes of domestic abuse and overreaching AI. Christie – rightly – gives it her all.10. Finding Neverland (2004)Christie plays the disapproving mother of widowed Kate Winslet, whose sons inspire JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write Peter Pan in this weepie biopic. It’s not mentioned here, of course, but Christie’s character, who mellows as the film goes on, will soon be grandmother to Daphne du Maurier, who wrote Don’t Look Now.9. Afterglow (1997)Two couples in Montreal swap partners in Alan Rudolph’s stilted sex comedy. Whenever Christie is working her magic on screen as the unhappy wife of handyman Nick Nolte, she makes you forget the contrived situations and clunky dialogue, and sweeps you up into a sublime, deservedly Oscar-nominated performance.8. The Go-Between (1971)View image in fullscreenQuietly devastating … Christie and Alan Bates relaxing on the set of The Go-Between.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA 12-year-old boy, spending the summer at a school friend’s country house, is cajoled into carrying secret messages between his chum’s older sister (Christie) and a tenant farmer (Alan Bates). After looking distractingly modern in other lit-flicks such as Doctor Zhivago, Christie is perfectly credible as an Edwardian aristocrat in Joseph Losey’s quietly devastating film adaptation of LP Hartley’s novel, scripted by Harold Pinter.7. Away From Her (2006)Sarah Polley’s directing debut, adapted from a story by Alice Munro, gives Christie the best late role of her career, as a married woman showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. She checks into a nursing home, but her husband wonders if she’s exaggerating her memory loss as revenge for his past infidelities. Ambiguous to the end, Christie makes it about more than just dementia, and earned a fourth Oscar nomination.6. Shampoo (1975)In the real-life ex-couple’s second film together, Beatty plays a philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser who still carries a torch for his former girlfriend. Hal Ashby’s satire, set on the eve of Nixon’s 1968 election victory, now seems more sad than funny, but Christie, rocking a backless black sequined Jean Varon gown, is a hoot as she drunkenly tries to fellate her ex at a posh dinner party.5. Fahrenheit 451 (1966)View image in fullscreenAlso worryingly prescient … in the retro-futurist adaptation of Fahrenheit 451.Photograph: Anglo Enterprises/AllstarThe current American trend of banning books makes François Truffaut’s charmingly retro-futurist film of Ray Bradbury’s novel feel like a wake-up call. Oskar Werner is a colourless leading man, but Christie makes up for it in her dual roles as his hilariously conformist wife and a rebellious neighbour who asks: “Do you ever read the books you burn?”4. Billy Liar (1963)John Schlesinger’s film of Keith Waterhouse’s novel leavens its social realism (shot on the streets of Bradford!) with the fantasies of Billy (Tom Courtenay). In her breakthrough performance, Christie radiates liberation and natural glamour, but miraculously makes Liz not just a dream girl but a fully realised character. She’s the girl next door – if the girl next door were a stunner.3. Petulia (1968)Christie dials up the kooky as an unhappily married woman who attaches herself to a San Francisco surgeon played by George C Scott. The drama starts off frothy but becomes progressively downbeat, until you belatedly realise you’re watching a tragedy, nudged along by nonlinear inserts now considered more typical of the film’s cinematographer, Nicolas Roeg (and editor Antony Gibbs), than its director, Richard Lester.2. Don’t Look Now (1973)Nonlinear inserts abound in Roeg’s haunting kaleidoscope of a chiller that is also a heartbreaking portrait of a marriage under stress. Christie and Sutherland play bereaved parents who relocate to Venice, where a blind clairvoyant claims to be in contact with their dead daughter. The wife accepts what she can’t see, while the husband’s scepticism blinds him to the truth until it’s too late.1. McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971)View image in fullscreenPeak Christie … as a cockney brothel-keeper in McCabe & Mrs Miller.Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockChristie came up with most of her own dialogue as the cockney brothel-keeper in Robert Altman’s melancholy revisionist western, set in a muddy mining town. Whether she’s tucking into fried eggs, striving to keep her relationship with McCabe (Beatty) on a business footing, or drifting away in an opium daze, this is peak Christie, and one of the funniest, saddest love stories ever filmed.Explore more on these topicsRankedJulie ChristieMcCabe & Mrs MillerDon't Look NowFar From the Madding CrowdHamletWarren Beattybest ofShareReuse this content"

He brought me around to his gigs and coffee houses. That was a cool, unique way to grow up, beside this alcoholic artist who hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend’s house. He he was smart and so well informed when it came to music.I was his shadow between the ages of nine and 13 or 14 or so. Beyond that, we parted ways. So when I was an emancipated minor at 15 and going into the adult world, it was with no protector by my side. I was out there in bars, on my own, running the open mic, playing gigs. I had an after-school job – I was trying to finish high school. I never managed to grow a thick skin; I’m still very open and porous. Somehow I survived all those years without cutting myself off.I remember seeing you regularly in London on a Monday night atthe Weavers Arms, probably in the early 90s. What brought you to London at that time?KjwillyBack in the day you could get a cheap plane ticket, where you were only supposed to stay for a week and you couldn’t bring any luggage. So I went to London, and – shhh, don’t tell anybody! – I stayed longer than a week. I started showing up to open mics and making friends. I remember a gig at the Mean Fiddler: a split bill between me and Tori Amos. The audience was loud and rude, and Tori was scolding them, and then I played. That was before either of us were either of us.In America, there was this stereotype of me that the media proliferated again and again: angry, hairy feminist. So that meant only certain people even felt invited to my shows, because the media told them exactly what my music was and who it was for. But when I got to England, there was nobody saying anything about me, so people could find their own way to my songs. The further I got from my stereotype, the more open and free my connection [to the audience] became.Doing things like rejecting the major-label system and having a social conscience – and, importantly, acting on it – inspires admiration. Is it me, or is that way of being, and of doing things, dying a death?eamonmccHaving thwarted the music industry and remained independent, I grew a lot. But when I look back, I see a lot of ways in which having a team of creative people around me would have really helped me make decisions. And helped me look good: there’s no hair products in my bathroom, you know.These records that I made all on my own are an acquired taste. I’m not an expert recordist, mixer, producer. I have regrets about not doing a lot of my songs justice along the way. It’s just a matter of what I can afford, operating on the level that I am. There are sacrifices to being outspoken and political. I’ve been pushed down and reduced because of my feminism, etc. But anything worthwhile involves sacrifice.View image in fullscreenOn stage in Chicago, US, in 1997.Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImageWhat is the difference between a good song and a great song?InASenseInnocenceA great song is a song that was not meant to be great: it was just meant to be a song. So many people want to make a hit, but to me, that’s like pulling yourself out of the water of creation and into calculation. Even worrying about that is a distraction from making real art. I’m just doing what I’m compelled to do in the moment.Ata time when women’s rights are being eroded at a terrifying pace, what can we do to rise to the challenge and support the young women of today?SJB3288What we can do looks different for each of us. For me, it has looked like writing a lot of songs, and lending my time and energy to movements. For somebody else, it might be bringing a casserole to a neighbour. My whole life I’ve fantasised about the moment when women across colour, economic and cultural divides reach for each other and model the solution together. I believe it would be the most powerful thing the world has ever seen. Individualism is a mirage.Somebody asked me, “Do you still see yourself as a protest singer?” And I’m not sure if I ever did, because I don’t think that telling somebody they’re wrong about something is very effective. More and more, I see my role through my songs as saying to people to my right and to my left: you are here and you matter. Really, the goal of what might on the surface sound like a “protest song” is to uplift the people of the world who are trying to do good work; it’s to make them feel stronger and more alive.I hope that more artists on every level will be putting their butts on the line and getting political, because it couldn’t be more urgent. It’s a terrifying time for democracy, for women’s rights, for the environment, everything. We are in peril on so many levels, so I hope that even artists with a lot to lose will go there. Who would I team up with for an anthem about women’s rights? What’s Little Simz doing – let’s go!DiFranco playing live in her home studio in 2021.You havecompleted your 23rd albumand have been around a while. How do you maintain your creativity when Gertrude Stein, for example, declared that after 26 an artist is through?WoodsDThere’s something to that: for a lot of us, what we have to offer, we offer right away. The work that I did [between ages] 18 to 23, that is probably the work that affected my culture the most. But I’ve made a lot of songs since then. I accept the fact that I’m not the “it girl” any more and that’s fine. But I am still growing, and passionate about what I do. There is no diminishment of value to women as they age, unless you’re working for the approval of the patriarchy. Our energy is being drained and taken from us by these forces that tell us we’re not good enough. I find it so sad that people in Hollywood are all trying to play the game with plastic surgery and injections. People accepting who they are, even as they age, is a service to everyone.What is your most reliable source of creative inspiration? How do you preserve the playfulness and magic in music-making in an industry, and indeed a world, with lots of noise and criticism?April006One of my most reliable sources is other people’s art. My favourite thing is to go to a show that makes me want to go home and pick up my guitar and write a song. And my second favourite thing is to be that for somebody else.Has being part of the theatre scene, through Persephone [the role she played in the musicalHadestown on Broadway], influenced your artor creative lens?April006It was very humbling in so many ways. I don’t know how much more humbling I can take in this life, but to play to an audience that did not show up to see me with love in their heart, on a nightly basis, was eye-opening. I had to lock eyes and sing right to people, and 97% of the time they were giving me the death stare. It was brutal.View image in fullscreenDiFranco at the March for Women’s Lives held in Washington, DC in 2004.Photograph: David S Holloway/Getty ImagesWoody Guthriewrote “this machine kills fascists” on his guitar as a symbol of the power of words and music to fight against oppression. We have a new generation of fascists and a nationalism that is rising worldwide with renewed vigour.You once wrote about “coming of age during the plague of Reagan and Bush”; Trump feels like a whole other thing again. How do you think about the role of your music against this new backdrop?benwerdComing of age during the plague of Reagan and Bush, I thought that we could stoop no lower. I was naive – there’s always a lower. As a political songwriter, you would love for your tunes to become passé. I wrote a song in 1997 about the plague of gun violence in America. [There were] these songs that I wrote in the George W Bush era, thinking that there was no greater evil to fight … and now here we are under a Trump regime. It’s horrifying to have these 30-year-old songs be more relevant than ever. Being an activist all these years is exhausting. And that’s also a very deliberate strategy by these repressive forces: to exhaust us. For me, who’s been taking to the streets for 30-plus years, I have to battle this feeling of: does it even matter, if all of the honour is stripped from politics, and the political leaders are just power-hungry oligarchs who don’t care?As a young, straight guy in the late 90s with a big love of Fugaziand straight-edge punk, I still found my way in to your music and found both it and your story revelatory and inspiring.I wonder, did you ever have or feel any kinship with those hardcore and very male bands at the time or since?HMKGrey2Absolutely. I love Fugazi and they love me back. I grew up in an era where if you were a woman speaking about your experience, that was, according to many people and the media, only relevant to other women. Any man who was open and brave enough to relate to and hear a woman’s experience, they were renegade and rare beasts. I remember having conversations on dressing-room walls, where we wrote to each other – they played the club a week before me, or I did. In the 90s, before social media, if you wanted to send somebody a message, the wall was where you posted.I loved hearing how you began by playing gigs at bars, and the way your songs were sometimes influenced by trying to grab the audience’s attention.Could you speak a bit more on how you struck out to develop your unique guitar style?April006The dynamics of my music – I use a lot of loud and soft – all come, I think, from the survival skills I learned playing in bars alone, to shut people the hell up! I discovered that if you make a loud sound or hold a note, and then you leave a chasm of silence, people’s talking will suddenly hang in the air and they will notice themselves, and then they might even notice you. In that moment, there is a seed of possibility for capturing their attention.What would you say to your Gen Z fans? The young lesbians still love you!paige004I still love them back. We’re still here. Being an old guard now of feminism and the queer movement, us old lesbos or lesbo-adjacent people have things to offer. And I hope that the younger generation want to have us at the table. They are finding their own way, and they very much should, and I have a lot to learn from it. But there are some feminist principles that could help allof our social movements, a lot of wisdom there to be drawn from.“He said, are you an American citizen? I said‘Yes sir, so far’” – any more or less since you wrote those lyrics?brittunculusMy mother is Canadian, so as of a year or two ago, I did achieve Canadian citizenship, so I’m dual now.

But her career should flyThu 17 Apr 2025 06.13 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 06.33 EDTShareIf you ever needed definitive proof thatMarvelhas lost pace with the zeitgeist, just look at the panicky marketing of Thunderbolts*. The film opens in a couple of weeks and, according to the trade press, is tracking to open soft.Had this been six or seven years ago, then fans would be clamouring to see Thunderbolts* simply because it was the latest instalment of the grand MCU soap opera. After all, it’s a film that stars several side characters from older Marvel films and TV shows, and there was a time when audiences would go bananas for this sort of thing. But as the last few MCU films have shown, that approach doesn’t really work any more.For a while Marvel attempted to trade on the intrigue of the asterisk, but that fell down because the people who cared guessed what it meant and the people who didn’t couldn’t care less. Then camethe weird trailer last monthwhere the movie tried to rebrand itself as an A24 film, declaring itself to be “absolute cinema” because it hired the production designer from Hereditary and the editor of Minari (and, in Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of You Hurt My Feelings). And while there was a lot of novelty about this – when was the last time a Marvel film made a big deal about the pedigree of the people who made it? – it didn’t do a lot to shift the needle.But now, finally, it looks as if Marvel has cracked it. The final flurry of pre-release marketing about Thunderbolts* doesn’t make a big deal about the superheroes or the mythology or the cinematography or anything like that. No, this time it’s being much smarter. This time it’s unveilingFlorence Pughas the new Tom Cruise.Thunderbolts* contains a big setpiece stunt in which Florence Pugh jumps off the 2,722ft Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, the second tallest skyscraper on Earth. Now it has been revealed that not only did Pugh perform the stunt herself, but she also pleaded with the Marvel brass to do it.“As we got closer and closer to shooting, they said they don’t think it’s going to happen because it’s a crazy insurance ordeal,”Pugh told Variety. “I was like what the fuck? Of course we are! We have to do that.” Referring to herself as a “sassy Karen” for refusing to let the issue drop, she then described the moment they relented. “They’re like, ‘OK, if you want to fall off the second tallest building, we’ll figure it out for you.’”These claims are backed up by a film that was posted to YouTube five days ago, in which we see Pugh jump off the aforementioned building. In truth, as far as the footage shows, it’s less of a jump and more of a dangle – she appears to step off the roof and descend a small distance before she’s winched back up – but nevertheless it looks absolutely terrifying.It’s a very Mission: Impossiblish formula. You’ll remember that the entire selling point of 2023’s Dead Reckoning: Part One was the sight of Tom Cruiseriding a motorbike off the side of a mountain. Indeed, by the time the film came out we’d already seen the stunt in its various forms hundreds of times.Of course, it turns out sharing your biggest stunt ahead of time is not always completely wise. Box office grosses for Dead Reckoning were lower than expected because we’d been given the exciting bit for free several years before it was released. This year’s instalment, The Final Reckoning, is doing a better job of hinting at the big stunt –Tom Cruise flapping abouton the underside of a corkscrewing biplane – without revealing the whole thing.Time will tell whether Thunderbolts* should have been less generous with the stunt footage. But for now that doesn’t really matter. What matters is that Florence Pugh wants to do her own stunts, and she’s fearless about it. If there’s a Thunderbolts* 2, maybe she’ll do a helmets-off motorbike chase, or a one-take skydive. Maybe she’ll beat Cruise and literally shoot into space. Maybe she’ll even start sending cakes to people for Christmas. Either way, this might be the start of an amazing action career.Explore more on these topicsFilmMarvelFlorence PughFilm industryTom CruiseMission: ImpossibleMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OnecommentShareReuse this content"

To some extent, that imbalance will be difficult to change, especially withticket pricesand attendance both setting records, often in concert with each other. But the last year or so on Broadway has also seen a resurgence in shows that pursue a vastly younger audience.$921 to see Denzel Washington’s Othello? How Broadway tickets got so expensiveRead moreOne of the biggest success stories so far is theRomeo + Julietproduction starring Rachel Zegler and Kit Connor, which emphasized the youthfulness of a story often aged up, and brought in a recognizable star with her own vocal fanbase – not unlike what Baz Luhrmann did when he cast Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 film version.According to one of its producers, the play managed to hit the youngest Broadway audience in recorded history, with 14% of ticket buyers in the 18 to 25 demographic, as opposed to an industry average of 3%.That may not sound like a record-torching number, but 18 to 25 is a narrow demo that notably excludes actual kids, who flock to shows like The Lion King and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on their parents’ (or grandparents’) dime. Many of the biggest Broadway productions of recent years have been those family-friendly spectacles or jukebox fare aimed at the nostalgia crowd. But this season has seen a surge in material seemingly aimed at that younger-adult crowd. Recent openers include a Stranger Things prequel, akin to the Harry Potter play only somewhat less kid-friendly and the less spectacle-mindedJohn Proctor Is the Villain, a play about teenage girls reading The Crucible, starring ... Sadie Sink from Stranger Things. Even the Stranger Things-free and more traditional-soundingSmash, based on a flop NBC TV series chronicling the making of a musical, appears to skew younger and fresher than, say, last season’sBarry Manilow-penned, second world war-based musical. A superstar version of Othello, one of the hottest tickets on Broadway, probably doesn’t need to offer $50 student-rush tickets, but they’redoing itnonetheless, presumably recognizing both the good optics of a discount option and the danger of pricing out tomorrow’s audiences. It’s also notable that so many youth-targeted shows aren’t splashy musicals but straight plays – always an area that could use the commercial boost.View image in fullscreenKit Connor and Rachel Zegler in Romeo + Juliet.Photograph: Sam LevyMaybe younger audiences can do for more challenging work what devoted fanbases have done for musicals like Rent, Spring Awakening, Mean Girls or Hamilton. A recent movie hit has proved the value of that dedication:Wicked, a show that’s been running for more than two decades, finally made the jump to the big screen and became a worldwide smash, seemingly less out of older-audience Oz nostalgia than younger-audience fandom for the show itself, as well as Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Younger stars like Grande, Sink or Zegler cultivate a level of rabid fandom that doesn’t necessarily greet, say, Denzel Washington, despite his best-to-ever-do-it rep.So while it might seem counterintuitive for Broadway to court a younger audience for their events pricedbeyond the reachof many middle-class Americans, it’s also savvy much in the way it makes sense to market an exorbitantly expensive trip to Disney World as a standard, attainable practice. Although movie tickets are priced much, much lower than their Broadway equivalents (which, if you don’t happen to live near New York City, incur an additional cost of entry via travel), Broadway is starting to seem further ahead of the curve regarding a lesson Hollywood has taken ages to learn: you can’t keep recycling the same properties forever. Though movies like Wicked and Minecraft have started their own recent youth-driven sensations, it’s taken studios years to consider that maybe the same mix of 80s and 90s properties (Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, Star Wars, The Matrix) don’t inspire the same excitement in those who came up after generation X.It may not seem all that revelatory to do a big, expensive play based on a big, expensive Netflix TV series – especially when there was a Back to the Future musical playing on the Great White Way not too long ago. Doubtless there will still be jukebox musicals courting audiences born well before 1975 and musty hit movies awkwardly converted to the stage. But after years of press about how the millennials are killing this or that outdated industry, don’t be surprised if it winds up being gen Z who helps saveBroadwayfrom blue-haired oblivion.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayUS theaterTheatreStranger ThingsWickedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he’s made his most personal film yet – and it’s a vampire thrillerThu 17 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 10.24 EDTShareWe’re supposed to be talking about movies, butRyan Cooglerhas family on his mind when we have our video call – parents, siblings, twins, ancestors and, most of all, his two children. “It’s all good, kids not up yet,” the director says in his Oakland drawl. He’s speaking from a New York hotel room, the morning after the premiere of his new movie, Sinners. But, sure enough, 10 minutes into our conversation, his five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son come into the room and bundle on to his lap. “Aw, here’s my little ones, bro.” A toy boomerang flies into and out of shot. “Daddy’s gotta work,” he patiently explains. Noises off-screen and doors closing.Anyway, where were we?Sinners is Coogler’s fifth feature and, despite being a gory period vampire thriller, his most personal. “I was bringing my whole life to it,” he says. This is his first original story, after a run that’s set him up as one of the most powerful names in cinema. His 2013 debut, Fruitvale Station, chronicled the final day of Oscar Grant, an innocent Black man shot dead by police in Oakland in 2009. It won prizes at Sundance and Cannes and put not only Coogler’s name on the map but also that of his regular leading man,Michael B Jordan. After that came Creed (2015), a reinvention of the Rocky franchise that was way better than anyone expected, even earning Sylvester Stallone an Oscar nomination. Then came the cultural phenomenon that was Black Panther (2018), and its tragedy-stricken sequel, Wakanda Forever (2022). Aged just 38, Coogler is the highest grossing Black film-maker ever, which gave him a certain latitude.View image in fullscreen‘Complicated grief’ … the late Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa in Black Panther.Photograph: Marvel Studios\\Disney/AllstarSinners is set in 1930s Mississippi, close to where his own family originated before moving to California, he explains. The narrative weaves in the recent history of the era: slavery, reconstruction, the first world war; abject rural poverty; the Ku Klux Klan; Christian and African spiritualism; and the birth of the blues. “I’ve been struggling to tell a story that does the great migration for a while,” he says. “It’s a personal obsession of mine, this period of time when Black people were considering leaving the south en masse.” He had already been interviewing remaining members of the“silent generation”for several years, he says, including his own family. The blues element comes from his uncle, who grew up in Mississippi and died in 2015. “We were really close, and he would always listen to blues records – it was his only form of entertainment. I would find myself listening to blues records to remember him. That’s how I got inspired to explore and research, and that’s how I got to this movie.” He’s mindful of his own place in this family history, he says. “So it’s me growing and dealing with my own position, my own mortality.”He’s talking as if he’s just made a historical documentary, but Sinners is a full-throttle action movie, taking in bloody violence, supernatural mayhem and some rousing musical numbers. Anchoring it all is Jordan in double gangster mode, playing twin brothers Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago with plans to set up a“juke joint”on the edge of town. Opening night does not go as planned.This is Coogler’s gift as a film-maker: his movies are deep and soulful but also crowd-pleasing and spectacular. It’s a rarity in today’s movie landscape, and Coogler comes across as a sincere and thoughtful artist.As to how he manages to make cinema that’s entertaining but not dumb, though, his explanation is simple: “We’re, like, real movie people,” he says. He’s talking about himself and his wife, Zinzi, who is his co-producer. “We grew up going to the movies. We all got kids now but we still end up going, even when we’re busy, at least once a week.”View image in fullscreen‘Movies have been in my blood for at least two generations’ … Ryan Coogler, photographed in New York, April 2025.Photograph: Andre D. Wagner/The GuardianWhen he talks about films, he’s talking about family, and vice versa. He really did grow up with the movies: “It’s been in my blood for at least two generations.” He remembers his father taking him to his first cinema when he was five. His father was in his early 20s, doing odd jobs in Oakland, which was still very working class (he later became a probation counsellor; his mother is a community organiser). The movie was John Singleton’s 1991 classic Boyz n the Hood: “He’d heard it was a good movie for Black fathers and sons.” This is the kind of movie Coogler has sought to make, he says: “about a specific American experience, but it translates – everybody gets that movie.” His father took him back the next year to see Spike Lee’s Malcolm X (1992). He’s proud that he’ll be screening Sinners in the same cinema next week.Coogler also remembers his first date with Zinzi, when they were still in high school together: they went to see the teen comedy Bring It On (2000). When he interviewed his grandmother (from southern Texas) as research for Sinners, she told him his grandfather (who hailed from Mississippi) had done the same: “He took her to the movies and tried to make out with her. And she told him: ‘Hey, we can do that after the movie. I’m trying to watch this.’”The twins element of Sinners is also close to Coogler’s own experience. He speaks of the history of twins being othered and mythologised, of thetwin deitiesin the Yoruba culture of his ancestors, and how West Africa still hasthe highest rate of twin birthsin the world. But he also speaks of his twin aunts, one of whom is his godmother. “We could tell my aunts apart easily, but they’re completely identical. They live next door to each other to this day.” He also confesses: “I dated these girls that were identical twins when I was in summer camp. But not at the same time, bro!” He was only 10 years old, so it was all innocent, he hastens to add. “But these girls were cute, man – everybody wanted to be with them.”As for directing two Michael B Jordans, Coogler modestly credits his leading man for differentiating the two characters (Smoke is tough and serious; Stack more easygoing and dandyish). Coogler just took care of the technical stuff, he says. The twins theme fits with the dichotomies of the story – good and evil; the blues and the church; day and night – but it was also a way to refresh his long relationship with Jordan, who has not only featured in all of Coogler’s movies so far, but also directed Creed 3, which Coogler co-wrote and co-produced.View image in fullscreen‘He’s a wild dreamer’ … Michael B Jordan as Smoke with Miles Caton as Sammie Moore in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PA“He’s an incredibly kind man, a humble man, generous, but he does have a raging ambition within him,” Coogler says of Jordan. “If you can offer him something that he hasn’t done before, that, on the surface, is a challenge, you have a better chance of getting his interest – especially with me, because we’ve done so much together.” He wouldn’t describe their relationship as brotherly, but they are like the twins in the movie: “Mike is very like Stack, in terms of his ambition. He’s a wild dreamer. He comes up with incredible ideas and concepts, and oftentimes I’m like: ‘Bro, that’s impossible.’ So we make a good pairing.”Despite the setting, it is tempting to view Sinners as a commentary on the present day. This is, in essence, a story about Black folks trying to build something of their own, and white folks coming in to try to tear it down (the movie’s chief antagonists are a sinister Irish folk trio, led by Jack O’Connell). At that level it’s a story that reflects its era, not least incidents like the Tulsa massacre in 1921, where a whole Black neighbourhood was razed to the ground by white people. But it could also speak to a modern-day America, where DEI provisions are being rolled back by the Trump administration, Black history is being erased, qualified Black professionals are being fired and white supremacy is apparently back.In 2022, Coogler washandcuffed and detainedat a bank in Atlanta, assumed to be a bank robber, when he was simply trying to withdraw his own money. The issue was quickly resolved, and Coogler would rather not talk about it today, he says.And as for parallels with the present day, “any direct ties with what’s happening right now are, like, totally coincidental, or ironic”, he says. He wrote the story in 2023. “I definitely couldn’t have predicted what’s happened in our politics in the last few months. I wish I was that smart.”View image in fullscreen‘Raging ambition’… Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed.Photograph: Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros./AllstarIn a way, though, Coogler’s career stands in direct opposition to the forces now trying to tear American progress down. Fruitvale Station anticipated the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. Now, that movement is in retreat, as the culture war has spread into entertainment: movies that give more space to women or people of colour are routinely piled upon by white so-called fans. Major franchises such as Star Wars, Marvel movies and Disney princess movies have all experienced this.But if there was ever any credibility to the “Go woke, go broke” maxim, Coogler’s work provides the perfect riposte – particularly his Creed and Black Panther movies, all of which have been hugely successful. Black Panther in particular will be remembered as an extraordinary flowering of Black creativity, in its utopian Afrofuturism, its celebration of African culture and its gathering of talents on screen and off, from the all-star cast, to Oscar-winning costume designer Ruth E Carter, to Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd and SZA on the soundtrack. It’s no exaggeration to describe it as a cultural moment, on a par with Coogler’s formative movie experiences Boyz n the Hood and Malcolm X.Making the sequel was much harder, he says, in the face of the Covid pandemic and the death of Black Panther himself,Chadwick Boseman, of colon cancer in 2020. It was a time of “complicated grief”, he says, and the Black Panther team took it like a loss in the family. They got through it by working. “Sometimes it’s actually a relief having something to do, so you can’t sit in that terrible feeling … After we put the movie out, my heart broke almost even more, because I realised all the work had been distracting me from the fact that Chad’s not going to make any more movies.”Conscious as he is of his identity and heritage, Coogler never set out to make films only for Black audiences. He pushes back on my suggestion that Sinners is simply about white folks tearing down what Black folks have built. It’s more complicated than that, he says. The story also includes Chinese American and Native American characters, and O’Connell’s character is marked by his own history of colonisation back home in Ireland: “I think he has knowledge of what’s really coming for these people.”View image in fullscreen‘Black people love that shit’ … the Irish folk band in Sinners, with Jack O’Connell, second left.Photograph: Eli AdéCoogler has no axe to grind against Irish folk music, he insists. Quite the opposite, in fact: “Black people love that shit, bro! It’s almost the world’s best-kept secret how much we love that music and that culture.”Music is the key to Sinners, and, he suggests, to the history of multicultural America. “You realise that ‘genre’ was a totally racist invention,” he says. In the 1920s, white-owned labels began to market blues, jazz and gospel music to Black consumers as “race records”, he explains, “and they built different genres off that. So it’s like, I sing a song, then you sing a song and now they’re different genres? That’s fucking crazy.”Coogler calls blues music “the most important contribution America has made to global culture … because it’s so true, it’s so pure that it works for everybody. And to me, that is fascinating – that people living under that type of societal situation can make something that had that transcendental impact.”There’s a memorable musical scene in Sinners where singer Miles Caton’s blues performance literally tears the roof off the joint and rips through the fabric of space and time, bringing together African tribal musicians, Funkadelic-style electric guitarists, even Chinese dragon dancers. This frenzied melting pot of musical styles and cultures is perhaps closer to the real America, or at least how Coogler sees it.View image in fullscreenLetitia Wright as Shuri in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThere’s just time to ask about Black Panther 3.

Is it going to happen?“I certainly hope so – I love all those guys over there,” he says. But then his children come back into the room. “They’ve come to collect me, bro,” he laughs, as they pull him away. He’s kept them waiting long enough.

Promotional materials for the film suggest these messages “order him to commit atrocious murders of three other tenants who, in turn, want to kill their next-of-kin”. The film is also described as “perturbing, livid and hypnotic”.Gascón’s rise to fame and fall from grace provided awards season with one of its most vertiginous fairytales in years. After sharing the best actress award at Cannes with herEmilia Pérezco-stars, the newcomer, whose credits until then mostly featured Spanish telenovas, looked set to become the Oscars favourite for her performance as a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob.However, disquiet among the Mexican and trans communities about their portrayal grew louder as the film’s campaign gathered pace, securinga record-breaking 13 nominations. But Gascón’s own chance at victory then appeared almost nil after posts on X were resurfaced which expressed controversial opinions about muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Gascón apologised but was cold-shouldered by Netflix and the film’s director, Jacques Audiard, until a U-turn saw her allowed to attend the Oscars – although not to walk the red carpet.The actor spoke out about the vitriol with which she was met during awards season, saying the pain of the subsequent backlashhad led her to “contemplate the unthinkable”. But promoting her memoir a fortnight later, she described herself as “less racist than Gandhi” and said “no one has to forgive me for anything”.“If anyone feels offended by things I may have done in my life,” she said, “let them come and tell me.”Gallo, 64, is another sometime Cannes favourite and proud non-conformist, whose explicit road trip film The Brown Bunny premiered at the festival in 2003. However, his career has flatlined over the past decade.The actor endorsed Donald Trump’s re-election and called him “the greatest president the USA has ever produced”. Last yearit was reportedthat the actors’ union in the US, Sag-Aftra, was investigating after complaints made by three female actors who auditioned for Gallo’s most recent film, The Policeman.Hispersonal websiteadvertises his services as an escort, as well as selling vials of his sperm, at $1m apiece.Explore more on these topicsKarla Sofía GascónEmilia PérezTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

It marks the first time the two leads have both been played by minority ethnic actors.Jodie Whittaker became the first female Doctor in 2017 under the previous head writer, Chris Chibnall, and Gatwa became the first black actor to play the TV lead of Time Lord in 2023.“Someone always brings up matters of diversity,” Davies said on the Radio 2 programme Doctor Who: 20 Secrets from 20 Years. “And there are online warriors accusing us of diversity and wokeness and involving messages and issues.“And I have no time for this. I don’t have a second to bear [it]. Because what you might call diversity, I just call an open door.”When asked whether he wrote the show’s diverse themes consciously, he said: “I don’t even know if it’s conscious. That’s life, and I think it’s the only way to write.”He said it would be harder to write scripts with “a narrow window” of references. “Why limit yourself? Why breathe in the exhaust fumes? Why be toxic?” he said. “Come over here where the life and light and air and sound is.”Sethu, who plays the Doctor’s new companion Belinda Chandra, addressed comments about the show’s perceived “wokeness” in an interview with the Radio Times.“I just think we’re doing the right thing if we’re getting comments like that,” she said. “Woke just means inclusive, progressive, and that you care about people. And as far as I know, the core of Doctor Who is kindness, love and doing the right thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was intended as an improved follow-up to the failed first Fyre festival in 2017, which experienced problems with security, food, accommodation, medical services and artist relations, resulting in the festival being indefinitely postponed and eventually cancelled.“The event has been postponed and a new date will be announced. We have issued you a refund. Once the new date is announced, at that time, you can repurchase if it works for your schedule,” read a message sent to ticket holders,ABC Newsreported.Billy McFarland, a businessman who organized the initial festival alongside the rapper Ja Rule, was convicted of wire fraud in connection with the failed 2017 festival.The new festival was being marketed under the slogan “FYRE Festival 2 is real”. Tickets, which went on sale in February,started at $1,400. Luxury tickets with artist access ran as high as $25,000.A $1m package, titled “Prometheus God of Fyre”, was also offered. This option was intended for only eight people, and said to include a four-stateroom yacht and 24/7 private chauffeur service.Despite descriptions about the location of the sequel festival on the website, Mexico officials had previously confirmed that no event of that name was planned to be held there.“We have no knowledge of this event, nor contact with any person or company about it,” Edgar Gasca, from the tourism directorate of Isla Mujeres, toldthe Guardian. “For us, this is an event that does not exist.”At the time, McFarland responded on Instagram to defend the festival, saying: “First, Fyre 2 is real.

They have nothing but admiration for him and wish him the very best for his future.”The Who’sRoger Daltreyis a patron of TCT and until 2024 acted as curator for their annual gig series at the London venue.But areview of the band’s March gig in the Metrosuggested that Daltrey was complaining onstage about Starkey’s performance.It said that the frontman paused their final song, The Song Is Over, and told the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can’t. All I’ve got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can’t sing to that. I’m sorry guys.”Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey,gave a statement to People magazineabout his firing. “I’m very proud of my near 30 years with the Who. Filling the shoes of my godfather, ‘uncle Keith’” – the band’s original drummer, Keith Moon – “has been the biggest honor and I remain their biggest fan. They’ve been like family to me.“After playing those songs with the band for so many decades, I’m surprised and saddened anyone would have an issue with my performance that night, but what can you do?” he continued, referencing the London gig.Starkey had appeared to be aware that the news was coming – and not on the warm terms shared by the Who’s representative – when he shared a tongue-in-cheek post on Instagram at the weekend.Beneath a photo of himself and Daltrey, Starkey wrote in all caps: “Heard today from inside source that Toger Daktrey [sic] lead singer and principal songwriter of the group unhappy with Zak the drummer’s performance at the Albert Hall a few weeks ago is bringing formal charges of overplaying and is literally going to Zak the drummer.”‘It ain’t over till one of us is gone’: the pop stars who refuse to bury the hatchetRead moreStarkey joined the band full time during their 1996 Quadrophenia tour. He was introduced to drumming by the Keith Moon, a family friend who gave him a drum kit for his eighth birthday.Starkey has also played with Oasis – although the lineup for the band’s upcoming reunion tour is yet to be officially announced – Johnny Marr, the Lightning Seeds, Sly and Robbie, and his father.He performs in the recently formed supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos, also featuring Shaun Ryder and Bez of the Happy Mondays and Black Grape, and Andy Bell of Oasis and Ride. In January, the band was forced to cancel a live date when Starkey suffered a blood clot in his leg. “This is now completely healed and does not affect my drumming or running,” he said in the statement to People.Starkey said he now planned to “take some much needed time off with my family, and focus on the release of Domino Bones by Mantra of the Cosmos with Noel Gallagher in May, and finishing my autobiography written solely by me.”Explore more on these topicsThe WhoPop and rockRoger DaltreynewsShareReuse this content"

So many people wanted to help,” she said on Tuesday.Tuplin said the endeavour took just under two hours – much shorter than hiring a moving company to box and unbox the thousands of titles. The brigade even put the books back on the shelves in alphabetical order.Now Tuplin hopes to have the new location open within two weeks.The bookstore has been in Chelsea, about 60 miles (95km) west of Detroit, since 1997. Tuplin has been the owner since 2017 and has three part-time employees.About 5,300 people call Chelsea home and residents described it as a place where neighbours help neighbours.“It’s a small town and people just really look out for each other,” said Kaci Friss, 32, who grew up in Chelsea and has worked at the bookstore for a little over a year. “Anywhere you go, you are going to run into someone you know or who knows you, and is going to ask you about your day.”Friss said Sunday’s book brigade reminded her of “how special this community is”.Explore more on these topicsBooksellersMichigannewsShareReuse this content"

They include his shift from abstract expressionism to pop art in the 1960s, his exploration of modern art in the 70s, his Reflections series of the 80s, and his interiors and nudes from the 90s.View image in fullscreenNew photos from Sotheby’s give a rare glimpse into Lichtenstein’s home studio.Photograph:  Art © Estate of Roy LichtensteinThe collection is expected to make more than $35m (£26m) when it is auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York next month.

Together, the group is a survey of the artist’s reflections of art history over four decades of practice.”Lichtenstein was born in New York City in 1923 and took classes at the highly regardedArtStudents League of New York in his teens. He was drafted into the US army in 1943 where he served as a draughtsman and artist. He later completed his fine arts degree at Ohio State University, where he also taught art.In 1951, Lichtenstein held his first solo show in New York. He found fame in the early 1960s with his large-scale reworkings of comic-book illustrations, including a series of “girl paintings” depicting stereotypical “damsels in distress”. His range expanded to include sculpture and ceramics, and he became an icon of the pop art movement alongside the likes of Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An infamous 1964 Life magazine headline asked of Lichtenstein: “Is he the worst artist in the US?” Others criticised the lack of credit he gave to the comics artists who inspired him.In 1968, Lichtenstein married Dorothy Herzka, a director of the Paul Bianchini Gallery in Manhattan. She became a philanthropist and, after her husband’s death, the president of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation. She died last year.Speaking about his father’s work, Mitchell Lichtenstein said: “What I most appreciate is the sense of humour embedded in all of it. It’s a wry humour that was part of who he was every day.“To my father, art was all about composition. When asked for comment about his subject matter, he often said: ‘It’s just marks on a page.’”The works coming to auction include Reflections: Art (1988), part of a series that ironically looks back on the artist’s earlier works by making them look like stylised mirrors; Woman: Sunlight, Moonlight (1996), a flat sculpture showing a woman’s profile; and a 1968 drawing of a smoking gun made for the cover of Time magazine, when the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F Kennedy had sparked a fierce debate about gun control.Explore more on these topicsRoy LichtensteinArtThe art marketnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just a shame that we don’t get more of him in this show about helping people with facial differences overcome their issues with the way they lookLucy ManganThu 17 Apr 2025 18.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Apr 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere are two ways to view Love My Face, Channel 4’s latest venture into one of its best-loved terrains – the place where medicine and society meet. The first is as a testament to man’s inhumanity to man, based on the accounts of lives made miserable by bullying and exploitation of the slightest visible difference sported by an individual. The second is as a shining example of the human spirit’s ability to endure adversity and forge a new, better life out of suffering. Over the four hour-long episodes you may find yourself pinging back and forth many times between the two.The format is familiar. At a specialised treatment facility, a group of people are brought together who have varying degrees of facial differences – ranging, for example, from a conventionally handsome young man with a keloid scar growing just noticeably on the back of his earlobe, to a man who was set on fire by his mentally ill uncle and suffered burns over nearly half his body, including his face and scalp. A team of doctors awaits to provide them with their medical options. And presenter Jono Lancaster, who has Treacher Collins syndrome, which means the bones of his face did not develop in the usual way before birth, offers emotional support and ways of thinking about their conditions and situations that may enable them to come to terms with them better – and perhaps avoid physical intervention.Lancaster is a gift to television generally, and this programme in particular. A natural communicator, he is also that rare breed who has clearly lived through much, analysed it thoroughly and internalised what worked for him in such a way that he can share it with others in direct, ordinary and therefore deeply affecting terms, instead of sounding like a therapised robot. He speaks with a wonderful combination of authority and compassion. You can see even the most traumatised patients falling under his spell and beginning to heal almost in real time.And there is real trauma here. Most notably, perhaps, in Kerry’s story. She longs to get rid of a stubborn double chin that persists despite her losing several stone after a lifetime of being overweight. Her size was one of her abusive father’s favourite subjects of attack, which left her no respite from the other comments she received at school and in public. “That’s how I felt before I was allowed to become anybody,” she says. She is now slim and, it is implied, has been in therapy before. But her chin, she explains on the verge of tears, “is what’s left of my dad. I’ve tried so hard to get rid of his voice.” Now she wants the physical reminder gone too.Love My Face is (ironically) a superficial production. Whatever the actual extent of Jono’s discussions with each participant, we are shown very little of it (but enough, as I say, to appreciate his talent for connecting and supporting each one according to their needs). More time is spent with the medics and their proffered plans – all of which are taken up by their subjects, most of whom have been denied further treatment on the NHS because it is “only” cosmetic – and on the obligatory reveals after the necessary weeks or months of care. For any deeper meanings or lessons to be learned, the viewer must do his or her own running.View image in fullscreenMia’s alopecia was acquired during adolescence and caused her to be tormented at school.Photograph: Channel 4It is fascinating, for example, to note the impact on the participants of a characteristic acquired during adolescence, such as Mia’s alopecia, and the repeated mentions of becoming self-conscious only as they were tormented at secondary school. It’s a painful reminder of how very little you need to deviate from the norm at that time to be marked – by yourself and by those around you – for life. We hear that Hattie was called a “minger” and “ugly” for her “Concorde” nose, and has “always been shut down … I feel like I shouldn’t be here.” Kayleigh talks of her “shame” about the port wine stain birthmark that covers part of her face, and says she hasn’t left the house without makeup since she was first old enough to apply it.You can also wonder at the gulf between people’s perceptions of themselves and the reality. There are a couple of times in the series when it is hard to see what is troubling a participant – with even fellow guests struggling – until it is pointed out. It is unclear whether anyone’s perspective shifts when they are in the company of people whose differences are far more marked. This also makes you question how much of Jono’s magic would be required to undo the harm social intolerance has caused the participants (who, for the most part, are not physically circumscribed in any way by their conditions) so that they can go without the medical interventions on offer.The programme itself, however, is content to end with the big visual reveals and words of gratitude to Jono for helping them find some peace with their experiences. Good enough, I suppose.Love My Face is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHealth & wellbeingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some productions – including the recent Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air – have a retrograde flavour, painting war (perhaps problematically) as a great big adventure. Many lean into spectacle, attempting to recreate the smoke and fury of battle, but in the process running the risk of celebrating or ennobling war. “Every film about war,” declared François Truffaut, “ends up being pro-war.”But The Narrow Road to the Deep North feels quite different from most war narratives, with a deeply layered central character and a heavy, morose tone of contemplation. There’s very little battlefield action, the war elements mostly taking place in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, where many soldiers, including Australian medical student protagonist Dorrigo Evans (Jacob Elordi), are forced to work on the Burma railway. There’s nothing remotely glamorous here.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningView image in fullscreen‘Throughout, the show is deep-thinking, eschewing myopic patriotism.’Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionThe story takes place in three time periods: pre, during and postwar. In the latter, Dorrigo is played by Ciarán Hinds. He has become a venerated, surly Sydney-based surgeon with a fierce glare and powerful turn of phrase. In one early scene he’s questioned by a journalist about his description of the Japanese as “monsters,” saying she’s spoken to Japanese survivors who’ve lost everything, citing the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The camp has both a tyrannical, horrifically violent colonel (Taki Abe) and a major (Shô Kasamatsu) who develops a fraught friendship with Dorrigo. There’s an aching feeling that war pulls everybody in terrible directions.View image in fullscreenComplex relationships with women … Elordi with Olivia DeJonge as his fiancee in The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionThe way Kurzel depicts Dorrigo’s relationships with women is also quite complex, not condemning him for the kinds of behaviour often viewed as moral mistakes. Before the protagonist is shipped off to war, while engaged to a woman (Olivia DeJonge) from a well-to-do family, he has a deep, intense sexual relationship with Amy (Odessa Young), the wife of his uncle Keith (Simon Baker). In the postwar timeline, he has an affair with Lynette (Essie Davis), the wife of his colleague Rick (Dan Wyllie).Elordi and Hinds’ finely balanced performances, as the young and older Dorrigo, really feel like different reflections of the same person, strikingly distinct in some aspects but inseparable in essence. The three timelines are smoothly integrated – less a mosaic than a river current – swirling, overlapping, forming and unforming.Narrow Road has a stately aura, stiffer and more formal than most of Kurzel’s work, with less of his signature tone – which is scuzzy and elegiac while somehow also elegant and poetic. You never doubt the show’s realism, or the compassion underpinning it. This is less about the theatre of war than the psychological stain it leaves.The Narrow Road to the Deep Northis streaming on Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand, the US and CanadaExplore more on these topicsAustralian televisionAustralian TV reviewTelevisionAmazon Prime VideoJacob ElordiWar filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

If nothing else, the contemporary reconfiguration of The Wedding Banquet passes the remake test handily.Ang Lee’s original 1993 film is about a bisexual Taiwanese immigrant, living happily with his male partner, who hastily arranges a lavish (and, emotionally speaking, fake) wedding to a woman to please his visiting parents; the director/co-writer Andrew Ahn, who shares screenplay credit with the original co-writer James Schamus, relocates the story from 1993 Manhattan to 2025 Seattle, and contends with a whole different set of social rules and actual laws in the process.The Legend of Ochi review – visually dazzling throwback kids movieRead moreAhn is so acutely aware of how times have changed, in fact, that he seems reluctant to mine the new situation for comedy. Lee (Lily Gladstone) and Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) are unmarried but committed lesbians about to go through their second expensive round of IVF. They can afford to live in the Seattle area largely because Lee has inherited her family home, where she yearns to start a family of her own; the couple also rents out a converted garage to Angela’s longtime bestie Chris (Bowen Yang) and his boyfriend, Min (Han Gi-chan). Min, who comes from money, has been in the US on a student visa that’s about to expire, and his grandparents want him to return to Korea and help run the family business. A green card is just a marriage proposal away, but commitment-resistant Chris is hesitant to marry, especially for convenience. So Min makes a counter-proposal: he’ll secure some of his family money to pay for Lee and Angela’s IVF, and in exchange, Min will marry Angela, for a green card and for familial show.The show becomes a lot showier when Min’s grandmother Ja-Young (Youn Yuh-jung, who won an Oscar for Minari a few years back) announces a surprise visit. A courthouse wedding will no longer do – and nor, it seems, will the hints that this Wedding Banquet will involve some degree of Birdcage-like deception farce. Ahn moves so far away from the mechanics of the 1993 film that the new Banquet takes ages just to waffle its way into its halfhearted scheme, which it then treats with an almost funereal sense of trepidation. (This, despite the fact that Ja-Young, no dummy, understands that the wedding ceremony will be for show, to placate Min’s unseen grandfather.)There are a wealth of serious relationship problems here: Chris, who has been indefinitely extending his grad-school years via an unfinished dissertation, shows similar reluctance to take the next step with Min. Angela, meanwhile, feels more ambivalent about motherhood than her partner, because of a fraught relationship with her overbearing mother, May (Joan Chen). (In a fun twist on the intolerant-parent trope, May can’t stop showing off how accepting she is of her daughter’s sexuality, as Angela cringes and attempts to avoid the spotlight.) Angela and Chris are described as codependent, even toxically so, but most of the time the movie skips over the funny side of those relationships – the snark, the shorthand, the almost fetishistic acceptance of personal quirks – so it can get to their complaints faster. The exception is a bit of unexpected bedroom farce that finally gives Yang, one of the funniest current Saturday Night Live cast members, something comedic to play. Naturally, it lasts about three minutes and quickly returns to the kind of guilt-ridden world-weariness you’d expect to see from a drama about grief.Look, there’s nothing wrong with Ahn taking his material seriously. That served him well in the beautifully wrought drama Driveways, about a kid who befriends his elderly neighbor, with masterly work from Hong Chau and, shortly before his death, Brian Dennehy. (It’s currently streaming on Tubi; check it out!) Even in his Wedding Banquet, there are certainly points where the lack of hacky shtick imposing itself on the characters counts as a relief, and even a few scenes, particularly a wordless one between Gladstone and Tran, where the performers bring true depth of feeling to potential contrivances. Yet those moments would probably land better punctuating a funny movie, instead of one that spends long passages actively distancing itself from comedy. Ahn largely shoots it like an indie drama that’s been cajoled into including some wan reaction shots, which has a domino effect: underdeveloped set-ups muffle the few punchlines and payoffs, which in turn make almost everyone involved seem vaguely depressed. (May, for example, never seems quite as monstrous as Angela makes her sound, which is more confusing than funny.) Han, making his film debut, is the only member of the central quartet paying much attention to comic timing.Tran and Gladstone keep the movie watchable, mixing prickliness and warmth in a situation that’s more common than movies often acknowledge: a partnership where one person is far more invested in parenthood than another. They’re stuck, however, in a movie that can’t quite commit to either incisive relationship drama or comedy of manners. Maybe that’s why Yang gets top billing over Oscar nominee Gladstone: his dithering Chris is the movie’s semi-annoying soul.The Wedding Banquet is out in US cinemas on 18 April and in the UK on 9 MayExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsDrama filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

That alone will make the set – taken from the two concert performances – a compulsory purchase for Davidsen’s many admirers, and certainly her performance is the main attraction here, though the feisty playing of theNorwegian National Opera orchestra, one of its first collaborations with Gardner after he became the company’s music director, is first-rate, too.View image in fullscreenDer fliegende HolländerBut from the moment that she launches into Senta’s ballad in the second act, colouring it to spine-tingling effect, Davidsen holds the stage, and makes every set-piece compelling, puttingGerald Finley’sDutchman entirely in the shade as she soars through their great duet. Yet her intensity is not sufficient for their pairing to strike real dramatic sparks. Alongside Davidsen’s larger-than-life quality, Finley’s portrayal seems rather small scale; his singing is as elegant and intelligently shaped as ever, his bass-baritone richly burnished, but the crucial heroic dimension is missing.Alongside them, both Stanislas de Barbeyrac as Erik and Brindley Sherratt as Daland give fine performances; de Barbeyrac clearly relishes his cavatina in the third act and Sherratt’s wonderfully even tone is always beautifully controlled. There are certainly more pluses than minuses in this performance, though in the end it seems just a bit less than the sum of its parts.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The partnership between US singer-songwriters Mackenzie “Torres” Scott and Julien Baker germinated in 2016, when the pair performed together in Chicago. Scott subsequently suggested, in a text sent during the pandemic, that they make a country album. Accusations that the pair are jumping on an ongoing trend for high-profile pivots towards a Nashville-oriented sound – which has so far involved the likes of Beyoncé, Post Malone, Zayn Malik, Chappell Roan and Lana Del Rey – are thus diffused.View image in fullscreenSend a Prayer My Way.Nevertheless, it still feels telling that Send a Prayer My Way arrives now. Baker has spent much of the 2020s as one-third of Boygenius, a collaboration with Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers that made her far more famous than her previous solo albums. It spiralled into something that resembled a genuine pop phenomenon, laden with awards and headlining Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl.Send a Prayer My Way, however, feels like a deliberate shift towards something more intimate and, perhaps, manageable. This is resolutely not the kind of 21st-century country that arrives, metaphorically, sporting a pink sequined cowboy hat, built to wind up on Spotify’s Neon Cowgirl playlist alongside Sabrina Carpenter and Shania Twain. Instead, its closest peer may be 2016’s self-titled collaborative album by Neko Case, kd lang and Laura Veirs. Its tasteful arrangements – big on softly weeping pedal steel and fiddle, occasional muted organ – and mid-to-slow tempos cleave to the less poppy and voguish sound of alt-country: when Tape Runs Out reaches a rocky crescendo, it feels closer to the realm of rootsyAmericanathan Nashville’s Music Row.The distinct lack of rhinestones makes sense: like Dacus’s recentForever Is a Feeling– an album largely concerned itself with tracing the arc of Dacus and Baker’s romantic relationship – it’s explicitly rooted in the personal. Baker and Scott hail from America’s deep south – the former from Tennessee, the latter from Georgia – where, as Baker put it, you “couldn’t escape” country music. Both are also gay, and the country scene of their youth was not exactly welcoming or inclusive.Julien Baker and Torres: Sugar in the Tank – videoSend a Prayer My Way’s same-sex love songs and stark explorations of growing up in an environment freighted with religious bigotry feel less groundbreaking in the era of fellow queer country acts Orville Peck and Brandi Carlile than they once might have done. But they’re still marked by an affecting sense of personal reclamation, of two expat Southerners looking back at a genre they rejected in their youth and finding a place for themselves. “In my book there’s no such thing as a guilty pleasure / As long as your pleasure’s not unkind,” the pair sing in harmony on The Only Marble I’ve Got Left.The pair sharply reframe standard country songwriting tropes such as weeping into your beer and/or starting a bar fight on Bottom of the Bottle, and Sylvia’s inveterate wanderer bidding farewell before taking to the open road. It can sound samey: the sweetly upbeat single Sugar in the Tank is an outlier, and Send a Prayer My Way could perhaps have done with at least one more track like it. That said, there’s real power in its combination of low-key musical delights – most notably the sound of Baker and Scott’s voices together, the former high and plaintive, the latter deeper and darker in tone – and lyrics that can deliver an emotional sucker punch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The saga devolves into self-harm, religious doubt and regret: the song’s brilliance lies not just in its unflinching retelling, but the fact it choses to spike its conclusion with wit. “One more thing: if you ever hear this song / Tell your momma she can go suck an egg,” Torres sings, softly.Something of that line’s quiet defiance runs right through Send a Prayer My Way, an album that seems intent on doing things its own way, regardless of commercial expectation or trends of the genre. It’s beautifully made and gently powerful – a reminder that understated pleasures are pleasures all the same.This week Alexis listened toKokoroko – SweetieFrom Kokoroko’s forthcoming second album, Sweetie splits the difference between jazz, Afrobeat and soul in an entirely delightful way: very summery, very London.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekIndieAmericanaCountryalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Teddy and Adam are teenagers in a small unnamed town on the west coast of Canada who have just finished high school. Bored and agitated, they are waiting for something to happen. Teddy, the more handsome and socially capable member of the duo, “is not thrilled by the prospect of manhood, but he has not yet settled on an alternative. He is shopping for shortcuts.” Maturation is laced with anxiety; “How can he avoid being left behind?” he asks himself.‘Blood-pumping’, ‘outstanding’, ‘urgent and essential’: the best Australian books out in AprilRead moreThe road trip north is Adam’s idea. He turns over “the idea of having gone as far as anyone can go”; Teddy “imagines the two of them arriving in a place where they were the other’s only family”. When the boys leave town, Teddy makes a stop to buy a gun; the reader quickly grasps that the road ahead will be violent and that these two boy-men will not grow up.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe friendship between Adam and Teddy is still finding a form, and The Passenger Seat charts their early intimacy and its acceleration on the road. Adam is a bit of a creep, a boy who turns to books and podcasts for advice on how to dominate the girls in his social group. He lives with his father and the topic of his mother is off limits. Both boys are struggling to respond to the cues emitted by their unruly bodies; they at once desire independence from family and long for the safety of its embrace.In an extraordinary first scene that prefigures the novel’s thematic preoccupations, and its tragic denouement, we are told that the boys “crave witness, someone who will remember seeing them wet and shining in the summer sun”. The narrator is their sombre witness, memorialising Teddy and Adam’s doomed intimacy, switching between their points of view, and often seeing far more than they do. The present-tense narration is deceptively simple and occasionally reveals itself to be retrospective, such as descriptions of security footage of the boys leaving a store, pulled from the future. We know how this story will end, and it’s not long before Teddy and Adam do too. For all that the climax is inevitable, the narrative remains almost unbearably tense as the boys wrestle with their opposing desires for connection and for independence.There is a coda to The Passenger Seat, another story of a dysfunctional male friendship adjacent to Teddy and Adam’s. Here we are in the company of a lonely man who tells anyone who asks that he “used to be close” to Teddy’s family. He is celebrating his 50th birthday by getting drunk with a friend, the ironically named Freeman, and reflects on his loneliness, on his desire to be a loving father and a loved son. He crashes out on his friend’s couch, just as Teddy did on Adam’s – a melancholy projection of the lives the boys might have led.This is as strong an Australian debut as I’ve read in years: confident, precise and simmering with intellectual energy. The Passenger Seat flirts with allegory but never renounces an urgent relationship to contemporary configurations of masculinity. Young men like Teddy and Adam are the subject of relentless public fascination. They are the guys who listen to Joe Rogan, watch Andrew Tate, read Jordan Peterson and voted for Donald Trump. Khurana grants Teddy and Adam their measure of humanity, but not redemption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Long on the expat beat, he has undertaken postgraduate studies in writing in the UK and won several awards for his short fiction there. The Passenger Seat was published in the US before it appeared in Australia. He is, in other words, a writer who has matured outside the networks and institutions that sustain most Australian debuts. Perhaps that accounts for his startling reinvigoration of long familiar tropes of Australian fiction: discontented young men, adolescent lassitude, the suppressed violence of regional towns, the cruelty of the wide, open road. Instead of sentimentalising Teddy and Adam and their milieu, Khurana has made of them a novel that is as original as it is timely.The Passenger Seat by Vijay Khuranais published by Ultimo ($34.99)in Australia and Biblioasis (US$22.95) in the USExplore more on these topicsBooksAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The book was reviewed in newspapers but with such fury that no Norwegian theatre would stage it; Chicago hosted the world premiere the following year. The playwright was so shaken that he wrote a great drama about ostracism,An Enemy of the People.Almost a century and a half later, and with anything going in most areas of life, it’s tough for a modern production to still deliver a Ghosts spooked by taboos. But Rachel O’Riordan’s staging of Gary Owen’s new version achieves it.“Complete silence would, in our opinion, be the most fitting reception for this work,” said one late 19th-century media critique. Turning this into a compliment, the 2025 theatre was filled with intense attention, broken by loud gasps at plot twists and laughter for dark jokes implicit in the original but spoken louder here.Owen and O’Riordan memorably relocated Euripides to modern Cardiff inIphigenia in Splottand similarly update Ghosts. Helen Alving becomes Helena, still the guilt-haunted widow of a local hero, though honouring him not with an orphanage but a hospital funded by private equity. Her troubled artist son, Oswald, turns into Oz, an actor short on auditions. The Alving’s maid, Regina, and carpenter father, Jacob, retain their relationship and roles, though she goes by Reggie. In the most striking modernisation, Pastor Manders, the creepy priest, becomes an agnostic management consultant, Andersen, whose church is Zoom and his bible workplace guidelines.The original contains (1881 plot-spoiler) a strand about assisted dying that is hotly topical now. Owen boldly jettisons that and the VD theme but still constructs a shocking plot around guilt, consent and, drawing audible shock, a plot line overlapping with season three of HBO’sThe White Lotus. The play’s theme of terrible familial and social inheritance survives in jagged dialogue that gives “home” and “safe” dark new meanings.Ghosts exemplifies Ibsen’s creed that the key events of a play take place before it starts: everyone is either hiding, or having hidden, something from them. The actors grippingly chart the negotiation of these secrets and suspicions. Victoria Smurfit’s Helena shows how the greater agency of a modern Mrs Alving has not prevented moral compromises but also allows her contemporary solutions. Callum Scott Howells as Oz is sassy, sarcastic but ecstatic at the prospect even of dangerous love. Patricia Allison’s confident, rebellious Reggie movingly becomes the story’s core of common decency. Rhashan Stone plausibly makes a corporate fixer the equivalent of a sanctimonious cleric and Deka Walmsley’s Jacob trails the exhaustion of a man who has kept quiet to survive.Crucially, this Ghosts, retaining the toxic power of the original, will grip whether you know the play or don’t.At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLyric HammersmithHenrik IbsenreviewsShareReuse this content"

A figure, some distance back. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t appear to draw any closer, or get further away. It seems to remain, matching our pace, just at the edge of vision – at the edge of the dusk now descending over the grand Lincolnshire parkland surroundingBurghley House. When we stop, the figure vanishes. When we set off again, it returns. A shrouded shape; a shadow stalking our steps.Map of Cambridgeshire/LincolnshirePerhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise. The old Roman highway we’ve been intermittently tracing from Water Newton to Stamford is a nine-mile track layered with history. Now overgrown and concealed, it was once a bustling leg of a great north-south thoroughfare that has run, in some form or another, like a backbone through the body of Britain for at least 2,000 years. A unique assemblage of ancient trackway, Roman road, medieval path, pilgrim route, coach road and motorway. Today, hereabouts, its modern incarnation – the A1 – loops west, leaving, as it does in many places, forgotten, discontinued ghost highways to their own devices.My fascination with the road connecting London and Edinburgh was sparked years ago. Joining an archaeological dig beside the A1 in North Yorkshire, I found myself unearthing the body of a man laid alongside an antecedent of the highway, perhaps 18 centuries earlier. Kneeling by that grave, a stretch of Roman road newly exposed to one side, the torrent-rush of the motorway to the other, the footings of future overbridges being hammered into the ground behind, I’d felt sharply aware of time – of past, present and future all meeting in that moment.View image in fullscreenRob Cowen became interested in the history of the route after unearthing a body that had been buried next to the A1 up to 1,800 years ago.Photograph: Rob CowenThe feeling stayed with me. Obsessive investigations over the months that followed coincided with the discovery of photographs hinting at my family’s own connections to this highway, and I started to see it as far more than just a road. Rather, a timeline through this land; a repository of collective memory. I wondered what else was out there and began exploring its 400 miles whenever I could, walking and re-walking its howling carriageways and tangles of tributaries, up and down the country. Ten years of research culminated in my new book: The North Road. Blending non-fiction, memoir and short-story, it is part road movie, part novel; part history and part personal journey that braids a universal story of people and place through time.So the leg to Stamford is a revisiting on my part. The idea of a friend and writer who lives nearby and wants to feel something of the aura of the road himself. We meet outside theBell Innin Stilton, on a museum-piece high street, bypassed now by the A1 and a world away from its previous life as a stop on the old highway. In the 1830s, 42 coaches and mails surged down Stilton’s high street every 24 hours. Their destinations persist, tattooed into the stone of the inn’s arch – as do the ubiquitous (and inevitably false) coaching inn rumours of Dick Turpin escapades. Inside, menus skew towards the Bell’s most renowned export: stilton. Made miles from here in Leicestershire, the cheese became a hit in the Bell’s dining room. Soon it was being sold from Stilton to every passing coach. The name stuck.View image in fullscreenThe Bell Inn Hotel, Stilton.Photograph: Dave Porter/AlamyLunchtime rarebits devoured, we drive up the A1 to Water Newton, six miles north. Its only thoroughfare (“Old North Road”) like a fibre worked loose from the thick rope of dual carriageway veering west to avoid the River Nene. Another preserved village emerges: drowsy stone houses, dewy lawns, willows. Rooks cawing. A snapshot England cut from a vintage motoring annual. It takes imagination to picture the huge Roman walled town and transport hub, Durobrivae, that once existed three fields to the east. The travellers, livestock, wagons, soldiers; the stink, smoke and fire; the warehouses, potteries, kilns and villas. And running through it, that wide Roman road north that came to be christened Ermine Street.While reduced and buried, the Roman road still uncannily declares itself via a long ridge under earth, like an arm thrust under a duvetTo join Ermine Street, we cross the glaze-green River Nene near the Norman church of St Remigius where a slab to a native son, Edward Edwards, reveals him to be the captain of HMS Pandora – the ill-fated frigate tasked with hunting down the mutineers from the Bounty in 1790. From here, the Hereward Way footpath tracking the Nene is the best route, joining up with Ermine Street further on, although highway purists like me may prefer to try a bit of rough walking along more of its laser-line straightness. For while reduced and buried, the Roman road still uncannily declares itself via a long ridge under earth, like an arm thrust under a duvet.Fields, woods. Early skylarks over dwarf pasture. The entire afternoon is swallowed in open-stride walking, with the odd diversion down roads and tracks where necessary. Pausing for water, we find the base of a Saxon cross – Sutton Cross – in the undergrowth. Such relics of history are testament to the fact that there is no virgin earth anywhere in England. Later, approaching the parkland of Burghley House, the track becomes a footpath through green baize, spotted with stately oaks. We are tracing this along the vast estate wall, evening just beginning to fall, when we notice the figure following us.View image in fullscreenSixteenth-century Burghley House.Photograph: Burghley House/Visit EnglandBurghley was built by William Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, but the area is also profoundly connected to John Clare – the rural labourer and nature poet who was a gardener at the big house in his youth. In 1806, Clare jumped over this same estate wall on his way home from Stamford to read a book of poems. It was a Damascene moment that changed everything. Writing, fame and, eventually, fits of delusion, madness and internment followed, with Clare conducting his own last, epic foot journey up the north road in 1841, fleeing from an asylum and trying to get home. We are discussing this when the figure emerges.Stamford’s clusters of churches, mazy passageways and twisting thoroughfare, give it the air of a condensed Oxford or CambridgeI suggest we quicken our pace to reach the estate gate where the path joins the old Great North Road. When we do, we turn to find the figure has gone. But as we set off down the pavement, we both see it shuffling ahead of us, turning the corner towards Stamford, before disappearing into the dark.Described by Sir Walter Scott as ‘‘the finest sight on the road between Edinburgh and London”, Stamford’s clusters of churches, mazy passageways and twisting thoroughfare give it the air of a condensed Oxford or Cambridge transposed to a leafy fold in Lincolnshire. The George, close to the point where the road bridges the River Welland, is its ancient coaching inn and is still doing great business. It’s less a place than a portal to be moved through – a feeling amplified as you pass under its 18th-century “gallows” sign, once doubling as welcome or warning to travellers.Cromwell is rumoured to have overnighted. Charles I was also a guest, and his last evening of freedom was spent in the town. A century after, the “bloody” Duke of Cumberland, Butcher of Culloden, took dinner in the same panelled dining room we’re pulling up chairs in, after routing Charles I’s greatgrandson Bonnie Prince Charlie on a Scottish moor.Over well-earned pints, we relive the dizzying depths of history experienced in a single afternoon’s walking along the highway. My friend brings up the figure again – the sheer strangeness of it. He shakes his head. But this is something you come to accept. Old roads lead to uncanny places. Time does stand still. The enormous past often possesses the present.The North Road by Rob Cowen is published byCornerstone(£22). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Cabbage, the hero vegetable in my kitchen, stars as the main dish, which is my take on Ashkenazi latkes. Presented here as the size of a rösti, it makes the perfect veggie centrepiece, and invokes the eastern European spirit of sharing. The side makes a perfectly creamy and zingy companion, showcasing the best of new season potatoes and carrots. Fresh, vibrant and full of colour, this duo is an edible herald of spring.Giant cabbage, pea and spring onion latka (pictured top)Prep5 minCook1 hr 30 minServes6-81 medium cabbage(roughly 800g)1 small bunch of spring onions(4-6 onions), trimmed and finely chopped, both green and white parts25gdillor more to taste, finely chopped, plus extra to serve, if you like1 tbspfine sea salt100g frozen green peas4 eggs80gplain flour(4 heaped tbsp)Olive oilSoured cream,to serve (optional)Remove and discard the outer leaves of the cabbage, but keep the core intact. Quarter and shred the cabbage into thin strips, using a mandoline, ideally, or as thinly and evenly as you can with a sharp knife. Put in a bowl with the spring onions and dill, and season with salt.Put the peas in a sieve, defrost with boiling water, then drain and add to the cabbage bowl.In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the flour, mixing vigorously to make a smooth batter. Pour this into the vegetable bowl and mix thoroughly until evenly incorporated.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a nonstick ovenproof frying pan, and swirl it around so it coats the sides of the pan, too.Add the cabbage mixture (it should sizzle straight away), and press it down hard into the pan so it sits in an even layer. Cook on a high heat for eight minutes, until the bottom sets and caramelises. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes, until the top of the latka is crisp and caramelised in places. Remove, leave in the pan to cool for five minutes, then run a rubber spatula or palette knife all around the edges to make sure the latka isn’t stuck. Carefully transfer the latka to a platter and decorate with fresh dill sprigs and dollops of soured cream, or the herby feta dip below.Roast new potatoes and carrots with whipped herbed fetaView image in fullscreenAlissa Timoshkina’s roast new potatoes and carrots with whipped herbed feta.Prep5 minCook1 hrServes6-8400-600g new potatoes200-400g young carrots30ml olive oilSea saltFor the whipped feta200g feta100g full-fat creme fraiche15g dill15g parsley4 sprigs fresh mint, leaves pickedTo serveDill, parsley and mint leavesChilli flakesSea saltFinely grated zest of ½ lemonWash the potatoes and carrots, then cut them all in half lengthways.
