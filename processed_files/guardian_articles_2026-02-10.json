Let’s jog some memoriesGeorge MonbiotYes, he betrayed the national interest in his dealings with Jeffrey Epstein – but also in his sanctioned role as enabler of corporate powerTue 10 Feb 2026 13.07 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 13.13 ESTShareHistory is being rewritten. The story we are told is that an evil man called Peter Mandelson, pursuing his own interests,went rogueto collaborate with a serial abuser of girls and women, undermining the good work of people seeking to defend the public interest. All this is true. But – and I fear many will find this hard to accept – it is only half the story.The much harder truth is that Mandelson’s disgraceful dealings with Jeffrey Epstein were less a betrayal of his brief than an unauthorised extension of it. In 2009 – just as, we now know, Mandelson was passing sensitive information to Epstein – I argued that thegovernment department he ran, called Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Berr), “functions as a fifth column within government, working for corporations to undermine democracy and the public interest”.Berr was a smaller and less chaotic version of Elon Musk’s“department of government efficiency”(Doge). Its purpose, I suggested, was to bypass the House of Commons on behalf of capital. It allowed Gordon Brown’s government to create the impression that it was defending the public interest while simultaneously, but more quietly, appeasing powerful lobbyists. In contrast to other government departments, Berr was largely run by unelected lords, who had either been corporate executives, corporate lobbyists or, like Mandelson, members of a concierge class operating on their behalf. I wrote that these ministers, appointed by Brown, “appear to have formedtheir own lobby group within government”.Berr sought topart-privatise Royal Mail, breaking a manifesto commitment. It succeeded. It tried to block theEU working time directive: UK government filibusters delayed and weakened it. It attempted, less successfully, to undermine theequality bill, whose aim was to ensure equal pay for women (Mandelson’s simultaneous dealings with Epstein were not the only respect in which he showed disdain for women’s rights). It undermined environmental legislation. It was “quietly building a bonfireof the measures that protect us from predatory corporate behaviour”.So when Brown, who was prime minister at the time, expresses his shock and betrayal, please forgive me a small gasp of frustration. In his interview on theBBC’s Today programme, Brown claimed that in 2009: “We were solving a major financial crisis … all my thoughts were on how we could save people’s jobs and savings and their livelihoods.” But not only did he allow Mandelson to attack the public interest on behalf of business, he greatly increased Berr’s budget. This was despite the fact that, as I noted at the time, Mandelson “was partly responsible, both in Blair’s government and as European trade commissioner, for promoting the culture of deregulation that catalysed the economic crisis”. On one hand, Brown was trying to solve it. On the other, at the behest of corporate lobbyists, he was setting up the next one.Brown also told the BBC, in justifying his appointment of Lord Mandelson, that the man had “an unblemished record as the [European] trade commissioner”. An unblemished record of what, exactly? Neocolonialism, perhaps. While Mandelson was in that post, he sought to imposedraconian trade provisionson some of the poorest countries on Earth. He put pressure on them to let EU corporations muscle out local firms and make privatisation legally irreversible, threatening people’s access to health, education and water. He sought toforce African countriesto hand over crucial resources at the risk of widespread hunger.Yes, when Mandelson was a minister in Brown’s government, he betrayed the national interest. But this is what, by other means, he was appointed to do. His treachery, while it went way beyond his official mandate, was not a bug, but a feature. The corrosion of democratic values was institutional. And this spirit has prevailed ever since. Keir Starmer’sgovernment of all the lobbyistsis no exception.Brown, inproposing remediesfor the secretive machinations Mandelson conducted, writes: “Conventions about commercial confidentiality should no longer prevent public service contracts delivered by private companies being subject to reasonable freedom of information requests.” I could scarcely breathe when I read that. It is exactlythe demand some of us madewhen Brown rolled out theprivate finance initiative (PFI)across the public sector, enabling businesses to get their hooks into every aspect of state provisioning. When we tried to see the contracts, to understand what was being done in our name, Brown’s Treasury repeatedly blocked our information requests on the grounds of “commercial confidentiality”.The sense of betrayal that Brown quite rightly feels is the same sense of betrayal some of us felt towards the governments in which he served. Yes, Brown had and retains some great qualities, anddid much good. But he is also a remarkable escapologist. Almost everyone appears to have forgotten how his PFI programme planted atimebomb in public services, enabling corporations to take the profits while leaving the risks with the state: one of the reasons why they arenow in so much trouble. Almost everyone appears to have forgotten his crucial role in the Iraq war: standing with Tony Blair andfinancing it. He rightly called for Vladimir Putin and his “enablers” toface justice for their crime of aggressionin Ukraine. Yet it’s the same crime that Blair and his enablers (including one G Brown) committedin Iraq.But it is not just Brown who is rewriting history. The media are 50% of any problem, and the story most of it loves to tell is of one bad apple. Heaven forfend that we see the systemic problems. There is a reason why Mandelson kept returning to government, despite sackings for his over-enthusiastic relationships with plutocrats. He was brought in to do the dirty work. The governments in which he served could loudly claim to be doing something, while subtly and simultaneously undoing it.Mandelson’s treachery is an extreme instance of the dominant mode of UK politics over the past 45 years: the subordination of democracy to thedemands of the ultra-rich. Abuse and exploitation – of women and children, of poorer countries and their people, of workers and contractors, renters and customers – are baked into the system.If you cannot diagnose a problem, you cannot fix it. We urgently need to see this for what it is. Mandelson’s grovelling to the sinister rich is disgraceful, disgusting, deceitful, a crushing of women’s rights and of democracy. But it is not a deviation from the system. It is a manifestation of it.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Would a massive set of teeth suit his faithful beagle, Gromit? How about a nose shaped like a banana?Such questions are answered by an illuminating and sometimes alarming exhibition at east London’s Young V&A that showcases the work of the world’s leading stop-motion outfit, the Bristol-basedAardmanstudios. Early sketches for Nick Park’s much-loved characters reveal that Wallace was once just a few bristles short of Hitler, while Gromit had fangs and the ability to speak.Such designs were judiciously smoothed along the way: Gromit became toothless and mute, and Wallace’s long, thin face was massaged into something wider and friendlier after Park watched Peter Sallis, the original voice of Wallace, enunciating the word “cheese”.View image in fullscreenTimmy from Shaun the Sheep on display.Photograph: David Parry/PA Media Assignments/PAInside Aardman: Wallace & Gromit and Friends opens on Thursday and runs until 25 November, two months after the release of the studio’s third Shaun the Sheep movie, The Beast of Mossy Bottom. Aardman, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, is one of UK film’s most enduring and endearing success stories, with a current total of four Oscars and eight Baftas.Its first film, Chicken Run, is still the highest-grossing stop-motion movie of all time, taking $225m – about five times its budget – while its latest, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, became the BBC’s most-watched scripted show in two decades after it aired on Christmas Day in 2024.Sales for the exhibition are comparable to those enjoyed at the V&A’s main site in South Kensington. More than a quarter of the tickets have already gone, and the first three weeks are entirely sold out.Over 150 items are on display, including never-before-seen models, sets and storyboards from Aardman’s archives. They are all the more precious for their scarcity. A fire destroyed thousands of items in 2005, including the original Creature Comforts and Chicken Run models.View image in fullscreenPeter Lord (right) and David Sproxton photographed in 2018 with one of their earliest creations, Morph.Photograph: Adrian Sherrat/Adrian SherrattThe exhibition’s layout intends to recreate the experience of touring the company’s studios, offering children “a peek behind the curtain” – and hopefully inspiring them to similar endeavours said the chief curator, Alex Newson. Boards around the four large rooms precis the key jobs across the studio – such as writer, puppet maker and director of photography – and the skillsets needed.Aardman’s co-founders, Peter Lord and David Sproxton, began modelling together as schoolboys in the 1960s on Lord’s kitchen table in Woking. “Our working hours were constrained by mealtimes,” he said. “We had to finish by 6pm and get out of the way.”They borrowed a 16mm clockwork camera from Sproxton’s father, “which meant we were in an unusual and privileged position”, Lord said. “Now it’s democratic because everyone’s got a camera. And it’s such a powerful thing for young people to be able to bring something to life.”The studio was founded in 1976, then given fresh energy by Park’s arrival in 1985. It now employs more than 500 people.“Aardman is an incredibly complex and skilled operation,” said Newson. “It’s also slow. Each animator only produces around two seconds of footage a day. Yet it’s one of the most accessible creative processes; even a small child can grasp it.”The exhibition offers ample opportunity for children to get hands-on – repeat visits are encouraged and included in the price. One area enables them to shoot a 20-frame stop-motion short using Playmobil figures, while another offers the tools – rubber gloves, drumsticks and coconuts – for them to provide a soundtrack.View image in fullscreenThe ship from The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! on display in the exhibition.Photograph: David Parry/PA Media Assignments/PAMany models on display are designed to be handled, as are samples of their malleable metal skeletons. One scene featuring Feathers McGraw – Wallace and Gromit’s sinister penguin nemesis – is set up so visitors can manipulate the lighting rig and witness the dramatic effect that subtle changes can make.The demographic of visitors is likely to stretch beyond primary school age, but the exhibits have been tailored to children. “What we see with kids is that they run to the interactive things first,” said Newson. “Without those things to do, they won’t engage with things in cases and on the walls.”These include meticulous models such as Gromit’s vegetable patch, the local museum from The Wrong Trousers and a remarkably large and detailed ship from 2012’s The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! – which Lord says is the exhibit of which he’s fondest. “I love that thing,” he said. “It was a totem for the whole production: wonderful, bonkers, mad.”Scores of spare mouths are on display – inserted and ejected from figurines to speed production – likewise a selection of everyday objects occasionally drafted in, such as clingfilm, tinfoil, icing sugar and lentils, the lentils used as rivets on Wallace’s space rocket.View image in fullscreenGromit in the greenhouse model used in the filming of Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit at the Young V&A in London.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPATV screens explain various Aardman idiosyncrasies, such as the “model hospital” that specialises in ear repair and eye wiping. One striking video shows Park acting out storyboards with co-directors, the better to later recreate plausible facial expressions in clay.Park can appear a self-effacing figure on awards podiums, but such footage reveals him to be a highly adept and rubbery performer, a match for any of the A-listers he brings on board for voice work.Many of Aardman’s films have explored the tension between embracing technical advance and being wary of it turning on its originators, but the exhibition suggests the studio has found a happy medium. Thumbprints are generally left intact, but cutting-edge software is employed to aid innovation. “The digital processes support the handcrafted processes,” said Newson.“Stop-motion is maybe more loved than it ever has been. It’s not an antidote to AI, but there is something about its homespun nature that resonates. It’s a counterpoint.”View image in fullscreenFeathers McGraw’s cell from Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: David Parry/PAThat such a sentiment has international reach is supported by Aardman’s theme parks in Japan, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, as well as outside Liverpool. Wallace and Gromit are remarkably popular in South Korea, but the lack of dialogue in Shaun the Sheep helps to explain why those characters account for 35% of the studio’s overseas business.Other diffusion lines include a Shaun circus show, scheduled to open in Manchester this year, partnerships with hotels and restaurants, and a few on-the-hoof ventures. TheShaun the Sheep restaurant in Dubai, for instance, with its menu of lamb’s brain, tongue, eyes, brain and trotters, is unlikely to be official.Aardman’s 20 best films – ranked!Read moreThe concepts behind the exhibition have been road-tested by years of schools’ workshops and young internships pioneered by the company, said Newson. For Lord, his involvement in the former has led him to believe the “simple pleasure” of working with clay remains consistent. “Modelling is engrossing,” he said, and it can work in symbiosis with the attractions of an smartphone.“What we do at Aardman is really technical and complicated. It requires great skill and great patience, but even so, it’s basically telling jokes and funny stories and creating good characters. Yes, we’ve done clay for 50 years. But we’ve also done play.”Inside Aardman: Wallace & Gromit and Friendsruns from 10 February to 25 November at the Young V&AExplore more on these topicsAardmanWallace & GromitLondonAnimation on TVnewsShareReuse this content"

You had service users crying, saying: ‘I don’t want to go.’ It was soul-destroying.”Since the announcement from the council last Tuesday that it was “back on track”, Collymore is one of several people in Birmingham that have expressed frustrations with the measures implemented by the local authority to tackle its financial woes.View image in fullscreenWendy Collymore outside the Fairway Centre in Kings Norton, which her father attended until 2024 when it was forced to close.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe council issued a section 114 noticedeclaring effective bankruptcyin September 2023, blaming a £760m equal-pay liability, a botched IT system and £1bn in cuts over the previous decade of Conservative government.In response, the council put forward a massive cost-cutting drive, a £750m asset sale programme and a 17.5% rise in council tax bills over two years.The city has also been dealing with the impact of a more than year-long bin strike after the council slashed pay and jobs. In an announcement on Tuesday, the Unite union said workers had voted in favour of extending the strikes beyond the May local elections into September.“The rubbish, the fly-tipping … you’ve got young people, they have no longer got a youth centre,” Collymore said. “When the opportunity was there, Birmingham city council turned their backs and walked away.”TheSave Birminghamcampaign began in response to the bankruptcy declaration, with the aim of securing the future of community assets – including libraries, youth centres and community centres – which were at threat of closure due to the asset sale programme.Kathy Hopkin, the campaign coordinator, said: “These kinds of places are a lifeline and are either free of charge or very low cost. If people don’t have access to them any more, then [you get] issues of social isolation, issues of young people not having access to activities.”For Hopkin, the announcement from the council on Tuesday has done little to assuage her concerns. “There are still libraries that are on the chopping block so [the announcement] feels quite tokenistic to me. It feels like nothing’s actually going to change … they’re stripping the city of everything.”She added that the asset sale programme, which the council said was continuing in order to finance the equal-pay liability, was shortsighted. “Stripping away all of these things, you’re setting yourself up for having higher costs in the future,” Hopkin said. “It’s storing up issues for the longer term.”A council spokesperson said that there were no plans to close any of Birmingham’s libraries. Regarding asset sales, they added: “The council is conducting a city-wide asset review and disposal programme to raise up to £1bn in capital receipts by the end of 2027, to support essential services and transformation.”Sidrah Awan, the welfare manager at Green Lane mosque, said families in Birmingham had been increasingly struggling, with residents “choosing between whether they eat or whether they warm up their home”.View image in fullscreenSidrah Awan, the welfare manager at Green Lane mosque, says demand for services such as the food bank have doubled or tripled in two years.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianDemand for many of their services – including a food bank, financial assistance programme and social services – had doubled or tripled in the two years since she took on the role and this included stay-and-play sessions, which, Awan said, were one of many services cut by the council in recent years.However, for Awan, the blame cannot be put solely on the local authority. “This is an ongoing problem,” she said. “I don’t think we can blame just one party for the issues that have been happening. This [has] obviously been a long process that has caused the council to get into this position.“It’s been a difficult time for everybody, council included.”Many local authorities have raised concerns in recent years about rising costs and demand, with 30 receivingexceptional financial supportfrom the government last year to stave off effective bankruptcy.Birmingham’s Labour leader, John Cotton, said the council would “start reinvesting in frontline services and deliver improvements for people in the city”.The “extra £130m investment” would be used to address fly tipping, youth services, knife crime and libraries, he added. “This is the first stage in addressing the 15-year legacy of austerity in this city,” Cotton said.“We know there’s still much more to do, we’re pressing on with making the changes that people rightly want to see.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamLocal governmentSocial careLibrariesAusterityCouncil taxCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The non-digestible carbohydrate has two main functions: “There’s insoluble fibre, which is found in things such as whole grains, brown rice or vegetable skins, and I think about it like a broom,” Tew says, “in that it brushes the system out.” Then there’s soluble fibre (oats, beans, lentils), which she likens to a sponge: “It turns into this gel in your gut, and aids digestion and keeps us regular.” But that’s only part of the story, because fibre can also help lower cholesterol and stabilise blood sugar.So, are you getting enough? “The aim is 25-30g fibre a day, but in reality most of us are maybe getting 15-18g,” Tew says, so we’ve got a little way to go. That said, some folk on the #fibremaxxing train have set their sights higher, which is where things can become problematic. “If you’re having too much fibre, you can end up feeling bloated, constipated or have abdominal pain,” she says, and that can occur when you increase your fibre intake too quickly: “The body needs time to get used to what’s happening.”As with most things in life, it’s far better to take things one step (or one meal) at a time. “Think about adding a bit of fibre to breakfast, lunch and dinner,” Tew advises, whether that’s sprinkling chia seeds or linseed over porridge, adding some fruit (“a banana, say, or raspberries, which contain a lot of fibre”), plus that eternally important spoonful of nut butter.The same sprinkling strategy also applies to soup, and you could up the fibre content further by tossing in some lentils (“instead of carrot and coriander, try carrot and lentil”) and serving with wholegrain or rye bread. “Our gold standard carrot and hummus is a good snack, as are apples [keep the skin on, mind] paired with almond butter.” Happily, popcorn also falls into the “good fibre content” snack camp, as do roast chickpeas, which you could (quite literally) spice up with smoked paprika, ground cumin and coriander, plus a pinch of cayenne.Come dinner, Niall Kirkland, author ofThe Good Bite Easy: High Protein, High Fibre, Delicious Meals, is all about a one-pan creamy bean and lentil number: “Saute an onion with garlic, add a dollop of miso, chuck in some butter beans, lentils, stock and blended silken tofu [which also adds a hit of protein], and simmer until thick.” Garnish with soft cheese and chilli oil, then scoop up with toasted sourdough: “You’ll be in heaven.”Tew also homes in on pulses, stirring lentils through chicken curries and pasta sauces, or tossing kidney beans into a chilli – just be sure to serve the latter with basmati or brown rice, because “they’ve got a better fibre content”, she says. “Think: where can I add that sneaky bit of fibre without going over the top? Otherwise, you’ll end up feeling rubbish.” And that’s definitely something to minimise.Got a culinary dilemma?

After yet another day of drama, we kept hearing that the prime minister would be pressing the reset button. Not again! Starmer’s reset button is like the OK button on your TV remote – worn blank through overuse. He has pressed that thing more often than you’ve decided another 44 minutes of a crap thriller is somehow less of an effort than getting yourself to bed. Anyway, next episode in five, four, three …Fine. One more.The inciting incident for yesterday’s deranged chapter was another comms chief leaving, followed by an objectively hilarious call for Starmer’s resignation by the Scottish Labour leader,Anas Sarwar, that accidentally forced Labour’s big guns to swing publicly behind Starmer. That said, you couldn’t claim the cabinet came off as one big happy family, with a ministerbriefing darkly: “We’ve all been made to tweet.” Buck up, Cruz. Think of Sarwar as the Labour family’s Brooklyn Beckham, the latter havingnotably observedlast month that “Family ‘love’ is decided by how much you post on social media”.Anyway, having seen off Sarwar’s desiccated power move, Starmer supposedly crushed it at Monday evening’s gathering of the parliamentary Labour party. Entering the meeting room, the PM is reported to have got a standing ovation that lasted 37 seconds. But don’t set too much store by a standing ovation. At the Cannes film festival, you can get double that even for a documentary claiming that every single Cannes film festival attender is a necrophiliac bestialist. A fired-up Starmer apparentlytold his parliamentary colleagues: “I have won every fight I’ve ever been in.” The prime minister is now seeking a match-up with either Jake Paul or Tommy Fury.He can butch it up all he likes, but the Peter Mandelson revelations have exposed Starmer as an alleged fallen nice guy and dubious ally to women. He’s kind of the Justin Baldoni of Westminster. Who’s the Blake Livelyin all this? I desperately want to quit this analogy but find it impossible when Wes Streeting keeps claiming that he is being covertly briefed against by Starmer’s team. If these dark arts start to impact unit sales of Wes’s affordablehaircare lineit may be time to go nuclear.In fact, maybe that was what was already happening late yesterday afternoon, when Streeting went full drama, claiming Downing Street wasbriefing against him, thenreleasing his own messageswith Mandelson. Do people now leak their own messages? It’s so hard to keep up with the sheer naffness of our politics, particularly given Streeting’s other sighting was during a media appearance wherehe explainedpeople needed to “give Keir the chance [to turn it around]”.Elsewhere, it emerged that Angela Rayner is doing all she can to getHMRC to hurry upand conclude its review of her tax affairs – so maddening when one has to spend more than five seconds in the political wilderness. We also learned that a partly constructed website claiming to launch Rayner’s leadership campaign, created by the same company that does her official parliamentary website,briefly went livein January before being instantly pulled. A Rayner ally described it as a “false flag” operation. So, like Operation Himmler, but a website. Any other news? Oh yes, anothercabinet secretaryis on the way out – the third in eight years for a job that used to be all about stability.When he took office, Starmer stood outside No 10promising“to restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives”. Yet his government has trodden on people like the Serengeti wildebeest migration – a million cock-ups and U-turns stampeding over a squashed Britain for 19 months, with absolutely no sign of let-up. Even the attempts to defend his record sound like satire. Yesterday, allies sent round a rallying note explaining that thegovernment was delivering“on many areas of incremental change”. The trouble is it delivers like Evri. Your incremental change has been left in a safe place. Notyoursafe place, obviously, but somewhere you may never find.Arguably, the most intriguing line of defence yesterday came from two cabinet ministers, Shabana Mahmood and Bridget Phillipson. “Labour governments don’t come along often,” said Mahmood. After a day like yesterday, I can’t imagine why. Phillipson went onto wibble: “Change is hard. Government isn’t easy.” Really? Many will be able to live without the pronouncements of the cabinet sounding like tactical self-care posts from an influencer who promoted a dodgy meme coin and is now on a sober-curious journey. No idea where we’ll get to by the end of the week at this rate. The chancellor explaining that “it’s OK not to feel OK”? Anas Sarwar declaring “I’ve had to teach myself to hold myself in the moment”?Public faith in politics is now in the gutter. Here’s how Labour should drag it out | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThat said, it wasn’t a massively edifying day for the news media, much of which could probably do with stepping away from the news as a wellness exercise. A mad world it may be, yet Chris Mason seemed somewhat overexcited by the idea that his audience wanted to see him as the White Rabbit. Next time you see the BBC’s political editor on screen, imagine every report he presents being prefaced with the words: “Oh my paws and whiskers!” It works better that way.As for the many branches of what could happen next, Theresa May showed us that governing as a wounded meme was possible for at least two years, while some of the suggestions should a sudden replacement for Starmer be required are genuinely insane. Take the people suggesting that enough MPs could probably rally round John Healey as a unity candidate. Sorry, but what? And, indeed, who? At the last measure (Q4 2025), a mere 36% of the public said theyrecognised John Healey. I hate to break it to Labour’s delulu-is-the-solulu power brokers, but after this rolling horror show, assuming the British people would be totally cool with some guy the vast majority of them have literally never heard of being anointed their prime minister may be a piss-take too far.The fact is the UK is on its sixth prime minister in 10 years, and at least teetering near breaking the glass on a seventh. We’ve had more CEOs in a decade than a failing 00s telecoms firm. We’rebasically Yahoo. Or maybe it’s worse. Maybe we’re one of those countries that even the neocons refused to invade because there was no figure that any meaningful number of the local populace would coalesce around. It’s all very last-days-of-the-frying-pan. As for Labour’s next destination?

There is a big risk that we meander and end up in this tepid decline where we all make ourselves feel better but a Reform government becomes inevitable.“Wes has the numbers, but it will require a steeliness and a determination that most colleagues have not to date shown.”The person added: “At this point Keir is a zombie. He is in the Theresa May phase of his leadership.”A Streeting spokesperson said, however, that the MPs’ claims were “categorically not true”.Another Labour backbencher said: “The reality is the public does not like or trustKeir Starmer. Once we have the results of the local elections, it will become unavoidably clear that something bigger needs to change.”The MPs’ comments contrast with the public display of unity shown by cabinet members on Tuesday.Streeting himselftold the BBC: “The prime minister has got my full support. He is leading our country through an enormous set of challenges and people have got to recognise the integrity with which he does that.”Speaking at an event in central London, Burnham alsogave his backingto the prime minister, saying it was time for everyone to be “facing in the same direction and pulling in the same direction around our ambitions”. He added however, that the government should be more ambitious, notably on housing.Starmer chaired a lengthy meeting of cabinet on Tuesday morning at which ministers conducted what one source called a “frank and broad” discussion of what had gone wrong with the prime minister’s leadership.One cabinet insider said afterwards: “We think Keir should remain in place but the culture in No 10 has to change completely and the briefings against colleagues need to stop.”After that meeting, Streeting and Starmer held a one-on-one meeting, which one source said was intended to clear the air between the pair of them.Starmer gave a speech at an event in Hertfordshire on Tuesday at which he insisted: “I will never walk away from the mandate I was given to change this country, I will never walk away from the people that I’m charged with fighting for, and I will never walk away from the country that I love.”Government officials say they are still trying to work out whether there was any coordination between the health secretary and Sarwar, who prompted the crisis on Monday bycalling for the prime minister to resign.One senior minister said: “There were junior ministers and PPSs [parliamentary private secretaries] ready to go. It went off half cocked. There was a plan, it just didn’t work.“I think the story now is Wes’s misjudgment. The release of the [Peter Mandelson] texts has not relieved people of their doubts and it looks obsessive, even desperate.”A Downing Street source added: “Wes just did not move, this all feels very James Purnell.”Purnellresigned as Gordon Brown’s work and pensions secretaryin 2009 in a move that was expected to prompt a leadership bid by his ally David Miliband, which then never came.Others however, have concluded there was no coordination between Streeting and Sarwar, even if they do not trust the health secretary’s reassurances of support in the future.They point to the fact that Streeting had been planning torelease his text messageswith Mandelson on Monday, making it a less than ideal time to also mount a coup.Allies of Streeting also pointed out that while Sarwar was speaking, the health secretary was giving an interview to Sky News in which he offered his support to the prime minister.One said: “Before Anas Sarwar made his statement, Wes told Sky News that Keir needs to be given a chance and shouldn’t resign. I’m afraid the conspiracy theory doesn’t fit the timeline of events.”A minister added: “No 10 seems to have an obsession with Wes. People are saying that he bottled it without any evidence he was going for it.“Wes is a smart political operator who would have known that if you get out and call for the PM to go and don’t have a plan and outriders come in behind you, it would fall flat.”MPs believe that Starmer’s future now depends on the results of both the Gorton and Denton byelection and the subsequent local elections in May.“Keir is there but he can’t stay for long’” said one. “His name keeps coming up on the doorstep – people hate him.“They didn’t fully trust him before the election and they definitely don’t after [his decision to cut] winter fuel payments.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

When they arrived at the scene, officers found a 12-year-old boy who had also been stabbed.Police said a 13-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.DCS Luke Williams, who leads policing in north-west London, said both injured boys were in a serious condition and police were awaiting a further update.He said: “The thoughts of everyone at the Met are with them and their loved ones, and we want to thank the doctors and nurses who are providing the boys with urgent care.”Williams said the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism officers, who were working alongside local police.He said: “After urgent inquiries, our officers arrested him [the boy] and also recovered a weapon, which we believe to have been used in the stabbing.“The suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody for questioning by our officers.”He said police were not currently looking at any other suspects in relation to the incident.“This has not currently been declared a terrorist incident and the investigation team will now be working at pace to gather any evidence and to establish the full circumstances of what has happened as quickly as possible.”A police van was seen blocking the entrance to Kingsbury high school’s lower school after the incident.Pupils, some of whom were in tears, continued to be spoken to by police officers in one of the school’s halls on Tuesday evening, more than three hours after the school day finished.A father of a year 8 pupil who had been kept by police as a potential witness said children had been “traumatised by what happened in front of them”.Alex Thomas, the headteacher of the school, described the incident as “a deeply traumatic event for the whole school community” in a letter sent to parents and carers in which he confirmed two students had been stabbed.He said: “Our thoughts and best wishes are with our students and their families at this incredibly difficult time.“We would also like to thank the emergency services for their swift response and our staff for the calm and dedicated way they supported students throughout the day.“Students in the lower school were kept in the playground at the request of the police while they began their investigations, they were incredibly patient and respectful of others during this time.”He said the lower school would be closed on Wednesday and advised students to stay at home. The upper school will be open for students in years 10-13.“The situation is under control, but a live investigation is taking place. We are working closely with the authorities and I will provide further updates as soon as I am able to share confirmed information. Please keep the students and their families in your thoughts.”The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said her thoughts and prayers were with the two children who were stabbed.She wrote on X: “The police have arrested the suspect, and I would like to thank them for their rapid work in doing so. We must now give them the space to pursue their investigation.”The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said she was “heartbroken” about the stabbings and said her team were in contact with the school and Brent council to offer support.She wrote on X: “My heart goes out to the families affected and the young people, teachers and school community at this awful time.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged anyone with information about the stabbings to contact the police, saying “there is no honour in staying silent”.He said in a statement: “My thoughts are with the family, friends and wider community in Brent following the appalling stabbings today. This awful violence has absolutely no place in our city.“I am in close contact with the Met as they investigate this terrible incident. The investigation is in its early stages and it’s right the police are investigating every possible element.”Bob Blackman, the MP for Harrow East, said he was “deeply shocked and saddened” by the stabbing. In a post on X, Blackman said: “Two boys have been stabbed, and my thoughts are with them, their families and the whole school community.“I want to thank the emergency services for their rapid and professional response. I know this will shock our local community, and I am in close contact with the police and will continue to seek updates as they work to keep everyone safe.”Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent council, described the incident as “deeply shocking and distressing” and thanked emergency services and school staff for their “swift response”.He added: “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured, their families and the whole school community.”A London ambulance service spokesperson said: “We sent resources to the scene including ambulance crews, incident response officers an advanced paramedic, a paramedic from our tactical response unit and a clinical team manager. We also dispatched a trauma team in a car from London’s air ambulance.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The younger Musk and the woman were involved for around six months between 2012 and 2013, with Kimbal Musk describing them as “dating”.In the lead-up to Musk and the woman’s first meeting, Epstein and his longtime associate Boris Nikoliclabored to set them up and bring her to a birthday party Musk was throwing – with Nikolic telling Epstein: “please prepare [the woman] —;)”“Jeffrey and Boris, many thanks for connecting me with [the woman],” Musk lateremailed Epstein and Nikolic in October 2012 after a lunch at Epstein’s Manhattan apartment. “I believe you both played a role. :)”Throughout Musk and the woman’s time together, she forwarded Epstein several of the personal messages Musk sent to her and asked Epstein for guidance on the relationship. There is nothing in the emails to suggest that Musk was aware of her backchannel correspondence with Epstein.Who are the six men named in the unredacted Epstein files?Read moreThrough her lawyer, the woman has said in recent years that she was trapped, coerced and abused by Epstein while in his circle. The woman has not publicly told her story nor spoken about her relationship with Musk, and the Guardian has chosen not to publish her name. Her full name appears in the documents due to a faulty redaction, while other mentions in the emails match her first name and an itinerary of her travels with Musk that Epstein retained. Attempts to reach her and her lawyer did not receive any reply. A request for comment sent to Nikolic via his venture capital firm did not receive a reply. Nikolic, who was named as a backup executor of Epstein’s estate, has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and previouslysaid he did not consentto being named as an executor.Around an hour after the Guardian sent Kimbal Musk a request for comment on Monday for this article, he posted a statement on X about his relationship with Epstein and the woman. A spokesperson from his family office directed the Guardian to his post, but Musk did not respond to a detailed set of questions on his ties to Epstein. Musk has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.“This post is related to the Epstein Files and why my name is in them. In 2012 I started dating a woman who was 30 years old. I met her through a friend. Epstein did not introduce us. My only meeting with that demon was in his New York office during the day. I never met with him again and I never went to his island,” Muskposted.“The reason he has so many emails from me is because he was subscribed to a newsletter I sent out to thousands of people every few weeks. My heart goes out to the many victims of Jeffrey Epstein, as it does for all who have suffered any kind of sexual abuse or harassment,” he wrote.The emails, part of the justice department’s release last month of 3m documents related to Epstein, depict a far friendlier and more intricate relationship between Kimbal Musk and Epstein than previously known to the public, one which goes beyond a periodic newsletter. They coincide with a period when Epstein appeared to be attempting to court both Kimbal and his older brother Elon, now the world’s richest man, through invitations to his island and the use of personal connections.In 2020, Business Insiderreported a storywhich cited two anonymous sources who claimed Epstein set up Kimbal Musk with a woman. The story also reported Epstein had previously dated the woman and that she lived in an apartment owned by Epstein’s brother. The relationship between Musk and the woman appeared to be genuine, Business Insider reported, but the sources claimed Epstein saw it as a means of gaining connection to the Musk family.The emails cover a period of time following Kimbal Musk’s divorce from his first wife, which he references in a 2013 email to Nikolic saying that he is “now divorced! Free to live my life.”Until this week, Kimbal Musk had not spoken publicly about his ties with Epstein. The release ofElon Musk’s own communications with Epsteinhas conflicted with the tech mogul’s previous attempts to distance himself from Epstein as someone he avoided and deemed “obviously a creep”. Kimbal Musk exchanged numerous emails with Epstein and Nikolic in late 2012 and early 2013, inviting the financier to his birthday party and a SpaceX launch. Kimbal even joked about the trio coordinating Halloween costumes.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick says he had lunch with Epstein on his private islandRead moreThe younger Musk, although less successful and well-known than hisTeslaand SpaceX CEO brother, holds several powerful positions. He has repeatedly profited off sales of his 1.4m shares of Tesla, including selling $108m worth of the stock in 2022. Kimbal also served on the board of SpaceX from its founding until 2022 and remains a prominent shareholder. SpaceX this month became the world’s most valuable private company and plans to go public later this year at a valuation of up to $1.5tn. Kimbal is additionally the CEO of a drone entertainment business and co-founder of the Kitchen restaurant group, as well as founder of the food education non-profit Big Green. Until last month, he was a board member of the annual Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute, had long used women and social events to make connections to some of the world’s most powerful people. He died in 2019 afterfacing federal chargesof sex-trafficking minors and has since been the subject of relentless speculation, conspiracies and investigations into his operations.‘Jeffrey and Boris, many thanks for connecting me’It is unclear how Kimbal Musk first encounteredJeffrey Epstein, but in September of 2012, he extended the disgraced financier an invite to his birthday at the Four Seasons hotel in Manhattan. Musk was in town to celebrate turning 40 years old and had been talking with Boris Nikolic, a longtime associate of Epstein and tech investor, about his party plans.“Just talked to Kimbal. His actual bday is on Thursday night (although his party is on Saturday). Kimbal, Elon and few of their closest friends will go out that night,” Nikolic emailed Epstein on 19 Sept, a day before Musk’s birthday. “I told him that you will join us as well. Also I told him that you are coming with [the woman’s name] and that he might want to ditch his ex/or current to be. He said yes and is looking so much forward.”“So please prepare [the woman] —;) She might like Elon as well,” Nikolic added.On the Friday after his birthday, Kimbal Musk emailed Nikolic telling him that he had a fun night and to let Epstein and his friends know that they were invited to his formal birthday party the next night at the Four Seasons. Musk instructed Nikolic to send his executive assistant, Karla Shaw, the names of those whom Epstein and Nikolic would bring to the party.Nikolic almost immediately relayed Musk’s emails to Epstein, who replied asking whether he and Nikolic could set up a lunch with both Musk brothers at Epstein’s home. Later that day, Nikolic followed up with Epstein reminding him to send a list of names for Musk’s party.“Pls reply with whom you are going to that party. Kimbal really like [the woman],” Nikolic said.An email from Musk to Epstein the following week suggests that Epstein did not attend the party, but Musk then initiated plans for the two to spend time together.“Hey Jeffrey. Sorry you missed the party. It was a blast. Sorry to miss lunch on Sunday. Had to fly back and nurse myself back to health. ;) I’ll be in town next Friday (Oct 5th). I’d love to meet up if you’re in town. Imk,” Musk emailed Epstein on 26 September.Over the next two weeks, assistants for Epstein and Musk sorted out the details of the lunch – fretting over Musk being a “foodie” and arranging a potential driver for him to New York’s La Guardia airport afterwards. An email to Epstein from his assistant stated that Musk was confirmed to visit on 7 October at 11.30am.In a series of emails between Musk, Nikolic and Epstein following the lunch, Musk proposed seeing them again when he would return to New York later that month around Halloween – exchanging jokes with Nikolic about the three of them dressing up as the Holy Spirit, Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. Musk also thanked Epstein and Nikolic for setting him up with the woman, resulting in an exchange in which Nikolic told Musk to “be nice” to the woman since she is one of Epstein’s “girls”.“Great to hang out today. Jeffrey and Boris, many thanks for connecting me with [the woman]. I believe you both played a role. :),” Musk wrote on 7 October.“Kimbal – just fyi – you better be nice to [the woman] ;) Jeffrey goes crazy when someone mistreats his girls/friends. So better be very nice to her,” Nikolic responded.“Jeffrey: Message received wide and clear. ;) Seriously, I am very happy with my time so far with [the woman]. She’s great,” Musk replied.Jeffrey Epstein plotted with lawyer to try to have woman deported, documents revealRead moreIn the weeks that followed, Musk and the woman appear to have begun spending more time with one another. He sent her an affectionate email on 22 October saying that the universe had conspired to bring them together and invited her to fly with him to London the next month to attend a birthday party for Talulah Riley, who at the time was married toElon Musk.“Talulah’s birthday party is on Nov 17th in London. I was not going to go, but now getting flack from my family that I’m a lame-oh. And I now have someone I’d like to take. ;) ,” Musk emailed, adding that they could stay with each other through Thanksgiving and keep traveling together. He signed off the email “xoxo”.The woman forwarded the invite to Epstein, adding: “All who thought to introduce us are GENIUS! ; )” Epstein responded with suggestions on what she should do with Musk.“stay thorugh thankisgiving. go somewhere romantic morocoo . . etc,” Epstein emailed, suggesting that she could also come to his private island beforehand. He also sent one of his associates an itinerary of the woman’s scheduled travels with Musk covering the period of October to January that included over a dozen days the woman and Musk would be together.Around the time that Epstein was giving advice to the woman about Kimbal Musk, he was also exchanging messages with Elon Musk. A series of emails from November included Epstein asking the tech mogul how many people he would take on Epstein’s helicopter to visit his private island.“how many people will you be for heli to island,” Epstein asked on 24 November.“Probably just Talulah and me. What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Elon Musk replied a day later. The trip appeared to never take place due to logistical issues.Elon Musk claimed last month thathis communications with Epstein, which included other email exchanges and social invitations, were “misinterpreted” and has called the release of the files a “distraction” despite harping on them throughout 2025.Epstein also extended Kimbal Musk an invite to his island on 24 January, which the younger Musk said “would be nice” but declined because he was “still dealing with the nuclear explosion that is my life”. Musk thanked Epstein for the invitation and told him to “say hi to [the woman]”.‘good news now i have you back again, full time’The relationship between Kimbal Musk and the woman appears to have continued for months into 2013, up until he sent her an email asking to slow things down and revert to a more casual relationship. Musk’s lengthy email began with an apology to the woman for being “in such a bummed out mood last night” and said he wished he had more time for the woman but “at the end of each day I just want to pass out”.“We know how much we like each other. But I am just not able to do a real relationship right now. Would you be up for going back a step to just dating? We would see each other on weekends when we can and focus it on fun stuff,” Musk emailed on 26 April.Ex-Florida police chief claims Trump told him ‘everyone’ knew what Epstein was doing in 2006Read moreThe woman forwarded the email to Epstein, once again asking for advice.“Thoughts? I just don’t think I’d EVER be a priority because he hasn’t shown any ability to get over history or find a way to emotionally cope with the future … Grandfathers funeral, whole family around today and he sends me this … ,” the woman wrote.In response to her email, Epstein demanded to know where the woman was and stated that he thought she was in Los Angeles. The woman responded that she postponed her flight to attend her grandfather’s funeral, suggesting that Epstein told her to stay for it.“ok, good news now i have you back again,full time, come to ranch you;;ll feel better, come tonihgt if Youwant [sic],” Epstein replied in a separate email.The woman also sent Musk’s email to Steve Hanson, another associate of Epstein, who responded with a frenetic email to Epstein and the woman chastising her for how she handled the relationship and giving instructions on what to do next. Hanson has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and did not return a request for comment.“U gave to much too quick . As I said u should have come home after 1 max 2 weeks. Just don’t even answer his e or calls for 10 days. Leave NOW . In 1 week we will have. A plan for u. As u wont be able to listen now anyway - if u walk- which u must do . Just get on a flight tonight. U have to control this. Its a game. Your losing. Your not even playing. Also turn your phone off. So when it rings its auto to voice mail. Jeff ??” Hanson’s email stated.The following day, the woman sent Epstein another email that included what she claimed was a text from Kimbal. The text appeared to be an apology from Musk about the situation and an offer for a driver to pick her up from the Los Angeles airport, but the Guardian found no response from Epstein to the woman in the justice department’s latest files.“Hey. I’m really sorry. I wish things were simpler. There will be a car for you at the airport if you did take the flight. It will take you wherever you want to go. I’m here until Wednesday if you’d like to talk. K,” the email from Musk stated.Although the files show no documentation of an intimate relationship between Musk and the woman beyond this point, he continued to invite Epstein to private events through at least 2014. Epstein also exchanged emails with Elon Musk later in 2013 about plans for a visit to his island, which Epstein ended up canceling after deciding to stay in New York.Contact between Musk and the woman in Epstein’s network did not entirely end. Years later in 2015, the woman received a personal invite from Musk to attend a charity event for his food education non-profit, telling her he would love for her to attend.“Kimbal invited me to this below, what do you think?” the woman asked Epstein.“go,” Epstein replied.The Musks under scrutiny over EpsteinKimbal Musk has described the months following his divorce as a sad, chaotic time in his life in which he dated numerous women and became “an unhealthy version” of himself.“We separated and I would start drinking, just start to act irresponsibly,” Musk said last year on a podcast for the bidet company Tushy. “Meaning fooling around with girls, partying. I always love a good party, don’t get me wrong, but this was unhealthy.”Musk claimed that he created rules for himself during this time such as dating three women at once to avoid forming too strong of an attachment to any one person, and that he learned a practice of “being very honest with girls that I dated that I’m just not ready”.He would later become an avowed advocate for psychedelics-assisted therapy in the past decade as a means of healing emotional trauma and a self-described “burner”, the term for fans of the annual Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.The revelation that Musk had numerous interactions with Epstein caused backlash from some members of the Burning Man community, amid greater scrutiny on both Kimbal and Elon Musk’s ties with the notorious sex offender. Anopen letter to the Burning Man boardlast week calling for the festival to hold a review of Kimbal Musk’s board position received hundreds of signatures.A spokesperson for the festival said his decision to leave Burning Man’s board was made last month before the justice department’s release of Epstein’s emails.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinElon MuskTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

The quality of the material is amazing and he was absolutely at the height of his powers. We just had to get out of the way and let the performance speak for itself.”View image in fullscreenThe show is narrated by David Bowie himself, whose interviews are used to provide commentary on the different parts of his creative life.Photograph: Justin SutcliffeView image in fullscreen‘You feel like you’re joining the crowd back in 1978,’ said David Sabel, Lightroom’s executive producer.Photograph: Justin SutcliffeThe show, You’re Not Alone, which opens in April at the venue in King’s Cross, London, also contains Bowie’sfinal performance as Ziggy Stardustat the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973. “We were able to get the multiple camera feeds, so while there is an edit out there, we could go back to the source,” said Grimmer.Lightroom’s executive producer, David Sabel, adds that the immersive space – which is a vast “three-storey concrete box” with projections on all four walls and the floor, and a spatial sound system – has been used to put visitors “inside” the performance.“You feel like you’re joining the crowd back in 1978,” he said. “You don’t get a linear experience – you get a more three-dimensional one.”View image in fullscreenDavid Bowie: You’re Not Alone is shown in an immersive space with projections on all four walls and the floor, plus a spatial sound system.Photograph: Justin SutcliffeView image in fullscreenThe exhibition draws on the singer’s personal archive as well as publicly available material.Photograph: Justin SutcliffeGrimmer spent hours in the 90,000-itemBowie archive at the V&A East, as well as the singer’s New York archive, pulling out interviews and ephemera that provide the core of the exhibition, which is divided into seven non-chronological “chapters”.Other elements, such as the stage models for theDiamond Dogs tours, are also used to create digital renderings of the designs that will be projected on the walls of the space.“He kept everything,” said Grimmer. “He knew one day someone would come and look through this stuff. They’re not objects for veneration to be kept in a box; we want to bring the handwritten notes and photography to life through animation.”The hour-long show is narrated by Bowie, whose interviews are used to provide commentary on the different parts of his creative life from the construction of his different personas, such asAladdin Sane, to his interest in mime.Grimmer said that after spending time in the archive, there were certain key themes the singer returned to throughout his life, until hisdeath from cancer in 2016.“Spirituality was always very important to him,” he said. “So was transience and the idea of mortality, which was something that was on his mind long before he was ill.”Sabel added: “There’s a strong sense of what you do with a life. He had a voracious appetite to consume art and culture throughout his life.”You’re Not Alone is the fifth show at Lightroom, which launched in 2023 with aDavid Hockney exhibitionthat was also produced by Grimmer. It has also hosted shows dedicated toVogue and catwalks, while Tom Hanks narrated its space exploration project, the Moonwalkers. It is one of asmall group of immersive venuesin London.In January, Heritage of London Trust announced it hadacquired Bowie’s childhood home– a terraced house in Bromley, south London.The home is to undergo a £500,000 restoration to give it back its 1960s appearance and is due to open in late 2027.Explore more on these topicsDavid BowieLondonPop and rockExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was tipped as a future chief of the defence staff prospect, and there was surprise when the Scot suddenly resigned to run as a Labour candidate, winning the safe seat of Birmingham Selly Oak in 2024.He was appointed minister for the armed forces in September 2025 and has earned praise for quiet stewardship of a portfolio also encompassing issues ranging from homeland defence to support for Ukraine. Supporters present him as a man with credentials to take the fight to Reform UK in Labour heartlands.Yet the emergence of Carns as a whispered-of leadership contender – albeit a major outside bet in the shadow of big beasts such as Wes Streeting and Angela Rayner – also reflects not just the febrile atmosphere gripping the party, but the growing impatience and appetite for change among its 2024 intake.Many of the newly elected cohort who were once derided as “Starmtroopers” expected to toe the line are less than impressed with the notion of more senior party figures having a free pass. If Labour skips a generation opting for a fresh face such as Carns, it will be largely because of the 200-plus new MPs elected along with him in July 2024.“We’re not a monolithic group. The Scottish Labour MPs are very much their own group for example and while a lot us worked in politics before some haven’t and those of us who were originally the long shots to win their seats are probably the most unpredictable,” said one of the cohort.“But it’s also true to say that people have found their voices. Rebelling on welfare changes was one thing, but there’s also a correlation between them and the assisted dying debate, when people were allowed to organise without getting into trouble, and got used to speaking their mind.”Many in the 2024 intake also see themselves as a group with relatively broader life experience then those who have come before them. As well as being more ethnically diverse, there is also more gender balance than before.“It’s a broader group than previously and it really runs contrary to the Tory jibe that Labour lacks people with business experience,” added the same 2024 newcomer.“There are people who have worked in finance tech, the NHS and of course a significant number who were in the armed forces, so why shouldn’t someone like Al Carns have a chance?”The counterpoint – expressed by a fellow Labour MP who took office in a previous general election – is that although Carns has a strong backstory for those seeking to shore up Labour’s patriotic credentials, his instincts on bread-and-butter economic issues are more of an unknown.“He’s perfectly nice, but what is his thinking on all the major questions of the day when it comes to the country, whether its the NHS, childcare or climate?” said the MP.“In some ways he reflects the approach under the direction of Morgan McSweeney [Starmer’s recently departed chief of staff] to have candidates who could tick boxes at election time. ‘He’s a soldier!’ But why should this mean he’s the solution to our problems?”The answer to this, responded a 2024 colleague, was that Starmer was now likely to remain as prime minister at least until after the coming elections in May and there could be time for a newcomer to grow in confidence, ability and profile.“Why not Alistair – who has done very well with whatf he has been asked to do so far or someone different like Miatta Fahnbulleh [the Labour MP for Peckham]? If we are looking at two years’ time then there may be people we are not even talking about now.”Explore more on these topicsLabourLabour party leadershipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what the experts sayMadeleine AggelerTue 10 Feb 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 12.36 ESTShareIn 2015, during a particularly energetic performance of the song American Woman in Stockholm, Lenny Kravitzsplit a pair of leather pantsright down the crotch, revealing his manhood to the world.I’m sorry to say I think about this incident somewhat regularly. Not out of titillation, but because it planted in my head a troublesome question: just how many people, rock stars or otherwise, aren’t wearing underwear in public?Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is not a lot of data to answer this question. One2023 YouGov pollfound that 7% of Americans say they always go commando, and another 10% say they “often” forgo underwear.People in the US: what is your top piece of relationship advice?Read moreNor has there been much research on how healthy it is. “There is limited research directly comparing health outcomes between wearing and not wearing underwear,” says Dr Kyle Brenda, a board-certified family physician at Whitman-Walker health, a non-profit community health center in Washington DC. “The primary consideration should really be the comfort of the individual.”But there are times when experts suggest it is better to wear underwear than not. And the cut and fabric of your undergarments matter, too. Below, the pros and cons of going commando.But first, how does underwear affect one’s health?If one is wearing the appropriate underwear, it shouldn’t affect your health much, Brenda says. But what the appropriate underwear is might vary slightly from person to person.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’For men, boxers, boxer-briefs and briefs are all good options for regular wear, says Dr Justin Dubin, urologist and director of men’s sexual health at Baptist Health South Florida, and co-host of the Man Up podcast.One 2018 study did find the type of underwear men wore affected their sperm count; men who wore boxers had a 25% higher concentration of sperm and 17% higher sperm count compared with those who wore tighter undies. This could be because tight underwear keeps testicles closer to the body, potentially increasing the temperature of testicles, “making for a less favorable environment for sperm to develop”, Dubin says.Black sesame is growing more popular in the US. Is it actually good for you?Read moreBut don’t toss out all your briefs just yet. Dubin says these are not significant concerns for average men with healthy sperm production. “Fertility is not likely going to be compromised by what underwear you wear,” he says. “But if you want to do everything you can to have the best swimmers, wear boxers or boxer-briefs.”For women, an undergarment’s fabric can affect health. “It’s ideal to wear cotton underwear since it’s breathable,” says Dr Natasha Bhuyan, family physician in Phoenix, Arizona. Fabrics like polyester, on the other hand, can trap heat and moisture. This “increases the risk of things like yeast infection or tinea cruris (jock itch)”, she explains.Fit also matters, Bhuyan adds. “Underwear that is too tight can cause ingrown hairs or irritation from the friction,” she says.Is ithealthier to not wear underwear then?It’s mostly a personal preference, experts say.For healthy individuals, going commando is generally safe and may even “reduce exposure to potential irritants found in underwear and detergents”, Brenda says.Depending on what clothes you’re wearing, skipping pants can also provide better airflow to your genitals, preventing moisture from getting trapped in the area, Bhuyan says. She says it’s also a good idea to skip underwear immediately after a swim or a bath. “You want to ensure you are dry first,” she says.Does it even need to be said? No, you don’t need to do a ‘parasite cleanse’Read moreAs for when you absolutely should put on underwear, experts advise wearing it when you exercise to reduce friction and to provide support. Dubin further suggests that men wear tighter underwear and a cup during contact sports like soccer, baseball or hockey, in order to reduce the risk of injury.Specific underwear might also be helpful in certain medical situations. If, say, a person has undergone scrotal surgery, like a vasectomy, “we often recommend briefs, jock straps or tight athletic boxer-briefs as they provide more support and comfort after surgery”, Dubin says.Bhuyan adds that if a person is postpartum from a vaginal delivery, “they will usually end up wearing stretchy mesh underwear with pads”.Finally, there are also “certain social situations where wearing underwear might be deemed more appropriate”, Dubin says.Do these include musical performances in Stockholm? Not according to Mr Kravitz.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyUnderwear for menUnderwearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Regular viewers could either take in an elaborate andjoyful halftime performance from Puerto Rican recording artist Bad Bunny, one of the most popular music stars in the world, or, if they weren’t interested in football or inBad Bunny’s music, they could quietly find something else to watch or listen to. There are a lot of options out there. Those who wanted to prove their Maga bona fides or loyalties, however, may have felt obligated to watch a parade of similar-sounding country singers lead into a performance from a shorts-wearingKid Rock, jumping around and seemingly lip-syncing to a novelty hit from 1999.At the Super Bowl, Bad Bunny challenged the meaning of ‘America’Read moreFor rightwingers who couldn’t stomach the Spanish lyrics to Bad Bunny songs, they could take comfort in the clear English of the man also known as Robert Ritchie: “Bawitdaba, da-bang, da-bang, diggy-diggy-diggy.” (These lyrics are actually just what a certain segment of white listeners prefer: something ripped off from Black culture, in this case rapper Busy Bee.) This sad spectacle was provided by Turning Point USA, which is not actually a charity organization for faded turn-of-the-century rap-rockers, but a rightwing advocacy group co-founded by the late Charlie Kirk. WhenKid Rockpivoted back to Ritchie and covered the country tune Til You Can’t (with a pious and half-assed new verse added by Ritchie himself), the music was chased with a tribute to Kirk. This means that viewers were treated to all the artistry of a Kid Rock show plus all the cheerfulness of a funeral.Movie theaters have their own rightwing cause célèbre this winter with the documentaryMelania– a critically reviled less-than-puff piece about the current first lady, Melania Trump, from the director of the worst X-Men movie and the worst Hannibal Lecter movie. Seemingly unable to figure out how to make art of its own out of such a vacuous subject, the Melania documentary resorts to borrowing heavily and nonsensically from others: music cues closely associated with Goodfellas, or actual score from Phantom Thread, which composer Jonny Greenwood and director Paul Thomas Anderson havedemanded be removed. (Greenwood’s contract stipulates that he be consulted in third-party uses.) With Melania filed on the bottom shelf alongside various ham-fisted faith-based movies, Dinesh D’Souza hack jobs, and projects that threaten to include Ben Shapiro cameos, it’s enough to make you wonder: are there any remaining rightwingers who can make seriously great or even good art?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charpaud Christopher/Abaca/ShutterstockAngel Studios has been making some kind of good-faith effort to release movies for a Maga-skewing audience, though that company would argue correctly that some of its movie aren’t conservative or even faith-based at all. But while they’ve distributed the inventive family film Sketch and the new Kevin James romcom Solo Mio, Angel’s biggest successes have been theQAnon-adjacent trafficking thriller Sound of Freedomand a couple of low-rent (though in the case of The King of Kings, quite star-studded) animated Bible stories. There’s clearly an audience for overtly Christian-themed entertainment, as evidenced by the success of evangelical film-maker Dallas Jenkins, the creator of the life-of-Jesus series The Chosen.The women who saw Melania in theaters: ‘If you’re Republican, this is girls’ night’Read moreThese may have some overlap with the audience forMelania, which treats its subject with a near-religious faith in her inherent goodness and grace. But plenty of evangelical movies and shows are more small-c conservative than fully right wing – and for that matter, so is plenty of secular mainstream entertainment in overall sensibility. Moreover, obviously not every great pop-culture artist has been left-leaning. There’s plenty of great stuff attributed to genuine rightwingers, too. Wildly talented representatives of Americana such as director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart were conservative Republicans. Director Sam Raimi, whose new movie Send Help is a current hit, donated to George W Bush in the 2000s, and there are strains of conservatism through some of his work. A film-maker as iconoclastic as David Lynch voted for Ronald Reagan – though overall, his political leanings are harder to pin down in both his real life and his art.That’s really the sticking point in the lack of Maga art. (Well, that and the fascism.) Prominent film-makers such as Clint Eastwood and S Craig Zahler (writer-director of the cop thriller Dragged Across Concrete) have some obvious right-leaning sensibilities, but they don’t always parrot prescribed talking points, favoring complex, sometimes thought-provoking narratives. Eastwood has directed some thoughtful films about prejudice, the failures of US institutions, and moral ambiguities. Zahler’s crime pictures are more genre-y, mixing tight-spot thrills with generally sympathetic rightwing characters (and provoking further when, say, casting Mel Gibson in a leading role).View image in fullscreenA still from Sound of Freedom.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThat’s supposed to be more vexing to “woke” leftwingers; the stereotype about leftists engaging with art is their supposed inability to avoid sanctimonious purity tests. It’s not entirely unfounded, and certainly evident in some of the online discourse around a movie such as Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another, which inspired some beside-the-point arguments about whether it was properly instructional about (or reverential to) genuine revolutionaries. Yet the truly unyielding perspective ultimately has been snatched up by rightwingers. Relatively anodyne matters such as diverse casting or casual inclusivity seems to set off ultra-conservative alarm bells. For this crowd, arguing about whether One Battle After Another is good leftism or mocking centrism is laughable. It has Black women depicted more sympathetically than not. Bzzt, it’s woke!But it’s also hard to picture the Trump faithful really claiming the work of David Mamet; even a more overtly Trump-friendly Mamet probably requires some degree of work rather than reading the broadest possible signifiers (or outright loyalty pledges). Because while conservatism isn’t inherently at odds with art, Trumpism may be. It was forged (or at least enabled) in the depths of reality television, which can be art, but generally prefers not to, recasting narrative as an endless gameshow with non-union writers. Even when he was a Democrat, Trump evinced little patience for movies, and he gives the impression of a man who has never read a book or listened to a record for pleasure. When he pokes back into the entertainment world and demands that a newly Trump-friendly Paramount get going onmaking Rush Hour 4, it’s hard to believe it’s because Trump himself has actually watched a Rush Hour movie straight through. No, it’s because Rush Hour impresario Brett Ratner made Melania (and maybe a subsequent docuseries?), and helped the Trump family receive a payday, his own sympathies probably increased by being a “victim” of the #MeToo movement (meaning he was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women). Naturally, Trump will respond in kind and help Ratner revive his most famous and lucrative film series.Trump, and therefore the Maga movement, demand submission and fealty. A surprising number of people are willing to provide it, even while crowing about their freedoms. But real artists, even conservative ones, tend not to be so easily constrained. Even if conservatism creeps back into Hollywood, Maga art will be subject to a hilariously on-the-nose deal with the devils: if you want fully approved art or entertainment, it’s gotta be Brett Ratner at the helm. Maybe Kid Rock can do the score.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaKid RockDonald TrumpDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some restaurateurs fear speaking out as immigrants themselvesSupported byAbout this contentAdam ReinerTue 10 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 15.26 ESTShareAmid calls for a national shutdown on 30 January, Anton Kinloch displayed a sign on the sidewalk outside Lone Wolf, his craft cocktail bar and restaurant in Kingston,New York. In large block letters he wrote: “WE LOVE ICE IN DRINKS. WE DON’T LOVE ICE IN REAL LIFE. SOLIDARITY ALWAYS.”Along with his wife and business partner, Lisa Dy, he had made the difficult decision to stay open, electing instead to donate a portion of the night’s proceeds to a local immigrant advocacy group. With frigid temperatures and inclement weather stymying business in the region this winter, he simply could not afford the lost revenue. But he refused to stay silent in the aftermath of the brutal killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti byImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents inMinneapolis.‘These are people’s livelihoods’: Minnesota’s economy in crisis amid ICE surgeRead moreWithin hours, Kinloch discovered that the sign had been vandalized and thrown into the middle of the street. Its wooden frame was splintered and the chalkboard surface shattered; it appeared to have been run over by a car several times. Earlier in the day, he’d received at least a half-dozen derogatory messages after posting support for immigrants on social media. “I spoke to other business owners in the area, and they said that they had received similar threats,” he said. “They also saw a decline in their social media followers after speaking out. People were unfollowing them, blocking them and sending them hate messages.”Since Donald Trump returned to office last year, restaurants and bars across the country have found themselves on the frontlines of aggressive immigration enforcement and intimidation by masked federal agents. According to the American Immigration Council,immigrants comprise 22% of the restaurant industry’s workforce, a figure that exceeds 30% in states with large foreign-born populations such as California, New York and Texas. Withthreats against immigrants rising, many restaurant owners have been vocal in their opposition to ICE in their communities. But the most outspoken businesses said they’ve also become a target for vitriol by ICE supporters: online harassment, boycott threats and even physical confrontations. Some restaurateurs claim they have been besmirched by phony negative reviews on sites like Google and Yelp.View image in fullscreenJamie Kenyon, the executive chef of Bottino and ’ino in New York City, has faced backlash for his pro-immigrant views.Photograph: Ellen McDermottJamie Kenyon, executive chef and partner of Bottino in New York City, said that within minutes of posting a pro-immigrant message on his restaurant’s social media page the day of thenational shutdown, his restaurant received an obscenity-laced phone call from a stranger condemning the post. Kenyon was taken aback by the threatening response to what he considered a benign show of solidarity. “We are all immigrants,” it said,explaining the restaurant group’s decision to stay openand its plans to donate 15% of sales to the National Immigration Justice Center. “One less place to visit,” one commenter responded. “Maybe when some illegal sets you on fire you’ll grasp why.”Later that day, the restaurant received two blistering one-star Google reviews in quick succession. “Their horrendous values and morals do not represent us,” the reviewer wrote. “They are extremely hateful and immoral. Would not go here under any circumstances.” Kenyon suspects that the angry caller may have been responsible for the slanderous reviews and, while he and his partners are working to have them expunged, the reputational harm is irreversible. A2015 report by Moz, a software company specializing in search engine optimization, revealed that over 67% of respondents were influenced by online reviews and that businesses risk losing 22% of customers when one negative review turns up in their search results. “When you get good reviews, they’re so precious, and bad reviews are devastating,” Kenyon said. “But when they’re fake and total nonsense, it’s just infuriating and really damaging to businesses.”At Pizza Matta in Chicago’s Logan Square, a dispute over the immigration issue led co-owner Jason Vincent to refuse service to an ICE supporter who had been leaving the restaurant harassing, politically charged messages on Instagram for months. The conflict escalated when the customer came into dine the same day thatfive-year old Liam Ramos was abductedby federal agents in Minnesota. After a contentious exchange, Vincent demanded he vacate the premises. “I refuse to cook for fascists and their enablers,” he said. While it isn’t official policy in his restaurants, Vincent said he reserves the right to refuse service to anyone who comes in wearing a Maga hat or a pro-ICE T-shirt. “I was raised Jewish, and I was taught from a young age ‘never again’,” he said. “What is happening here is ‘never again’.”View image in fullscreenCheetie Kumar, the chef and co-owner of Ajja in Raleigh, North Carolina, has faced online backlash for speaking out against ICE.Photograph: Baxter MillerRising hostility toward immigrants has some business owners increasingly on edge about the risks of being too vocal. “It’s really important for small businesses to speak up and make our point of view clear,” said Cheetie Kumar, co-owner of Ajja in Raleigh, North Carolina, and a board member and vice-president of the Independent Restaurant Coalition. “But at the same time, I’m an immigrant, there are people in my restaurant who work for me who are immigrants, and I definitely don’t want to put a target on anyone’s back.”The plight of immigrant workers resonates with many foreign-born restaurateurs, especially ones who’ve experienced uncertainty around their own immigration status in the past. “I’m so thankful that I just received my citizenship a year ago because it’s scary,” said Kenyon, who relocated to the US from Manchester, England, when he was 14 years old. “Without that, I’d be up at night. I have a family to feed, too.” He believes that sensible immigration enforcement should focus on removing criminals who pose a threat to the community, not targeting innocent people based on the color of their skin. “The biggest ‘crime’ that immigrants are committing in restaurants every day is working,” he said. “They’re giving back to the community. That’s the best crime in the world.”Most industry leaders agree that deporting the millions of immigrant workers whose labor is the industry’s lifeblood would be catastrophic. “People of color and immigrants have been holding up the entire food system in this country since its existence and historically without any equality,” said Sean Sherman,chef-owner of Owamni, an indigenous restaurant a few miles from where Alex Pretti and Renee Good were killed. “You can’t just pull all of this massive workforce out and expect these systems to continue to work.”Restaurants across the country are already battling rising inflation and skyrocketing costs. They can ill afford reckless immigration enforcement that threatens their workforce and destabilizes their communities. In Minneapolis, where federal agents have been aggressively targeting the hospitality industry, sales at local restaurants are down as much as 50-60%, according to Sherman. “At this rate and this pace, every restaurant in Minneapolis would probably be shut down in two months.” (Tom Homan, the border czar, announced last week the administration’s plans todraw down 700 officersin Minnesota.)Vincent has seen a similar effect in Chicago, where ICE had been conducting regular enforcement operations late last year. In October, whenagents deployed teargasacross the street from a school on the same block as his restaurant Giant, he said it was the slowest night the establishment has ever had in its 10-year history.Sherman recently traveled to Washington DC todeliver a petitionwith more than 3,000 signatures to Minnesota’s junior senator, Tina Smith, urging Congress to rein in ICE. Days before his visit, an Owamni employee wasapprehended outside of the restaurantby immigration agents and disappeared to a detention center in Texas, despite being properly documented (the employee has since been released).“Our priority is not fighting trolls online,” said Sherman. “We’re trying to figure out how we can make some noise to alert people that this is not the America we want to be living in.”Explore more on these topicsUS small businessOur unequal earthUS immigrationRestaurantsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)FoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is the question that presses unexpectedly hard as the new reality competition show The Summit begins. The premise is hateful in the standard way: 14 strangers (which might as well be 17,000 in televisual terms – onlyThe Traitorsdoes more and it generally dispenses with half of them before they have even set foot inside the castle) are gathered together to tackle a task for which they are vastly and vividly unfitted – in this case, they are going to climb a mountain. In the New Zealand Alps, if you care. If you do, you won’t for long.None of them, naturally, have ever climbed a mountain before. It’s possible that some have never seen a mountain before. It’s possible that some have never walked anywhere before. Thomas has – he’s a tour guide – but he doesn’t like heights. Tyra has done the Duke of Edinburgh bronze and silver and thinks it can’t be much different from that. Pageant and fitness coach Afton, whose ultra-posh accent sounds uncannily like Celeste Dring’s Eugenie inThe Windsors, has been glamping “but thaaaah was a chaaaaarf”. (There was a chef, in case you were wondering.) She wears a pink Lycra outfit and starts screaming when she sees mud.There is a welcome sense of the world righting itself when it is revealed that Afton is “Doctor”Gillian McKeith’s daughter. For those of you who don’t remember, McKeith (who agreed with the Advertising Standards Authority in 2007 to stop using the title, partly because looking at people’s tongues and peering at poos they’d done in lunchboxes for Channel 4 did not make her one, but largely because she did not have a recognised qualification) was a prominent early shill for pseudoscientific practices (including the advice to eat lots of leafy vegetables so that the chlorophyll could oxygenate your blood) and an entirely useless contestant on 2010’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Then there’s Dockers, a self-professed “alpha male”, proving once again that if you have to profess it yourself … . Sean is the group’s self-professed “most valuable player”. Warren is stunt casting – in the 90s, he was famous as Ace in Gladiators but later discovered God and is now an Anglican minister.There are others, and other back stories, but who has the strength?View image in fullscreen‘They seem to hate each other as much as I hate them’ … the rope bridge challenge on The Summit.Photograph: ITVBen Shephard is – just barely – the presenter. He turns up for a minute or two at the beginning to explain in fairly desultory fashion that they will each be carrying a share of the £200,000 prize pot in their backpacks (Why? The money is in notes, not weighty coins, so it’s not to add to the physical challenge. Is it in case they cannot deal in abstract concepts?) and that they must cooperate in order to reach the summit because whoever doesn’t will have their share subtracted from the total available. They already seem to hate each other as much as I hate them, so this could be fun.Publican Miranda volunteers to direct the group. She is good with maps. She’s not so good, it turns out, at being able to stay near the front of the group and lead them in the direction she would like them to go. Eventually, and with an impressively bad grace, she relinquishes the map, clearly in the hope that they will now all fail to make base camp within the allotted time. Go, team!When they reach a rope slung across an abyss as their first challenge, Dockers volunteers to show them how it’s done. My notes read “omega male” and it’s a pity the Greek alphabet only ran to 24 letters.The motley crew (just) make base camp, Ben puts in another two-minute appearance to tell them some bad news and then they are left to kip in tents on bare ground for the night. Good, though I would chuck a groundsheet or something to Thomas, who is by now emerging – in an uncrowded field – as a reasonable human being.The next day, Dockers throws a tantrum at finding one of his gloves over-toasted by the fire, accusing all and sundry of sabotage and taking against Thomas’s lack of support in particular.I shall not spoil the ending, except to say that I forgot to tell you that there is a stupid, hateful black helicopter known as the Mountain Keeper that flies around “intimidating” the contestants and halfway through the episode’s final challenge drops instructions that made me boot the screen in. See you back here next week, I guess. I hate myself most of all.The Summit aired onITV1and is available on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVITV1reviewsShareReuse this content"

Oskar Kokoschka designed a Magic Flute for Salzburg and a Ballo in maschera for Florence. Salvador Dalí produced a controversial Salome for London; David Hockney’s designs for Glyndebourne’s Rake’s Progress complement Stravinsky’s sound-world so miraculously that they are still in use 50 years after their creation. Marc Chagall’s ceiling fresco for Paris’s Opéra Garnier and murals for the New York Met testify to the intimate connection between opera and painting.And yet remarkably few operas portray visual artists. Something about their painstaking work seems to resist representation in this most extravagant of artforms. Only two operas about artists are regularly performed: Hindemith’s Mathis der Maler, depicting the German Renaissance painter Matthias Grünewald, and Berlioz’s Benvenuto Cellini– and Cellini gave Berlioz a head-start with his rollicking memoirs about his scandalous adventures in 16th-century Florence.He constantly reinvented himself, using at least 30 different namesBy taking a piece of art as subject matter, then, Scottish Opera’s The Great Wave enters largely uncharted territory. The print that gives the new production its name is one of the most familiar images of the past 200 years, even if relatively few of those who encounter it on fridge magnets or phone cases realise exactly where it comes from or know much about the life of the artist who created it.Katsushika Hokusai was born in 1760 in Edo, now known as Tokyo, then the world’s largest city with over a million inhabitants. He lived to 88 at a time when only a handful of Japanese each year passed 60. His life was eventful: he survived being struck by lightning, a stroke that forced him to relearn how to draw, and a fire that destroyed his studio. His output was prolific and diverse – his 30,000 or so surviving works include paintings, sketches and the illustrations that fill Hokusai Manga, a drawing manual for students, as well as woodblock prints – and he constantly reinvented himself, using at least 30 names. He was a gifted self-publicist, attracting huge crowds by painting a gigantic portrait in a public square, but often in financial difficulty.View image in fullscreenThe boats seem to move …  Under the Wave off Kanagawa, as the work was originally titled.Photograph: Universal Art Archive/AlamyUnder the Wave off Kanagawa – his most celebrated work’s original title – was one of his Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, a series of woodblock prints produced around 1831, which was so successful that Hokusai later added another 10. It is an unforgettable image: although our attention naturally focuses on the cascading foam and menacing undertow of the wave, so vividly depicted that the boats that ride it seem to move as we look, the image’s still centre is Mount Fuji itself, regarded in Hokusai’s time as a deity.Just as Hokusai’s sequence of prints viewed the mountain from various viewpoints, many unexpected, the opera’s five acts approach the artist himself from different angles, arranged in a sequence that’s anything but chronological – the opera begins with Hokusai’s funeral. As librettist Harry Ross explains, the decision to tell Hokusai’s story in a non-linear way was taken in solidarity with the worldview of Hokusai and the culture of which he was part: “We’re teleological in the west – this is very much an eastern thing.”The thread that runs through the libretto, drawing together scenes otherwise highly diverse in setting, character and dramaturgy, is Hokusai’s relationship with his daughter, Ōi, also a significant artist. It is Ōi that we see at the start, supervising her father’s burial, and Ōi with whom he is conversing at the end, as the pair resolve to continue artistic exploration together.Ōi had married another artist, but divorced him, as Ross recounts with evident admiration: “He wasn’t a very good artist, and she wasn’t going to run a business with someone who wasn’t going to succeed.” Instead she returned to her father’s studio. Ross and composer Dai Fujikura are fascinated by these decisions, very unusual for the time, and by the two artists’ bond. “Ōi is an extraordinary character – we don’t know much about her but we know enough,” Ross says. “The relationship between father and daughter was very special,” Fujikura notes. “We both have daughters, so it was very easy to tap into that.”View image in fullscreenFather-daughter dynamic … Daisuke Ohyama as Hokusai and Julieth Lozano Rolong as Ōi.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicFujikura grew up in Japan, but until he visited the British Museum’s Hokusai exhibition in 2017, all he knew about the artist was that he had produced The Great Wave. It was Fujikura’s wife, after they read more about him in the exhibition catalogue, who suggested the artist as a subject for an opera and he was intrigued – “I’d never written an opera set in Japan.”“It is a wild ride, a fascinating life,” Fujikura says with relish. He began to share ideas with Ross, a close collaborator since the 1990s when they met as students at Trinity College of Music. Together they devised a scenario drawing on an unpublished English translation of the first Hokusai biography, written by Iijima Kyoshin in 1893.Much of their work on the scenario was done during the Covid lockdown, a situation uncannily mirroring the closed nature of Japanese society in Hokusai’s lifetime. During theEdo period, the Tokugawa military government who ruled Japan imposed a policy ofsakoku, literally “locked country”. Between the early 17th century and the mid-19th, international trade was all-but forbidden, and Japan was closed to almost all foreign visitors.Indeed, the only non-Japanese character in The Great Wave is the German botanist and traveller Dr Philipp Franz von Siebold, played by a countertenor – the “falsetto” voice aptly reflecting how strange Siebold’s western face would have seemed to most Japanese of the time. Siebold brings a large sack of Prussian Blue pigment (a rare commodity in Japan at the time) in payment for some of Hokusai’s prints: an acquisition that delights Hokusai, since it enables him to realise the vibrant colours he has imagined for his Mount Fuji series.View image in fullscreen‘He’s quite contemporary’ … composer Dai Fujikura and librettist Harry Ross.Photograph: Julie HowdenFujikura relished the opportunity the scene offered to represent Hokusai’s new colour in music: “People are seeing an object they’ve never seen before, something very special – it’s like the moment in Pulp Fiction where they open the attache case and we don’t know what it is.” He found a combination of timbres to represent Hokusai’s blue: “Natural harmonic trills blended with artificial harmonics and a shimmering vibraphone played with soft mallets.”Fujikura’s early musical training as pianist and composer in Osaka, not untypically, was entirely in western styles; traditional Japanese instruments formed no part of his musical upbringing: “Even my parents never heard them live.” It was only in the early 2000s, at a festival in Darmstadt, that he first encountered these instruments, and had to learn about them as a western composer would: “They have such a long history, they make Bach look like a baby.” He has now composed about 40 works for Japanese instruments, including concertos forshō(a bamboo mouth organ),koto(a long, plucked zither),shamisen(a three-stringed lute) andshakuhachi.It was the last of these – a traditional Japanese flute which makes a softer and breathier sound than the western version – that Fujikura has included in The Great Wave. “I wanted to transport listeners into another realm.” Fujikura explains that the noise of the player’s breath is part of the performance, and that he has encouraged the player – Shozan Hasegawa, who has travelled from Japan to perform – to improvise in traditional style around the notated pitches.Theshakuhachiis heard in the opera’s opening bars, and reappears at the end, where the director Satoshi Miyagi features the instrument on stage: he interprets its sound as the voice of Hokusai, resonating in his daughter’s mind. What comes between uses only traditional western instruments, but deployed with a colourfulness and immediacy that reflects Fujikura’s initial ambitions to compose for film. “I can express everything with my music: the orchestra is my palette.”The production has been a remarkable example of cross-cultural collaboration: there was financial support from Japanese government agencies (plans are well under way for the production to transfer in 2027 to Tokyo and Kyoto) and in Glasgow, Miyagi is joined by a team of Japanese designers and choreographers from the Kajimoto company. Although the set and costumes do not attempt to recreate Hokusai’s Japan – “by not specifying the cultural background or the time period, it allows the piece to be universal,” Miyagi explains – the Japanese influence is clear. How to feature The Great Wave itself was a particular challenge for scenographer Junpei Kiz: “It is such an iconic piece. There is going to be anticipation of how it will be presented.” His intriguing solution was to introduce it in monochrome before revealing the full colour spectrum.It is clear, however, that for Ross and Fujikura, as for Miyagi, Hokusai’s story is one whose message is universal. Ross finds cause for optimism for today’s artists in the resourcefulness and capacity for reinvention that Hokusai showed throughout his career. “He’s quite contemporary – we have this notion of the Romantic artist who’s always struggling, but in the 21st century we’re more like Hokusai – we must change to stay the same.” Fujikura agrees: “He shows such strong energy, just to be an artist, a better artist. Nonstop creativity – that’s something I absolutely love about this person.”The Great Wave is atTheatre Royal Glasgow, on 12 and 14 February and Festival Theatre, Edinburgh 19 and 21 February.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaScottish OperafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as a practising doctor, I am concerned that it may be doing more harm than goodByGavin FrancisTue 10 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 05.13 ESTShareSomeoneis shot, and almost dies; the fragility of life is intimately revealed to him. He goes on to have flashbacks of the event, finds that he can no longer relax or enjoy himself. He is agitated and restless. His relationships suffer, then wither; he is progressively disturbed by intrusive memories of the event.This could be read as a description of many patients I’ve seen in clinic and in the emergency room over the years in my work as a doctor: it’s recognisably someone suffering what has in recent decades been called PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder. But it isn’t one of my patients. It’s a description of a character in the 7,000-year-old Indian epic The Ramayana; Indian psychiatrist Hitesh Shethuses it as an exampleof the timelessness of certain states of mind. Other ancient epics describe textbook cases of what we now call “generalised anxiety disorder”, which is characterised by excessive fear and rumination, loss of focus, and inability to sleep. Yet others describe what sounds like suicidal depression, or devastating substance addiction.Research tells us that the human brain hasn’t changed much in the past 300,000 years, and mental suffering has surely been with us for as long as we have experienced mental life. We are all vessels for thoughts, feelings and desires that wash through our minds, influencing our mental state. Some patterns of feeling are recognisable across the millennia, but the labels we use to make sense of the mind and of mental health are always changing – which means there’s always scope to change them for the better.The subject is important, because according to modern psychiatric definitions, the 21st century is seeing an epidemic of mental illness. The line between health and ill-health of the mind has never been more blurred. A survey in 2019 found that two-thirds of young people in the UKfelt they have had a mental disorder. We are broadening the criteria for what counts as illness at the same time as lowering the thresholds for diagnosis. This is not a bad thing if it helps us feel better, but evidence is gathering that as a society it may be making us feel worse.We have developed a tendency to categorise mild to moderate mental and emotional distress as a necessarily clinical problem rather than an integral part of being human – a tendency that is new in our own culture, and not widely shared with others.Psychiatrists who work across different culturespoint out that, in many non-western societies, low mood, anxiety and delusional states are seen more as spiritual, relational or religious problems – not psychiatric ones. By making sense of states of mind through terms that are embedded in community and tradition, they may even have more success at incorporating our crises of mind into the stories of our lives.In the US, it’s common to classify mental distress according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is now in its fifth edition. In the UK and Europe, it’s more common to use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), now on its 11th revision. Both have seen huge expansions in recent decades, classifying more and more distressing feelings and emotions as pathological. Other classification systems have also seen expansion, though they vary in the emphases they place on different elements of mental life and of what constitutes “normal”.Maps of the mind such as the DSM and ICD are culturally specific models of how to think about thinking. They are instruments, useful to the extent that they help us meet the many challenges of being alive. If they don’t do that, we have to question them. As the statistics for mental ill-health continue to worsen, it’s clear that our current approach to mental health labelling and diagnosis is not working.For more than 20 years now, my work has been as a general practitioner (the UK equivalent of a primary care physician). Of the hundreds of millions of GP appointments that take place every year in the UK, 30-40% touch on mental health. All of us are more than our fleeting feelings, but our mental states are where we live. They filter every experience and sensation. The mind creates the world we inhabit, and profoundly influences bodily health: psychiatry, then, is a fundamental part of every consultation I have. Thirty years in medicine have shown me just how hard life can be for many people. It has also taught me not to make much distinction between suffering of the body and mind.When I worked in emergency medicine, I frequently had the sense of being witness to a defining moment of someone’s life: a car crash, a heart attack, a brain haemorrhage. There is never much latitude in how to approach such crises – there are rigid, lifesaving guidelines to be adhered to. But when I became a GP, I learned there was great freedom in how I conducted each consultation, and that it was necessary to vary my approach with each patient; how I engaged was intricately interconnected with outcome, and was part of the therapy. The Hungarian psychoanalyst Michael Balint called it “the doctor as the drug”. I was to judge when to be candid and when to be circumspect, and to recognise what kind of doctor each patient needed. Appointment times were short, but with access to my own appointment book I could bring patients back for consultations frequently and get to know them over time.View image in fullscreenScene from the Ramayana … some of its characters show symptoms of what might today be diagnosed as PTSD.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesDr M was my first mentor. His consultations were impressive, filled with kindness, gentleness and a kind of tranquillity. He was unafraid to let silence fill the space of the consulting room. His great kindness meant that his clinics attracted more than an average share of people who were emotionally and psychologically distraught. No matter the dark territory that was being explored – abuse, neglect, addiction – Dr M always found a way to bring the consultation round to something redemptive, and each patient left happier than they’d come in.He asked me, after every patient I saw, to offer a summary of the presenting complaint, and to think about the unsaid motives each might have had in coming to the appointment. He also asked me how Ifeltafter each one, and spoke to me about the reality of transference – how your patient can’t help but transfer their emotions into you, and that you can discern a lot about someone by examining how they make youfeel. It struck me that the ideal state of mind for a clinical consultation was almost meditative, remaining engaged and emotionally aware without getting entangled by a paralysing excess of compassion. It felt like the first time in my medical career that someone had earnestly tried to show me how to be a good doctor rather than how to master a set of skills – to be a healer rather than a technician. Dr M called it being “an effective GP” in contrast to “another pill-pusher”.My subsequent supervisor, Dr Q, was very different: I watched a list of referrals made and prescriptions issued, entirely without kindness. I noticed that most people went out of her room unhappier than they went in. Technically the “job” was being done, but something about the manner of it was all wrong – focused on technical aspects, it had become drained of humanity, and her encounters lacked any sense of healing. A marker of the low esteem in which she held her own skills was that she seemed at a loss as to what to teach me, or what to help me get out of the session watching her clinic. In the end, she just told me which drugs I must avoid prescribing in order to keep within the practice drug budget.I worry that our models of mental healthcare are increasingly built for a world dominated by clinicians such as Dr Q, who approach mental-health consultations as an opportunity for tick-box protocols lifted from the DSM or the ICD, and the scoring of blunt and context-free online questionnaires. As pressure on the NHS grows, there’s precious little space left for the humanity, curiosity and humility of clinicians such as Dr M.In the course of my work I meet people whose lives are blighted by feelings of anxiety and fear, who are depressed or manic, who have been traumatised or abused, who are psychotic or addicted. It’s work that obliges me each day to ask questions about the nature of consciousness, of mood, and of the elements that go into making a meaningful life.I’ve met people in their 80s who, through our conversations in the consulting room, have realised that the root of their unhappiness is a sense of having been neglected as an infant, almost a century earlier. I’ve met others who have come to realise their overeating, or obsessive cleaning, or alcoholism, are attempts to fill an emptiness which could be more reliably filled in other, healthier ways.Conscious experience is a flowing, dynamic river of influences, sometimes dominated by memory, sometimes by anticipation, sometimes by immediate perceptions – which means that it can be nudged, in its changes, towards health. As I went on in my GP training, I realised that some people stay in roughly predictable mental fields their whole lives, while others cycle between radically exotic states of mind. The word “doctor” means “guide” or “teacher”. Sometimes I guide my patients through those landscapes well known to me; at other times, it’s my patients who guide me.And those mental landscapes can be perilous: our states of mind can make prisoners of us, make us want to die, or make us believe we’re invulnerable. They can torment us with visions and voices, and distort the way we see our own bodies and those of others. They can make it impossible for us to sleep, sink us in addictions, make us incapable of focus, self-control or contentment. They can destroy our families, make it impossible for us to communicate, to love, to be part of the very communities that would help sustain us. Just about any aspect of mental life can go wrong, and how we make sense of those disturbances can have huge implications for how we find our way back to a sense of ease.Alongside the expansion of the DSM and ICD, it has become routine to talk about mental suffering as caused by discrete mental disorders. I’m encountering more people these days with the conviction that the labels we give mental suffering have a fixed reality, that they are based on hard neurological evidence, and that they therefore confer some kind of fate. But even among those same patients, I’m encountering increasing disquiet with mental-health labelling, and a rising awareness that such labels can become self-fulfilling. Many are surprised to learn that the terms we use, and that our culture is enthusiastically exporting around the world, were not gleaned from lab science but were decided in committee rooms by a group of western medics.Many people now use the words “mental health” as interchangeable with “mental illness” – as in, “I’m here for my mental health, doctor.” The ubiquity of this kind of language has had some real benefits: it has destigmatised emotional and mental distress, encouraged sufferers to seek help, fostered communities of people with similar problems. But medical words are powerful, and medical labels can become self-fulfilling spells that curse as often as they cure. Today’s worrying statistics on deteriorating mental health may represent long-overdue recognition of widespread mental illness, or they may represent a pathologising trend to categorise normal human experiences as clinical disorders.As a GP, I don’t have the option of picking a side in this increasingly polarised debate – it’s my job to help the patients who come to me, with whatever perspective they come with. But the first ethical principle of medicine is “do no harm”, and I’m concerned that some of the labelling my profession is enthusiastically embracing may ultimately do more harm than good.Although the suffering caused by mental difficulties is as grave as any kind of physical suffering, and can sometimes be life-threatening, history confirms that the frameworks we use to understand it change with the times. The word “emotion” developed its current meaning in the 1830s; before that, it was more common to speak of “sentiments”, “spirits” or even “humours”. I can imagine a day will come when the bare lists of psychiatric classification seen in today’s DSM and ICD will seem as overconfident as the old phrenology charts, which claimed that human faculties could be gauged by the shape of the skull.Around the world, different cultures view the derangements of the mind in utterly different ways, sometimes with better consequences. Shekhar Saxena, a former director of mental health for the World Health Organization,said he would rather get a diagnosisof schizophrenia in Ethiopia or Sri Lanka than in the west, because there’s a greater chance in those countries of making a life that continues to have meaning, of being able to make sense of your experience, of remaining connected to community.Human culture is bathed in language. It relies on concepts to make sense of the world, and different languages and cultures take different approaches to thinking, feeling and being. The psychoanalyst and writer Clarissa Pinkola Estés summarised just a few alternative ways her clients had described their mental states to her over the years, as distinct from the lists seen in the ICD: “dry, fatigued, frail, depressed, confused, gagged, muzzled, unaroused. Feeling frightened, halt or weak, without inspiration, without animation, without soulfulness, without meaning, shame-bearing, chronically fuming, volatile, stuck, uncreative, compressed, crazed. Feeling powerless, chronically doubtful, shaky, blocked, unable to follow through, giving one’s creative life over to others, life-sapping choices in mates, work or friendships, suffering to live outside one’s own cycles, overprotective of self, inert, uncertain, faltering, inability to pace oneself or set limits.”It’s a rich inventory, immediately recognisable and very different to the lists found in any textbook – as well as far more helpful for me as a clinician. Pinkola Estés recognised that trying to force her clients’ experiences into a rigid, monotone table of diagnoses would dishonour the richness of their experiences – and wouldn’t help them to get better.In clinical practice I no longer use those categories. Instead, I try to acknowledge that there must be numberless states of mind – perhaps as many as there are people who experience them, multiplied by the moments of their lives. I speak in terms of distress and pain and suffering, rather than in terms of labels. Every state of mind influences every other one: some kinds of anxiety breed delusions; some manifestations of neurodiversity bring on anxiety; emotional trauma can exacerbate addiction; addictions can fuel a depression, and so on. We don’t experience our mental life in chunks, but in streams of experience. Your mind is a part of nature, and nature’s rule is that everything flows.At medical school, my tutors spoke of the work of Charles Sherrington in tones of hushed awe – he was the first to use the word “synapse” to describe the connections between cells in the brain, and the first to appreciate the ways that networks of brain cells work together in concert, communicating in circuits or loops. One famous passage of his describes the change he imagined coming over the cerebral cortex of the brain as it wakes from sleep:The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of travelling sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning … Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one.Sherrington was writing about the brain as an “enchanted loom”, weaving conscious experience, at a time when factory looms were among the most complex machines in existence. Yet from the standpoint of today, his neurophysiology was primitive and didn’t offer much in the way of clues to relieving mental illness.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Anais Mim/Guardian DesignThe discovery through the 1950s and 1960s that certain drugs could influence mental states gave birth to the idea that tinkering with chemicals in the synapses between brain cells could cure mental distress. This is wrong-headed, bad science, and has been proven to be incorrect. A2023 study published by Naturereviewed all the evidence, and concluded that “the huge research effort based on the serotonin hypothesis has not produced convincing evidence of a biochemical basis to depression … We suggest it is time to acknowledge that the serotonin theory of depression is not empirically substantiated.” This is a hugely significant finding, but it hasn’t yet been fully absorbed into the culture at large. As a society and a medical culture, we have yet to emerge from the blind alley that the serotonin theory of mood took us down.Through the 1990s, as the code of human DNA was cracked, a great hope was ignited that genetic markers for mental disorders would soon be found. Instead we’ve found hundreds of genes that may be partially implicated, each interacting with the other in baffling ways; even identical twins don’t express the same genes at the same time. In less than a century, we have moved from a model of brain function as an enchanted loom, to one of synaptic chemistry, to one of DNA determinism, to the modern view of the brain as a “connectome” of circuits and loops of varying bandwidth like a computer – which (I predict) will eventually be disproved in its turn.It’s probable that a century from now our current approach will seem at best quaint, at worst barbaric. Despite billions of dollars of research spending by both governments and pharmaceutical companies, we still have little idea how shifts in mood are governed at the neural level – neither the changeable spirits of mind that come and go from day to day, nor those background moods that move slowly, often imperceptibly, over months and even years. It’s fascinating that each theory over the past century or so has mapped on to aspects of the high technology of its time.Doctors speak of “constellations” of symptoms, as if the body were a galaxy, and the process of diagnosis simply the imposition of stories upon the patterns of nature. At medical school, I was taught to understand mental experiences using constellations of symptoms that point to a particular mental-health diagnosis with its own label – depression, generalised anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, attention-deficit, schizophrenia.But as a GP, what I see in clinic is never a set of labels, but unique blends of strengths and vulnerabilities, with vast areas of overlap between different conditions. I have come to see how suffering of the mind exists in thousands of gradations, from minor unhappiness to suicidal depression, say, or from mildly suspicious to psychotically paranoid. And in mental illness, symptoms don’t point to causes: one person may have withdrawn to their bed, unable to leave the house, because of a paralysing crash in their mood, while another might have withdrawn because of terror over what lay beyond their front door. One person could have developed anorexia because of obsession over food or thinness, while another developed it because a traumatic, abusive childhood left a legacy of need to control what goes in and out of the body.The best psychiatry focuses on strengths rather than weaknesses. I have come to appreciate more fully how just a little of some traits such as obsessiveness or elation or rumination can be helpful, while an excess usually ends up being harmful. A little anxiety is a good thing – it keeps us safe – but if it starts to take over, we need to find ways to hold it in check. Our minds’ capacity for delusion and hallucination hints at something fundamental to our humanity: our openness to creative reinterpretations of reality. But when that capacity becomes unmoored, it can destroy a life. (Psychotic illness, when the fabric of reality itself becomes distorted and unreliable, has a higher suicide rate than depression.)Someone with a tendency to elation and disinhibition can be a boon for any community – we need some rule-breakers and utopian dreamers, who believe themselves to be capable of anything. But when those feelings tip over into mania, it wrecks families, friendships and livelihoods. A pupil with a label of ADHD might challenge a teacher trying to control a boisterous classroom, but the energy, enthusiasm and multitasking associated with such tendencies can, in other contexts, be a blessing. And what is low mood except the excruciating awareness that life could and indeed should feel better than it does? Every mental health problem I see in clinic has at its core a tendency that, in a more measured dose, or different setting, could contribute to human wellbeing rather than detract from it.If we were able to hold the labels more lightly, aware of the human tendencies they oversimplify, would we be able to create a society more accepting of difference? Might it be less stigmatising, and also more hopeful, and more open to recovery? With each of my patients, I try to figure out what works best for them to be unfragile – to bend and roll with life’s challenges, rather than be shattered by them. Our minds are not brittle or rigid, but dynamic and responsive, creative and adaptive. Change is not only possible for the mind, it is inevitable, and part of its very nature. To reverse the mental-illness epidemic we need less rigid classification, and more curiosity and kindness, humility and hope.The Unfragile Mind: Making Sense of Mental Healthis published by Profile/Wellcome on 12 February.

The safest of safe hands. A grownup. That didn’t mean the likes of Emma Reynolds. Emma looks permanently startled at the best of times. Especially when there’s a microphone around. Give her more than 30 seconds and she’ll confess to crimes she didn’t commit.And certainly not Wes Streeting. Not even Wes trusts Wes. His denials over any involvement with Anas Sarwar’s Monday press conference weren’t 100% convincing. Nor was his insistence that he had never much liked Peter Mandelson. In his WhatsApps, Wes uses one kiss for those he hates and two for those he loves. Apparently.Ordinarily it would have been Pat McFadden on the morning media round. Keir Starmer’s personal enforcer. But Pat hasn’t been quite himself since touring the studios on Sunday to tell broadcasters it would make no sense for Morgan McSweeney to resign. Nor was his delivery ideal. Pat is one of life’s natural depressives. You get the feeling that a smile costs him. Even when he’s trying to be upbeat, he still sounds as if he’s giving a funeral eulogy. Something best avoided on today of all days.So it fell toEd Milibandto do the honours. Ed comes with one massive advantage over many of his cabinet colleagues. He really, really doesn’t want Starmer’s job. He’s done it once and he crashed and burned. He has no desire to put himself through that pain again. He’s happy in his own skin doing a job he loves as energy secretary. Ed is now older and a wee bit wiser. This gives him a credibility and gravitas that many ministers lack. The worst has happened to him and he’s come out the other side. There is the sense that what you see is what you get with Ed. That he is an honest broker. Up to a point. More of that later.Labour MPs had looked over the precipice, he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson on the Today programme, and they hadn’t liked what they had seen. That was one way of looking at it.But Ed was getting down to basics. No pretence that the events of the last week had all somehow been a confection of the Westminster media. It had been a real enough leadership crisis alright. One that had only been steadied by the cabinet giving Soviet levels of support for Starmer and a quick reminder to be careful what you wish for. Don’t get rid of your leader until you have a successor lined up.And never forget that it’s not just Keir’s job on the line. It’s those of hundreds of Labour MPs. Many may not rate their prospects of keeping their jobs in 2029 with Labour tanking in the polls, but if they get rid of Starmer now that election could come early and they will be getting their P45s a whole lot sooner. Even Streeting knows he is likely to be a goner. Which wasn’t to say that the danger had passed for Keir. Just that he was safe for now. Until the next crisis. Bring on the May elections. As Miliband knows better than most, politics is nothing if not transactional.But Ed didn’t want to dwell on the negatives. They were to be left as an unspoken subtext to all his interviews. A reminder both to Starmer and Labour MPs of the realities. And who was really in charge. First though, some praise for Keir. He had been bold and passionate in his speech to the parliamentary party on Monday night, Miliband said. Starmer had reminded MPs he had never been involved in a fight he had lost. Maybe he was having an attack of amnesia. Either way, it seemed that no one reminded him he had lost the battle over the two-child benefit cap and inheritance tax for farmers.This was the Starmer he had always known throughout their 15-year friendship, Ed insisted. It was just one of life’s little tragedies that Keir had always saved his boldest, most passionate speeches for behind closed doors so that the voters never got to see it. Put him in front of a TV camera and Starmer fades to beige.But Miliband was hopeful that everything would be different from now on. A line in the sand had been drawn. Keir had refound his mojo. He had a burning desire to end the class divide. From now on he would govern for the powerless. This was a moment of genuine change.It was a nice thought. Wishful thinking, perhaps. You couldn’t help thinking this was a Keir fashioned in Ed’s own image. Starmer was now only in Downing Street under the sufferance of a cabinet elite. That weak.A while ago, one of McSweeney’s team had described Keir as the leader who thought he was driving the driverless DLR. If that was an exaggeration then, it’s turning into a reality now. Miliband was more than happy to give Starmer a fake steering wheel for the sake of appearances. To allow him to think he was at the centre of government. Why bother to go through all the pain and uncertainty of replacing the leader, when it’s much easier to control the one you’ve got into doing what you want? Especially when you haven’t got a replacement lined up. Ed didn’t need the trappings of office. Save them for princes. All he was interested in was a Labour government doing his kind of Labour things.Not that there wouldn’t be a struggle for power at the very top. Wes wouldn’t give up without a fight. So Miliband gently put the boot in. It was time for others to stop making the leadership crisis all about their own ambitions. A nice touch, that. Add in a quick reminder that Ed had never trusted Mandelson since way back and his morning’s work was just about done. Things still might go tits up, but they were looking a lot more promising than they had done a day ago. Later, Starmer gave a media clip in which he promised never to walk away from the job. Bless. As if it was in his gift.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe politics sketchKeir StarmerEd MilibandLabour party leadershipcommentShareReuse this content"

The so-called “concrete monstrosities” of the Hayward Gallery, Purcell Room, Queen Elizabeth Hall and its skatepark undercroft have finally been Grade II-listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Traditionalists may be spitting feathers, but as football pundits are apt to assert: “It was the right result.”Campaigners welcome ‘long overdue’ listing of brutalist Southbank CentreRead moreHowever, it turned out to be a very long and very tetchy game. Constructed between 1949 and 1968 in an uncompromisingly brutalist style, theSouthbank Centrewas once voted Britain’s ugliest building. Since 1991, the Twentieth Century Society (C20), champions of all things modern, and Historic England had recommended listing on six separate occasions, yet their advice was rejected by successive secretaries of state. Until now. The decision brings to an end an unprecedented 35-year-long impasse, one of the longest-running battles in British architectural heritage.The brutalist era produced some of the boldest, architecture in Britain, constructed on a scale unlikely to be repeated“The lack of listing had become a complete anomaly,” said Catherine Croft, C20’s director. “The Southbank Centre is admired as one of the best brutalist buildings in the world, so this decision is obviously very well deserved and long overdue. The arts complex is a highly sophisticated sculptural masterpiece, with enormous richness of form and detail inside and out. The experience it gives concert-goers and gallery visitors is unlike any other venue in the country, its virtuoso spaces still unrivalled.”View image in fullscreenThe Upper Ground of the South Bank, circa the opening of the National Theatre in 1967.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesIronically for the spitting feathers traditionalists, the origins and present form of the Southbank Centre can be traced back to Winston Churchill, whose Conservative government spitefully swept away most of the oldFestival of Britainsite, except for the Royal Festival Hall. This scorched earth policy paved the way for new development along the Thames, in the style of the day.EnterNorman Engleback, who helmed London County Council’s youthful architectural team charged with designing the Southbank Centre. Eschewing the more milquetoast, Scandinavian-style modernism of the neighbouring Royal Festival Hall, Engleback and his gang opted instead for a full-ondroogs’ paradiseof board-marked concrete walls, walkways, staircases and rooftop terraces, punctuated by concrete air conditioning ducts and pyramidal glazing.As an architectural movement, brutalism has oscillated wildly in public affection and critical standing. But the wheel turns, and since the 2010s it has been rediscovered by a new generation of admirers, drawn not only to its aesthetic qualities but also to what it represented in terms of progressive social reconstruction in the postwar era. The listing of the Southbank Centre is merely the long overdue cherry on the concrete cake.View image in fullscreenQueen Elizabeth Hall.Photograph: John Maclean, View/AlamyYet the saga was not without its bizarre twists and turns. The abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986 led to the creation of the South Bank Board, which sought to generate more income from the site, and the reviled “concrete monstrosities” were an obvious target for redevelopment. The next four decades saw numerous putative salvoes, from cosmetic tweaks to outright demolition.A 1989 proposal by postmodernist imperatorTerry Farrellwould have wrapped the buildings in a po-mo shell, but was abandoned in 1993. The Wave, a £70m Richard Rogers scheme from 1994, would have involved a curved glass roof enclosing the buildings and outdoor spaces, like a giant and somewhat preposterous conservatory. Criticised for its lack of practicality and exorbitant cost, it was axed after failing to receive National Lottery funding. A 1999 masterplan for the entirety of the South Bank by Rick Mather was touted by some as “the perfect antidote to the centre’s drab squalor”, but again remained unexecuted.In 2013, Feilden Clegg Bradley put forward theFestival Wing, a £120m proposal featuring a 60-metre-long glazed pavilion looming over the Hayward Gallery and commercial spaces housed in shipping containers. Vigorously opposed by C20, this plan was also dropped, largely due to the protests of the skateboarders who frequent the undercroft of the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and whose “Long Live the Southbank” campaign attracted more than 80,000 supporters and the backing of the London Mayor.View image in fullscreenBoard meeting … the skates who gather in the undercroft below the Queen Elizabeth Hall campaigned to save it from demolition.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFollowing a £16.7m grant from Arts Council England, Feilden Clegg Bradley instead went on to lead an exemplary conservation and restoration programme for the Hayward Gallery, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room in 2018.The brutalist era produced some of the boldest, most uncompromising architecture in Britain, constructed on a scale unlikely to be repeated. Paradoxically, a style that was once seen as ugly, aggressive and alienating now features as sanitised decoration on plates, mugs, tea towels and a host of other merch. Yet as the Southbank Centre amply demonstrates, brutalism’s real power lies in its buildings: things of supreme heft, surprising beauty and audacious ambition.“The battle has been won and brutalism has finally come of age,” said Croft. “This is a victory over those who derided so-called ‘concrete monstrosities’ and shows a mature recognition of a style where Britain led the way.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureSouthbank CentreHeritagecommentShareReuse this content"

Why isn’t Britain?Pippa NeillIn Lancashire, I met people living with dangerous levels of Pfas, including in their food. The government is failing themTue 10 Feb 2026 10.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 10.49 ESTShareLast week, on the morning the government published itsPfas action plan, I got a worried phone call from a woman called Sam who lives next door to a chemical factory in Lancashire. Sam had just been hand-delivered a letter from her local councilinforming herthat after testing, it had been confirmed that her ducks’ eggs, reared in her garden in Thornton-Cleveleys, near Blackpool, are contaminated with Pfas.Pfas – per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment – are a family of thousands of chemicals, and I have been reporting on them for years. Some, including those found in the eggs Sam and her family have been eating, have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses,including certain cancers.The levels recorded in one of the eggs was so high that if Sam ate just one a week, it would exceed the European safe weekly level for Pfas exposure 10 times over. Thisthresholdsets out the maximum level of Pfas that can be consumed weekly over a lifetime without risking adverse health effects. Sam and her children have been eating these eggs every single day for decades.This is what living on the frontline of regulatory failure looks like.Sam stopped eating the eggs about a year ago, when the local council started investigating the factory at the end of her garden due to concerns around thehistoric airborne emissionsof PFOA, a banned and carcinogenic type of Pfas chemical. But before this, Sam believed she was making healthy choices, growing her own vegetables and rearing her own ducks, aiming to teach her children where their food comes from.View image in fullscreen‘Sam has now stopped eating her eggs, but has the damage to her health already been done?’Photograph: Kilian O’Sullivan, ENDS ReportShe told me over the phone that she now feels terrified to go into her own garden. The following day, she messaged to say she had been unable to sleep. “Are these chemicals in my blood?” she said.On the one hand, it’s great to see that the government has finally published its plan for Pfas. It has been a long time coming. On the other, this plan fails to lay out any concrete steps that the government will take today to help people like Sam. It is a plan to make a plan, a promise to act – when parliamentary time allows, subject to consultation, and as thegovernment itself says, taken in collaboration with the chemical industry. All the while, Sam, and who knows how many others across the country, are still at risk of potential exposure to toxic chemicals.The factory on the edge of Sam’s garden is still allowed torelease large amountsof a new Pfas chemical into the environment, despite evidence that this chemical could cause damage to a person’s sexual function, fertility or their child’s development. This chemical was not mentioned once in the plan.After years of reporting on industrial Pfas pollution, I know only too well that Sam is not the only person living with the real-world impact of this chemical pollution. In aninvestigationfor the ENDS Report and the Guardian in 2024, I revealed that the small Yorkshire town of Bentham is polluted with what was described by experts as the highest level of Pfas pollution ever recorded in the UK. How many more communities are going to learn that their homes and public spaces are contaminated with toxic chemicals before the government finally does something?Since Brexit, the UK’s regulation of Pfas has fallen woefully behind the EU’s. The bloc is drawing up plans for ablanket banon all Pfas. The UK, meanwhile, is looking to group and then restrict certain chemicals – an approach described as being akin to “Whac-A-Mole”. Why? Because when you ban one chemical, the industry can simply tweak the formulation slightly to produce a new variant that, while slightly different, may pose identical or perhaps even worse health risks.Speaking at aparliamentary inquiryon Pfas last week, the lead chemical expert at the Health and Safety Executivedescribedthe UK’s reason for not matching the EU’s safeguards with a direct copy as being philosophical in nature. “There is a slightly different way of thinking in the UK [compared with the EU] in terms of philosophy,” he said. The difference was that rather than a blanket ban, the UK would choose what to ban a “a bit more slowly or gradually in a prioritised way”.Environmentalists decry ‘crushingly disappointing’ Pfas action plan for UKRead moreI haven’t asked Sam, but I’m not sure that she and the other people in her position have time for a slow, gradual approach from government when weighing up the potential risks to their health – and that of their families. They just want to be safe, and to live without fear.What the government’s new plan does do is pledge to undertake more research. While no one could deny that more research is needed, this seems to be coming at the expense of acting on what we do already know. For example, we already know,without doubt,that a number of these chemicals are toxic, that they are persistent, and that they are everywhere. The Environment Agency hasitself estimatedthat there could be as many as 10,000 Pfas hotspots across England. Until these chemicals are banned at the point of production, that number is not going to get smaller.Back inLancashire, Sam has now stopped eating her eggs, but has the damage to her health already been done? These are the questions she is left to grapple with alone, while the government pledges to take action – once it has spoken with the chemical industry.Pippa Neill is an environmental journalist and the news editor at ENDS ReportExplore more on these topicsPfasOpinionChemical industryEuropean UnionEnvironment AgencyLancashireEnglandPollutioncommentShareReuse this content"

Jan Leeming is right – our kids need to be trained to behave in publicPolly HudsonThe former newsreader has caused a stir by complaining about unruly children in a restaurant. We do our offspring no favours by teaching them that they are the centre of the universeTue 10 Feb 2026 10.31 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 15.50 ESTShareJan Leeming, the 80s newsreader, has found herself unexpectedly back in the limelight without even having to do Strictly. Instead, she seems to have unwittingly starred in a non-televised episode of Supernanny, dishing out advice to parents about how to raise their children. Or how not to, to be more precise.Last week, Leemingcomplained on social mediathat a friend’s birthday lunch at The Pig at Bridge Place, near Canterbury, was “slightly spoiled by a screaming child”. She explained: “One tot was a real menace, allowed to walk around and often screaming … parents oblivious to other clients.”Shedoubled down on Times Radioon Saturday, saying too many mums and dads treat their children “like little princes and princesses: many of them are just allowed to run riot”. She added that kids should be trained like dogs, to behave when out in public. “I’m afraid that if you have children, it’s your responsibility to teach them to be socially acceptable.”This opinion has unsurprisingly proved largely unpopular, probably not helped by the canine comparison and the image it conjures up of youngsters being tapped on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. Leeming is right, though.One of a parent’s main jobs is to teach their kid not to be a dick. Pull this off successfully and it ensures that when they grow up, and spend time with humans who don’t unconditionally adore them and forgive anything, as you may, they’ll make friends, be on good terms with colleagues and find a partner, if they want one. They’ll be kind and considerate, at ease with the reality that they are not the centre of the universe. In order to function in society later, children need to be told now when they’re being selfish, annoying or acting inappropriately for the setting.Of course for some neurodivergent children it’s impossible to sit quietly in a restaurant, so obviously this doesn’t apply to them.This isn’t “being seen and not heard” – you’re not making unfair demands, merely asking that they behave the same way as everybody else on the train, or in the cinema, or at the shop. When they’re in a restaurant, screaming is off the table. Remain seated. If they can’t manage that, we’re outta there. Now more than ever, going out to eat is a treat, not a basic human right. There are some specifically family friendly restaurants, full of kids, which happily tolerate carnage and chaos, and everybody who goes there knows the deal. But if it’s an adult establishment, children who can’t play by the rules – and let’s face it, few toddlers can – should steer clear, for the good of all involved.What most people seem to lose sight of is that when a kid is causing a scene in a public place, nobody wishes they would shut up more fervently than their parents. ​They are fully cognisant of what their offspring doesn’t notice or care about: everyone in this room hates us. That type of insight is much easier to digest when delivered gently by somebody who loves you, which is why it’s up to mums and dads.I am certain that all the adults we see around us listening to music out loud without headphones, not saying thank you at zebra crossings, and putting their feet on public transport seats others have to sit on were overindulged in restaurants as children. It has to stop, for the future of civilised civilisation.I’m reminded of asocial experiment detailed in the Guardianby Hannah Ewens, who decided to politely suggest using headphones to those playing content out loud whenever the opportunity presented itself. She reported that they generally responded well: “They make one of two faces: either they look as if they are rousing from a century’s slumber or appear shocked at themselves, as if they don’t know how they got to this moment.”It turned out they weren’t actively trying to upset their fellow travellers, or being purposely thoughtless and self-centred, it just hadn’t occurred to them that they were bothering anybody. They weren’t “bad dogs”, just untrained.Ewens described how one man had immediately blushed and said: “God, sorry. Was in my own little world there.” That’s what we need to teach our kids – it’s not your own little world, it’s yours, mine, Jan Leeming’s, and about 8 billion other people’s too.

The last chief executive, Murray Auchincloss,got the heave-ho in December. Last month brought news ofhefty write-downson the troublesome low-carbon energy assets in solar and biogas. Now comes an admission that the current debt-reduction measures aren’t enough to ease the strain on an over-extended balance sheet.Share buy-backs are being suspended.Buy-backs have become the essential symbol of financial virility in today’s oil industry. At the right price, they represent an efficient use of excess capital and are a way for managements to send obligatory signals about “financial discipline”, meaning refraining from empire-building adventures.Thus it was significant that Shell last week sustained its 17th consecutive quarter of at least $3bn of buy-backs, allowing debt to rise evenas profits fell. The company was saying it can handle, for now, a spell of lower oil and gas prices. At BP, by contrast, buy-backs are already deemed an unaffordable luxury.The decision is probably sensible in the short-term for three reasons. First, BP’s balance sheet, measured by financial gearing, is the weakest among the big oil majors. Debt, on the most generous metric, is $22bn. So best to save $6bn a year by “fully allocating” excess cash to the reduction effort. It is simpler than waiting for receipts from disposals,notably the 65% share of Castrol, to arrive.Second, there is little relief in sight from markets: annual profits for 2025 were $7.5bn, down from $9bn, reflecting a 20% drop in the price of oil. Third, the new chief executive,Meg O’Neill, will arrive in April, so let her start with a free hand.The market didn’t like the decision – especially the refusal to commit to restarting buy-backs once debt is within the target range of $14bn to $18bn – but it cannot be surprised. Shares fell 6%.But it does all add to the mystery over what the reign of O’Neill and new-ish chair, Albert Manifold, will bring. The only certainty is more oil and gas projects.BPstarted seven in the past year and has its large Bumerangue discovery 250 miles off the coast of Brazil in the wings. So it is conceivable that BP, having signalled chunky cuts in fossil fuel production during the green-tinged era of Bernard Looney, will veer to the opposite extreme of keeping output at roughly the current level of 2.3bn barrels a day all the way until 2035. The talk now is about the “deep hopper of oil and gas opportunities”.One constituency of shareholders – those who hated the dabbling in renewables and thought BP should stick to what it knows – will applaud the new direction. But one suspects even they will want clarity sharp-ish from O’Neill on what else follows.If BP is now all-in on oil and gas, is there any point in keeping a rump interest in solar and biogas? Could those assets be sold? And perhaps the electric vehicle charging assets and the global chain of petrol stations could be added to the mix, which might create a bigger and cleaner parcel for a demerger.Most of all, though, investors will want to know what’s coming their way in terms of cash, after the churn of capital expenditure, cost-cutting and disposals. It’s one thing to “retire” – as BP did on Tuesday – guidance that 30-40% of operating cashflow will go to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buy-backs. But something has to be put in its place.How low does debt have to go before the balance sheet is judged safe? What oil price is required to allow share purchases to resume? BP shareholders, whatever strategic camp they’re in, love the hard clarity of dividends and buy-backs. O’Neill’s honeymoon period won’t last long.Explore more on these topicsBPNils Pratley on financeOil and gas companiesEnergy industrycommentShareReuse this content"

I didn’t give it a lot of thought – romance’s festival day has never been a great advert for the concept. In the best case scenario, it turns your real and important feelings into a commercial cliche, in the worst, it’s just a vivid and poignant reminder of how much you wish you were elsewhere, and at every point in between, it’s open season for restaurants to rip you off while you make dry conversation over drier chicken.This year, however, I made a plan with two married friends. I did not anticipate how much I would enjoy bumping into their husbands around the place, going “guess where I’m going on Valentine’s Day? OUT WITH YOUR WIFE”, to see their astonished expressions, since, ensconced in long marriages, they can no longer remember what month it is, let alone if anyone has any plans.Then my uncle, who was born on 14 February, broke the habit of a lifetime and decided last minute he wanted to celebrate. It’s a bit of a surprise because he’s not even 90, but I don’t think I’m breaking a taboo when I say it’s unwise to tell your favourite 89-year-old on Earth that you can’t make his birthday because you’re holding out for the big 9-0.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Zoe’s sister Imogen, uncle Richard and Zoe, pictured in 1983.Photograph: Courtesy of Zoe WilliamsI always greet him the same way, “HELLO UNCLE RICHARD”, and he always greets me the same way, “HELLO ZO”, shameless, exuberant shouting, which is handy now because he’s deaf, but came about (in 1978) because I was just so happy to see him. In adolescence I had a choice whether to transmute to a more adult “hey, Richard”, and I elected instead to just stay the same, only ironic. And now I’m 52, and I shout “HELLO UNCLE RICHARD”, and it’s louder than ever, and I’m still so happy to see him.If he were celebrating in a price-gouging restaurant, I would have no problem with that (although he would have a major problem with it – he’s very thrifty; and anyway, we’re going to the pub). There is no chance of conversation running dry, there being about a thousand Williamses-and-adjacents, and that’s just in Catford. The errant wives I had to reschedule are, unbelievably, free the next day. Best Valentine’s weekend ever.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Britain’s muted response to a media mogul’s harsh sentence suggests a narrowing view of what confrontation is worthTue 10 Feb 2026 13.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 18.41 ESTShareIf thesentencehanded to the media mogul Jimmy Lai was meant to surprise, it would have been shorter. Twenty years behind bars is not a burst of rage. It is a sentence designed to make repression routine in Hong Kong. The 78-year-old founder of the shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily is now likely to die in prison after being convicted of sedition. The court was telling Hongkongers what kind of place they now live in, and signalling to foreign governments what kind of relationship Beijing expects them to accept.China’s national security law, imposed on Hong Kong in 2020, was designed to dismantle the former British colony’s pro-democracy movement and to place freedom of expression under permanent political constraint by the Chinese Communist party. From 2020 to 2026, at least385 individualshave been arrested and 175 convicted under national security-related offences.The day after Mr Lai’s verdict, China released a securitywhite paperon Hong Kong. The timing was no coincidence. It described the national security law as a “legal shield” that had restored order. The message was that Hong Kong cannot be a special case within China: its courts, legislature and civil service are instruments of Beijing’s security apparatus. Mr Lai’s sentence, the heaviest yet imposed under China’s national security law, drew international criticism. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk,calledfor his release, warning that the verdict violated international law, criminalised journalism and relied on conduct that predated the legislation under which he was prosecuted.Hong Kong’s chief executive said the security laws target “hostile” foreign intervention. Britain stopped short of contesting that framing. Ministers haveexpressedconcern, called on China to honour the Sino-British Joint Declaration and said the government had raised the case privately. Their appeal for his release rests on humanitarian grounds, not on the unsoundness of the conviction.Brussels’responsewas tougher than London’s, even though Britain is the former imperial power and Mr Lai is a British citizen. That reluctance is often justified as realism: China is simply too important to confront. But realism cuts both ways. Beijing reads restraint as a signal of limits. The point of cases like Mr Lai’s is not only to punish an individual, but todemonstratethat guarantees – even “legally binding” ones – are no constraint.Britain sees itself as a defender of a rules-based order. But it is also, regrettably, saying that those rules will not be enforced where the costs appear too high. The continued presence of some British judges in Hong Kong’s top court was once defended as a safeguard of judicial independence. They ought to leave as the role now risks legitimising Beijing’spersecutionof democracy activists.Australia’s experience offers a contrast. When a high profile China-born Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, was detained for three years on national security charges, Canberra treated herdetentionas political, and campaigned despite the risk of retaliation. Australia clearly said that there were costs to be weighed on both sides. The reporter waseventuallyfreed. Britain could take a tougher stance. That would not guarantee Mr Lai’s release. Nor would it require Britain to abandon engagement with China. But if a British citizen can be ruled unlawfully imprisoned and the response stops at private appeals for mercy, a line has been drawn – and others will notice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rising costs and the growing role of private providers in residential care and foster placements have exposed deep weaknesses, yet reform has lagged behind the crisis in children’s homes. Only now have ministers set outplans to reshape fostering. The test is whether their plan fixes the system, or papers over its cracks.The main thrust of anew policy paperfrom the Department for Education is that more foster carers are needed to meet a target of 10,000 additional non-profit places by 2029. The children’s minister, Josh MacAlister, who previouslyled a reviewof the sector under the Tories, likened the plan to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which saw nearly 74,000 people volunteer to host refugees fleeing the war. A national recruitment campaign can be expected soon. With around a third of all current carers aged over 60, it makes sense to try to attract new people to their ranks.But even the most experienced foster carers do not operate alone. And the rest of the proposals deal with the support systems that surround them. One is for stronger collaboration between councils. Another is for grants so that experienced foster carers can extend or refit their homes to accommodate extra children, potentially including siblings of those already there. A third concerns specialist placements for young people on remand, as an alternative to custody.Many of these ideas deserve support. Imprisoning vulnerable young people who have not been convicted of crimes should be a last resort. The suggestion of improved local fostering networks is also welcome. These could provide ongoing peer support but also practical help such as temporary respite care. Speeding up approvals makes sense too. There is no reason why this process should take longer than it does for prospective adopters, as at present. And it is right that foster carers should be listened to when decisions about children are made.Yet significant gaps remain. It is unclear who will lead and sustain this agenda. There is also little sign of firm action on the excessive profits identified bythe Competition and Markets Authority in 2022. So far, pledges to end these amount to little more than threats. And it is depressing that it is seen as necessary, in 2026, to explain the benefits to children and families of consistency from social services. Avoiding frequent changes of professionals ought to be among the most basic aims for authorities dealing with looked-after children. Retention of social workers must be improved.Last year the Institute for Government gave its most favourable rating to children’s social care, in itsreview of public servicesunder Sir Keir Starmer’s government. Mr MacAlister’s prior involvement in shaping government policy gave him a head start, when he became a minister, andfunding has increased(with £555m invested over two years). Children’s social care tends to make headlines only when there is a catastrophic failure, and a child dies. Signs of ministerial action are to be welcomed. Recruiting more foster carers is a necessary but not sufficient fix. Without clear leadership, curbs on profiteering and stable social work teams, the foster care system will remain fragile.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Third, it requires compelling landlords to charge reasonable rents.Fourth, and finally, it requires local authorities the financial headroom to buy up vacant retail space. This ought to enable innovative community and business enterprises to flourish in what would otherwise be an overtaxed and overpriced rental market.None of the above will suit the treasury nor a chancellor who has a history of gaffes. It’s not just the prime minister that needs changing. We need enablers to have their way.David ClaridgeOxted, SurreyImagine a hobby centre instead of a shopping centre. It would have free table tennis and crazy golf. And paid-for craft classes and yoga. It would houseMen in Shedsand there would be indoor football and badminton. Food courts would include a creche.We need a new vision for town centres and tinkering with a failed system won’t work. Our supposedly free market is driven by financial not social value, forgetting that the purpose of wealth is happiness and health. It results in high streets of vape shops and nail bars, while online we spend beyond our means on throwaway products.Tim Jackson described the challenges of a system based on material gain in Prosperity Without Growth, but said we still need the buzz currently provided by material gain. Increasingly, we also need to recreate the public spaces that used to bring us together.Buzzing, social venues are popping up all over, such as the Games Room in Falmouth, crazy golf in Liverpool’s city centre and board game cafes around the country. At the same time, there’s an explosion of interest in crafts such as crochet.Someone once said that Martin Luther King had a vision, not a 10-point plan. Sure, we need supportive taxation and business people to plan, but it’s the vision of a systemic change we’re missing. So let’s start with funding arts and innovation in schools, celebrate diversity and bring the creatives and people who care in from the cold.Mandy BarnettBurneside, CumbriaI don’t know Newton Aycliffe, but when I read your description of the decline of the Beveridge Way shopping centre, I had a hunch. A quick look at a map confirmed my suspicion: not far from Beveridge Way there’s a large Tesco Extra and, naturally, a huge car park.I suggest that wherever one finds hollowed-out shopping centres like Beveridge Way one will find not far away one of those grotesque temples to the motorcar that make a nonsense of aiming for net zero. Planning authorities are all but helpless in the face of pressure from the corporations who inflict them on our towns. Should councillors have the temerity to deny planning permission, corporations threaten them with expensive lawyers, eye-watering expenses to be paid out of the public purse, and the real threat of surcharge – something our Westminster representatives don’t have to face if they make a mistake.A government with a spine would know where the immediate cause of high street decline lives, and would tackle that first, before any regeneration measures.Rosalind MitchellEdinburghYour editorial on the decline of the high street doesn’t cover the damage done to public transport – and the environment – by the move of shopping from the high street to out-of-town superstores and shopping centres.As a former CEO of a passenger transport executive in the 1990s and 2000s, it was very apparent that the new superstores – virtually all located away from or on the fringes of towns with large car parks – were designed around cars, with little or no consideration for access by public transport.The switch by many shoppers from bus to car meant existing bus routes became less viable and many people from communities with relatively low populations lost their bus service altogether.Of course, the result of these planning authority decisions meant many more local car journeys contributing to more pollution – and global warming.Some towns have or are enhancing their centres by increasing pedestrian-only areas and only allowing buses and taxis into these areas.If town centres are to thrive, much needs to be invested into making them aesthetically attractive and to give priority on the radial roads to those buses serving the town centres.At the same time, there needs to be a financial incentive for businesses to locate there. Perhaps the chancellor might consider a differential between VAT charged on goods bought face to face and those bought online. Some of the resulting revenue could be channelled to local authorities to enhance their town centres.Mike ParkerDirector general, Nexus (Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive), 1994-2006A number of people are bemoaning that if we don’t use our high street shops they will go (Letters, 2 February). This is totally fair. Is it also fair to expect people to shop in an area that costs more than online and is difficult to access (with expensive and difficult parking)? I don’t think it is.If it’s cheaper and easier to shop elsewhere, we cannot expect people to buy consistently from the more expensive options (especially during this cost of living crisis).So what do we do with our empty stores? I’d be deeply saddened to see the high street turn into houses and lose that sense of community at a town’s heart. I live in central Tonbridge and spend a large portion of my time in the town centre. I bought my home specifically so I could walk to the high street.With out-of-town stores, supermarkets and online next-day delivery shopping, our high streets now provide us with a different experience to the one our grandparents required. We now work longer hours, spend our days looking at screens and communicate with loved ones remotely. Plenty of cafes, social spaces to spend time together in real life, places for families to bring their children – this is what our communities now need at their hearts. Places that bring people together and allow us to breathe, reconnect and space to look up from our screens. Places to fill our hearts and calm our overstretched minds. These could be cafes, restaurants, play centres, pubs, community spaces to hold events, groups and classes.If the government thinks about what modern communities need and rethinks business rates to accommodate these spaces, our towns can continue to grow outwards without losing town centres at their heart.Holly WareTonbridge, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

She admits there is a problem in defining what it is so, I assume, she has her own personalised definition.And therein lies the problem. Everyone has their own idea of what they mean by class. Accent, postcode, housing tenure, income, job type – all relating either to oneself or to one’s parents. I have even been told it relates to grandparents’ jobs.It is so meaningless that picking out one variable for the purpose of legislation is a non-starter. And if this solicitor’s son’s prospects could be limited by virtue of his schooling and postcode, it is also immoral.People are just people with varying abilities. A change in the law would not affect me. In my 80-plus years of life, I have always considered myself classless and I’m very happy to continue to do so.Michael ChapmanHeathfield, East SussexRegarding David Bell’s letter(Letters, 5 February), he is misinformed if he thinks comprehensive education was introduced in the 1970s. A movement for “common” schools began before the second world war, and about ahundred comprehensive schoolswere open by the end of the 1950s. There were 10 times as many by the end of the next decade, following the Labour government’s 1965 request to all England’s local authorities to plan to “go comprehensive”. Even so, in areas retaining selective education, some four out of five students attended secondary modern schools.These young people learned in larger classes and were taught by less well-qualified staff than was the case for the small minority who went to grammar schools. Nor could they aim at university, being generally denied the opportunity to take O-level (let alone A-level) exams. As is the case today, the grammar schools of the 1960s taught very few children from impoverished families. Comprehensive schools, not grammar schools, have been the great enablers of opportunity, as the chancellor, the home secretary, the great majority of the cabinet, and the new archbishop of Canterbury, all comprehensive school students in their youth, could perhaps attest.Patrick YarkerDereham, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

When Britain arrived in Milano Cortina there was heady talk of the country having one of its “most potent ever teams” for aWinter Olympics. So far, though, Team GB is still firing blanks.It is not for the want of trying.Kirsty Muir missed outon a freeski slopestyle bronze by 0.41 points. Mia Brookescame impossibly closeto making the biggest trick in Olympic big air snowboard history. WhileBritain’s mixed curlers, having coasted regally through the group stages, their mojo went awol when it mattered most.Winter Olympics 2026 day four: Sweden’s Wrana siblings beat USA to win curling gold – liveRead moreLess than 48 hours ago, there were high hopes for three medals on Magic Monday. Now the dominant narrative is of heartbreak and pain, tears and tales of what might have been.No wonder Team GB’s chef de mission, Eve Muirhead, has urged everyone to “stay positive” after three fourth-place finishes in barely 24 hours. But the fact she used the phrase four times in four answers, when speaking to the media after Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds’ bronze-medal defeat against Italy, suggested she was trying to convince herself as much as anyone else.So will it be squeaky bum time at UK Sport, which has invested £25.5m across winter sports for the 2022-26 cycle, and set a goal of four to eight medals? Not yet. Because while medal opportunities have slipped by, even more remain.Part of that confidence comes down to believing that the variance that has gone against them so far must shift at some point. Yes, Britain expected at least one medal from the three chances they had earlier in the week. But if you spin a coin three times hoping for heads, there is still a 12.5% chance you get three tails instead. And that is what essentially happened.As Muirhead put it on Tuesday: “We always speak about winter sports and how it comes down to absolutely nothing and I think the last couple of days has been a prime example of that, hasn’t it? Millimetres, milliseconds. But you know what, I’m really kind of, I’m positive. We are only on day four and there’s a lot of great events to come.”One longtime Team GB figure said that Muirhead’s view reflected the “realistic optimism” in the camp, with the team acknowledging the setbacks but also noting that multiple athletes had already enjoyed best ever results, including the likes of Ellia Smeding, who finished 11th in the women’s 1000m long track.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Bankes (centre) is the favourite in the women’s snowboard cross.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAMore importantly, the British camp still believe they have several aces left to play. The biggest comes in skeleton, an event where Team GB spend far more than their rivals, allowing them to have far more aerodynamic sleds and kit – a huge advantage. Think of it like Formula One. While Team GB has the equivalent of a McLaren, most of their rivals are in a Williams or Kick Sauber. Does it guarantee a place on the podium? Of course not. But it certainly doesn’t hurt their chances.While the British team’snew helmet was bannedlast week, the indications from practice are enormously positive. Matt Weston – who has won five of the seven men’s World Cup races this season – has been fastest in three of the four runs so far. In the women’s event, Tabitha Stoecker has finished first in practice twice, and second on the other two runs.If sledders like Marcus Wyatt can discover their best form, it is not inconceivable that the skeleton team could get close to the lower part of UK Sport’s medal target all by themselves. The medal chances don’t end there either. In the women’s snowboard cross, Charlotte Bankes is the favourite. Team GB’s men’s curlers, who won silver four years ago in Beijing, are the world No 1’s team according to the curling statistician Ken Pomeroy.With Britain still having Brookes going in her best event, the snowboard slopestyle, and Kirsty Muir in the freeski big air, and world champion Zoe Atkin in the freeski halfpipe, you can see why Team GB’s message is ‘don’t panic’.The hope is the comeback could start as soon as Wednesday evening when the ice dance competition reaches its denouement, with Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson in fourth place. “We need to start building a little bit of momentum and I think we definitely can do that,” Muirhead says. “We’ve got to keep positive.” And why not, given there are still 12 days to go.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBanalysisShareReuse this content"

This has been the worst week of my life.‘My needles are waiting’: Ben Ogden credits knitting habit after cross-country silverRead more“I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her. Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.”Asked by the interviewer how he managed to finish third, Lægreid replied: “I try to be a good role model and I did something stupid. I got a nice video from the club at home and I used that as motivation today. As I said I want to be a good role model but I have to admit when I get something wrong. You have to admit when you do something you can’t stand for and hurt someone you love so much.”Lægreid won gold in the relay in Beijing four years ago and has 14 world championship medals, including seven gold. After the medals ceremony he spoke to NRK again: “I do not want to say who it is. She has had enough to deal with after last week but I hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel for us both. And that she can continue to love me.”It was a hugely emotional day for Botn, too. He pointed to the sky as he crossed the finish line and shouted “We did it Sivert!” to the TV cameras, remembering his teammate Sivert Guttorm Bakken,who was found dead in his hotel roomin Lavazè, Italy, in December.“My thoughts felt OK all the way,” he told NRK.“I went out on the last lap and had an incredible emotional rollercoaster. It was very special. When I crossed the line I broke down. I was thinking about him all the way through the last lap. I started to think about the whole year and us training every day for this. It had been such a clear goal for us. I felt that he was with me that whole lap. I hope he was watching today.”Lægreid said: “Of course, now I hope I didn’t ruin Johan’s day. Maybe it was really selfish of me to give that interview. So yeah, I don’t know. I was, I’m a bit, I don’t know … I’m not really here mentally. So yeah, we will see what happens.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

The Ukrainian team have appealed against the helmet ban, arguing that it is not in breach of Article 50 of the Olympic Charter which ­prohibits political statements while in competition.After finishing second in his ­training run, Heraskevych said that he planned to continue to use his banned helmet in competition. “I used it in all trainings. I used it today, I will use it tomorrow, and I will use it on race day,” he said. “I truly believe that we didn’t violate any law and any rules.”The images on the helmet include those of the weightlifter Alina Peregudova, the strongman Pavlo Ishchenko and the ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, who were all killed.View image in fullscreenOlena Smaha’s glove reads: ‘Remembrance is not a violation’.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesHeraskevych, who has the support of theUkrainepresident, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has also accused the IOC of betraying those dead Ukrainian athletes. “A decision that simply breaks my heart,” he said on ­Instagram. “The feeling that the IOC is ­betraying those athletes who were part of the Olympic movement, not allowing them to be honoured on the sports arena where these athletes will never be able to step again.”Earlier the IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that, while the helmet was banned, the committee would make an exception to allow ­Heraskevych to wear a black armband during competition.“There was an informal meeting last night with Mr Heraskevych, his coach and the delegation, and we ­reiterated our understanding of the athlete’s wish to pay tribute to his ­fellow Ukrainian athletes, which he’s done during training and on social media,” Adams said.“What we’ve tried to do is to address his desires with ­compassion and under­standing. We will not stop him expressing himself in press conferences, in the mixed zone and elsewhere. And we feel that this is a good compromise.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUkraineInternational Olympic CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m proud of the level of care.”It is the fourth injury to strike the Australian team, with aerials medal favourite Laura Peel injuring her knee at a pre-Olympics training camp, while young freeskier Daisy Thomas also suffered a knee injury in a fall.Snowboard halfpipe Olympian Misaki Vaughan was also ruled out of making her debut after failing a HIA, hitting head while training on Monday.Under the team’s head injury protocols, the 20-year-old can’t participate for a minimum of seven days.While Thomas withdrew from slopestyle, she is hopeful of competing in the big air while four-time Olympian Peel hasn’t given up hope of landing an elusive medal.“Unfortunately with winter sport injuries happen along the way, in 53 athletes doing relatively high risk sports it’s not something that’s unusual I’m afraid to say,” said Camplin, who won an aerials gold medal in Salt Lake City in 2022 skiing on two fractured ankles.“My heart breaks on their behalf – I know how much work goes into an Olympic dream.”Camplin said the two-time world champion Peel continued to “make progress”.“Our aerials team haven’t even arrived yet so we don’t need to rush her,” she said.Bolton was the highest-placed Australian men’s snowboard cross rider in Beijing in 13th place, while he also finished ninth in the first ever team event alongside Belle Brockhoff, whose own career was ended by serious injury.He was due to line up in the men’s seeding round on Thursday morning in Livigno with the opening round getting underway later that day and has been replaced by debutant James Johnstone.View image in fullscreenJakara Anthony during moguls qualification.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockOlympic champion Jakara Anthony has kept her stunning Games record alive, making it five rounds of competition unbeaten after she topped moguls qualifying in Livigno.Four years ago, Anthony also opened with a bang in qualifying and then swept through the next three rounds en route to Australia’s first women’s moguls gold medal.The 27-year-old joined her fellow opening ceremony flagbearer Matt Graham as the two Australian skiers to bypass the next qualification round, with the 2018 silver medallist grabbing the 10th and final spot in the men’s event.Anthony was satisfied with her performance, saying she did what she needed to do. “I felt like it was what I needed to put down for qualifications, it felt pretty tidy and that’s what we came out here to do today,” said Anthony.“My goal was just that I wanted to get through in qualification one so that I just have the chance to come out for finals tomorrow and I don’t need to worry about qualification two. So, yeah, happy.”Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026Australia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Hesingled out freestyle skier Hunter Hessfor criticism after the Oregon native said he felt “mixed emotions” about competing in the current political climate.Trump calls Hunter Hess ‘a real loser’ for skier’s ambivalence about representing USRead more“Hess, a real loser, says he doesn’t represent his country in the current Winter Olympics,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, failing to convey the nuance of the skier’s expression. “If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the team.”The exchange has quickly become the most visible example yet of political friction surrounding the US team at the Milano Cortina Games, where athletes have largely avoided direct criticism of the Trump administration but now appear increasingly willing to discuss the tensions they are experiencing.The shift has come as the Trump administration has taken a more aggressive posture internationally – includingtariffs on key allies,military action in Venezuelaandrhetoric about acquiring Greenland– moves that diplomats and analysts say have strained relations with traditional partners and contributed to a more politically charged atmosphere at the Games.It has also unfolded against a visible political backdrop in Italy. Vice-president JD Vance spent five days in Milan attending multiple Olympic events, often alongside US secretary of state Marco Rubio in what at times felt like a soft-launch of the 2028 GOP presidential ticket. Vance took separate meetings with US athletes, Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and IOC president Kirsty Coventry, whiledrawing audible and sustained booswhen shown on stadium screens during the opening ceremony (a reaction thatappeared to be edited out of the telecastback in the US).Athlete comments first drew attention during a news conference in Milan on Friday, when reporters asked the members of the US freeski team how they felt representing the country amid heightened immigration enforcement and domestic political division.Hess said he saw a distinction between representing his nation and endorsing every policy carried out in its name.“If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I’m representing it,” he said. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Fellow freestyle skier Chris Lillis struck a similar tone, saying he felt “heartbroken” about recent developments in US immigration policy while stressing that he still saw his Olympic appearance as a chance to represent a different vision of the country.“I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent,” he said.View image in fullscreenAmber Glenn said she received a “scary amount” of online hate after speaking publicly on the US political moment.Photograph: Paul Kitagaki Jr/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFigure skater Amber Glenn, days beforewinning an Olympic goldin the team event, said she believed LGBTQ+ Americans were facing a particularly difficult political moment. She later said she would be taking a break from social media after receiving what she described as a “scary amount” of hate messages and threats in the wake of her comments.In response to questions, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) said it was monitoring abusive online activity directed at athletes and working with social media platforms and law enforcement when credible threats emerged.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety,” the organization said.The hostility has not been limited to current Team USA athletes. Team GB freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, who previously represented the United States and won Olympic slopestyle silver in 2014, said he had received death threats afterposting an image on social mediacriticizing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.“The other day I posted a photo with my thoughts on ICE and that photo has since gone everywhere,” Kenworthy said in an Instagram video posted on Sunday. “I’ve gotten a ton of messages and most of them honestly have been supportive and encouraging. But a lot of the messages have been awful – people telling me to kill myself, threatening me, wishing they’ll get to see me blow my knee or break my neck during my event, calling me slurs. It’s insane.”Kenworthy, who will compete in the snowboard halfpipe in Livigno later in the Games, also voiced support for current US athletes who have spoken publicly about their discomfort with the political climate.“I think sometimes people forget that you can love the US and be proud to be an American – I am – and still think they can be better,” he said. “Just because you love the US doesn’t mean you stand with this administration.”3:51Winter Olympian Gus Kenworthy reveals he has received threats over anti-ICE post – videoThe backlash has not been limited to the political sphere. Influencers and conservative commentators have also weighed in, includingthe YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who criticized Hess on social media before attending a US women’s hockey game alongside Vance.Former NFL quarterback Brett Favre, actor Rob Schneider and Florida congressman Byron Donalds were among public figures who also criticized athletes speaking out.Richard Grenell, the Kennedy Center head who was the US ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first term, criticized Hesson social media, suggesting he “move to Canada if you aren’t proud to wear USA”.“The guy said he has mixed emotions about representing America,” Grenellsaid. “[H]e is a loser for saying that while representing the greatest country in the history of the world.”But many athletes have stopped short of directly attacking the administration, instead emphasizing a distinction between government and country.Snowboard starChloe Kimand cross-country skierJessie Digginshave both spoken about representing what they describe as core American values – inclusion, opportunity and community – even while acknowledging political divisions.Kim framed the moment through her family’s immigration story, saying recent events had “hit really close to home”.“It is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another with all that’s going on,” said the two-time Olympic halfpipe champion, whose parents immigrated from South Korea. “I’m really proud to represent the United States. It’s given my family and I so much opportunity. But I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going on. And I think that we should lead with love and compassion. And I’d love to see more of that.”Diggins, who helped the USwin a historic team sprint goldat the 2018 Winter Olympics and later added two individual medals in Beijing, said she saw her Olympic performances as representing Americans she believes are defined by empathy and community.“I’m racing for an American people who stand for love, for acceptance, for compassion, honesty and respect for others,” Digginswrote in an Instagram post. “For everyone out there caring for others, protecting their neighbours and meeting people with love – every single step is for you.”The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in the US | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreAlpine skierMikaela Shiffrinstruck a similarly careful balance, saying it remained “an honor and a privilege” to represent the United States while adding she hoped to demonstrate values of diversity, inclusion and respect through her performance and public platform.The tension has also intersected withprotests in Italylinked to the presence of US immigration enforcement personnel supporting Olympic security operations. Demonstrations in Milan have drawn thousands of participants, with smaller groups clashing with police after rallies targeting the role of US immigration agencies abroad.US officials and Italian authorities have emphasized that the personnel deployed are part of investigative units that typically assist with cross-border crime and athlete security rather than enforcement operations. Still, the optics have fueled criticism and reinforced the sense among some US athletes that domestic political debates are following them to the global stage.The dynamic reflects a longer Olympic history of athletes navigating national identity and personal conscience, but the speed and scale of online reaction has given rise to new concerns about athlete safety and mental health.Taken together, comments from several US athletes and former Olympians point to what many see as a defining tension of modern Olympic sport: representing a nation while maintaining individual political and moral beliefs.“I’m representing my family, my community, the people who helped me get here,” Hess said. “That’s what wearing the flag means to me.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamUnited States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC)Amber GlennMikaela ShiffrinJessie DigginsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The manager is dealing with a ghost from the club’s more successful recent past. There were 49 minutes on the clock when the South Stand choir took up the song. “He’s magic, you know. Mauricio Poch-e-ttino.” The message was clear. They want their former idol back. They cannot persist any longer with Frank.The only wonder here was that Newcastle, who had arrived on the back of three successive Premier League defeats and with numerous issues of their own, were not out of sight at the interval. If they were bright in the first half, Spurs were impossibly awful. Frank’s injury list numbered 10 players and he lost another one – Wilson Odobert – in the 34th minute. The captain,Cristian Romero, is suspended, of course. Nobody wants to hear excuses.Chelsea 2-2 Leeds, Tottenham 1-2 Newcastle, Everton 1-2 Bournemouth: football – live reactionRead moreThere was a period at the start of the second half when Spurs threatened an improbable comeback. Trailing to Malick Thiaw’s goal just before the interval, they re-emerged with a bit of purpose and Archie Gray would find the equaliser after a set piece.Newcastle simply went again and there was an inevitability about Jacob Ramsey’s winner, his first for the club. It was entirely merited from a Newcastle point of view. They had brought an unwanted statistic to London, having given up 19 points from winning positions; the most in the league. It was never going to be a tale of frustration for them. Eddie Howe called it one of Newcastle’s best performances of the season.The celebrations of the manager and his players in front of the travelling fans at full time stood in sharp contrast to the unhappiness of everybody connected to Spurs. The soundtrack to the evening from their point of view had been boos and more boos – and even more when Frank ventured on to the field after the final whistle.At the start of stoppage time, he had heard another chant from them: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” There was an end of days feel about it all. Where does Frank go from here? Next up is the derby against Arsenal on Sunday week.A word on Pochettino. He is preparing to lead USA at the World Cup this summer and it feels inconceivable that he could be available before then. After the finals would be a different story.View image in fullscreenJacob Ramsey’s neat finish gives Newcastle a winner that always seemed inevitable.Photograph: John Walton/PAWhen the dust settled, it did so on a grim detail for Frank and Spurs: they have won only twice in 17 league matches. It is relegation form. And, playing like this, with so little attacking intent and cohesion, it is impossible to say the club is not in a relegation battle.Howe had gone for pace and mobility in his front three; it was Anthony Elanga and Harvey Barnes either side of Anthony Gordon. Newcastle settled quickly and their control of the first half would be total. The assurance on the ball belonged to them, with Bruno Guimãraes always seeming to have an extra second in possession. The only blot for Newcastle would be a suspected hamstring injury for him towards the end.Joe Willock was a whisker away from the far corner with a low shot on nine minutes and the pressure from the visitors mounted inexorably. The Spurs support wanted something to get behind. Anything. There was zero from their team before the interval. Anxiety filled the void with Guglielmo Vicario a focus for it. When he punched weakly midway through the first half, there were howls from the South Stand. He was jittery on the ball, too.The snap‑shots in Spurs anguish built up. When players went back rather than forwards there were yells. Where were the options? When Vicario collected an easy ball, there were cheers. Pape Sarr and Xavi Simons would be booked for diving.There were boos from the Spurs fans after Willock ran on to a Ramsey pass on 44 minutes, cut inside Micky van de Ven and located the far corner with a cool finish. The goal would be disallowed when the video assistant referee spotted Willock was fractionally offside but Spurs’ reprieve did not last long. The breakthrough came when Thiaw rose unmarked to meet Elanga’s cross and Vicario could only pat the ball out weakly. Thiaw got to his own rebound ahead of Sarr and Gray. He wanted it more.View image in fullscreenMalick Thiaw pokes the ball over the line to give Newcastle the lead just before half-time.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesSpurs did restart with a bit of feeling. Mathys Tel, who had come on for Odobert, lashed high after good work from Gray. Sarr forced Nick Pope into a save. It was better and the equaliser came when Sarr headed back a Simons corner and there was Gray to volley home.Newcastle’s response was emphatic and, after Barnes was denied by a Van de Ven block, they restored their advantage. Conor Gallagher squandered a counter‑attacking opportunity with a poor pass and Newcastle came back up the Spurs right. It was Gordon with the low pass into the area and, with nobody in white close enough, Ramsey shot low and first time into the far corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Frank Ilett, the man who pledged never to visit a barber again untilManchester Unitedwon five matches in a row, may have been denied a viral haircut, but United’s resilience came to the fore here to deny the Hammers what would have been a deserved victory deep into added time.A studded finish from the fan favourite Tomas Soucek was cancelled out by an impressive, instinctive strike from Benjamin Sesko to leave this match honours even. United lacked energy and snap, West Ham saw two precious points fall away at the last; both sides will leave frustrated but not disconsolate. The Hammers remain in 18th place, United stay in fourth, their contrasting objectives remain in play.Okafor grabs comeback draw for Leeds as wasteful Chelsea’s bad habits returnRead more“The fans, the players and ourselves are disappointed to take this blow in the final moments of the match,” Nuno Espírito Santo said. “But we’ve been able to contain a team in a good moment. The way we started the second half was very positive. In the final moments we had two or three occasions with space in behind where we should have scored the second. Overall it was a very positive performance.”For Michael Carrick there was an admission that things could have gone better. “We were not quite at our best and you have to credit West Ham, but the boys are a bit frustrated in the dressing room and that’s a good sign,” he said. “We know how hard it is to build a run in this league, sometimes it comes naturally and there’s a spark, sometimes it’s maybe a little more stodgy. You’ve got to find the answers and find a way.”View image in fullscreenGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen despairs after West Ham concede late on.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCarrick mulled on the adjustments he had to make after Soucek turned home a low Jarrod Bowen cross to give West Ham the lead. If Sesko had come on earlier than the 69th minute might United have won the game? Carrick wasn’t sure, and certainly it was only after the clock passed 90 minutes – and Carrick had also replaced his full‑back Diogo Dalot with the forward Joshua Zirkzee – that United were able to finally put their hosts under pressure in their own box.With five of seven added minutes passed, an uneven cross from Bryan Mbeumo finally found Sesko, and the emerging forward picked out a flicked finish that deviously switched the angle of the ball to send it inside Mads Hermansen’s far post.For West Ham there were lots of positives to take, despite the ultimate result. Going up against the league’s form side, they showed no signs of self‑doubt and indeed relished the opportunitychance to put United to the test physically. Bowen was his usual self, a ball of energy who executed each moment to the best benefit of his team.View image in fullscreenTomas Soucek prods West Ham in front in the 50th minute.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoAaron Wan‑Bissaka and Crysencio Summerville were equally blurred presences on the pitch, getting up and down and causing their opponents endless trouble. Summerville might have had his sixth goal in six games with a fine first‑half effort, Wan‑Bissaka somehow managed to clear a goalbound Luke Shaw shot off the line with a jutted leg 22 minutes in.“We have been able to bounce back from disappointing moments before and the boys have always been able to react and compete,” Nuno said, looking forward. “There is no other way. Our standards are high.”For United there will be no diminishment of the enthusiasm that Carrick’s tenure has brought to the club and the fanbase. What’s more the interim boss, by taking the risk to score late on, will have further endeared himself as someone in tune with United’s traditions.There will be questions bubbling under, however, as to how sustainable their recent form will be. Matheus Cunha was ineffectual here and withdrawn for Sesko. Mbeumo was often to be found on the periphery of events too. Questions of quite how to knit up the team’s attacking talent at places where the battle off the ball is just as significant will have to be resolved over time.“I think it’s going to shift a little bit with different games as well as the situation within games and how you want to attack,” Carrick said. “It’s where the spaces are, what the game looks like. We probably didn’t quite get a bunch of it right, if we’re honest, for the first part of the game. And that happens, especially against a team going all out to stop you scoring.“So we’ve just got to find that way, but we kept going and mixed things up because we have got that flexibility, and I think it certainly helps to find different solutions …”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The lapses in concentration have piled up and there was another to add to the list after Stamford Bridge witnessed an inexplicable collapse against Leeds, who took another step towards staying up fighting back from 2-0 down to keep themselves six points above the bottom three.The turnaround was not on the cards when Cole Palmer, who had earlier collected his first assist in thePremier Leaguethis season, extended Chelsea’s advantage by scoring from the spot for the third time in two games. By the end, though, Liam Rosenior was ­watching the prospect of an eighth win in 10 games slip away. The implosion was staggering. Lukas Nmecha and Noah Okafor had capitalised on dreadful defending to make it 2-2 and, while Chelsea rallied, their hopes of a late winner ended when Palmer produced a contender for miss of the season.Rayan and Adli stage Bournemouth fightback against 10-man EvertonRead morePalmer was no more than two yards out when he connected with a cross from Moisés Caicedo and somehow fired over. Chelsea, who have dropped 17 points from winning positions, flailed at both ends. They kept Leeds at arm’s length for 67 minutes, only to reckon without the unlikely restorative powers of Jayden Bogle.The versatile 25-year-old defender sparked the comeback when he thundered into the area, drew a clumsy challenge from Caicedo and stepped aside for Nmecha to halve the deficit. More was to come. Josh Acheampong was flimsy, Bogle forced the error and Okafor was free to score for the ­second time in five days.“Six minutes of switching off,” Rosenior said. “We have to make sure we are switched on for 90 minutes. As simple as that. We should come away with three points. We haven’t because of two moments.”Rosenior’s wait for the perfect 90 minutes goes on. The frustration is that Chelsea were impressive for an hour. Palmer looked free and João Pedro scored again. “Some of our football was everything I wanted to see,” Rosenior said. “That makes it even more of a bitter pill to swallow.”Part of the problem is how ­Chelsea respond to setbacks. The loss of ­composure and shape at 2-1 was impossible to defend. Bogle ­handled ­during the buildup to the equaliser but he should never have been allowed to advance so far. Leeds simply wanted it more in that moment. Daniel Farke’s side were without key ­players but ­relished giving ­Chelsea a bloody nose for the second time since promotion.“Great vibes from everyone in the team,” Farke said. “I’m very proud of my players. I just have compliments for them for such a fightback. If you go 2-0 down, of course it can be a long night, but our players have this never‑say-die attitude.”Chelsea needed patience against a deep five-man defence. They looked for solutions with rotational movement in possession. Andrey Santos, who has been one of the benefi­ciaries of ­Rosenior ­replacing Maresca, dropped into defence to start moves, Marc Cucurella pushed into eye‑catching areas from left‑back and there was plenty of ­freedom for Palmer.Gaps started to appear after a quiet 20 minutes. The opener came when Santos threaded a pass through the lines. Palmer took it on the half-turn and released João Pedro, who collected his sixth goal in eight games by lifting a clever finish over Karl Darlow.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer, who scored in the first half, puts the ball over the open goal late on against Leeds.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesChelsea were glad to see Palmer and João Pedro on the same wavelength. They are a devastating duo when they are fit and on song. Palmer has three assists in all competitions this season and it is no coincidence that they have all been for João Pedro.It is not all one-way, though. João Pedro has won three ­penalties in two games for Palmer. The ­Brazilian works so hard. He raced on to a long ball in the 58th minute and got there before Jaka Bijol, who was ­penalised for a crazy shove on the Chelsea striker.Up stepped Palmer to send Darlow the wrong way from the spot. Leeds had offered nothing with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Anton Stach ­missing up front. It is rarely simple with Chelsea, though.Without a clean sheet in six games, they were rattled when Nmecha pulled a goal back from the spot. Leeds went direct. Bogle bustled into the area, held off Acheampong and pushed the ball away from Robert Sánchez. Okafor, on as a substitute, tapped into the empty net.Chelsea threw on Liam Delap. João Pedro headed just over the bar. Palmer produced his miss. Chelsea grasped for answers.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Not yet, anyway. Sixth place and momentum in the push for European qualification was the tantalising prize for beatingBournemouthbut, not for the first time at their plush new stadium, David Moyes’s team let it slip through their grasp.Andoni Iraola’s visitors extended their unbeatenPremier Leaguerun to six games courtesy of second-half headers from Rayan, the 19-year-old Brazilian who could well be their latest gem, and Amine Adli. Bournemouth’s goals and a red card for the Everton defender Jake O’Brien arrived in an eight-minute spell in which the hosts imploded to leave themselves without a home win since 6 December. Moyes’s side have collected 17 points from their last eight away games but only eight from the last nine at home. Their quest for Europe is floundering on home soil.West Ham United v Manchester United: Premier League – liveRead more“We missed a couple of good chances to get the second goal so we only have ourselves to blame, no one else,” said theEvertonmanager in a monosyllabic press conference that was over inside three minutes. His anger was palpable. Iliman Ndiaye had put Everton ahead from the penalty spot five minutes before the interval and Moyes’s side were superior when reduced to 10 men. But the clinical touch and the resolute defending that Everton routinely show on the road was absent once again.Thierno Barry squandered two gilt-edged chances while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had a goal-bound drive blocked by the impressive James Hill. Both teams were responsible for a turgid, laboured opening half hour in which a disallowed goal by the offside Ndiaye was the only incident of note.Mercifully, the contest improved after Djordje Petrovic spilled James Garner’s ambitious free-kick into the path of Barry. The striker had to react sharply but, unmarked inside the six-yard box, he sliced woefully wide. European football would be a considerable achievement by Moyes under any circumstances this season, but even more so given the painful lack of quality from Barry and Beto.The miss did spark the home team into life, however. A minute later Ndiaye met Dewsbury-Hall’s cross with a first time effort that Petrovic turned on to a post. Everton were then presented with a penalty when Rayan was harried off the ball by Jarrad Branthwaite and unwittingly clipped the defender inside the area. Ndiaye swept the resulting spot-kick inside Petrovic’s right hand post.View image in fullscreenJanuary signing Rayan scores for the second successive game for Bournemouth.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersEverton started the second half strongly but Barry failed to convert a delightful pass from Ndiaye, his tame effort allowing Álex Jiménez to block, and Dewsbury-Hall was denied following a mistake by Petrovic. Barry was distraught on the bench after being withdrawn shortly afterwards. He could have no complaints with Moyes’s decision.Adrien Truffert served notice of Bournemouth’s belated improvement with a long-range drive that fizzed past Jordan Pickford’s far post. The left back’s effort arrived between two penalty appeals by the visitors, for a handball by Garner before the interval and a trip by Vitalii Mykolenko on Rayan, and though neither were given Iraoli’s players never lost focus. Rayan atoned for Everton’s penalty by scoring for the second game in succession for his new club. Truffert sent a cross over Vitalii Mykolenko and the winger, the recent £24.7m signing from Vasco da Gama, soared at the back post to beat Pickford with an emphatic header.Three minutes later, with Everton again unconvincing in the air, Bournemouth were ahead. Pickford and his defenders were all at sea when Alex Scott delivered a free-kick into the Everton area. Hill headed across goal for Adli to steer a diving header into an empty net and, despite Enes Unal being in an offside position when the free-kick was taken, the winner stood.O’Brien’s straight red for colliding into Adli and denying a clear goalscoring opportunity completed Everton’s costly meltdown.“I’m very happy with the result,” said Iraola. “To be honest it wasn’t our best performance but football is like this. A draw would have been a fair result but we found a way.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I was told recently that he has the best win record of any Scotland coach in the professional era. Sir Ian McGeechan had two spells and I think Gregor sits above that. The way he has coached the attack they have, and the way they move the ball, when they do that, they look terrific.“I have immense respect for him as a coach and I find it surprising that people are not spending more time talking about Scotland rather than not supporting their coach. I think he’s a phenomenal coach and they should spend more time supporting him.”England have won only once at Murrayfield since 2016 but are on a run of 12 successive victories. Borthwick has kept changes to his side to a minimum, restoringMaro Itojeto the captaincy, promoting Luke Cowan-Dickie to start at hooker to maximise Jamie George’s strengths of the bench but largely keeping faith with the team who thumped Wales last week.With Fin Smith replacing namesake Marcus on the bench, England appear light on three-quarters cover but Ben Earl has regularly been deployed at centre while Henry Pollock will continue to have “freedom to roam” when he comes on as a replacement.View image in fullscreenLuke Cowan-Dickie will start at hooker against Scotland.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“[Henry’s] got incredible pace and super handling skills and you see not just his ability to make breaks, but how he supports breaks,” Borthwick said. “How often do you see him on somebody’s shoulder taking an offload and then running on and scoring or potentially giving another offload for somebody else to score? His skill set and the way he plays the game is less within a structure and more within having freedom to roam to go and find the ball and find where he needs to be. I’m very confident with him in that position.”Borthwick also believes his side is well equipped to deal with any Scottish skullduggery at Murrayfield, with previous Calcutta Cups featuring a tunnel bust-up involving Ryan Wilson, George Ford and Owen Farrell in 2018 as well as bagpipers encroaching on England’s half in the warmup.“This is a brilliant place to play rugby, against a very good team,” the England head coach said. “If you go back, how have I, how have we approached it? How exciting is this, another brilliant international in this fantastic championship and another step in the development of this team and a great challenge playing against a Scotland team who have a lot of top quality players in it.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamMaro ItojeSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal and Manchester United are among eight teams vying to join Barcelona, Lyon, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, who automatically qualified for the quarter-finals as the top four in the league phase.As in the men’s competition, a switch from a group stage to the league format has been made. However, with the UWCL group stage having been introduced only for the 2021-22 season, there was scepticism about a change coming so soon, with the group stage viewed as a big step forward and in its relative infancy.WSL talking points: Arsenal punish City and Chelsea get into the grooveRead moreThere are few surprises in the playoffs, given three of the four ties taking place this week and next bring together teams who met during the league phase, with four teams seeded and four teams unseeded for the draw, but the new format has yielded plenty of positives.Statistically, its success is clear, with Uefa data showing a 27% rise in the number of matches decided by a single goal and a 16% increase in the number featuring goals from both teams compared with the same stage last season. The win rate for the team who scored first is down from 88% to 61% and the lowest-ranked teams in the league phase took an average of 1.1 points a game compared with 0.6 last season.OH Leuven’s midfielder Julie Biesmans spoke of the significance of the format for lower-ranked sides. “For teams like us the new format is really interesting, because you play against different opponents, and mostly, when there is a group stage, you already kind of know who is going to finish first or second,” she said. “This [format] gave us a bigger chance to actually go through, and that’s what happened, even if we didn’t think about it, we didn’t dream about it.”The league phasewent to the wire, with seven of the nine games in the final round having some form of jeopardy. The audience has grown, with cumulative live viewership reaching 13.5 million, a figure reached only during the final between Arsenal and Barcelona last season.Statistics don’t always present the truest picture but they help shape it, and come the end of the competition we will be able to reflect on the season of change and draw conclusions about how successful the switch to the format deemed best for the men’s game has been.On Wednesday, Arsenal play at Leuven, the competition’s lowest-ranked remaining side, with Renée Slegers’s team hoping to replicate the performance that yielded a3-0 win away to the Belgian sidein December. Arsenal are coming out of an intense period, with winsagainst ChelseaandManchester Citysandwiching their Champions Cup victory. They have weathered the impact of high-intensity games in quick succession and, in theory, beating Leuven should be straightforward. However, Leuven’s record in the league phase demonstrates their potential threat, with Arno Van den Abbeel’s team beating Twente and securing draws against Paris FC, Roma and Paris Saint-Germain.View image in fullscreenFridolina Rolfö celebrates her winner in October against Atlético Madrid, who meet Manchester United again this week.Photograph: Diego Souto/Getty ImagesLater on Wednesday, Real Madrid host Paris FC, the Spanish side having had to rely on a Caroline Weir goal in the eighth minute of added time to cancel out Lorena Azzaro’s first-half penalty when the teams met in November.On Thursday Wolfsburg play Juventus in the only new tie. The Italian side sit third in Serie A, a point behind Inter but six behind the leaders, Roma, but have strung together five back-to-back wins in all competitions since their loss to Inter on 18 January. Wolfsburg have had their 2026 interrupted by postponements owing to poor pitch conditions and have played only one game, a 2-1 win over Köln, since beating Hamburg on 21 December.Manchester United travel to the Spanish capital for a second meeting with Atlético Madrid on the same night, Fridolina Rolfö’s goal having been the difference in atight encounterin Madrid in October. Marc Skinner’s side were forced to work hard to earn their 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday and Thursday kickstarts a fierce run of fixtures, with London City Lionesses their opposition between the two legs against Atlético, after which they face back-to-back games against Chelsea, in the fifth round of the FA Cup and League Cup final, to test the strength and depth of their squad.The playoffs add games that many teams – the Women’s Super League clubs in particular – could probably do without but will they add more exciting data points and present some interesting games before the tastier quarter-finals? We will see.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fans are fully justified to react the way they did at the end.“I was very strong on the point at half-time that the game hadn’t been won. I was pleased with the first half but it’s certainly not a positive. There are no positives to take because of the second half. None at all.“I can’t explain what happened. I have spoken to the players and there is a sense of anger but I won’t elaborate on that until I’ve had time to reflect more.”With only goal difference now separating City from the bottom three, King said: “I want to apologise for that last half an hour because it wasn’t acceptable. You can’t hide away from anything. It’s going to be difficult to bounce back from that.”While City peer anxiously over their shoulders, Southampton are now within touching distance of the playoffs after Eckert’s tactical and personnel tweaks sparked a dramatic upturn in performance. “At half-time, we reset,” he said.“I asked the players to make a decision and that was if they wanted to have a proper go. In fairness, they had already made that decision. I don’t have an explanation for what happened during the first half. But we bounced back. It was a crazy night.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The winners of those ties would then meet at Wembley as normal to play for promotion to the Premier League.The EFL is understood to be confident that the change will be approved, having consulted widely with the clubs since the idea was proposed at a Championship divisional meeting in September.The idea of expanding the playoffs has been discussed in EFL circles before without gaining sufficient traction.The EFL is understood to have gained the backing of its rights holder Sky Sports, which has welcomed the prospect of two extra games given the drama and jeopardy of the playoffs, one of the highlights of the club season.If successful the new format could be extended to League One and League Two in subsequent seasons.The FA and EFL declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Buttler said that McCullum is actually “as sharp a coach as I’ve ever worked with”, and that “everyone in the dressing room knows the truth”.While McCullum has been sceptical about the overuse of data in cricket he has recently adopted the use of walkie-talkies to relay information from the team’s analysts to their support staff and on to the pitch during matches, and Buttler insisted he has always been more involved in the action than it appears.England’s habit of ‘winning ugly’ in tight games gives them T20 World Cup hopeRead more“That’s obviously the energy he wants to have, to allow guys to feel less pressure in a game that has a lot of pressure,” Buttler said. “So that image is important to him. But don’t mistake that for someone whose mind is relaxed and who’s not got his finger on the pulse. There is stuff that goes on behind closed doors that you guys aren’t party to. You have to make a judgment from what you see. Everyone in the dressing room knows the truth.“Baz can sit with his feet up and sunglasses on and look very relaxed, but he’s as sharp a coach as I’ve ever worked with. He doesn’t miss a beat.”England have named their team for the second game of their T20 World Cup campaign, against West Indies in Mumbai on Wednesday. Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer have been backed to come good after disappointing displaysagainst Nepal in their opener, but Luke Wood has paid the price for an error-strewn final over and lost his place to Jamie Overton.The 19 runs Rashid conceded in the 14th over of Nepal’s chase made it the joint 10th most expensive of his 19-year, 138-game internationalTwenty20career. Archer meanwhile bowled the single most expensive over of the game, his last, which brought one wicket, two wides, three sixes and 22 runs in all and during which the chances of Nepalese victory according to statistical modelling rocketed from 20.25% just before his first delivery to 60.66% after his last.Wood’s final over immediately followed it: he bowled three wides, conceded 14 runs, and bumped Nepal’s victory chances up to 79.7%, beforeSam Curran turned the tidein the 40th over of the match to secure English victory by a four-run margin.View image in fullscreenAdil Rashid conceded 19 runs in one over against Nepal, one of the most expensive overs of his career.Photograph: Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesBut Buttler said that the experience Rashid and Archer can call on would make it “pretty easy” for them to come back from a bruising outing for a key game in Group C. West Indies also won their first match, and whoever prevails would take a giant stride towards qualifying for the Super Eights with two group games still to play.“We’re all accepting of how T20 cricket works,” Buttler said. “The batters are going to come after you and be aggressive. Experienced players, talking about Jofra and Adil, have seen it all before. They’re not immune to people playing well against them. That’s allowed. We try our best and want to perform really well, but every other country and every other player that we play against is wanting to do the same. That’s T20 cricket. You start again tomorrow, nought for nought, and it’s a new game.”With Overton’s return the team to face West Indies contains seven of the XI who werethrashed at the Wankhede last Februaryin the final game of England’s white-ball tour of India, their last bilateral series under Buttler’s captaincy. But there has been a shift in the side’s balance in the past 12 months, notably with the adoption of a second specialist spinner in Liam Dawson.Quick GuidePakistan dispatch USAShowPakistan warmed up for their blockbuster T20 World Cup clash against India with a 32-run win against USA on Tuesday then declared they were \"confident\" of taking down their bitter rivals.The Group A win was a boost for Pakistan before the high-octane clash with the defending champions in Colombo on Sunday, now back on after the Islamabad government called off a boycott 24 hours previously.The opener Sahibzada Farhan, who top-scored with 73, said: \"The match is on and we are in a confident mood.\"Pakistan have a dismal record against India in International Cricket Council tournaments, winning only once in eight encounters in T20 World Cups and have lost all eight times that the sides have met in the 50-over World Cup.In the T20 Asian Cup last year, India beat Pakistan three times on their way to lifting the trophy in Dubai.The spinner Tariq Usman, who took three for 27 against USA, said those stats did not bother him. \"We used to beat India in the 1990s and before so don’t count the recent record or only the ICC event record, we used to win against them frequently,\" he said.Farhan promised: \"This time it will be different and we will give a strong performance. We lost all three matches including the final to India in the Asia Cup but they were not one-sided.\"Farhan said two wins out of two in the World Cup, the first was against the Netherlands on Saturday, had kick-started Pakistan’s campaign.Pakistan came into the tournament having beaten Australia 3-0 in a home T20 series and Fargan said the mood around the camp was very positive.\"Wins always give you confidence and we will take this confidence into Sunday’s game and we assure you we will be a better side come Sunday,\" he said.India will face a second Group A match against Namibia on Thursday in New Delhi before flying to Sri Lanka. It means a quick turnaround for the match on Sunday, the biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket.Agence France-PresseWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“There were definitely learnings from that series,” Buttler said. “I would say we attacked with pace a lot in that tour. We had some exceptionally fast bowlers – Mark Wood, Jofra, Brydon Carse was there – but it’s clear that pace isn’t the only answer.“I just look at the side we have at the moment, there’s a nicely balanced bowling attack. If you need a lot of spin, there’s a lot of spin overs in the group. If you need pace, it’s there. If you need nous and skill and slower balls, it’s there. I think that’s a really nice, balanced attack, not just trying to blow teams away with pace.”Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamBrendon McCullumT20 World Cup 2026T20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The schools watchdog Ofsted will inspect how schools implement the policy.This week the NASUWT teaching union urged the government to introduce a statutory requirement – rather than just guidance – for schools to lock away pupils’ mobile phones for the whole school day.The study provides the first analysis of the economic impact of smartphone policies in schools and is based on data drawn from a nationally representative sample of 20 schools inEngland, 13 of which have “restrictive” policies and seven “permissive” policies.According to the research, restrictive policies require phones to be turned off and hidden in a school bag or handed in to reception throughout the school day, while permissive policies allow use during breaks and lunchtime.The self-reported data showed that on average, schools with restrictive policies spend 102 hours – or the full-time equivalent of 3.1 staff a week overall – on implementing policies.Schools with permissive policies spend slightly more time on average – 108 hours or the full-time equivalent of 3.3 staff a week – potentially costing £94 per pupil per school year more than more restrictive policies.Schools in England should be phone-free all day, education secretary saysRead moreProf Victoria Goodyear, of the University of Birmingham, who is chief investigator of the Smart Schools Study, said: “School phone policies, whether permissive or restrictive, are a huge drain on a school to enforce.“The high proportions of teacher time spent managing phone use or phone-related behaviours during the school day is potentially being diverted away from other types of wellbeing-promoting activities, such as pastoral support or extracurricular activities.“We therefore need new ways of approaching adolescent smartphone use in schools.”Prof Miranda Pallan, one of the report’s authors, said: “It is unknown how a statutory ban may impact on the staff burden of dealing with phones.“There will be different ways of implementing a statutory ban such as handing in phones, pouches, or complete site bans, which will each have a different impact on staff time and school resources.“Even with a ban, there will be breaches that will need to be dealt with, which will still place a burden on staff time.”Data from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology shows 99.9% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools have mobile phone policies. However, 58% of secondary school pupils reported phones being used without permission in some lessons, rising to 65% among key stage four pupils.The NASUWT general secretary, Matt Wrack, said: “From interrupted learning and reduced concentration to confrontations when staff ask pupils to hand over devices, the situation has reached a critical point. Schools cannot be expected to manage this alone while the government offers no meaningful support.”Sarah Hannafin, the head of policy at the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We recognise that effective enforcement activity can be time-consuming, but as parents’ and pupils’ expectations about being able to access their phone in school hours change, and bans become the norm, we hope the need for such activity will be reduced.”Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We would like to see funding support provided to schools for the safe and secure storage of mobile phones, such as storage lockers or locked pouches.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Mobile phones have no place in classrooms. Without the distraction, children learn better and teachers can teach.“Our guidance helps schools implement phone-free policies effectively, with practical case studies showing how schools across the country are making this work without it becoming a burden on staff time.”Explore more on these topicsSecondary schoolsSchoolsTeachingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The study aimed to identify the effect of exercise across all ages, and in pregnant women and new mothers. The exercises ranged from resistance training and aerobic workouts to mind-body activities such as yoga and tai chi.Forms of aerobic exercise that boosted the heart rate had the biggest impact on depression, with resistance training and yoga having a lesser effect. A similar trend was seen for anxiety but the impact was smaller, the study found.Further benefits were seen in people who took part in group exercise or supervised activities, the researchers write in theBritish Journal of Sports Medicine. This suggests socialising plays “a crucial role in the antidepressant effects of exercise”, Munro said.According to the World Health Organization, more than 280 million people worldwide have depression and 301 million have anxiety disorders. In the UK and elsewhere, cases haverisen sharplyamong 16- to 24-year-olds in the past decade. About15 to 20%of new mothers experience depression and anxiety in the first year after giving birth.Dr Brendon Stubbs, who studies exercise and mental health at King’s College London, urged caution over the findings because they relied heavily on mild cases.“For people with mild or subclinical symptoms, exercise can reasonably be considered a frontline treatment option,” he said. “However, there is no evidence from this study, or from the wider literature, to suggest that people should change or discontinue established treatments such as psychotherapy or medication.”For many people with severe depression, even basic daily activities could be extremely challenging, he added, and their symptoms often needed to improve before they could attempt exercise.Prof Michael Bloomfield, a psychiatrist at UCL, said: “It’s good news that group exercise such as Zumba can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression for some people, likely through a mix of physical activity, social connection, fun, dance and routine, and the evidence supports it as a potential useful adjunct to care.”But he said for many people with more severe depression, taking part in energetic group activities was unrealistic. “For that reason, exercise should be seen as a complement to, not a replacement for, evidence-based treatments such as psychological therapies and medication where these are clinically indicated,” Bloomfield said.Explore more on these topicsMental healthDepressionAnxietyHealthFitnessRunningSwimmingnewsShareReuse this content"

A European robin has taken up residence in the neighbourhood, which is sandwiched between two industrial areas with warehouses and railway lines and, a few blocks away, port facilities on the St Lawrence River.Ron Vandebeek from Ottawa, Ontario, is here on a frigid February morning hoping to see the rare bird, which was first spotted at the beginning of January.This is thefirst recorded sightingof a European robin in Canada, and only the fifth or sixth in North America. That it has taken up residence in Quebec is a source of delight but also consternation for birders. How did it travel thousands of kilometres from its home territory, and will it survive a very cold Montréal winter?The bird’snormal home rangeis western Europe, from Scotland to Turkey and as far north as Sweden during breeding season, and visiting Iceland on a seasonal migration stop.“Did it island hop from Iceland to Greenland to here?” Vandebeek wonders. “That’s a lot of hopping.”The new local celebrity has brought hundreds of birdwatchers to witness this “rare bird” or “vagrant”, as birds outside their normal territory are called.View image in fullscreen‘It’s neat to see a bird totally out of its environment’: Montreal’s celebrity European robin.Photograph: Courtesy of  Sabrina Jacob/eBird QuebecWhile he’s waiting, Vandebeek is joined by others, including Serge Benoît of Laval, Quebec. Benoît says it is worth making the effort to see such a curiosity.“It’s a very rare bird and it’s the first time it’s been reported in all ofCanada. We’ve never seen it before. So, when a bird is very rare, we’ll travel farther.”Vandebeek is the first to spot the bird as it alights on a platform feeder set high in a hedge. With its striking orange breast feathers, it is easy to identify. It seems unfazed by the excitement and whirr of digital cameras, perhaps having adapted to its celebrity status after drawing hundreds of birdwatchers over the past weeks.The European robin is a very distinctive bird, says Ted Floyd, the editor of the American Birding Association’s (ABA) Birding Magazine, and that has made it easier to spot.These birds are getting here on boats and that’s just something that resourceful robins are doingMaggie MacPherson, Trent University“A lot of the really rare birds that show up in North America are pretty drab and brown and boring so they’re easily overlooked,” he says. “But the European robin is one of the most iconic birds on Earth and American birders know what it looks like. So they would have noticed that.”“Oh, it’s beautiful,” says one man, as he snaps some photos using a long-range lens.Montrealer Valéry Landry is here on her second attempt to spot the robin. This time, her patience is rewarded. “I was lucky,” she says. “In 10 minutes, he was there.”The bird is also lucky. Montréal is having itscoldest winterin four years, with temperatures one January weekend dropping to -25C. While its usual diet consists of insects, it is omnivorous when required, and bird fans are ensuring it has enough to eat.Sheldon Harvey of Bird Protection Quebec says as long as it can find sustenance, it should survive. “For that type of bird, it’s really driven by food,” he says. “As long as they can find food, their metabolism will keep them through the cold.”Bird experts are puzzled and delighted by the bird’s arrival.“It’s wild for a lot of reasons,” says Maggie MacPherson, an evolutionary ecologist who studies bird ranges at Trent University in Ontario. If the European robin migrates at all, it only travels short distances, she says, making it even less likely that it would make such a long journey of its own accord. “That makes this sighting just amazing,” she says.The first North American sighting of a European robin was in Pennsylvania in 2015. “It was such a shocking find that it took the ABA checklist committee three years to approve it,” says Floyd. “The question that arose was did it really get here on its own or could it have gotten out of an aviary or a private collection?”The two leading theories as to how this European robin arrived are that it either caught a ride on a container ship all the way to the Port of Montréal or was caught in a storm that blew it there.‘We thought they would ignore us’: how humans are changing the way raptors behaveRead moreMacPherson thinks it is more likely that it was caught up in an autumn storm, and that it has probably been in the area since last autumn, and not identified until January.“It was part of a population that was migratory, got to the coast and then got swept up in a storm that actually carried it across the ocean,” she theorises. Or a storm could have swept it out to sea, she says, where it boarded a ship bound for Montréal.Although researchers are still investigating changes in storm incidence and severity due to the climate crisis,North Atlantic stormsare predicted to change direction withincreasing wind speeds. Those changes could mean more unlikely birds visiting North America, says MacPherson, and also more bird deaths as they are caught in severe storms.“I think it’s not out of the question that if we’re having more storms, we could get more vagrants that are being swept up in this storm situation, which can happen both in fall and in spring migration.”The boat theory is also not far-fetched because birds are known to use human-made infrastructure. Warblers use oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico as rest stops during migration, MacPherson says. In Florida, European robins have been spotted on cruise ships, says Floyd. “We actually know they’re coming on cruise ships because people are photographing them on cruise ships. So these birds are getting here on boats and that’s just something that resourceful robins are doing.”View image in fullscreenIn 2008, a white-crowned sparrow native to North America was seen in the UK.Photograph: David Tipling/AlamyThere has been a sharp increase inrare bird sightingsin the past decade, says Floyd. That does not necessarily mean more rare birds, as there are more birdwatchers. “There are many, many more people watching birds with really good cameras and social networks where they are discussing their findings,” he says.The same phenomenon has also been spotted in reverse, with native American birds arriving in Europe. In 2008, a white-crowned sparrow native to North Americadrew crowds of birdwatchers in North Norfolkin England.Other recent celebrity vagrants in Canada include ataiga flycatcheridentified in Vancouver in December, another first for the country, and aSteller’s sea eagle, first spotted in December 2024, which made its home in a Newfoundland park.MacPherson thinks this robin is a young adult of about two years old; the species has a lifespan of five to eight years. It is not impossible it will spend the remainder of its life in the Montréal area.“We always feel kinda bad when a solo bird of a species shows up,” says Harvey. “Other birds that have shown up like this robin, they tend to suddenly disappear. We don’t know where they go or what happens to them.”There are more birds new to Quebec as they adapt their range to the climate crisis, he adds. “But when something really bizarre like this happens, you just go out, you enjoy it and you know that’s all you can do.”Vandebeek now has another bird to add to his list of 5,000 sightings, and considers this a morning well spent. “It’s neat to see a bird totally out of its environment,” he says.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionCanadaAmericasAnimalsWildlifeClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I was really surprised with how many students turned up not just from the LSE but from other universities as well.”Yang, who was studying a masters in economics at the time, said the first meeting was held on a “bit of shoestring”, dependent on volunteers and “some real acts of kindness” from family and friends as well as some of the LSE’s leading academics.“It was very volunteer led,” she said. “My dad, bless him, helped out by doing some filming … and we had some of the leading professors helping out. [The South Korean economist and academic] Ha-Joon Chang arrived early and helped us make name tags.”Chang, now a leading author and professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, said the launch came after decades when the neo-classical school of economics had come to dominate universities “like Catholic theology in medieval Europe … a doctrine that fundamentally defines the way humanity sees the world”.View image in fullscreen‘Rethinking Economics has exposed the staggering deficiency in the way economists are educated’, says economist Ha-Joon Chang.Photograph: PR image“By demanding that economics education should be more pluralist, more ethically conscientious, more historically aware, and more oriented towards the real world, Rethinking Economics has exposed the staggering deficiency in the way economists are educated and induced some significant, albeit woefully insufficient changes in economics teaching around the world,” he said.Rethinking Economics has blossomed since the first meeting and now has thousands of members, including several eminent economists, across more than 40 countries.According to its communications lead, Sara Mahdi, its aim is to make economics education “plural, critical, decolonised and historically grounded” rather than “dominated by a single framework presented as ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’”.“We are building an international movement of young people who are organising, educating and agitating for an economics that takes account of the real world we see around us,” she said. “One that portrays the economy as embedded in ecology, power, institutions, history and inequality, and treats competing economic theories and methods as legitimate, not marginal to a sort of classical, almost mathematical view, which has been dominant in many institutions for decades.”Mahdi, a degrowth, economics and anthropology graduate from University College London and the Autonomous University of Barcelona, says the group has secured tangible changes in the way economics is taught – from full programme redesigns to the introduction of new core modules – at scores of institutions.View image in fullscreen‘We are building an international movement of young people who are organising, educating and agitating for an economics that takes account of the real world we see around us,’ says Sara Mahdi.Photograph: PR image“Since 2019 alone the movement has supported and recorded more than 80 campaign wins in universities across 35 countries, including 23 major curriculum reforms, impacting tens of thousands of students,” she said. “These are the kinds of reforms that don’t just add ‘one optional lecture’, they reshape what students learn as mainstream economics.”Among the changes highlighted are the launch of a politics, philosophy and economics course at Goldsmiths, University of London in 2014, an interdisciplinary programme at the University of Lille in France in 2020, and an economics and society undergraduate programme and public sector economics masters programme at Leiden University in the Netherlands in 2023.One of Rethinking Economics’s most active groups is based in South Africa, where the campaign grew out of a wider student protest movement calling for greater access to higher education for poorer communities.The junior programme officer at Rethinking Economics for Africa, Amaarah Garda, said what started as a protest about fees had become a broader critique of the academic system and its colonial outlook.View image in fullscreenStudent organisers for the seventh Rethinking Economics for Africa (Refa) festival in Johannesburg in 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of RefaInitially, universities refused to change mainstream economics teaching, so the campaign changed tack.“We have had to carve out our own progressive courses and events at these universities,” Garda said. “So it is not that everyone who does economics is exposed to a more progressive vision, but those courses are now available.”The movement was growing, she said, as students sought answers to the issues confronting them in the news and their day-to-day lives, from how war economies work to what is being discussed at UN climate talks.View image in fullscreenA Rethinking Economics gathering in Zambia.Photograph: PR Image“In South Africa, and perhaps globally, we can see that our students are finding these ideas not just interesting but more and more urgent given the multiple crisis that we are facing,” she said. “They are approaching us to explain topics because they can see how critical they are to society and they cannot get that information through their usual courses.”Many academics have welcomed the space the campaign has opened up.Clara Mattei, a professor of economics at the University of Tulsa in the US and president of the Forum for Real Economic Emancipation (Free), said her group was collaborating with students from Rethinking Economics to “improve economic education and make it a useful tool for expanding economic agency among the general public”.She said the current economic system was “showing its most violent face … with rampant militarism and unprecedented, obscene levels of inequality with four people owning more wealth than four billion people”.View image in fullscreenClara Mattei, a professor of economics at the University of Tulsa in the US, said her group was collaborating with students from Rethinking Economics to improve economic education.Photograph: PR IMAGE“It is urgent that the economics discipline learn to understand these issues as systemic features of our capitalist economy rather than as the result of market imperfections or crony capitalism,” she said, adding that students such as those involved in Rethinking Economics were “pushing toward more courageous frameworks within the economic tradition … to prioritise the logic of need over the logic of profit”.Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US, said Rethinking Economics was forcing established economists to ask the basic questions that many had been trained to overlook.She said there were still power structures within institutions, thinktanks and journals that wanted to maintain a narrower, restricted view of economics, but that the campaign was making headway.“It is a battle, but what I really appreciate about this group is that they go about things in a thoughtful way, they are willing to hear people from the other side.”She said she had spoken to Rethinking Economics groups around the world.“They bring in all kinds of people, not just economists and students but activists and others together, and they look at the same questions in such different ways … I have actually learned a lot from them … It has made me realise that economics is too important to be left to economists.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsBeyond growthGlobal economyHigher

Round 2 for the brawling badgersAbbeydale, Sheffield:I’m genuinely scared when I wake at 2am to the sound of screaming. Then I see two male badgers in an almighty scrapEd DouglasTue 10 Feb 2026 00.30 ESTShareFast asleep, my dreamworld takes an unexpected swerve as raucous screaming erupts outside the open bedroom window. For a moment, I assume this is imagined, some emotional outburst from my subconscious. Then I realise that I’m awake. This is real. I check the time: 2am. The screaming continues. In fact, it’s now louder and somehow more intense. The back of the house is woodland, and noises off are common enough. A fox barking. Robin song that eases those anxious, wakeful stretches of the night. But this is something else altogether. This is violence.My heart is racing now. I fear someone is being attacked, and from the pitch of the screaming, a woman. Mercifully, I soon discount this. My startled mind then suggests a catfight, but the sound I’m hearing is too big for that. So, despite the freezing cold beyond the duvet, I hop out of bed, pull back a curtain and stick my head outside.Below me, about 20 feet away, what seem to be two large carpet bags are going at it. The streetlight is too dim to allow much colour into the scene, but the carpet bags seem grey. One of them disengages and moves rapidly away from the house; the other carpet bag pauses briefly and then follows. I see now, of course, that these are not carpet bags, but badgers. The badger running away stops and almost at once so does the other. Then, simultaneously, they turn and start running in the opposite direction, back towards the house. This happens a couple more times, back and forth. Then they start scrapping again.By now, I’ve had enough. I’m too cold. “Do you mind?” I call down. The badgers freeze, lift their faces towards me, and then bolt for the woods.Early February is a lively time for badgers. It is when cubs are born and females often mate soon after. Perhaps that’s why these males are in a stew, since it is mostly boars that fight, and older boars most of all. Plus, badger clans are matriarchies, and right now the females have better things to do.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024, is available now atguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentCountry diaryRural affairsAnimalsWildlifeWinterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include allegations of bugging, phone tapping, hacking and the “blagging” of documents.As well as Lawrence, theclaimants include Prince Harry, Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, and the actorsElizabeth Hurleyand Sadie Frost. ANL denies all the claims.Doreen Lawrence tells court she felt ‘taken for a fool’ by Daily Mail publisherRead moreDacre said his “heart bleeds” for Lawrence. However, he said it was “inconceivable to me” that “lurid allegations” that she was targeted with landline tapping, hacking and electronic surveillance were anything other than preposterous.He also said one of the articles Lawrence is complaining about, revealing that the then home secretary Jack Straw was ordering a public inquiry into her son’s murder, was given to Dacre personally by Straw.“We were on friendly terms (having been students together at Leeds University) and occasionally had lunch or dinner,” Dacre said in a written submission. “At some stage in July 1997 Mr Straw called me to a meeting and volunteered the information that he was setting up an inquiry.”The Daily Mail had a long-running campaign to bring Stephen Lawrence’s killers to justice. In February 1997, it ran a front page labelling five men – Gary Dobson, Neil Acourt, Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris – as “murderers”, challenging them to sue for libel.“Throughout my 26-year editorship, [the Stephen Lawrence campaign], of all my countless campaigns, many of which made a significant contribution to the public weal, is the campaign of which I am most proud and to which I devoted the most space,” Dacre said.“If I had concerns about a story raised in conferences then I would be very forceful in making it abundantly clear that its provenance should be interrogated by the hierarchy. A favourite phrase of mine was ‘I smell danger here’. For example, if a story was worrying, distasteful, immoral, incredible, potentially libellous or in contempt of court or could have involved a breach of the editors’ code.”In court, David Sherborne, the lead barrister for the claimants, told Dacre that a box had been found in the office of the Daily Mail’s managing editor. It contained records of payments to private investigators, including the criminal private investigator Steve Whittamore, amounting to more than £3m.Prince Harry v the Daily Mail: high-stakes trial could have profound effects on UK mediaRead moreSherborne repeatedly showed Dacre invoices that he suggested showed ANL journalists obtaining car records, ex-directory phone numbers and criminal record checks. He put it to Dacre that executives had signed off the payments.While Dacre said he would need to see what stories the payments related to, he said most appeared to relate to finding addresses and phone numbers and that the law allowed journalists to make certain inquiries “in the public interest”.Dacre said the information commissioner had ruled that there was “no evidence” that his journalists had asked private investigators to act illegally.He said he “brought the shutters down” on the use of what he called “inquiry agents” after evidence emerged of their widespread deployment across newspapers, banning his journalists from using them in 2007.Dacre also said a “sense of proportion is required” because the use of inquiry agent searches should not be compared to the allegations of bugging, tapping and hacking that had been made by the claimants.Associated’s legal team said in written submissions that all the stories cited by the claimants had been obtained “entirely legitimately from information variously provided by contacts of the journalists responsible”.Associated has said almost a “full roster” of journalists are “lining up to give evidence addressing the allegations against them”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsPaul DacreDoreen LawrenceStephen LawrenceAssociated NewspapersNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was sentenced to a community payback order, and placed on the sex offender register.In his statement, Doyle said: “I want to apologise for my past association with Sean Morton. His offences were vile and I completely condemn the actions for which he was rightly convicted. My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted by these crimes.“At the point of my campaigning support, Morton repeatedly asserted to all those who knew him his innocence, including initially in court. He later changed his plea in court to guilty. To have not ceased support ahead of a judicial conclusion was a clear error of judgment for which I apologise unreservedly.”Doyle said he had “extremely limited” subsequent contact with Morton, and had “not seen or spoken to him in years”. Doyle said he had seen Morton once “to check on his welfare after concerns were raised through others”.He added: “I am sorry about the mistakes I have made. I will not be taking the Labour whip.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said: “Keir Starmer handed a peerage to Matthew Doyle despite knowing about his ongoing friendship with a man charged with child sex crimes.“The prime minister has now suspended the whip, but he must come clean about what he was told before making this appointment. We won’t let this go.”Starmer has denied claims that he knew about Doyle’s relationship with Morton.Regarding Duncan-Glancy, a Scottish Labour spokesperson, said: “All complaints are assessed thoroughly in line with our rules and procedures.”Get in touchContact Guardian Politics about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

He called on the government and businesses to work together to tackle the issue, arguing that it was damaging the UK’s standing on the world stage.“We cannot afford to be a country that lets the next generation languish on the sideline,” Prasad said at an event in London hosted by the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank, adding that the government must stop “tinkering at the edges” of the problem and make bold changes to get more people into work.More than 9 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK are classed as economically inactive, meaning they are not actively looking for work or available to start a job. This includes 2.9 million people aged 16 to 24, with almost a million young people not in education, employment or training, a 26% increase from pre-pandemic levels.Analysis by the thinktank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) suggests more than 700,000 university graduates are out of work and claiming welfare benefits. In December, the government announced an £820m funding package to help more young people into work or on to learning schemes.Prasad said there were “myriad reasons” for many people being economically inactive and that life had been “incredibly challenging” for lower-income households for a sustained period of time, saying they had been at the “sharp end of a prolonged era of political instability and economic uncertainty”.But he added: “My perspective from being a major employer in this country is that far fewer people are at work than they could be. This means instead of investing in parts of national life that might stimulate investment and growth into the wider economy, we are spending an ever increasing proportion of our national income on our out-of-work benefits.“We have been sleepwalking into a quiet epidemic that is keeping millions of people out of work,” Prasad said.Prasad did not say what out of work benefits he was referring to in his claims. The government has said the number ofpeople claiming health-related benefitsthat enable them not to work has increased by 800,000 since 2019-20, while the number claiming a personal independence payment (Pip) to help cover the additional living costs of their disability is forecast to double this decade from 2 million to 4.3 million.However, Pip is not an out-of-work benefit, and economists have pointed out that overall out-of-work benefits have not risen. Some of the increases have been due to a higher state pension age increasing the number of “non-pensioners” claiming sickness benefits who would otherwise be on the state pension.The UK’s Tesco boss also implied that the government’s increases in regulation and employer taxes were harming businesses’ ability to hire more people.“Our biggest expenditure is the salaries and the wages of our employees,” Prasad said, adding that any change to this cost had a large effect on Tesco as it was such a big employer.Tesco, the UK’sdominant grocer, is the largest private-sector employer in the country. It has more than 300,000 employees across the UK and Republic of Ireland and more than 5,000 stores.It was accused of giving struggling workers a “slap in the face” when its group chief executive, Ken Murphy, received£9.9m in pay and perksas profits soared during the cost of living crisis in 2024. The payout meant Murphy earned more than 430 times the average pay at Tesco that year.Prasad acknowledged Tesco was in “good financial health” but said thehighly profitableretailer had invested an extra billion pounds in wages over the past five years.He said retail was one of the best sectors in helping people into work. “We provide some of the most flexible work opportunities in the labour market, supporting people to enter the workforce for the first time or re-enter after they’ve taken time out for either childcare or caring.”Explore more on these topicsTescoUnemploymentBenefitsWelfareSupermarketsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They immediately acted to shore up the prime minister.But insiders revealed that initial fears that Streeting, the health secretary, was coordinating an operation with Sarwar to bring down the prime minister quickly fell away when the alleged putsch fizzled out.Sarwar has shown his ruthless streak. But will his swipe at Starmer mean anything to voters?Read moreOne minister close to Streeting said: “No 10 seems to have an obsession with Wes. They are saying that he bottled it without any evidence he was going for it. Wes is a smart political operator who would have known that if you call for the PM to go and don’t have a plan it falls flat.”Sources close to Sarwar confirmed that he was acting alone, and in what he felt was Labour’s best interests inScotland. He had been reflecting on the move for several weeks and only decided to act on Monday. “This is our intervention – not a structured attempt to oust Keir,” one said.1:11Scottish Labour leader calls for Keir Starmer to resign as PM – videoOne Scottish MP who had spoken to Sarwar added: “The judgment was, the strategy of being close to Keir hasn’t worked, he might as well roll the fucking dice. Keir is extremely unpopular, in Scotland as much as anywhere.”Scottish Labour sources sought to justify Sarwar’s risky decision by arguing a challenge to Starmer’s leadership could still materialise.Revealed: ‘Rayner for leader’ site briefly went live in JanuaryRead more“There are people in the cabinet and Westminster who want to run,” said one. “The place has been buzzing on this for weeks now. It has crystallised recently and I would give it to the end of this week to see what happens. I’m not convinced there will be a reset moment.”Sarwar and his team were furious, allies said, that some of the prime minister’s internal rivals believed it was sufficient to wait for Labour’s defeats in the Scottish, Welsh and English local government elections to challenge him.“We’ve worked very very hard [to win],” they said. “We’re not going to be a sacrificial lamb because people haven’t got the gumption to say to Keir you’ve got to go now.”But the move alarmed Labour politicians in the Scottish parliament, who fear his intervention was mistimed. “It’s a very high-risk strategy. You’ve got to succeed. It didn’t,” said one senior figure at Holyrood.graphThe move raises short-term challenges for Scottish Labour’s credibility, with the latest polls showing the party is languishing in third place behind the Scottish National party and Reform UK, with only 12 weeks until May’s Holyrood election.Several ministers said they did not believe Sarwar was acting in a vacuum and that they had been expecting him to get public support from Scottish MPs. “I think it is pretty clear something went wrong,” one said. Another MP added: “We were expecting more but everybody else seemed to disappear off into the hills.”Downing Street, aware of the anger among Scottish MPs ahead of the May elections, has attempted to ease relations by inviting them to No 10 for talks on Tuesday, and to Chequers on Thursday to see the prime minister. MSPs have not been invited.Downing Street is also keeping a close eye on the situation in Wales, where several Labour MPs said Morgan felt that the prime minister was damaging their chances in May.“Everybody was expecting her to come out and row in behind Anas and then she didn’t. We know that she feels that Keir is a drag anchor on what’s happening in Wales,” one MP added.Sources close to Morgan said she had spent all Monday afternoon in meetings in Cardiff and that Sarwar had only contacted her after his explosive press conference. She then messaged Starmer to say he had her support.Allies denied the first minister had her head in the sand over Starmer’s unpopularity in Wales. “She does respect and like Keir, but that doesn’t mean she blindly follows him,” one said.10:37Is Starmer out of the woods after Labour showdown? - The LatestDouglas Alexander, the Scottish secretary in Starmer’s cabinet, portrayed the rift as a dispute between two people “who have strong and clear opinions, but who do not bear grudges”, as he sought to calm the controversy.Explore more on these topicsLabour party leadershipAnas SarwarScottish politicsKeir StarmerLabourScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The safe list also includes Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia.Rights groups have raised the alarm about the inclusion of Tunisia, where President Kaïs Saïed has cracked down on civil society and opposition figures have beenjailed for up to 66 years by politically controlled courts. Tunisian forces have alsoforced back migrants to remote desert regions, where some have died of thirst.A coalition of 39NGOs said in a statementbefore Tuesday’s vote that designating Tunisia as a safe country of origin deprived “Tunisian nationals of their right to an individual, fair, and effective assessment of their asylum claims, while giving the Tunisian authorities a renewed carte blanche to continue their systematic violations against migrants, civil society and the wider civic space”.Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP, who led the European parliament’s work on the safe countries of origin list, hailed the result: “This is the beginning of a new phase: migration is no longer endured but governed.”He said: “For too long, political decisions in migration policy have been systematically called into question by divergent judicial interpretations, paralysing state action and fuelling administrative chaos.”Ciriani is member of Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, which has clashed with Italian and European judges, who have ruled against the government’s arrangements with Albania.In 2024an Italian court ruledthat seven men at the Albanian facility would be transferred to Italy, disagreeing with the safe country of origin argument presented by Italy.Italy had argued that the men could be transferred to their “safe” home countries of Bangladesh and Egypt, but the judges said there was a lack of transparency in how safety was assessed.The EU has been tightening refugee rules since more than 1.3 million people claimed asylum duringthe 2015 migration crisis, but the trend has accelerated with electoral gains by nationalist and far-right parties.In the search for “innovative solutions”, EU leaders in 2024endorsed the concept of offshore return hubs– processing centres for people denied asylum in the EU.The rightwing Dutch governmentannounced last Septemberit had reached a deal with Uganda to enable the deportation of Africans denied asylum in the Netherlands. Denmark’s Social Democrat government had previously explored processing asylum claimants in Rwanda, but never went ahead.Last year 155,100 people risked their lives travelling in unseaworthy boats across the Mediterranean, while 1,953 died or went missing, according to the UN refugee agency.The deadly toll has continued in the first weeks of 2026. As manyas 380 people were feared drownedafter a boat from Tunisia sailed into a cyclone last month.Supporters of the new measures argue they undermine the business model of people smugglers.“People who genuinely need protection must receive it, but not necessarily in theEuropean Union. Effective protection can also be provided in a safe third country, while individual assessment remains fully guaranteed,” said Assita Kanko, a Flemish nationalist politician.The International Rescue Committee described the votes as deeply disappointing.“The new ‘safe third country’ rules are likely to force people to countries they may never have set foot in – places where they have no community, do not speak the language and face a very real risk of abuse and exploitation,” said the IRC’s senior advocacy adviser, Meron Ameha Knikman.The two laws were passed with strong support from the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) and three nationalist and far-right groups.The votes were the latest sign of a new dynamic in the European parliament after the election of a record number of nationalist and far-right MEPs to the right of the traditional Christian Democrats in 2024.While critics accused the EPP of breaking thecordon sanitaire, voting lists revealed a more complex picture. The centre-left was deeply divided, with significant minorities of socialist and centrist MEPs voting in favour of the new laws, while many centrists abstained.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionMigrationEuropeRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

New York and San Francisco had similar pilot schemes but Ireland is believed to be the first country to make one permanent.The pilot, for which 2,000 artists were randomly selected from 8,000 applicants, lowered the likelihood of artists experiencing enforced deprivation and reduced their levels of anxiety and reliance on supplementary income, a study found.The scheme recouped more than its net cost of €72m through increases in arts-related expenditure, productivity gains and reduced reliance on other welfare payments, according to a government-commissionedcost-benefit analysis.Peter Power, a member of the National Campaign for the Arts steering committee, said it was a real-world test of what happened when people were given stability instead of precarity. “Artists on the scheme spent more time creating and less time trapped in unrelated jobs just to survive, and many became better able to sustain themselves through their work alone,” he said.A more vibrant arts sector brought myriad benefits such as greater economic activity, improved mental wellbeing, critical thinking and innovation, Power added.Under eligibility rules, artists can receive support for three out of every six years. An artist selected for the 2026-29 cycle must skip the next cycle but can reapply for the following one.Guidelines about the scheme, which has an initial budget of €18.27m (£16m), will be published in April. Applications for the cycle that begins in 2026 will open in May, with payments starting September and continuing until September 2029. Applicants are to be randomly selected.Jenny Dagg, a Maynooth University sociologist whostudied the scheme, said it was a win for all but noted that eligible artists could not live solely on the weekly payments, which were considered supplementary income.Artists have welcomed the scheme but said they still faced a cost of living andhousing crisis. Rents in Dublin have doubled since 2013, forcing many young people to continue living with their parents.Explore more on these topicsIrelandArts policyUniversal basic incomeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

DNA traces detected on the firearms belonged only to the deceased men, they said.Then, on Sunday, the police discovered the bodies of three more people, two men aged 51 and 22 and a 15-year-old boy, in a campervan in the Okolchitsa Peak area, about 62 miles (100km) north of the capital, Sofia. The trio was tracked down by law enforcement as investigators suspected they were linked to the Petrohan pass deaths.View image in fullscreenZahari Vaskov, the director of the national police general directorate, told a press conference on Monday the deaths were ‘a case without comparison in our country’.Photograph: Bulgarian Ministry of InteriorAgence France-Presse reported that the prosecutors’ office said on Tuesday: “Based on the autopsy data for the [latter] three bodies, it appears that there were probably two murders committed successively and one suicide.”According to the police, five of the deceased were members of the National Protected Areas Control Agency, a non-governmental organisation devoted to nature protection which used the Petrohan pass lodge as a headquarters and also hosted rural holiday camps for young people.Some accounts have described its members as “forest rangers” who for years patrolled the area near the Serbian border and assisted border police. Meanwhile, law enforcement have said the men were involved in Tibetan Buddhism and quoted a relative of one member who spoke of “exceptional psychological instability” within the group.Those close to the deceased have said they must have been killed because they witnessed criminal activity around the Bulgarian-Serbian border, where people smuggling and illegal logging activities are not uncommon.Ralitsa Asenova, the mother of one of the victims found in the campervan, dismissed reports of tensions within the group. “They obviously witnessed something. For me, this is a professionally committed murder,” she said in an interview with Nova, a Bulgarian TV station.As details remain sparse, a lack of official information has led to often groundless speculation spreading online and has further undermined Bulgarians’ low trust in their institutions and authorities. The country is without a government and is headed towards its eighth parliamentary election in five years.The former president Rumen Radev called the case “a political shock and a sign of the country’s condition”, according to his press office. Radev, who resigned as head of state last month after nine years in office, offered his condolences to the deceaseds’ families and urged the authorities to solve the case.“I will not comment on this tragedy, which must be investigated by the competent authorities. The causes of these murders must be clarified as quickly as possible, because the public expects answers,” he said.In 2024 a survey found that 70% of Bulgarians believed in conspiracy theories while 37% had fallen foul of misinformation – so much so that the authors of the study, by the Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) and the Bulgarian-Romanian Observatory of Digital Media, said Bulgaria was living in a “post-truth” situation.Explore more on these topicsBulgariaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ferries had struggled to keep up regular service in the frozen sea after weeks of temperatures dropping to -10C (14F).View image in fullscreenThe first official ice road of the season opened between Estonian islands Hiiumaa and SaaremaaPhotograph: Janis Laizans/ReutersPeople living on the smaller island of Hiiumaa, with a population of about 9,000, travel to Saaremaa, population roughly 31,000, for shopping, a cup of coffee or to drop-off children at school. Getting to the larger island also ensures connection to mainland Estonia.While opening the ice road came out of necessity, Hergo Tasuja, the mayor of Hiiumaa, said it was also “part of our culture”.“For generations and generations, local people who live here, especially those who live near the sea, swim and use boats in the summertime,” Tasuja said. “And in winter, it’s in their blood to go to the sea” and step out on the ice.View image in fullscreenAuthorities decided to open the ice road after local residents spontaneously began driving across the frozen sea, exposing themselves to serious risks.Photograph: Janis Laizans/ReutersThe “ice road” is essentially a marked corridor on the frozen sea where specialists have determined the ice is thick enough to sustain the weight of driving cars.Preparing the road is not easy, said Marek Koppel, a road maintenance supervisor at Verston Eesti, the Estonian construction company in charge of building and managing the road.Workers have to measure ice thickness every 100 metres to determine the areas with more than 24cm of ice, the minimum required for safety. They smooth over ridged ice and cracks. Weather conditions and the solidity of ice are monitored around the clock and the route amended accordingly.A vehicle cannot be heavier than 2.5 tonnes and must drive either below 20km/h (12.4mph) or between 40 and 70km/h (25 and 43mph) – anything in between can create a vibration that damages the ice.View image in fullscreenTwo cars cross the frozen Soela strait in the Baltic Sea near Hiiumaa.Photograph: Kostya Manekov/APCars are not allowed to stop and need to maintain a safe distance from one other. Passengers cannot wear seatbelts and doors must be easy to open, to allow for a fast exit in case of an accident.“The road was pretty good, it was easy to ride,” said Alexei Ulyvanov, who lives in nearby Tallinn and travelled to the islands to show his children “that it’s possible to ride a car over the sea”.According to Tasuja, an “ice road” was last used to connect the islands eight years ago. Since then, the country’s winters have been too warm.Verston, the construction company, said authorities had contracted them to open two more ice routes this week, this time linking mainland Estonia to two smaller islands.Explore more on these topicsEstoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

More than $100m were bets on Bad Bunny’s opening song and $45m on which artists would perform with him on stage. In comparison, the platformsaw $27min total trading volume at last year’s Super Bowl.Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to trade on the outcomes of virtually anything, from sports and elections to what color someone will wear during a performance. Unlike casinos or traditional sportsbooks, users effectively bet (or “trade”) against others on the platform, instead of an established “house”, and the platforms earn revenue by charging trading fees.‘We all on Kalshi now’: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the quiet collapse of sporting trustRead moreKalshi and competitorPolymarketargue that this model distinguishes them from traditional casinos or sportsbooks. Since the US supreme courtoverturnedthe federal ban on sports betting in 2018, state gambling agencies regulate traditional gambling outfits, but prediction markets are currently overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The reason people are flocking to prediction markets, especially Kalshi, is that our incentive as a company [is] we win when the customers win, we don’t win when the customers lose, and that’s a huge difference in the model,” Mansour said on Tuesday.On Sunday, Kalshitoldusers that although some deposits were “delayed because of the amount of traffic and deposits we’re getting”, their money “is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land”.Prediction markets have risen in popularity in recent months and are now used beyond sports, edging into other events such as the Grammys and Oscars. Last week, Kalshiannouncedthat the NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was joining the company as a shareholder.But in recent months, critics have raised concerns about potentialmarket manipulation and insider tradingon these prediction market sites. Ahead of the Super Bowl, Kalshi said it expanded itssurveillance and enforcement effortsto detect and remove accounts engaging in insider trading or market manipulation.In aposton X days before the Super Bowl, Mansour said the company over the past year “ran over 200 investigations and froze relevant accounts” and referred several active cases to law enforcement.Explore more on these topicsBusinessSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSport bettingUS sportsBad BunnynewsShareReuse this content"

So they shelled out $3,500 to do the unconventional: hire a horse and a cowboy to lasso the bull of Wall Street.On a sweltering evening in late September, the cowboygallopedtoward the iconic sculpture in lower Manhattan. Wearing ranch gear and a western hat stamped with the Lunos logo, he lassoed the bull’s horns as invitees and curious passersby watched. He and the horse then circled the statue, handing out cowboy hats and branded stress balls.The goal was simple: deliver Lunos’s pitch of “taming the wild west” of accounts receivables in the most literal, public way possible. The startup uses AI to automate invoices, track balances and follow up on payments.“We were trying to figure out in a sea of sameness how we could stand out as a startup to be reckoned with,” said Alex Mann, Lunos’s head of growth.How cryptocurrency’s second largest coin missed out on the industry’s boomRead moreWith more than90,000 AI companiesworldwide, according to one tally, many businesses promising to automate the same tasks across work and daily life are having increasing difficulty differentiating themselves by their products alone. Many AI companies geared towards businesses have relied on hype-filled messaging delivered through predictable channels like trade shows, white papers, billboards and digital ads. A live stunt in front of the Wall Street bull represents a departure in form that can feel oddly out of sync with the conventional back-office software these companies build.The stunt reflects a broader shift among AI companies turning to provocative marketing to stand out in an overcrowded, capital-rich sector. In 2025 alone, AI startups raised roughly $202.3bn globally, up from $114bn the year before, according toCrunchbase. Digital ad spending for generative AI apps also surpassed $200m in Q2 2025,SensorTowerdata shows.As standard claims about productivity and speed blur together, some startups are abandoning corporate messaging in favor of spectacle. And while these stunts appear to be working, marketing experts say the shift reflects an industry under mounting pressure.Provoking startupsStartups such as Artisan AI, Cluely andFriendhave provoked backlash for ads implying their tools could replace human workers, help cheat in job interviews or substitute for real friendships: decisions that critics say amount to distasteful messaging orchestrated for “ragebaiting”.Wary of similar accusations, business-focused AI startups are experimenting with less controversial gimmicks for a range of reasons.For Virio, the draw isviral content. In September, the AI marketing startup hired cowboys to walk two horses around the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco during HubSpot Inbound, a major marketing conference. From 8am to 11am, co-founder Emmett Chen-Ran walked beside the horses holding a Virio banner reading “Content that drives pipeline.”The aim was to catch the attention of founders and C-suite leaders at companies with 50 or more employees, Virio’s target customers. Chen-Ran said such theatrics are rare in the B2B world, where companies sell products to other companies rather than consumers, giving the stunt an added novelty. The real goal, though, was for conference attenders to take photos and share them on LinkedIn, fueling the online engagement at the center of Virio’s marketing strategy.“You don’t do the stunt for the stunt itself,” Chen-Ran said. “You do it for the LinkedIn posts and the content it drives.”While Virio leaned into spectacle, Personal AI, a small language model startup, used provocation as a visual metaphor for its core message.In June, at the HubSpot AI Summit (a separate conference from HubSpot Inbound) in San Francisco, Personal AI’s CEO, Suman Kanuganti,walked onstage toplesswearing only gym shorts. Kanuganti opened with the line “LLMs are naked” splashed across the screen behind him. He argued that the large models powering ChatGPT and Gemini leave users feeling “exposed” and “insecure”. Personal AI, which allows businesses to create individuated AI models by training on their own documents, he said, is the “missing gear”. As he slowly dressed, each item of clothing, from the Arc’teryx jacket to his Salomon shoes, symbolized a layer of protection he personally trusted. The point was to show that, just as people select clothing from familiar brands, businesses should have access to AI systems built with transparent guardrails: privacy, safety and reliability.Trapped in ‘land grab mentality’Marketing experts say the rise of these tactics speaks to the pressure facing enterprise AI startups in a rapidly expanding sector.Emily Heyward, co-founder and CEO of Red Antler, a marketing agency for startups, said founders feel trapped in a “land grab mentality” desperate to seize attention before a rival does, even if the product is still maturing, as investors pour billions into AI firms.“Few, if any, of these businesses are currently delivering on their ultimate product vision,” Heyward said. “It’s really about drumming up enough noise that people try you versus the other guy, then stick with you as the tech evolves.”Tom Goodwin, co-founder of All We Have Is Now, a business consulting firm, takes a more cynical view. Goodwin says there is “a degree of desperation and urgency” driving many of these stunts. AI is subversive, he argues, which lends itself to marketing that is provocative and attention-grabbing.“These companies are terrified that no one’s going to notice them,” Goodwin said.He goes further, arguing there is “a degree of lack of morality” embedded in some AI products, pointing to intellectual property theft, job displacement and the dismissal of human values. In a media environment splintered across social platforms and heightened political theater, fear, he says, becomes a marketing tool. Startups tapping into that anxiety are reaching for one of the few reliable ways to claw back attention.While these startups insist their tactics were strategic and effective in driving sales, Virio, Personal AI and Lunos say stirring up negative discourse solely for attention does not align with their values.The less inflammatory, more controlled version of stunt marketing appears to be paying off, though with mixed results.Virio’s stunt did not unfold as planned. Few people walked by, and the horses at the Moscone Center moved too quickly for most people to capture good photos. Still, Chen-Ran said the company created its own LinkedIn content from the event, generated more than 300 qualified website visitors and gained visibility after “countless” people recognized the team inside the conference, leading to calls with a few potential customers.At Personal AI, Kanugati said his stage performance helped cement the company’s positioning and secure additional conference bookings, which have led to a handful of small customer deals.For Lunos, the impact was immediate. Mann said thousands of people visited the site, LinkedIn posts about the Wall Street stunt drew hundreds of likes and comments, and word-of-mouth referrals spiked across CFO Slack groups. In the three months following the launch, Mann said inbound leads filled the sales pipeline with hundreds of qualified prospects. The publicity even triggered an influx of job applications, including McKinsey consultants seeking leadership roles across business operations.Lunos now has paying customers, and the team says the volume and quality of inbound interest has left them confident they can convert even more early leads into clients.As Mann put it, the stunt “opened the door for us to think creatively about how we want to design future activation campaigns”, a sign that the pressure to stand out is unlikely to fade.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAI (artificial intelligence)featuresShareReuse this content"

You know, my heart really goes out to victims of this scandal and these crimes,” he said.However, the Barclays boss – speaking as the bank reported annual profits – stopped short of commenting directly on allegations against his predecessor, Staley.The Guardian reported last week that, in 2019, US prosecutorsreviewed allegations of rape and bodily harm against Staley, including that he forced a woman to touch his genitals during a massage before raping her, and left “bloody marks” on the arms of a woman he called “Tinkerbell”.There is no evidence that prosecutors decided to pursue the allegations. Staley, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, has not responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment made over several months, either directly or via his lawyers. He has never been charged with a crime related to the allegations.During a UK court hearing in 2025, Staley admitted to havingsex with a member of Epstein’s staffin New York, but agreed with a lawyer during cross-examination that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”.When Venkatakrishnan was asked whether the allegations outlined in the Epstein files had prompted any further internal reviews at Barclays, the bank’s head of media said: “We have nothing further to add on that point.”It comes as the bank and its chair, Nigel Higgins, continue to battlea class action lawsuit in the USover claims they defrauded and misled investors over Staley’s relationship with Epstein.The US class action suit, led by pension funds in New York and Missouri, alleges that Barclays, Higgins and Staley repeatedly misrepresented Staley’s history with Epstein to media and investors, starting in July 2019, weeks after Epstein was arrested on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.They claim they were ultimately defrauded, having learned about the true nature of Staley and Epstein’s relationship only after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publicly released findings of its investigation and banned Staley from the Cityin October 2023. The news caused the value of their shares and American Depositary Receipts to drop, resulting in “significant economic losses”, they argued.Higgins and Staley have not commented on the case.Staley hadresigned from Barclays two years earlier, in 2021, over preliminary findings from the FCA’s investigation. Staleyfailed to overturn a banon his return to the UK’s financial sector last year and lost out on £18m worth of pay and bonuses from Barclays as a result of the ruling.Venkatakrishnan’s comments echoed those of the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who said last week thathe was “shocked” by revelationsin the Epstein files.That included information thatappears to have been sharedwith Epstein by the former UK business secretary Peter Mandelson regarding highly confidential government deliberations after the 2008 financial crisis. The revelations resulted in Mandelson resigning from the Labour party and House of Lords last week.Bailey said: “I don’t want to sound pious, but this is for all of us: how is it that we live in a society in which this happened, and the cover-up happened as well? I think that is a very fundamental question that we have to ask ourselves.”HSBC and Barclays are facing a $12bn (£8.7bn) lawsuit by a US heiress, Tanya Dick-Stock, over a Jersey trust allegedly linked to the Epstein scandal. The Times, which first reported the lawsuit, said both banks declined to comment.Barclays posted a near-13% increase in profits to £9.1bn in 2025 and said it planned to return more than £15bn to shareholders between 2026 and 2028. Profits for the final three months of last year rose 12%.Explore more on these topicsBarclaysBankingJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a warningWatch Michel Gondry’s 2004 time-twister as a hard sci-fi film and you might heed its adviceGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailNathania GilsonTue 10 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 17.54 ESTShareEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film about the gap between what we think we can control and what happens when reality hits. Over the years, many critics and fans have celebrated Michel Gondry’s film as a tender-hearted love story. But a rewatch might reveal that Gondry’s second collaboration with postmodern American screenwriterCharlie Kaufmanis much closer to another, twistier genre: hard sci-fi.‘Crime is a disease. Meet the cure’: Sylvester Stallone’s self-serious cop movie is ludicrous funRead moreBy now, the story of Eternal Sunshine is familiar. Depressed introvert Joel (Jim Carrey) meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), whose box-dyed hair colour and moods change as often as the weather. A mismatch made in heaven. The troubled couple eventually find a fix for their rocky, codependent relationship: a service provided by a sketchy medical company called Lacuna Inc that offers to erase their memories of each other. Clementine goes first. Out of spite, Joel follows.Early on in the film, a nervous Joel asks about the risks of brain damage before committing to the procedure. Dr Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna Inc’s founder and chief technician, says matter-of-factly: “Technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage. It’s on par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you’ll miss.”Joel’s fears are soothed, but mid-procedure, something shifts. Trapped inside his own consciousness, Joel realises he doesn’t want to lose Clementine. In an attempt to outsmart the Lacuna Inc technicians, he tries to conceal her in his oldest, deepest, most buried memories – childhood moments she was never part of. Hiding under the kitchen table from his mother. Being bullied. Moments that the technicians haven’t mapped out yet on their clunky equipment.View image in fullscreen‘Eternal Sunshine is about technology failing – from the very start.’Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarTypically, sci-fi films are about what can happen when technology works too well, and the characters can’t handle the ensuing moral and psychological consequences. Eternal Sunshine, on the other hand, is about technology failing – from the very start. Joel interferes with his own procedure. The Lacuna Inc technicians are hilariously unprofessional. The company founder is sleeping with patients. Everyone’s sloppy, human, compromised.Most sci-fi aims to demonstrate what happens when you solve the problem. Eternal Sunshine is about what happens when the problem was never solvable in the first place.The film keeps undercutting its own romantic moments with genuinely uncomfortable reality. In flashbacks, Joel calls Clementine “selfish” and “pathetic”. She’s mean to him at parties, dismissive of his interests, gets drunk and embarrassing. He’s passive-aggressive, judgmental and withdrawn. These aren’t quirky flaws – they’re the day-to-day of two incompatible people hurting each other. Their relationship is doomed from the beginning.Eternal Sunshine, then, is far from a love story – but rather a warning about how technology can’t really fix all our romantic mishaps. In 2004, the idea of erasing someone required literal brain damage. Now we have a softer, more insidious version: you can curate someone out of existence digitally. Block, unfollow, mute, delete, untag and archive entire text threads. We’ve built the infrastructure for memory erasure into our daily lives. In 2004, scrubbing someone out of our life on purpose was a thought experiment. In 2026, we’re discovering, like Joel, that erasure doesn’t actually work.View image in fullscreen‘The version of love that the film believes in isn’t about erasing or curating or controlling, but accepting the whole mess in front of us.’Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarWe may mute an ex, but their account still exists. We block their number but remember the texts. We archive photos but actually deleting feels too permanent. We’re never fully erasing, never fully remembering. We’re constantly trying to move on without fully committing.Like the existential terror of time travel narratives like Back to the Future – or even the Sundance-approved cult puzzler Primer – Eternal Sunshine unravels in gloriously non-linear fashion. Scenes interrupt each other. Time scrambles. We are immersed inside Joel’s consciousness, watching memories break apart and warp.As Clementine starts to disappear from Joel’s memories, they have conversations they could never have in linear time. In one flashback, the couple talks at a beach party, sitting far away from everyone else. “This is it, Joel. I’m going to be gone soon,” Clementine says, knowing they’re existing only briefly in a reconstructed memory. “What do we do?” Rather than scheming, Joel gives up: “Enjoy it.”That’s not romantic in the traditional sense. Because the version of love that the film believes in isn’t about erasing or curating or controlling, but accepting the whole mess in front of us and choosing it anyway, knowing exactly what we’re signing up for. This is a sci-fi film that argues for accepting our imperfect selvesagainstthe illusion of technological perfection. We try to delete. We try to refresh. But really, the best we can do is hope that things can be different this time around.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is available to rent in Australia and available to stream on Mubi in the UK and Hulu in the US.

He is framing The Fall Off as a graceful bowing out – “to do on my last what I was unable to do on my first”, he has said – and it’s almost as if he is a student coming to the end of a long period of study, with this double album as his graduate thesis.Across 24 tracks and 101 minutes, The Fall Off is full of technical proficiency, raw lyrical skill, citation, interpolation and sampling, and it attempts nothing less than to embody a half-century of hip-hop. Through direct and indirect references, lessons unfold throughout. The Fall-Off Is Inevitable is inspired by Nas’s 2001 Stillmatic track Rewind. I Love Her Again is an obvious nod to Common’s I Used to Love HER. Bunce Road Blues borrows lyrics from Usher’s Nice & Slow but connects to R&B’s present with guest vocals from Nigerian singer Tems. The Let Out is reminiscent of SpottieOttieDopaliscious from OutKast’s Aquemini, and so forth: all ample material for audiences to think through hip-hop’s past and future.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover of The Fall Off.Photograph: Interscope RecordsBut not every fan wants to study, and those who do are left with questions. The Fall Off seems like an attempt to convey Cole’s growth and development but it’s lacking in the emotional depth that comes from real human interactions: he is the only fully realised person on this album, and the people he engages with, both metaphorical and real, seem to function more as props.On Legacy, he confesses his earlier callow attitude towards women – “I need a Yelp for hoes / I need to read reviews” – but by the time we get to Life Sentence, a nod to DMX’s How’s It Going Down, those impulses are tamed by his marriage to long-term partner Melissa Heholt: “Found out who I want to be / Slowly, but surely he cut off his hoes / If you gone do it, do it right / Put ring on your finger, now me and you is doing life.” She gives birth to his two sons, making him a thankful husband and father, but for a four-verse song billed as the “realest one” in his discography, his wife is sketched lightly, a strangely faceless presence.Like many tracks here, it’s pure autobiography, and while any autobiography is fascinating to fans, they don’t always illuminate broader truths. On Safety, Cole keeps the lens squarely on him even as he broadens the cast list, rapping from the perspective of people who have messages from home for this now-famous star (it might immediately bring to mind Nas’s One Love, or perhaps the most famous epistolary rap song, Eminem’s Stan). But again, despite the letter-writing device, it feels like these thoughts are merely J Cole’s.He is stronger when examining hip-hop itself, and at times the album reminds me of Ralph Ellison’s 1952 novel Invisible Man. In the book’s famous Battle Royal scene, the naive narrator believes he’s been invited to give a speech. When he arrives, he’s blindfolded at the door and forced into a brutal competition, fighting against other young Black men for the entertainment of the drinking and cheering crowd. Relatedly, the public rap battle between Kendrick Lamar and Drake – which briefly involved Cole before he apologised and bowed out, to the consternation of many – had fans wondering if Cole would have more to say about the feud on The Fall Off. He addresses it obliquely on What If by citing hip-hop history, channelling the Notorious BIG and 2Pac to form a conversation that might have prevented two of the genre’s most famous tragedies. It’s another device that may seem a bit heavy-handed, but Cole understands that violence and death are cash crops in the current attention economy, and that the stakes remain high.Like Ellison writing the fight scene in Invisible Man, Cole uses The Fall Off to write about new takes on old practices in the US: the fickleness of fans, the intoxicating allure of the limelight and the spectacle of Black male combat are all addressed. Toward the end of Bombs in the Ville/Hit the Gas, present-day J Cole offers sage advice to his younger self: “Fame is a drug you was chosen to take / Unfortunately, can’t be sober and great / You’re just like a flower the world wanna hold / They sniff on your petals until you get old / And then they dispose, a new flower grows / Can’t take it personal, that’s just how it go.”A$AP Rocky: Don’t Be Dumb review – a charismatic, playful return, but it’s no slam dunkRead moreFellow students of hip-hop will notice the drum track sounds like Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99) by Cole’s former mentor, Jay-Z, and Jay-Z’s former mentor, Jaz-O. For better or worse, The Fall Off is J Cole, the student, fully transitioning into J Cole, the teacher. If he’s truly finished recording music, then perhaps this album will stand not as his thesis, but his instruction manual to others: a masterful, deeply knowledgeable but rather brittle read.Explore more on these topicsRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

However, rather than suburban Australia, writer Owen Egerton and director Corin Hardy relocate us to an autumnal, Springsteen-ready North American steeltown, where artsy high-schooler Chrys (Dafne Keen) inherits the locker of the star basketballer we’ve just seen flambeed in a prologue. The deadly doodad she finds there is a skull-shaped Aztec whistle with either “summon the dead” or “summon your dead” (there’s some linguistic quibbling) inscribed on the side. Naturally she puts it back, and everybody lives happily ever after.I kid, of course. For a while, the horror element is less in-your-face than it was in the pummelling Antipodean predecessor, but whistleblowing soon makes everyone’s worst fears about dying literal. That development gives Hardy’s increasingly bloody kill scenes a Final Destination-like piquancy: your heart can only go out to the boy racer who perishes via car crash in his upstairs bedroom. One similarity to the Philippous’ film is the sympathy for insecure, troubled teens who couldn’t seem more unlike the usual disposable jocks and prom queens. Egerton observes courtship rituals with tenderness, quietly foregrounding Chrys’s struggles to come out to upright classmate Ellie (Sophie Nélisse); beneath the looming shadow of death, this is an attempt to live one’s truest life.British director Hardy has far more fun here than he did with2018’s mechanical franchise entry The Nun. He runs with a solid in-joke – naming objects, places and Nick Frost’s doomed teacher Mr Craven after noted horror directors – and pushes a sequence involving a labyrinthine straw maze, surely beyond the actual resources of a small town harvest festival, towards the pleasingly surreal. If the film can’t successfully integrate a loose-end preacher-slash-drug dealer (Percy Hynes White), elsewhere it pulls off the deft trick of being familiar without seeming derivative, with scenes you remember from films you like, occasionally with a novel twist. Enough for Friday or Saturday night enjoyment, certainly.Whistle is out now in the US, on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsNick FrostreviewsShareReuse this content"

Let joy – and breathless protagonist Jack Dawkins (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) – be unconfined, mate.But not for long.“Oi!” bellow the wardens, puffing their cheeks in fury as the urchin turned surgeon turned (stitched-up-like-a-bleedin’-kipper) convict wriggles out of their clutches and makes for the harbour. “Tee-hee,” replies Dawkins as he slaloms between rhubarbing extras in mud-spattered britches. But strewth. Who’s this? A black-caped figure blocks our hero’s path to freedom. “I am Inspector Boxer, from London,” rumbles the stranger from the depths of his expositional cravat. “Here to replace … [the brow darkens] … Captain Gaines.” Dawkins gulps. Captain Gaines? The same Captain Gaines what got shot in the mug by notorious cutpurse Red (Miranda Tapsell) at the end of series one, a murder that saw the innocent Dawkins, after a series of lies and betrayals, condemned to the noose? The very same. The game, surely, is up. But hark! A cry goes up from the cobbles. An extra has been attacked by a shark and will surely cark it unless a passing surgeon – one who has, ideally, just escaped from the local nick with the help of gurning recidivist Norbert Fagin (David Thewlis) – attends to his shredded calf forthwith. A reprieve! Dawkins rushes to the rescue, Inspector Boxer reluctantly mumbles something about giving the man room and lo, the Artful Dodger lives to smirk another day. Or does he?It feels important at this juncture to point out that the entirety of the above happens within the first five minutes of the second series’ opening episode. No recaps or flashbacks here. Just the caption “Six months later” in 900pt Buckle Up, Bozos font and a juddering blast of Blur’s Song 2 (“woo-hoo!” indeed) as the viewer is left to gather her skirts and sprint after the action in search of elucidation. Confused?View image in fullscreenEarnest … Maia Mitchell as Lady Belle Fox in The Artful Dodger series two.Photograph: DisneyLet us rewind the hands of the Extremely Modern Period-Drama Clock to the events of season one, for a clearer sense of what the Dickens is going on.Conceived by James McNamara, David Maher and David Taylor as a sequel to Oliver Twist, the series is set 15 years after the events of the novel, with Dawkins and his former surrogate father Fagin now living in the squalid New South Wales penal colony of Port Victory. Dawkins has made a name for himself as the colony’s leading surgeon, but the lure of heist-based mischief with the scuttling, manipulative Fagin and his band of oi-oi-saveloy brigands ensures trouble is forever just around the corner. There is a romantic foil in the earnest shape of Lady Belle Fox (Maia Mitchell) who, as the governor’s daughter, is expected to stanch her yearnings for Dawkins and a future as the world’s leading lady surgeon. The finale found Dawkins and Fagin banged up by Gaines, its series-long preoccupations – the ties that bind, the notion that one can never truly escape one’s roots – coalescing in scenes of great tenderness. It was, all in all, very good indeed.And now? Lawks-a-mercy, it’s … OK.While Dawkins is pursued by Inspector Boxer (Luke Bracey, an Australian who appears locked in mortal combat with his own vowels), Belle’s noxious mother, Lady Jane Fox (Susie Porter), gives our hero an ultimatum: stay away from Belle for two years or it’s back to the noose ye go.Alas, the frantic pace that underpinned the first series now feels slightly desperate, with every available surface festooned with chase sequences, punch-ups and pounding “contemporary pop”. The result? A drama that appears to be in a race with itself to reach the closing credits. It’s all a bit The Artful Dodger: U Got 2 Pick a Pocket or 2. The guiding principle appears to be “more of the same, but with additional gun-fingers”. And the emotional richness sparked by those intimate, sweetly bashful conversations between Dawkins and Fagin? All gone (for now), buried under a wobbling pile of used surgical dressings and the less awkward demands of yet another heist (“we’ve got bigger problems than your feelin’s!”).So, huzzah for the pace and the balls. But boohoo for those who, having hoped for more than merely a louder re-tread of the first series, may now find themselves, as Fagin grumbles at one point, “a bit bleedin’ put out”.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThomas Brodie-SangsterreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s an industrial town surrounded by the Irish sea on three sides, known for its 140-year history of submarine building. The corrugated peaks of BAE Systems’ Dock Hall dominate the skyline over Barrow’s red-brick terraces, and roughly a third of working-age locals are employed in its sprawling complex. This militarised landscape is the unlikely home of Full of Noises, an experimental music and arts venue with a capacity of 40 whose first event featured krautrock legends Faust destroying an electric guitar with a pneumatic drill.View image in fullscreen‘An interesting context to be working in’ … BAE Systems’ base looming over Barrow-in-Furness.Photograph: Dan McCarthyHaving secured funding to launch a two-day festival in 2009, artistic director Glenn Boulter and four other local artists took on temporary custodianship of the crumbling canteen building on wind-lashed Barrow Island, “a building that’s part of this big military-industrial complex,” Boulter says. “It’s heavily security-controlled.” He recalls a game they would play on a nearby bridge, where they would pull their phones out as if to take photos and count the seconds until they were accosted by security. “For us, that was an interesting context to be working in.”The paradox of existing in this highly surveilled complex was that its far-flung location offered a rare kind of creative freedom: there was no established scene to satisfy. “You could do anything because no one was really bothered or looking,” says Boulter. That first festival with Faust set the tone – “big German men banging on an oil drum and setting fire to stuff” – and brought together a group of local ex-submariners to perform Kurt Schwitters’ dadaist poetry in morse code.Full of Noises kept moving around, “commissioning work, drawing on the town’s history, architecture and communities”, and 16 years later, now has a permanent home in Piel View House, a former park keeper’s lodge perched on a hill in Barrow Park. Its traditional red brick facade has been expanded with a Scandi-esque black cuboid extension, which houses an acoustically engineered space with pristine white interiors and high rectangular windows that frame the surrounding tree canopy. It has hosted stand-out names in experimental and improvised music, from LA-based Tashi Wada and Julia Holter to Marisa Anderson and Jim White. At the end of 2025, Lonnie Holley played to a room of 40 people here, having performed at London’s 1,500-capacity Roundhouse a week earlier. Beyond concerts, the venue hosts film screenings and creative workshops, and has welcomed artists-in-residence including Lee Gamble. “We’ve always enjoyed the challenge of putting on this kind of work in a place that’s fairly small and isolated,” says Boulter.View image in fullscreenLou Barnell and Amy Clark performing at Piel View House in August.Photograph: Laurence CampbellI spend two days at the venue getting to know the team during Independent Venue Week, as they prepare for a cohort of graduates from London College of Communication (LCC), who are travelling up to showcase their work.“When I was touring, I remember sleeping on astroturf in someone’s kitchen,” venue programmer Amy Stretch-Parker tells me as she cooks the meal for the night. She wants to make sure the venue feels like a “home away from home”, and cooks a communal meal for every visiting artist. “No matter who’s performing, everyone’s treated the same,” she adds. The upstairs of the venue is set for further renovation dependent on funding, which will include bedrooms for visitors and artists-in-residence.View image in fullscreenJim White and Marisa Anderson performing at Piel View House in September 2024.Photograph: Laurence CampbellThis care and programming is sustained by a unique financial model. Full of Noises holds a 25-year lease on a peppercorn rent from the local authority, who supported redevelopment over demolition. Arts Council England (ACE) funding covers the majority of their overheads, and Barrow’s recent designation as an ACE Priority Place has been transformative. “It meant being able to access money for the building and increasing our funding enough to have a proper team,” says Boulter. Additional funding from the local authority, trusts and foundations allows this arts and culture hub to host more than 60 events a year, most priced at just £5 or pay-what-you-feel. “It’s about being really open and welcoming to anyone that wants to engage with us.”‘Conga line around the car park!’ A week in the life of a British venueRead moreAt seven o’clock on this damp January evening, Full of Noises comes to life. The LCC graduates have set up an array of hardware – modular synthesisers, contact mics, even children’s toys. Around 20 people file in, order drinks from Boulter, bartender for the night, and take their seats. One performer, Sanki, captivates the audience with an illuminated tank of water and metal chains to produce sub-aquatic, mechanical distortions that vibrate the walls and feel fitting considering our surroundings.After the show, I get chatting with a local regular, who tells me to look up Caliban’s speech in The Tempest if I want to understand the venue’s name. “Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises / Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.” It’s a fitting parallel – the team behind Full of Noises having found their own enchantment in Barrow’s isolation.“As an artist, it’s just a really unusual, interesting place to be,” says Boulter. “An unlikely place where excellent art can happen.”Explore more on these topicsMusicCumbriaExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Watching her command this arena during the first of two sold-out shows in Glasgow in honour of Florence + the Machine’s sixth albumEverybody Scream, it’s hard to imagine Welch fearing anything. Just seconds ago, she was racing barefoot, flouncy skirts gathered in one hand, ripping through Spectrum (the band’s first UK No 1, back in 2012) and its searing demand: “Say my name!”But the new song she is steeling herself to sing presses on a bruise. With ratcheting intensity, You Can Have It All grieves an ectopic pregnancywhich almost killed her, as well as a music industry that punishes its stars for motherhood. Over grungy electric guitar, her tempestuous voice billows like sails in high wind: “Am I a woman now?” It leaves the arena in stunned silence. She gives a wry curtsey.View image in fullscreenFlorence Welch with her choir.Photograph: Lillie EigerEverybody Scream deals in familiar Florence tropes – mountainous emotions, thundering drums, glittering harp – but with a new sombreness, particularly as she wrestles with questions of legacy. On earlier songs she raged against metaphorical demons; now, on One of the Greats, her targets are more explicit as she stares down male peers making “boring music” and sings, her face tight with frustration, about what it would take “to conquer and crucify”.‘The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death’: Florence Welch on sexism, screaming and the lost pregnancy that nearly killed herRead moreWith her longstanding band the Machine performing in the shadows, Welch is accompanied by a choir who writhe and scream and rip at their frothy petticoats. This high-drama show could never be boring but it threatens to overwhelm: the choir’s folksy horror pulls focus away from a performer who can transfix a crowd, alone, with ease.Last year’s single Sympathy Magic is an instant Florence classic: a sky-high plea for catharsis through song. “What else?” she yells, before throwing herself into the arms of a fan on the barrier. It makes the aching, pretty closer And Love feel intentionally anticlimactic. It is tender, quiet, about finding peace. “If we sing it, it might come true,” she offers, but Welch, like her audience, thrives on the edge of a precipice.Florence + the Machine are atUtilita Arena, Newcastle upon Tyne, 11 February;then touringExplore more on these topicsMusicFlorence + the MachinePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Meeting in Washington DC to discuss it, he produces from between the pages a small Ziploc bag. Carefully, he takes out a flier, yellowed and brittle with age. The text at the top is Vietnamese. Underneath there is English.It reads: “Colored GI’s! The South Vietnamese people, who are struggling for their independence and freedom, are friends with the American colored people being victim of barbarous racial discrimination at home. Your battlefield is right in the USA! Your enemy is the war lords in the White House and the Pentagon!”Haygood says: “One of the soldiers I interviewed, Elbert Nelson, the doctor, he explains in the book that he found this leaflet directed to Black soldiers. And he was so touched that I tracked him down, he said, ‘I want you to have this.’ It was from the North Vietnamese, it was attached to trees and walls. It just gave me chills.”‘There’s this whole other story’: inside the fight to end slavery in the AmericasRead moreThe War Within a War tells such stories of Black Americans who from the mid-1960s to the mid-70s served in or otherwise experiencedVietnam: soldiers, marines, pilots, doctors and nurses, officers and drafted men, reporters and activists, cultural commentators and more.Saying “this is my most important book,” Haygood cites a great writer who pointed the way.“We need to remind Americans who have a very short memory whatJames Baldwinsaid. I met Baldwin when I started out my journalism career. I was at the Boston Globe, and he was a visiting writer at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and I was sent up there to do a feature about him. This was 1985. I hadn’t written a single book, but I was dreaming. And now I have a quote from him at the start of my book. I’ll read it, if I may.”In a steady voice, Haygood readswordsfirst published in the Black journal Freedomways in 1967.“Long before the Americans decided to liberate the south-east Asians, they decided to liberate me. My ancestors carried these scars to the grave, and so will I. A racist society can’t but fight a racist war – this is the bitter truth. The assumptions acted on at home are also acted on abroad, and every American Negro knows this for he … was the first Viet Cong victim. We were bombed first.”Haygood “came across that quote early in writing, and I said to myself, ‘I’ve got to use that at the beginning of the book, because it says everything.’ It synthesizes so much of what the feelings were among so many of those soldiers.”View image in fullscreenSkip Dunn.Photograph: Penguin Random HouseHaygood describes racism faced by Black soldiers, stark disadvantages in circumstances and outcomes washing back to American soil, a nation jaggedly divided.“Vietnam was the first desegregated war,” Haygood says, “the first engagement on any large scale in the history of this nation where Blacks and whites had to depend on each other. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, in spirit, told us to do that, to respect your fellow man or woman. But so often, that didn’t happen.”Figures from theLibrary of Congressare stark: “Approximately300,000 African Americansserved in the Vietnam war. In 1965, African Americans filled 31% of ground combat battalions in Vietnam, while the percentage of African Americans as a minority in the general population was 12% … African Americans saw combat at a higher percentage and suffered casualties at a higher rate. Dr Martin Luther King Jr referred to the Vietnam war as a white man’s war, a Black man’s fight.”In his reporting days, Haygood went to war zones including Somalia and Liberia. Closer to home, a piece for the Washington Post about a veteran White House staffer inspiredThe Butler, a hit 2013 film starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, directed by Lee Daniels. Previous book subjects include congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr, supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr and boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.His Vietnam book grew from humble roots. Haygood “grew up in Columbus, Ohio, lived on North 5th Street, and when I was in seventh grade, there was a guy who lived directly across the street by the name of Skip Dunn”.“He was in high school, he was like the neighborhood sports hero, and he would wave to me every morning. ‘Hey, Wil.’ And then came a period when I didn’t see Skip. And I asked my sister, who was in school with him: ‘Where’s Skip?’ And my sister looked down at me and said: ‘Skip’s going to a place called Vietnam.’“The following year, the summer of 1968, my mother moved to the east side of town, to an all-Black housing project. We were very poor. And that summer, there were rebellions and uprisings as a result of theassassination of King, and so I as a little kid found myself running from national guard troops and tanks that were sent to keep us all contained.”King’s death was also a watershed event for Black Americans in Vietnam, where 1968 was also the year of theTet offensive, the North Vietnamese onslaught that showed the war wouldn’t be won.Nearly 60 years after that, the war has been exhaustively studied. Nonetheless, Haygood identified “a big gap when it comes to Black soldier experiences, because Americans are still pretty confused by that war, and it’s a scary war to talk about because it lasted so long … and so I started thinking of the guy who lived across the street, Skip Dunn.View image in fullscreenAn image from The War Within a War.Photograph: Penguin Random House“I went back home. Skip had passed away but I started talking to people, and there were five other people who went, five other Black guys, and I happened to have known all of them. And so I said: ‘It damn sure is a book, now that I can pivot off of my childhood experiences, and start traveling around the nation, finding these soldiers to talk about the war.’”Dunn appears on Haygood’s cover, under a helmet, gazing out at the reader. Inside, boldface names include Joseph B Anderson, a West Point graduate and the subject ofThe Anderson Platoon, a 1967 Oscar-winning documentary directed by FrenchmanPierre Schoendoerffer. There is also George Forrest, who fought heroically at Ia Drang, a ferocious battle in 1965; Fred Cherry, an ace pilot shot down the same year, tortured, finally released in 1973; andWallace Terry, a Post and Time reporter who wroteBloods, an oral history published in 1984.Haygood also considers Motown’sresponse to the war, Berry Gordy putting out spoken-word albums of speeches in opposition, Marvin Gaye recording his great albumWhat’s Going Onin part-tribute to his brother, Frankie, one of thousands of psychological casualties.There is Dorothy Harris, a nurse who in Cu Chi in 1967 grew close to an infantry captain, Riley Leroy Pitts, then formed a supportive bond with his widow. There is the remarkablePhilippa Schuyler, a mixed-race former child prodigy pianist who went to Vietnam to save orphaned children, but died on 9 May 1967 when her helicopter went down near Da Nang.Schuyler, Haygood says, “could get away with hiding who she was with white soldiers. But the Black soldier said: ‘No, we know exactly who you are, and we know exactly what you’ve been running from. And baby, we need to bring you up to speed about what’s going on in the world, in America and in Vietnam.’”View image in fullscreenPhilippa Schuyler.Photograph: Library of CongressShifts in political consciousness dot the book, among Black soldiers “dapping” to express solidarity, in chaotic actions such as thelethal uprisingat Long Binh Jail, where Black soldiers disproportionately dominated.Schuyler, Haygood continues, “came to really admire those Black soldiers who wanted to give her tutorials in Black history and in history in general, in the truth of history. You can’t run from facts. I know we’re in an age where people do run from facts, but we shouldn’t.”His words are weighted. As The War Within a War is published, theTrump administrationcontinuesitswaronBlackhistory, particularlyinthemilitary, taking away honors bestowed on Black soldiers. One features prominently in Haygood’s book.‘Every account is slightly different’: who were the real Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday?Read moreIn 1966, at a US base in Cam Ranh Bay, Art Gregg was a lieutenant colonel in logistics. By the time he retired in 1982, he was the first Black three-star general. He was in his 90s when, in the fraught summer of 2020, he discussed with Haygood the murder ofGeorge Floydby a Minneapolis police officer and the protests for racial justice that followed.From 2021, under Joe Biden and former general Lloyd Austin, the first Black secretary of defense, theUS militaryattempted to reckon with its racist past. In 2023, as part of a wider renaming initiative, Fort Lee in Virginia, named for a Confederate civil war general, was renamed Fort Gregg-Adams, honoring Gregg and Lt Col Charity Adams, the highest-ranking Black woman in US forces in the second world war.“This shows the army has come a long way,” Gregg said then.Greggdiedin 2024, aged 96. In 2025, amid a slew of base renamings, theTrump administrationtook awayGregg and Adams’s honor.To Haygood, “it’s unbelievable that a nation as big as ours, steeped in the history of slavery and in the savagery of Jim Crow, would come to a point when it would try to rewrite history.“It was full proof to me, in light of what was happening to Black military history as the Trump administration was trying to wipe away all of these historical moments, that this would be my most timely book.“This is the book the literary gods at this point in life wanted me to write, because I do firmly think that writers and film-makers will step up in this moment, amid this effort to whitewash history.

St Paul’s Cathedral.Photograph: Finchley Thompson/AlamyBook of the dayBooksReviewYour Life Without Me by James Meek review – angel of destruction haunts a domestic dramaA plot to blow up St Paul’s Cathedral is seen through the lens of family tragedyXan BrooksTue 10 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTShareAgreat demolition is also an act of creation, so long as its execution is bold and impressive enough, so long as it clears out the dead wood and opens up the terrain. It’s the ethos that links Pablo Picasso to 1970s punk, Shiva the Destroyer to the anarchist hero of Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent. Rip it up and start again. Or rip it up for the pure thrill of the ripping. In Graham Greene’s short storyThe Destructors, the schoolboy vandals of the Wormsley Common Gang systematically unpick a Christopher Wren-designed London house, working from the inside out so that it dissolves into rubble the moment a supporting post is pulled down. The crime’s one adult witness, a lorry driver, guffaws at the sight. “I’m sorry, I can’t help it,” he tells the home’s distraught owner. “There’s nothing personal, but you got to admit it’s funny.”Raf, the angel of destruction who haunts the wings of James Meek’s graceful, death-haunted domestic drama, is likewise drawn to the work of Wren – although his project is conceived on a much grander scale. Raf is a professional demolition man, a gifted young engineer and natural born radical, easily moved to laughter or tears and effortlessly dazzling everyone in his orbit. For his PhD project, he has been granted free run of St Paul’s Cathedral in order to test the old building’s resistance to modern traffic vibration. He drills discreet holes in the masonry to install movement censors. But he also packs the cavities with Semtex.It’s no spoiler to reveal that Raf never actually completes his masterpiece. At the start of Meek’s novel he’s confined to Belmarsh prison, held without charge and refusing to speak with the authorities, while the narrative doubles back and pitches camp next door, viewing the ripple effect of this would-be terrorist on his unofficial adoptive family. Why does Raf want to blow up St Paul’s Cathedral anyway? He suggests it is because the building gives shape to the city and ennobles its worst excesses. Also because it is obsolete, a tired prop, an unquestioned symbol of virtue and grace. Removing it would be liberating, he thinks. People would mourn it, appreciate it, and then go and build something fresh and new in its place.Meek builds us a beautiful set of protagonists –intricate and compromised, complex, flawed but durableMaybe more institutions would benefit from a visit from Raf, the cab driver’s son from smalltown Lancashire who swings his metaphorical wrecking ball through the home of the respectable Burman family. Middle-aged Mr Burman (we are never told his first name) was Raf’s English teacher and a surrogate father of sorts. He now worries he may have inadvertently sent Raf down the wrong path, fired the kid up with his idle Marxist chatter to the point where Scotland Yard might even view him as an accessory. But it is clear that Raf’s crime is part of a wider, quieter family tragedy. Burman is still reeling from the death of his charismatic wife, Ada, while his adult daughter, Leila, is burning with resentment over a lifetime of slights, perceived or otherwise.Confoundingly, with a neat narrative sleight of hand, Meek reroutes the drama of Raf’s terrorist plot to the comfortable rooms of the Burman family home. He makes the house feel fraught and hazardous, a shell of its former self, with broken glass under every anxious step. Burman longs to speak to Leila as though they are a pair of normal human beings. His daughter is having none of it. She says: “Talking like human beings isn’t how human beings talk.”Meek – the Guardian’s one-time Moscow bureau chief – is best known for his lightly allegorical historical fiction: the 2005 Booker-longlistedThe People’s Act of Loveand 2019’s exhilaratingTo Calais, in Ordinary Time. Despite the modern-day setting, Your Life Without Me is just as interested in the past’s vexed interplay with the present, gliding along the family timeline and across differing viewpoints (Mr Burman, Leila, Raf) to weigh the merits of conservation and demolition, obligation and freedom.The narrative floorplan is that of a high-concept thriller or a state-of-the-nation epic. But the tale unfolds like a magic eye trick, an experiment in psychogeography that makes St Paul’s a proxy for the absent Ada and observes how the landscape is changed by her loss. It’s a neat marriage metaphor that slowly but surely comes into focus; teasingly at first and rather too explicitly near the end. Because for all its precision plotting and insurrectionist flurries, Your Life Without Me works best as a compelling, compassionate portrait of an English family in flux. Meek builds us a beautiful set of protagonists in Burman and Ada, Leila and Raf. His people are intricate and compromised, complex, flawed but durable, and look solidly three-dimensional right up until the moment that they’re not.Your Life Without Me by James Meek is published by Canongate (£18.99).

In 1979, the historian Eugene Genovese remarked that this story “might require 10 large volumes to tell in adequate detail”. Gibson attempts it in 500 pages. Flitting from Baltimore to Bridgetown to Bahia, her 35 chapters are a catalogue of escapes, armed uprisings and revolution – a dense tapestry as rich in stories from Spanish Cuba, Portuguese Brazil, French Martinique or Dutch Curaçao as from the more familiar settings of the United States or the Anglophone Caribbean. Not that it ignores well-known events or prominent people. William Wilberforce and the campaign to end the slave trade feature, as does Abraham Lincoln and the American civil war. But such familiar terrain is placed within a much broader context.Gibson tells her stories with a firm focus on how enslaved people “envisaged their freedom, and fought for it”. Those people include figures such as Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, men born in slavery who rose to become leaders of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), as well as more obscure characters, like an Akwamu noble known as King Claes and a woman known only as Breffu, who in 1733 helped lead an African uprising on the small Danish-Caribbean island of Saint John. Gibson narrates the achievements of escapees who carved out their own “maroon” societies in the upcountry hills and forests of the plantation colonies. We learn how enslaved Africans put to use the martial skills they brought with them across the Atlantic and how, in the 19th century, enslaved people born in the Americas redirected their efforts from escaping into self-contained communities towards a full-frontal attack on the slave system itself.Gibson’s extended chronicle of this “tireless fight for liberation” relies on what she calls “a vast sea of scholarship”. Despite her observation that rebellions have often been “shoved into the margins” in accounts of emancipation, they have caught the attention of generations of scholars, from pioneering historians of resistance such as CLR James and Herbert Aptheker to Genovese (whose work is curiously not mentioned other than in a footnote) and the increasingly varied and detailed scholarship of recent decades.For all her reliance on that rich reservoir of research, however, Gibson finds surprisingly little to say about the most common types of resistance by enslaved people. We know that they tried to bring meaning to their own lives through song and storytelling. They also used small acts of theft or sabotage to strike back against their enslavers, eking out better ways to survive their ordeal. For most people most of the time, that day-to-day defiancewasthe great resistance.Sometimes it burst into the open. As Gibson points out, enslavers were terrified at the very real prospect of the people they treated as “property” responding to the violence of slavery by seeking violently to free themselves. Enslaved people faced oppressors who were heavily armed and continually on guard. Rebellion was relatively rare precisely because it was so risky. The final chapters tell how slavery came to an end at different times and in different ways across the Americas. Historians have long since moved on from explanations that attribute this shift simply to evangelical white abolitionists and enlightened European rulers seeing the light and bestowing the gift of liberty. But debate still rages about just how and to what extent slave uprisings shaped the process.For Genovese, the Haitian Revolution was the critical moment, marking a transition from localised rebellions to a broader push for complete freedom. He called his chapter on the topic “the turning point”. Gibson does her readers no such favours. Amid swiftly drawn sketches involving an ever-changing cast of characters, in chapters with cryptic single-word titles such as “Liberation”, “Lashings” and “Repeat”, it is difficult to detect any clear explanation for the changes sweeping her grand historical landscape.Gibson does note the significance of the Haitian Revolution, describing it as “a volcanic explosion”, the “hot ash and glowing embers” of which ignited “more blazes” across the Caribbean and beyond. Such exhilarating metaphors, however, do not amount to analysis of the influences that were transforming methods of resistance during a time of worldwide revolutionary upheaval.Those transformations were facilitated by transatlantic networks of communication that brought the political cultures of enslaved people across the Americas into dialogue with one another, as well as with the ideas of reformers elsewhere. Despite their profound differences – in ideology, approach and aims – black abolitionists such as Samuel Sharpe, who in 1831 led a huge uprising in British-colonised Jamaica, were inspired in some measure by men like William Wilberforce. In turn, as the Trinidadian historian Gelien Matthews has shown, enslaved rebels in the Caribbean shaped abolitionist thinking in Britain, although that never amounted to equal dialogue.As Gibson reminds us at the conclusion of her book, practically every white act of abolition came with some sort of caveat, whether that was the £20m “compensation” the government awarded to British slaveholders as part of the 1833 emancipation act or the Brazilian “law of the free womb”, which freed children, but only on the basis that they remained under the control of their enslavers until adulthood.In these closing pages Gibson finally offers a cursory overview of key lessons from four centuries of complex conflict. From the outset, as she points out, “people used every possible route out of slavery”; but that is not the same as seeking to overturn the entire institution. She concedes that over time, something else – something more – became apparent: “Freedom had to be for everyone, otherwise it was a lie.”Christer Petley is professor of Atlantic history at the University of Southampton.

From parodying the banality of open-world games with 2007’s No More Heroes to collaborating with James Gunn for 2012’s pulpy Lollipop Chainsaw, his games often offer a welcome reprieve from soulless, half-a-billion-dollar-budget gaming blockbusters. It was with considerable excitement that I fired up Suda’s first new game in 10 years.The game kicks off with a slick cartoon that shows our hero, Romeo Stargazer, being eaten by a zombie. Hastily resurrected by his zany scientist grandfather, Romeo returns from the brink imbued with new powers – and then we’re off. Almost immediately I am bombarded by an impenetrable wall of proper-noun nonsense. It’s like this for the next 20 hours.Romeo is now a “deadman” – a being trapped between life and death – who has been recruited by the FBI’s space time police to stop interstellar criminals from terrorising the cosmos. Along the way you’ll be taking down wave after wave of unstoppable zombies – known in this world inexplicably as “bastards” – while a woman called Juliet sporadically appears in different dimensions, terrorising your dreams in PS2-era 3D, before battling you as an end of level boss. If this description sounds like it’s been written by a kid who hasn’t done his homework, I’m sorry to say that’s because even after playing this game to completion, I’m still none the wiser.In an interview last year, Suda cited Rick and Morty as a major influence on Romeo Is a Dead Man, struggling to explain the game’s story while espousing his love of chicken katsu and sticking it to “the bastards”. I remained hopeful that there would be a deeper meaning underneath all the bafflingly juvenile nonsense, but more fool me.Outside of the story, the game itself initially seems promising. Main missions see you swinging a legally distinct lightsabre as you carve up wave after wave of “bastards”, playing like a souped up successor to the seminal No More Heroes series. Hacking and slashing at zombies is dumb fun, with stylish attacks inviting screen-filling bursts of colour. The boss fights are fun and stylised, and everything feels satisfyingly chaotic. Yet as the game drags its nonsensical story kicking and screaming to the end, even the game engine decides it’s had enough. Despite reviewing this on a PS5 Pro, I found that the frame rate regularly slowed to a crawl as I was mobbed by waves of enemies in later levels, making an already flawed game almost unplayable.In between inter-dimensional killing sprees, players roam a charmingly retro hub world – your FBI-branded spaceship. Here everything is depicted in 16bit-era 2D pixel art, as you roam the spacecraft chatting to Romeo’s shipmates – which include an ancient Roman god, a talking cat and a Jamaican journalist. You can buy new stuff, play mini games and tend ability-granting plants inspired by the different zombies you slay along the way.View image in fullscreenDon’t let the bastards bring you down … Romeo Is a Dead Man.Photograph: Grasshopper Manufacture IncOne thing Romeo Is a Dead Man has going for it is it’s always interesting to look at. From fully animated cartoon sequences to PS2-tribute polygons and sculpture-esque art, this is a game that features more disparate visual styles than most game publishers’ entire catalogue. Yet while it looks eye-catching in trailers, the final playable collage ultimately feels less auteur-led and closer to a child mashing together all the disparate contents of their toybox.Romeo Is a Dead Man is certainly not predictable. It’s capable of getting a baffled smile out of you, and its anti-gaming-establishment attitude will have diehard fans searching for an irony-drenched reason to celebrate it. But where No More Heroes’ simplistic yarn kept the fights flowing and the jokes rolling, Romeo Is a Dead Man’s sprawl feels disappointingly directionless. Instead of coming together as a kitschy universe-spanning epic, this sci-fi story is sadly told with all the mastery of a rambling drunk in Wetherspoons.Romeo Is a Dead Man is out 11 Feb; $49.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5XboxPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Long since converted into shops and then flats, it had a magnetic appeal to a generation of 1990s clubbers whose desire for dancefloor escape justified their queuing for an hour (excepting those who had finessed the art of snogging their way to the front).The Coach and Horses is still up the road, though, as is a town centre that revels in a hedonistic spirit more commonly associated with Magaluf. It is, as Danielle Phillips’s lively play has it, “Yorkshire’s very own Vegas”.The reason for that lies in the town’s proximity to a score of mining villages.Doncasteris where working-class revellers have traditionally gravitated – and continue to do so long after Margaret Thatcher’s assault on the coal industry robbed the area of its economic heart.This is a seam that runs just beneath the surface of Children of the Night which, inspired by interviews with Karisma regulars, is both a celebration of teenage exuberance and a reflection on the social forces shaping popular culture. Writing in a spirited urban poetry – and performing with a brassy confidence – Phillips takes us to a 1997 when the Tories have been kicked out, Robbie Williams has released his first solo LP and the UK has won Eurovision withLove Shine a Light.Guidelines review – teens try to escape the aftermath of a murder filmed on a phoneRead moreThings can only get better and, as two best friends, Lindsay and Jen, make their debut at Karisma (Phillips joined by an equally fizzy Charlotte Brown), the force of DJ Don’s bass heightens the pleasures of dance, drink and debauchery. Darkening the mood in the years to come are acluster of HIV casesand Lindsay’s kindly father (Gareth Radcliffe) suffering cerebral hypoxia, a consequence of his time down the mines.The pacy staging by Kimberley Sykes for Mad Friday Productions is at its zingiest at the start, when references to Mothercare corner and Biscuit Billy’s score laughs of recognition from the home crowd. Later scenes lose some of that spark, but it remains a quietly perceptive account of working-class female experience.AtCast, Doncaster, until 14 February.

No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.”Documents recently released by the US justice department included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman, who was married at the time, and Maxwell from 2003. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal charges that she conspired with Epstein to sexually abuse teenage girls.Wasserman, who is in charge of organising the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, hasapologised for communicating with Maxwell. “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said, adding that it occurred “long before her horrific crimes came to light”.Sex and snacks, but no seat at the table: the role of women in Epstein’s sordid men’s clubRead moreRoan did not mention Epstein or the Epstein files in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure from Wasserman.The 27-year-old said she refused to “passively stand by” and that artists “deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity”.The decision to leave Wasserman “reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust”, she concluded.Wasserman has said he “never had a personal or business relationship” with Epstein but that he did take part in a “humanitarian trip” on his plane. “I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them,” he said.Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing by any of Epstein’s victims, but since the revelations he has been facing mounting pressure to remove himself from his talent agency and to step down from the Olympics organising committee.Roan, who has more than 35 million monthly listeners on Spotify, is the most high-profile artist to cut ties with Wasserman. Her announcement came after other bands it represented released statements distancing themselves from the agency.The indie rock bandWednesday saidthey were “aghast” to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and they hoped he would step down “for the sake of his staff”.The Dropkick Murphys posted on social media: “The namesake of the agency is in the Epstein files so … we GONE.”The rock band Beach Bunny said they were “hugely disappointed and disgusted” that Wasserman “had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell”.Others who shared statements about Wasserman included Best Coast’s frontwoman, Bethany Cosentino, who wrote “people in power can’t keep skating by”, and the experimental indie rock duo Water From Your Eyes, who said they had “no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman”.Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells said the duo would not leave the company, citing the financial impact it would have on the band. “Do I wish I could burn it all down, boycott and divest? Sure I do,” she wrote.Other prominent musicians represented by Wasserman include Ed Sheeran, Kendrick Lamar, Coldplay, SZA, Lorde and Tyler, the Creator.Maxwell is serving a20-year prison sentenceafter being found guilty by a jury in New York of charges including sex trafficking of a minor. She was arrested in 2020 after being accused by federal prosecutors of recruiting and grooming girls for sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.The US justice department’s release of millions of internal documents related to Epstein has revealed the late financier and sex offender’s ties to many prominent people, both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges, including soliciting an underage girl.Epstein’sdeath in 2019in a Manhattan jail cell was ruled a suicide.Explore more on these topicsChappell RoanGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Other sightings placed him in the indie venuethe Brudenell Social Club.Like most things surrounding the rapper, myth, rumour and lore envelop his story. But the central question of why one of hip-hop’s most loved figures spent the final years of his life in Leeds drove Batty and the BBC 6 Music DJAfrodeutscheto attempt to solve the mystery, in MF Doom: Long Island to Leeds.Born in Hounslow in 1971, the rapper – whose real name was Dumile Daniel Thompson – died aged 49 at St James’s hospital in 2020 due to a lack of oxygen to his brain after a reaction to a drug prescribed for blood pressure.View image in fullscreenAdam Batty and Afrodeutsche, the team behind the MF Doom podcast, at a mural celebrating the rapper.Photograph: Adam Batty/MF DOOM: Long Island to LeedsThe fact he was even in Leeds after being barred from entering the US in 2010 was news to many people, including Batty, a journalist and Doom mega-fan. “In a way his story is tragedy,” says Batty. “He was failed by many institutions around the world.”In the podcast Doom-heads, including the comedian Romesh Ranganathan opine about the brilliance of the rapper, who became known in the late 1980s alongside his brother DJ Subroc as the duo KMD. After his brother was killed in a car accident in 1993, Dumile Daniel Thompson re-emerged in 1999 with the album Operation: Doomsday under the moniker MF Doom.His new mask-wearing image and sound was influenced by superhero and comic-book culture. His records, including the 2004 collaboration with Madlib, Madvillainy, are considered some of the best hip-hop records ever made. “Nobody else can tell a story the way he did,” says Afrodeutsche. “It was funny, it was intellectual, it was something that you couldn’t keep still to as well.”The legacy of Doom is contested. The rapper’s wife and former A&R recently resolved a long-running legal disputerevolving around his notebooks, while concrete details about his life in the UK remain thin on the ground. “A lot of people won’t speak,” says Batty. “The family are very suspicious of who’s doing what and why they’re doing it.”That lack of clarity seems to have only driven interest in the rapper who was once described as being “an obstinate and one-of-a-kind genius in the Mingus mould”.Fellow musicians including Yasiin Bey continue to perform his tracks, reissues of his work abound, and a new illustrated biography published by Faber last year added to a growingDoom bibliography. His lyrics were also included in the first new Dr Doom comic published by Marvel in 20 years.The reason he was in the UK is clear: despite arriving in the US as a one-year-old infant, he never secured citizenship or residency in the country. In 2010, after returning from a tour, a border official denied him entry, partially based on the fact he had a criminal record dating back to the 1990s.He then found himself only able to travel to the UK, which meant he had to leave behind his wife and children in Atlanta. In 2023, Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trustissued an apologyfor the substandard care he was given. “I was most shocked about how he was treated,” says Afrodeutsche. “That broke my heart – he was a humble man.”Ultimately, the pair don’t find out why Doom moved to Leeds. Does Batty wish he had solved the riddle of Doom’s time in Leeds? “I don’t think it is an anticlimax as such – the best ending for us is that the mystery lives on.”MF DOOM: Long Island to Leeds is available on BBC Soundsfrom Tuesday 10 February.Explore more on these topicsHip-hopPodcastsRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His teachings were for life as well as the stagePhilippe Gaulier, clown guru and mentor to theatre and comedy greats, dies aged 82Tue 10 Feb 2026 08.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 16.59 ESTShareWhen I was starting out as a theatre-maker, back in the last millennium, there were three ways (or so we thought) you could educate yourself in the trade. If you wanted to be taken seriously and say a lot of words, drama school in the UK was your bag. If you wanted to make theatre with your body, École Jacques Lecoq in Paris beckoned. And if you wanted to perform with your whole heart, shared innocence and transcendent idiocy, you went to ÉcolePhilippe Gaulier. That’s what my pal Alex Murdoch did, and she returned with a suite of his teachings (about clowning and so much more than clowning) that the two of us made theatre with for the next 17 years.Few knew back then, although the process was already under way, that Gaulier –who has died aged 82– would go on to become a bigger name in comedy than in theatre training. This was much to the great man’s disgust. “I hate standup comedy,”he growled at mewhen I interviewed him a decade ago. “I would never teach something so horrible.” And nor did he. But he did teach skills – of playfulness and alertness to a crowd; of being vividly alive in the moment; of celebrating your own ridiculousness – that made standups, sketch comics and clowns much better at their jobs. In his later years, “Gaulier-trained” became a must-have imprimatur for scores of comic acts, particularly those wishing to join in the thrilling boom in innovative clown-comedy that has lit up the circuit in recent times.View image in fullscreenPhilippe Gaulier and Bridget Brandon (director of Drama Action Centre) in 1988.Photograph: Fairfax Media Archives/Getty ImagesThe list of his students and acolytes is long and illustrious, and includes Sacha Baron Cohen (who called him “the funniest man I have ever met”), Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Roberto Benigni. And more recently, the granddaddy of nu-clown, Phil Burgers, alongside smash-hit acts such asJulia Masli,Damian Warren-Smith(of West End hitGarry Starr: Classic Penguins) and Britain’s Got Talent champViggo Venn.Gaulier and his philosophies have had an immeasurably joyful impact on that area of comedy that overlaps with theatre, resulting in a generation of comics who are not just wannabe TV presenters or panel show talking heads in waiting, but who make their work out on a limb, in open dialogue with whomever is in the audience on the night, brimming with (often delinquent) pleasure just to be on stage.Like most great pedagogies, Gaulier’s was an instruction for life as well as for performances. And in his, pleasure and lack of self-seriousness were key. We are all ridiculous. Gaulier taught his students to stop hiding it – to delight in it, in fact, because the specific ways in which we’re ridiculous may be precisely what might make us unique and engaging on stage (and off?). And to have a whole audience looking at you and hanging on your every word? How lucky you are! Don’t squander it, and don’t dare – the worst form of ingratitude, this – be tedious or predictable. Should they ever be, his ex-students would find themselves for years afterwards haunted by a croaky French-accented voice in their heads. “This ees boring. Eet ees so shit!”None of which is to say that Gaulier-trained skills don’t lend themselves to serious theatre, too: his graduates include Kathryn Hunter, Rachel Weisz and the Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush. But even a dramatic actor can bring to their performance – as the best do – a sense of privilege and pleasure that what they’re doing, really, is just playing at being someone else. Gaulier certainly never forgot that it was all, life as well as theatre, a big game – and for teaching so many to play it a little bit more joyfully, he will be long and warmly remembered.Brian Logan is the Guardian’s comedy critic and the artistic director ofA Play, a Pie and a PintExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)TheatreComedy (Culture)ClownsPhilippe GauliercommentShareReuse this content"

They are still loved by their residentsCatherine SlessorTue 10 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 13.05 ESTShareWhen the French architect Renée Gailhoustet died in 2023, the residents of Le Liégat, a social housing block she completed in 1982, put up a large handmade sign saying: “Merci Renée.” Architects are often accused of designing impersonal rabbit hutches that they themselves would never deign to inhabit, but when Gailhoustet died at the age of 93, she had been living in her Liégat duplex in the Parisian suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine for more than 40 years.Outside her living room window, several storeys up, was a large cherry tree and a profusion of greenery. Characterised by their riotous informality, Gailhoustet’s free-plan apartment blocks invariably featured cascading terraces and loggias covered with a foot of soil, so residents could cultivate and enjoyunjardin derrière,a back garden.Over time, planting has enrobed the angular contours of Le Liégat, as it has her other housing schemes, softening and subverting its concrete armature in a kind of post-apocalyptic, nature-takes-over way that plays well on Instagram. Yet it originally sprang from the socially minded view that people should have access to green space, anticipating today’s preoccupation with a more eco architecture, capable of mitigating the effects of rising temperatures. In 2003,around 15,000 people diedin France in a heatwave. Planting provides natural shade and cooling.View image in fullscreen‘We merely wish to create possibilities for choice’ … Gailhoustet in 2014.Photograph: Valérie SadounGailhoustet might be described as an “eco-brutalist”, but her work across the decades, after she graduated in architecture from Paris’s École des Beaux-Arts in 1961, cannot be easily pigeonholed. She specialised in social housing and urban planning in the suburbs beyond thepériphérique–the less privileged, less photogenic Paris, where few tourists venture. Often combined with communal facilities such as shops and cafes, her housing megastructures were formally and spatially complex, like modern mini-cities. Designed to be adaptable over time as residents’ living arrangements changed, individual apartments were generously proportioned, with space, light and air flowing in all directions.Homes are not machines for living in – but gentle, human, individual spacesLe Corbusier famously remarked that a house was “a machine for living in”, anaperçuthat has dogged modernist architecture down the decades. Although her work is undoubtedly modernist, Gailhoustet took the opposite position: that homes should be shaped by their occupants and architecture should provide a template for elaboration and enrichment, rather than soul-numbing constriction. “The idea of social housing as an addition of little functional room boxes,” she once wrote, “should not be given sociological sanction. Almost no one living in those conditions chose to. We are not so pretentious as to propose an ideal dwelling. We merely wish to create possibilities for choice.”Architect and academic Nichola Barrington-Leach, editor of a hefty forthcoming tome on Gailhoustet, explains her appeal: “Her work invites us to imagine new ways of living together as an ecosystem, to reframe our relationship with nature, the city, with each other and ourselves. Homes are not machines for living in – but gentle, human, individual spaces.”View image in fullscreenRadical … La Maladrerie in Aubervilliers.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyIn a career dedicated to building more than 2,000 social homes, Gailhoustet offered a visionary riposte to thegrands ensembles,the industrialised and standardised postwar housing developments that dominate the peripheries of most French cities. Commissioned directly by leftwing municipalities, she was able to work freely and experimentally to an open brief but still had to conform to a limited budget. “She used those constraints to develop her vision and ideas,” says Barrington-Leach. “And I think that’s the message I get from her – which is, actually, you can do so much with so little.”In tandem with the book, which will be the first English language book solely dedicated to Gailhoustet’s oeuvre, Barrington-Leach has curated an exhibition,A Thousand and One Ways of Living, at London’s Architectural Association (AA), where she teaches. The exhibition takes its title from the words of Rima Abdul Malak, a former French minister of culture, who observed that Gailhoustet’s architecture offers “a thousand and one ways of inhabiting our world”.Part of the AA’s grand Georgian interior has been subtly transformed into a 1:1 scale installation of a Le Liégat apartment. “The aim was to bring one of her flats into the AA,” says Barrington-Leach, “to show her spaces rather than just her ideas.” Walls are represented by thick sheets of white paper suspended by cable ties from steel wires strung across the exhibition space defining the level of the apartment’s ceiling height. Intended to convey proportions and relationships, the effect is both abstractly sculptural and intimately functional, poetry infused with pragmatism.Along with photographs and drawings, different dwelling types are further represented by smaller scale models in card and cast concrete – bizarre, sharp-edged and waywardly random. Yet the appearance of complexity belies an underlying constructional simplicity and clarity, based on a hexagonal structural grid and lightweight partitions that could be easily rearranged. Gailhoustet once described the architect’s role as being “an artisan of a difficult material: space”.View image in fullscreenSo much with so little … housing in Ivry-sur-Seine.Photograph: Sacha Trouiller / NVBL ArchitectsBorn in Oran, Algeria, in 1929, the daughter of the deputy director of the Echo d’Oran newspaper, Gailhoustet grew up in the coastal city’s European quarter before moving to Paris for university. She alighted on architecture after studying philosophy at the Sorbonne, a move impelled by an ambition to build rather than theorise, underscored by her political convictions. She was active in the Young Communist movement and, during periodic clashes with far-right groups, had the dubious distinction of once having her nose broken by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the country’s National Front party.Between 1963 and 1985, Gailhoustet oversaw the radical transformation of Ivry-sur-Seine, on the south-east edge of Paris, while working on projects in other suburban locales, including La Maladrerie in Aubervilliers, to the north. Animated by an abundance of civic spaces – a library, cultural centre, home for elderly people and a children’s centre, along with shops, gardens and artist’s studios – La Maladrerie was designed in 10 phases, took 10 years to build and is her largest project, with 850 dwellings.By the 1990s, however, the political context had changed, with France’s central government increasingly hostile to large-scale housing projects. Work began to dry up and in 1999 she closed her practice for good.Cage fights at the White House! A gigantic arch! Trump’s gaudy plans for America’s 250th anniversaryRead moreFor decades, Gailhoustet has remained on the margins of architectural history, her reputation overshadowed, to an extent, by Jean Renaudie, whom she met in her mid-20s. They lived together for around 15 years, had two daughters, and collaborated on several projects. But her pioneering contribution is now being acknowledged, albeit belatedly. In 2022, a year before she died, she was awarded the Royal Academy architecture prize. “Her achievements reach far beyond what is produced as social or affordable housing anywhere today,” said jury chair Farshid Moussavi.Crucially, rather than top down, her design process was collaborative. Concepts such as open-plan living and garden terraces were discussed with residents through large-scale physical models. And though some occupants initially struggled with the lack of conformity, finding it difficult to imagine themselves in unorthodox geometries and unprescribed spaces, the homes she built are still loved and sought after.Most of Gailhoustet’s housing is still council-owned and, despite decades of state neglect and some misguided renovations, resident groups continue to fight for the preservation of her work, successfully listing several buildings. “She proved that we can explore alternative ways of living and create a framework for our cities that allows for adaptation and reuse,” says Barrington-Leach. “Her legacy, like her architecture, is growing as a living archive: evolving with every resident and every season.”Renée Gailhoustet: A Thousand and One Ways of Living is at the Architectural Association, London, until 21 MarchRenée Gailhoustet, edited by Nichola Barrington-Leach, will be published by AA Publications in late March and is available to pre-order from the Architectural Association BookshopThis article was amended on 10 February 2026 to clarify that the forthcoming book on Renée Gailhoustet will be the first English language booksolelydedicated to Gailhoustet’s oeuvre; an earlier version indicated it would be the first per se.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this week was different. After a reckless coffee-and-clothing spending spree made a mighty dent in my bank account, I decided I needed to take action. Self-control was one option, but another more drastic route was blunt-force restriction. I would ditch contactless payments, along with debit and credit cards. Instead, I would spend a week relying solely on cash.After subtracting the lavish lattes and Asos deliveries that had massively inflated my average weekly spend, I allowed myself £180 for the basics, including food and travel. For safety, I gave myself an extra £20. The first task was to take out £200 in cash from the ATM. But what the hell was my pin number? Thanks to contactless capabilities, I hadn’t used this all-important combination of digits in more than a year. Googling how to find it, I discovered I’d have to wait three to five working days to get a letter reminding me of it in the post. This wouldn’t do. I decided to head to my local bank to explain my predicament.“Have you got ID?” said the cashier. I did. “You can take out cash now,” he continued. Perfect. I left the bank with a wad of £20 notes, feeling optimistic about my cash-dependent week ahead.Day 1. Starting balance: £200I still had that week’s worth of money in my hand when a fairly strong gust of wind hit me, and I clasped the notes for dear life. I was going to need something to keep this cash safe. The thought of splashing a chunk of my budget on a wallet seemed irresponsible. There had to be another, more cost-effective option. I came across it in Tesco: a flat, translucent pencil case, slightly bigger than the size of a bank note. Perfect – and, even better, it cost just £1.Before heading to the till with my purchase, I picked up a few others bits: 1kg of chicken (£7.90), three packs of Tilda microwaveable basmati rice (£1.05 each), a 200g bag of tenderstem broccoli (£1.35) and a 1kg bag of porridge oats (£1.35). I instinctively headed to the self-checkout machines when the slightly stressed employee directing shoppers yelled out: “Card only!” I lugged my basket to the long queue of people waiting for the cashier-staffed till. I could feel my foot tapping impatiently as customers made small talk with the woman behind the till, who scanned goods at a leisurely pace.“Cash or card?” asked the cashier, but not before dispensing a few cooking tips. I pulled out my wad and handed over my first £20 note.Total spend:£14.75Day 2. Starting balance: £185.25I usually ride a speedy Lime bike to Guardian HQ in London, and it only dawned on me when heading out of the house – and with 20 minutes to spare before my first meeting (it takes me 15 minutes to cycle in) – that Lime only accepts digital payments. OK, don’t stress, I thought, as I hyperventilated into my plastic wallet.View image in fullscreenGecsoyler realises he can’t rent a Lime bike with a cash payment.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianTime was ticking and even the bus stop was useless (buses in Londonhaven’t accepted cashsince 2014). Accepting the fact I would be late, I rushed to the corner shop to buy an Oyster card. After a small queue for the till (something I soon learned would be common in my cash-only journey), I asked how much an Oyster card would be. Surely it couldn’t be more than a fiver. £10, said the cashier, for the card alone. Open-mouthed, but aware of the time, I handed over one of my precious £20 notes, giving me credit on the card of £10, before running for the tube (which took £2.80 off my balance).Where will I get £2 in a cashless world?Read moreAfter a stressful morning, I fancied a Nando’s for lunch. Usually, I would pre-order on the app, but, surprise, this is only possible if you’re paying by card. I tried to give the nearby branch a call but, with the lunchtime rush approaching, no one answered, so I hurriedthere. My quarter chicken with spicy rice and tenderstem broccoli came in at £12 – but by the time I was handed my takeaway bag, I had just 20 minutes to eat it. At the end of the day, instead of beating the public transport crowds by whizzing home on my green, electric two-wheeler, I tapped in (another £2.80 from my Oyster) and joined them on the tube.Total spend: £32View image in fullscreenLondon buses no longer accept cash, so Gecsoyler had to buy an Oyster card in a corner shop.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 3. Starting balance: £153.25Do you know what I hadn’t had for a while? A fancy coffee. I headed to my local upmarket cafe where I have previously tapped away an ungodly sum, this time with loose coins weighing down my pencil wallet. I told the barista my convoluted order (a decaf caramel latte with oat milk), which would set me back £4.60. I readied my coins, smugly preparing to hand over the exact amount – but, instead of thanking me for saving him the trouble of working out the change, the barista simply tapped the sign next to the till: “Card only.”According to Shankha Basu, associate professor of marketing at the University of Leeds, there are practical reasons why many businesses have shunned cash, including reducing the risk of theft. There are costs related to handling cash, too. “You need to keep a till,” he says, “and you need to make sure that at the end of the day, or the week, you physically go to the bank and deposit the cash.”. Card payments can feel like “much less of a hassle”. There’s also a more sordid side to this shift: consumers “think less about whether they need the product or not” with card or contactless payments, says Basu, and are more willing to choose more premium options or add-ons because “we are less sensitive to buying something that costs more than we initially intended to spend” when not physically handing over cash.I left the card-only cafe empty-handed. Instead of trying another trendy, gentrified coffee shop where my physical tender would probably be rejected, I opted for a place where cash was not only accepted, it was king: the greasy spoon cafe. After queueing behind a group of builders, who all pulled out notes to settle their bills, I made a slightly less pretentious order: a black coffee with a splash of milk. At £1.50, it was a more humble brew, but it did the job.View image in fullscreenCard only … his local upmarket cafe refused Gecsoyler’s carefully counted cash.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianI shunned the packed-out tube and walked the 50 minutes to the office. I also went for a slightly less lavish lunch: a Tesco meal deal, albeit the slightly fancier Tesco Finest bundle (£5).Total spend:£6.50Day 4. Starting balance: £146.75To reward my cash-only discipline, I decided I deserved a treat: a takeaway. I am a takeaway addict who pays £4.99 a month for Uber One (which cuts down the sometimes hefty food delivery fees), and I usually make an order at least once a week. This means I’m used to having access to nearly every cuisine imaginable at my fingertips. But it turns out that most places, especially chain restaurants such as Wagamama, KFC and Dishoom, only offer deliveries through third party apps such as Deliveroo – and they only accept card payments. If I want a cash-friendly option, I need to go about ordering food the old-fashioned way– phoning a local takeaway with in-house delivery drivers.I was hoping to keep things healthy-ish so I went for a chicken shish with chips (rice wasn’t an option). When I phoned, I wasn’t quite sure how it worked – would I just tell them what I wanted and where to send it? No card details, passport number or fingerprint scan to prove I wasn’t a fibber? And, more importantly, no tracker to see how far away my driver was? There were moments where I wasn’t confident I would be having dinner, but after about 40 minutes, it arrived. It was pretty cheap too: £11 with a drink. No inflated delivery charge, service charge or small order fees. Maybe ordering direct from a takeaway is the way to go.Total spend:£11View image in fullscreenGecsoyler ordering a takeaway on the phone instead of on his regular app.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 5. Starting balance: £135.75This was the real test: I decided to go shopping with a friend in central London. I usually go out with no intention of buying anything and come home with a dent in my bank account. I tapped my Oyster to enter the tube (£2.80 deducted from my topped-up balance) and had a wander around a few shops. At first, nothing really caught my fancy but then a fragrance I’ve had my eye on for a while was marked down in a clearance sale (from £180 to £90). It’s such a good deal, I kept telling myself. I pulled out my pencil case and counted the notes I had left: 66% of my remaining budget would be wiped out if I gave in, leaving me with £45.75.There was something about feeling the stack of notes between my fingers that made me think twice. It physically felt like a lot of money. According to Basu, the hesitance I experienced is a common consumer behaviour. “Spending cash feels painful, because you physically experience something going away from you,” he says. In contrast, when you pay for things with cards or contactless methods, “that feeling of loss is a bit muted, which leads people to spend much more money than they otherwise would do.” I put the bottle down.After my exceptional display of willpower, I went for dinner with my friend. A burger (£15) and three cocktails (£12 each) later and it was past midnight. I needed to catch the last train. I walked briskly to the station and tapped in. The barriers didn’t open. I didn’t have enough money on my Oyster. Panicked, I rushed to the top-up machine and shoved in a tenner. My train was leaving in two minutes. By the time my Oyster was replenished, I had one minute. I ran down the escalator in a mad hurry, breaking several health and safety rules in the process, and collapsed into the carriage before the doors shut behind me. A very close call and a reminder that the cash-only lifestyle means being topped up at all times.Total spend:£61Day 6. Starting balance: £74.75My sisters and I had planned a day trip to Rye, East Sussex. Usually, I buy my ticket in advance on Trainline so I can scan and sprint through the barriers moments before the train departs, but I arrived at the station early, knowing I would need to buy my ticket in person. The total was £39.50. Out of interest, I checked the same journey on the Trainline app: £41.49; I’d made a £1.99 saving, which made the £2.50 bottle of water I bought during our changeover at Ashford International sting a little less. After arriving, we went for an ice-cream (£3 for a delicious soft serve) and had a wander around the charity shops. I left with three books, priced at £1 each and, while queueing in a line filled exclusively with cash-wielding people some years older than me, I felt like part of the majority when I proudly handed the cashier some coins.For dinner, we went to a Thai restaurant where I opted for a £10 pad thai. I was the only person on the table not to brandish a card when paying our bill. My younger sister was startled and tried to insist she would cover my contribution for now, to speed things along, but I resisted and handed over my crinkly tenner.Total spend:£58Day 7. Starting balance: £16.75I spent the day at home, doing nothing and eating the last of my Tesco shop, leaving me with a lot of time to reflect on my cash-only week. With more than a tenner left in my trusty and slightly worn pencil-wallet, I think it’s fair to call the week a success. I spent far less than I usually would and, more importantly, I really thought about every purchase.I’m suddenly eager to pay for more things with cash – but I appear to be in the minority. According to a report by the trade association UK Finance, cash was used for 9% of all transactions in 2024:the first time this figure has dipped below 10%. In comparison,34% of all payments were made in cash in 2017. A study last year by the cash machine network Link found thatfewer than half of peoplein the UK now carry a physical wallet.UK Finance also predicts that notes and coins will account for only 4% of all payments made in the UK in 2034. After my cash-only week, this feels like a shame. Not only did I rein in my spending, but I had more face-to-face contact with people (the constant queues began to grow on me) and the slight restrictions (takeaway options, coffee shop choices) had actually made life simpler.As for next week, my cards are coming out of retirement – but they’ll be stashed in my makeshift wallet alongside some trusty notes. I’m also looking forward to finding out my pin number.Total spend: £0Explore more on these topicsLife and styleContactless paymentsBanks and building societiesConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For 28 hours he choked on fumes near a lava lake, fighting to get to safetyEmma RussellTue 10 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareThe 1993 erotic thrillerSlivershould have ended differently: Zeke, played by William Baldwin, was scripted to fly a helicopter towards an active volcano, after Sharon Stone’s character, Carly, reveals she’s the killer. The pilot, Craig Hosking, had been tasked with flying low over Hawaii’s Kīlauea volcano, accompanied by the director of photography, Mike Benson, and his assistant Christopher Duddy, to film the bubbling lava and white plumes of smoke escaping from the Puʻu ʻŌʻō vent. It was a clear day on the Big Island when Duddy watched a corkscrew trail form in the smoke behind the helicopter, and he remembers thinking: “I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this.”It was November 1992, and a big storm was due to hit the area, so they were shooting as much footage as they could along the coast, capturing the rainforest and brilliant blue ocean shimmering against the black lava of the volcano, before the weather disrupted production. But as they dipped over Puʻu ʻŌʻō for a second time, the helicopter’s engine failed. Their visibility faded as thick smoke engulfed them. Duddy jolted his eyes away from the camera monitors towards the open doors and saw that they were heading straight for a cliff. There was a loud crash as the rotor sheared off on impact and the helicopter went into freefall.We started looking around and realised we were inside the volcano, about 50 yards away from the lava poolDuddy doesn’t remember how long they were plummeting – everything seemed to happen so fast. They were lucky to land upright, on the helicopter’s skids, on a ledge. Hosking’s eye had a gash and blood was pouring down his face, but they were all alive. “We didn’t even realise where we were when we jumped out. Then we started looking around and realised we were inside the volcano, about 50 yards away from the lava pool.”Immediately, they began to choke on the fumes. Duddy’s eyes burned from the sulphur, which smelled of rotting eggs, and they all coughed uncontrollably. He could feel the heat of the boiling lava through his shoes and smoke was shooting from his footprints with each step. To escape, they needed to climb a 300-ft cliff-face to the volcano’s mouth. “I got in the lead because I was maybe the most scared,” says Duddy. “I’m definitely afraid of heights,” he says. “But it was pure survival mode.”The climb itself “was gnarly. You would grab on to the dried lava and it would just break away and rocks would come flying down.” Duddy scrambled halfway up the inside wall and, when he couldn’t go any further, took root on a little ledge. He could hear the others hundreds of feet below him, but he couldn’t see them.Hosking returned to the site of the crash to call for help on the helicopter’s radio, which had been crushed like a beer can. The dash was broken so the radio didn’t work but he managed to connect the camera battery and make a mayday call. “Every once in a while, the smoke would clear and you could see the helicopter on the ledge at the bottom of the volcano. Craig kept running up to this little mound to get some cleaner air because he was really choking and coughing and vomiting. He was not good. It was a little better where we were, on the cliff. There was a little pocket of air that was breathable.”They heard a helicopter hovering overhead. Hosking was yelling to Duddy and Benson, but they couldn’t make out what he was saying, and then everything went quiet. “We thought he’d died,” says Duddy. In fact, the volcano park rescuers had picked Hosking up, but it sent Duddy into a panic. Benson was calmer. He kept saying: “Just stay put. They know we’re in here. They’re going to rescue us.”View image in fullscreenSteam and lava flowing from Hawaii’s Kīlauea volcano in 1992.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesSure enough, a couple of hours later, the volcano park rescue team returned on foot and yelled down from the rim and began throwing ropes. “I felt a sense of relief,” says Duddy. But after several hours of the rope missing their location – they couldn’t see where the men were through the thick smoke – he started getting frustrated. “You hear the whoosh, the rope comes down again, and it was still 10ft away.” The rescue team were struggling – there was a huge crack on the rim, and they were worried that if they put too much weight on it, they would cause a landslide.Then there was silence. “We’re yelling: ‘Throw the rope down, throw the rope down.’ And we hear nothing. An hour would go by and we’d hear nothing. It started to get real worrisome.” The storm had gathered power. “It starts to rain on us. I’m soaking wet, I can’t see, can’t breathe.” Although the hot lava wasn’t that far away, the wind and rain made it very cold. It was November, about 5.30pm, the sun was setting and Duddy was “losing hope”. The rescuers returned, only to tell them they’d come back at first light because the weather was getting too bad. “We’re like, wait, what? We’re gonna be in here all night?”Throughout the night, there were all these trembles. You could hear the lava flowPerching on the rock, unable to fall asleep for fear of falling off the cliff, was terrifying and exhausting – but also incredibly beautiful. “It was like a light show in there. All these colours of orange, red and yellow, through the mist,” says Duddy. “Throughout the night, there were all these trembles. You could hear the lava flow. It was like when you’re camping by a river and you can hear it flowing.” Duddy curled up into the foetal position, pulling his sweatshirt over his face and putting his baseball hat on to create a tent that he could breathe in. He kept his eyes closed most of the time, otherwise they would burn from the fumes, and left his sunglasses on a ridge so that the rain would pool on them and he could hydrate himself a little.At first light, the rescue team returned but the weather got worse and worse until, at midday, they disappeared again.Duddy sensed the only way he was going to survive was by getting himself out. On late Sunday afternoon, the clouds started to break and a beam of sunlight hit the cliff above him. “I saw this path, and I’m like: ‘Oh my God, why haven’t I seen this path for the past 28 hours?’” At this point, his throat was swollen from the sulphur-soaked air, he was struggling to breathe and he thought: “Either I’m going to die sitting here or I’m going to die trying to get out.”He started climbing. “I was very athletic growing up. I have two older brothers and we played sports, but I was never a rock climber or anything. I think it was pure adrenaline.” But when he was about 5ft from the rim, the surface flattened, becoming impossible to scale. “Whereas below there had been big chunks of lava rock that you could grab on to, here there was nothing.” He used all his strength to stay rooted in position, knowing he wouldn’t survive the 300ft fall if he lost his grip. Eventually, he dug his arms into the gravel for leverage to lunge up. “It was like sticking your arm into broken glass because it was sharp. I was shredding my arms,” he says. “I don’t even know how it worked but I got my arms in and I just flipped myself and landed on the rim on my back. I was laying there looking up and I’m like: ‘I did it.’”At the top he watched, mesmerised, as the smoke swirled in the rain. Quickly, jumping to his feet, he started racing down the back of the cone, while Benson stayed put, still waiting for the rescue team to return. “It’s like you’re on the moon,” says Duddy. “The lava fields are otherworldly but you don’t know if you’re going to step into a crevasse or crunch into another lava tube.”He followed orange cones the rescuers had laid out to create a pathway to a camp, which was deserted except for a couple of tents, bottles of water and some oxygen tanks. Duddy started guzzling the water but it wouldn’t go down because his throat was so sore. He put the oxygen tank on and waved down a helicopter that had been flying back to the small base camp set up on the side of the volcano. “The minute the guy grabbed me, my whole body went completely limp. Like I just became paralysed. They had to pick me up, carry me to the helicopter and strap me in,” says Duddy, who hadn’t eaten or slept for more than 28 hours. “I just started bawling and I was like: ‘Mike is still alive, you got to go get Mike, let’s go get Mike!’”View image in fullscreen‘It changed my perspective on everything. I felt I was invincible.’Photograph: Jessica Pons/The GuardianAt base camp there was a frenzied scene: ambulances, fire trucks and news vans all focused on Duddy. Hosking ran up to the helicopter and helped him to the ambulance, which transported him to the hospital for monitoring.With the sun setting, the rescue team said they wouldn’t be able to recover Benson until the following day. The next morning, a pilot set off with a basket on a rope hanging from his helicopter. It was a whiteout over the volcano again. The first time he dropped the basket, it hit the cliff and a big rock fell into it, which the pilot thought was Benson. But the second time, he succeeded, flying Benson to base camp in the basket. “It was three different rescues on three different days,” says Duddy. “It’s pretty unbelievable that we all survived that ordeal.”When Duddy got home, he says his phone never stopped ringing. He did interviews for magazines and newspapers, and all three of the men went on the Oprah Winfrey show. Someone wrote a script for a movie telling the story of his miraculous escape from the volcano, but it was never made. Sliver’s director scrapped the original ending – another character was outed as the killer, and the volcanic finale was replaced with a shootout.My husband was murdered on holiday – and my whole world collapsedRead moreApart from the bronchitis that saw him coughing up sulphuric phlegm for several months, Duddy’s physical ailments were minimal. He was worried about lung damage, so started exercising and doing cardio work, including mountain biking around Los Angeles, where he lives. What was more difficult to overcome was the psychological impact of the accident – he had a panic attack the first time he flew in a helicopter after the accident, and developed a fear of commercial planes.Duddy had done a lot of aerial photography before the crash. After the accident, he began working with Canadian director James Cameron and his company Digital Domain, where in 1997 he was the visual effects director of photography on Titanic and Dante’s Peak, a disaster flick about a volcano erupting in a small town. Duddy was asked to travel to Mount St Helens, a volcano in Washington state to shoot footage. “I was like: ‘I’m not going to fly over another volcano. Are you crazy?’”Despite this, his career took off after the crash. In the early 00s, he started his own production company and, later that decade, directed his first movie, Cougar Club. “The crash changed my perspective on everything really,” he says. “I just had a tremendous amount of confidence and bravado because I felt as if I was invincible.” But that didn’t mean he wanted to relive any part of his traumatic experience. “I would run into Craig and every time I would see him, he would just start crying. He would hug me and he would start crying.”In 2021, he returned toHawaiito film two seasons of Magnum PI, including an episode featuring a helicopter rescue in the jungle. “A couple of times, I had to walk away from where we were shooting,” he says. “I was having full flashbacks. It was wild.”Despite the trauma of the crash, the island still has a special place in Duddy’s heart. “There’s something about the air there. Maybe it has something to do with my experience after being rescued and breathing again. The ocean water is a perfect temperature, the climate is not too humid, it’s not too hot. The people are wonderful,” he says. “Going back, I felt really lucky.”Explore more on these topicsHelicopter crashesHow we surviveVolcanoesHawaiifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some crave a single perfect shot of espresso, while others seek the milkiest latte; some love Starbucks and others, well, don’t. This is why the idea of there being a single best coffee machine is fanciful – everyone’s idea of the perfect coffee couldn’t be more different.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a selfless service to coffee drinkers everywhere, I’ve spent the past year researching and trialling coffee machines to produce a shortlist of tried-and-tested recommendations. The list spans all the main types of coffee maker: manual espresso, filter, bean-to-cup and capsule. (Not sure what all of this means? Read our dedicated guide tothe different types of coffee machine.)I’ve aimed this guide at everyday coffee lovers who want to up their game without spending a fortune or losing hours to perfecting their craft. Ease of use, simplicity and relative affordability play just as important a role as the quality of the coffee.

I’ve tested every type of machine, from capsule, filter and fully automated bean-to-cup models all the way through to fully manualespresso machines.Sadly, though, I have had to accept defeat in my pursuit of latte art mastery – despite the occasional happy accident, most of my attempts resemble indecent cave drawings. I apologise in advance for any incriminating photo evidence.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe coffee machines were tested across criteria such as taste and usability.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianI tested (or retested) 29 machines, several of which I’ve reviewed previously and three of which have a permanent place on my kitchen worktop. I’ve also pored over user reviews and forums, and consulted the recommendations of trusted coffee experts online and on YouTube, in the search for other models to test.Every machine has been run alongside either my own go-to machines or a curated selection of rivals for side-by-side taste and usability testing. Several kilos of fresh coffee beans and a pile of Nespresso-compatible pods have been sourced directly from my go-to roaster,Craft House Coffee. I’ve used the manufacturers’ official pods where applicable, too.For the filter and espresso machines that don’t have an integrated coffee grinder, I’ve used my own: aBaratza Vario W+and aKingrinder K6 hand grinder. I consumed so much coffee during the testing process that my blood type is now skinny macchiato.After testing, any coffee machines sourced for this article are either being returned to their sources or donated toWell Wishers, the official charity of the Walsall healthcare NHS trust.The best coffee machines in 2026View image in fullscreen‘A beginner’s dream’: the Sage Bambino Plus.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianBest budget manual coffee machine:De’Longhi Stilosa EC230De’LonghiStilosa EC230from£99.95£105 at Argos£99.95 at AmazonWhat we loveTasty espresso; low priceWhat we don’t lovePlasticky buildPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£105 at Argos£99.95 at AmazonNo, it’s not a typo: the Stilosa EC230 really is that affordable. With some takeaway coffees commanding £4 a pop, you could forgo just one month of paper cups of coffee and save enough to buy your own espresso machine. And boy, does the Stilosa make a great espresso.Why we love itThe price is obviously a big part – after all, we love a bargain – but it would be a false economy if it didn’t deliver the espresso-based goods. Connoisseurs may want more features and control, but they’ll probably be pretty surprised, too. Feed the Stilosa with great-quality, well-ground beans from a good grinder, and it’ll serve stunning coffee.I got great results from the medium-light roast beans I had to hand, and pairing the Stilosa with myKingrinder K6 grinderwas a match made in heaven. Espresso was flavourful and well balanced. Although the steam wand lacks oomph, with a bit of practice, it serves up silky hot milk with a dense microfoam. The result? Great espresso, wonderful flat whites, moreish cappuccinos.Make sure you check the model number before buying, though. TheEC235and EC260 look almost identical, but swap the manual steam wand for an automatic steam wand and pressurised coffee baskets. That means easier but inferior milk frothing and middling espresso – if you’re planning to feed the Stilosa good, freshly ground coffee, then buy the EC230.It’s a shame that …you don’t get everything you need in the box. The water tank feels cheap, and there’s no option to fit a water filter – although that can be fixed by buying a separate water filter jug.It comes with a piece of plastic that resembles a plastic tamper and coffee scoop, but it’s useless at the former and merely OK at the latter. My advice?Buy a proper metal tamper for under a tenner.The spouts also tend to drip as there’s no pressure valve, so have a cloth handy. Maybe an apron, too.Machine type:manual espressoDimensions:21x 34 x 29cm (WDH)Time to heat up:1min 30secsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:80dB (61dB average)Warranty:one year repair or replaceDe’LonghiStilosa EC230from£99.95£105 at Argos£99.95 at AmazonWhat we loveTasty espresso; low priceWhat we don’t lovePlasticky buildBest budget bean-to-cup coffee machine:De’Longhi Magnifica Evo One TouchDe’LonghiMagnifica Evo One Touchfrom£369£369 at Peter Tyson£370 at ArgosWhat we loveMilk-based coffees at the touch of a buttonWhat we don’t loveSmall milk carafe£369 at Peter Tyson£370 at ArgosI’ve tested several De’Longhi bean-to-cup machines over the years, all the way up to its range-topping £2,299.99Maestosa, but the Magnifica Evo One Touch is the best-value pick by a margin. It serves up tasty espressos, americanos and lattes with minimum fuss.Why we love itThe machine is fairly compact by bean-to-cup standards, although you’ll need to leave a little room around and above the machine. Bright, illuminated icons along the top edge evoke the glow of touchscreens on pricier models, but these are simple buttons. You can choose from seven different drinks, and the built-in milk carafe allows you to craft cappuccinos and creamy lattes with zero hassle.The quality of the drinks isn’t as immaculate as the pricier Jura C8, but it’s not far off. Espresso is rich and flavourful, hitting about 68C, and cappuccinos and latte macchiatos are topped with a pleasingly dense layer of creamy foam. The MyLatte drink option will prove popular: fill the carafe with the right amount of milk for your preferred coffee cup, and the machine will drain the carafe and add a shot of coffee.It’s a shame that …it’s not quiet. The grinder’s whines peak at 75dB, and the average noise level of 60dB is markedly louder than the Jura. The lack of a dedicated hot milk function feels like an oversight.Machine type:bean to cupDimensions:24 x 44 x 36cm (WDH)Time to heat up:35 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:75dB (average 60dB)Warranty:two years repair or replace at De’Longhi’s discretionDe’LonghiMagnifica Evo One Touchfrom£369£369 at Peter Tyson£370 at ArgosWhat we loveMilk-based coffees at the touch of a buttonWhat we don’t loveSmall milk carafeBest for capsules:L’or Barista SublimeL’orBarista Sublimefrom£45.56£49 at John Lewis£45.56 at AmazonWhat we loveGood results with Nespresso and L’or capsulesWhat we don’t loveDrip tray too small£49 at John Lewis£45.56 at AmazonBuilt by Philips, this L’or-branded machine makes a huge range of coffees thanks to its compatibility with official Nespresso, Nespresso-compatible and L’or’s own range of pods. It doesn’t support the latest Vertuo pods, but this machine looks great and works well.Why we love itThe compact dimensions are a big plus, and the design is (mostly) sensible. There’s a removable 0.8-litre water tank at the rear, and the drip tray and pod bin slide out together.It’s easy to use, too. Simply lift the large curved handle on top, pop in a capsule and close the lid. You can also pour two normal-size cups simultaneously.I wasn’t a fan of some of the more potent XXL L’or espresso pods – although the high-street chain flavour may be to some tastes – but there are more than 100 options from which to choose.It’s a shame that …the drip tray, lid and pod bin separate with minimal encouragement, so it’s easy to send their contents scattering across your kitchen floor if you’re not paying attention. Nor is it the quietest machine, although it’s unlikely to wake up the household.Some users have reported that the machine doesn’t play nicely with all Nespresso-compatible capsules. I had no such problems during my testing, but it’s worth buying a handful of capsules to test before buying in bulk.Opinions are mixed on thesustainability of capsule coffee, butL’orandNespresso’sstandard aluminium capsules can be sent back for recycling – both companies provide free postage options for returning capsules in bulk.

It still makes black and white coffees, with adjustable levels of froth no less, but the big appeal is the swappable bean hoppers.Why we love itIf you love the idea of having decafandcaffeinated coffee ready to go, then the Rivelia answers your prayers. You get two 250g bean hoppers in the box, and you swap between them with a quick twist and a click. The touchscreen pipes up as you do so: you can choose to brew one last coffee from the beans in the chute, or purge them into the internal bin. If the choice of two bean varieties isn’t enough, you can buyextra hoppersfor about £18 a pop.Flexibility goes hand in hand with an unconventional design. Eschewing the usual big, black cuboid template, the Rivelia has a smaller, more slender footprint. The 1.4-litre water tank protrudes out of the side, and the hopper pokes out of the top, but the smaller main unit looks much less imposing.The touchscreen interface is a joy. It’s slick and helpful, and deftly guides users throughout the process of making and customising drinks with friendly, helpful, onscreen messages. You can create up to four user profiles, too, so everyone can have their preferred drinks and settings loaded and ready to brew.The Rivelia also brews a superb coffee. You get a huge choice of short and long coffee drinks, both with and without milk. Espresso, the bedrock of many milk-based coffees, is superb. The grinder offers 14 steps of adjustment, and is capable of grinding so finely that it chokes the machine. This is an asset: dial it in carefully, and it rewards with the kind of rich, unctuous espresso that most bean-to-cups can only dream of.There’s oodles of adjustability, too. The Bean Adapt feature adjusts brewing settings to suit the beans you’re using, and it can be effective with a little tweaking. However, you can easily adjust strength and volume to suit your tastes – and the size of your cups – and being able to adjust the level of milk froth is something you don’t always get on cheaper machines.It’s impressive to see how much De’Longhi has packed in for the money. The touchscreen interface is top-notch, and the coffee is among the best I’ve tasted from a bean-to-cup machine at any price. If you’re looking for a step up from budget machines, then the Rivelia will show you what you’re missing.It’s a shame that …the Rivelia’s design sacrifices practicality in one key area. The touchscreen interface is undoubtedly brilliant, but as it’s positioned on the Rivelia’s top panel and faces upwards, it’s poorly positioned for shorter or seated users. A front-facing touchscreen would ruin the look, but it would be far more usable.Machine type:assisted espresso machineDimensions:24.5 x 43 x 38.5cm (WDH)Time to heat up:38 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?Yes, automaticPeak noise level:51dB (brew), 51dB (steam), 68dB (grind)Warranty:two years repair or replace at De’Longhi’s discretionDe’LonghiRiveliafrom£749.99£749.99 at De’Longhi£749.99 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent coffee, helpful touchscreen and dual bean hoppersWhat we don’t loveGrinder is noisy; awkwardly positioned controlsBest filter coffee machine:Fellow AidenFellowAidenfrom£299£303 at Healf£299 at AmazonWhat we loveGets the best from any coffee; highly customisableWhat we don’t loveExpensive; swapping filter baskets£303 at Healf£299 at AmazonThe Fellow Aiden promises “barista-quality results without the learning curve”. And it delivers. In the several months I’ve had this filter coffee machine on my worktop, it’s made glorious brews with everything from light to dark roast coffees – and with minimal effort.Why we love itThe Aiden’s magic touch is that it leads beginners by the hand and allows tinkerers to tweak water temperature and flow down to seconds and degrees centigrade. It’s versatile: you can brew a single cup of coffee directly into a cup, or fill the metal insulated jug with up to 1.5 litres of coffee. It tells you exactly how much ground coffee to use, and it’ll even do cold brew.It’s easy to get to grips with, too. The little clickable dial scrolls through simple text-based menus on the round OLED screen. The superbly minimalist user guide gives useful tips. In-built wifi means that you can use the Aiden app for iOS and Android, too, and tweak every recipe from your smartphone screen – or schedule brews to be ready the moment you wake up.The Aiden tailors its settings to suit the type of coffee and the amount you’re brewing. There are preset brew recipes for light, medium and dark roast coffee, each adjusting the water temperature and flow for the best results. They’re a great starting point. Some coffees can become bitter or sour on machines with set brewing temperatures, but the Aiden creates a more refined cup.It’s a shame that …there’s no integrated water filter. Using a water filter jug is a simple solution, but having used the also-excellent Sage Precision Brewer Thermal, it’s preferable to pour in tap water and just hit the brew button.The dual filter baskets are fiddly. As much as I love the convenience of brewing a single cup – or a big jug – it’s annoying having to keep flat-bottomed and cone-shaped paper filters stocked in the cupboard.Machine type:filterDimensions:23 x 23 x 30cm (WDH)Time to heat up:N/AMakes milk-based drinks?NoPeak noise level:63dB (average 48dB)Warranty:two yearsFellowAidenfrom£299£303 at Healf£299 at AmazonWhat we loveGets the best from any coffee; highly customisableWhat we don’t loveExpensive; swapping filter basketsBest manual machine:Lelit Anna PL41TEMLelitAnna PL41TEM£509.95£509.95 at Coffee FriendWhat we loveBrilliant coffee; adjustable brew temperatureWhat we don’t loveFinicky; non-standard 57mm portafilter£509.95 at Coffee FriendIf you want to get serious about espresso, then the Anna PL41TEM deserves a place on your shortlist. The stainless-steel build is reminiscent of the Gaggia Classic, but the big upgrade is the adjustable PID temperature controller that puts you in charge of the brewing and steaming temperatures.Why we love itIt’s the Anna’s mixture of talents that makes it so appealing. Value is foremost: its closest rival, theGaggia Classic, is about £75 cheaper, but lacks a PID for temperature control – a £200+ aftermarket upgrade. The two-year warranty is welcome, too, and Lelit is also confident enough to warranty it for a full year of commercial (ab)use.Once you’ve primed the boiler (note: read the instructions carefully), you can get brewing in about three minutes. The Anna PL41TEM lets you adjust the brew and steam temperatures from 80C to 130C. Set to the specific brew temperature recommended for your coffee, or just start with the default 95C.The control is invaluable: I remedied a slight bitterness to my first shots by dropping the brew temperature down a single degree. If, like me, you love globe-trotting one far-flung coffee plantation at a time, this adjustability ekes out amazing results from exotic light roasts through to classic Italian espresso.It’s a shame that …getting started may be daunting for beginners. The text-only, bullet-point instructions are unwelcoming;YouTube videosare a friendlier place to start. The manual fill boiler requires a little care, so it’s essential to get the hang of.The solid, basic design is reassuring for longevity, but refined it is not. The water tank just clunks into place with rubber pipes feeding from the top, and the top cover and drip tray are rattly. What’s more, the 57mm portafilter is a non-standard size, so upgrades to the portafilter, basket and various accessories are slightly harder to come by.One final minor moan from my long-term testing: the plastic window is just a tad too opaque, so it’s not very clear how much water is remaining.Machine type:manual espressoDimensions:23x 38 x 34cm (WDH)Time to heat up:3 minutesMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:79dB (64dB average)Warranty:two years repair or replace at Lelit’s discretionLelitAnna PL41TEM£509.95£509.95 at Coffee FriendWhat we loveBrilliant coffee; adjustable brew temperatureWhat we don’t loveFinicky; non-standard 57mm portafilterBest manual machine for beginners:Sage Bambino PlusSageBambino Plusfrom£399£399 at John Lewis£399 at ArgosWhat we loveEasy to use; automatic milk frothing works wellWhat we don’t loveBrew temperature isn’t adjustable£399 at John Lewis£399 at ArgosThe Bambino Plus’s balance of coffee-brewing talent and beginner-friendly features can’t be beaten for the money. It welcomes even complete newcomers with its friendly, informative user manual and helpful YouTube tutorials, and it’s capable of brewing brilliant coffee.Why we love itIt’s a neat little machine, and the modest dimensions mean it will slot unobtrusively on to most kitchen worktops. Sage supplies almost everything you need in the box, too. I say almost everything: you’ll also need some good fresh coffee beans and something to grind them with.The quality of the coffee seals the deal here, however. In something of a rarity at this price, the Bambino Plus has a temperature controller, ensuring the brewing water hits the coffee grounds at a consistent temperature. Combine that with a decent-quality coffee bean and a capable grinder, and you’ve got a recipe for routinely good espresso with a minimum of faff.Factor in the automatic milk texturing, which crafts wonderfully hot, silky, frothed milk at the press of a button, and it’s invigoratingly easy to whip up superb flat whites and cappuccinos. It’s a beginner’s dream.It’s a shame that …the manual mode doesn’t feel quite right without a proper physical dial, so budding baristas may hanker for a fully manual espresso machine. As you can’t adjust the brew temperature, you’re better off sticking with medium- to dark-roast coffee beans (lighter roasts require higher brew temperatures, so they may taste a little sour).Machine type:assisted manual espressoDimensions:19.5 x 32 x 31cm (WDH)Time to heat up:6 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?YesPeak noise level:63dB (50dB average)Warranty:two years repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionRead our fullSage Bambino Plus reviewSageBambino Plusfrom£399£399 at John Lewis£399 at ArgosWhat we loveEasy to use; automatic milk frothing works wellWhat we don’t loveBrew temperature isn’t adjustableBest Nespresso machine:Nespresso Vertuo PlusNespressoVertuo Plusfrom£89£89 at Nespresso£149 at John LewisWhat we loveEasy to use; Consistently good, hot coffeeWhat we don’t loveOverpriced at full RRP£89 at Nespresso£149 at John LewisThe Vertuo Plus uses Nespresso’s larger, pricier Vertuo capsules, allowing it to make everything from surprisingly refined espresso to half-litre carafes.Why we love itIf you’re looking for the most compact machine possible, then the Vertuo Plus isn’t it. Standing almost 33cm tall, the Plus’s curved body and offset water tank are an imposing sight next to the smaller capsule machines on my kitchen counter.Crucially, though, the Vertuo Plus makes a mean coffee. You can use any of the Vertuo capsules, and the machine did a great job with all those I tested. It’s quieter than theVertuo Lattissima, too, and while the noise levels reach 54dB when the capsules spin up, it’s a much less annoying thrum than its stablemate.One word of warning: lungos come out at a steaming hot 78C, perfect for adding milk, but tongue-searingly hot without. Espresso shots tend to pour into the cup at about 70C, so they are drinkable right away.It’s a shame that …the retail price is high. However, it’s regularly discounted. The same machine is made by several different manufacturers, though, so you’ll see versions with slightly different styling.Lovers of milk-based coffees may feel left out, but they should consider theVertuo Lattissimainstead – it adds deliciously frothy cappuccinos, latte macchiatos and hot milk to the menu.Machine type:capsuleDimensions:22 x 35 x 33cm (WDH)Time to heat up:27 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?NoPeak noise level:54.5dB (average 50.5dB)Warranty:two years repair or replace at Nespresso’s discretionNespressoVertuo Plusfrom£89£89 at Nespresso£149 at John LewisWhat we loveEasy to use; Consistently good, hot coffeeWhat we don’t loveOverpriced at full RRPThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Makes consistently enjoyable coffee’: the Lavazza Jolie Evo.Photograph: Sasha MullerJura C8JuraC8from£649£649 at Appliance City£895 at John LewisWhat we loveGreat design; good coffee; optional milk coolerWhat we don’t loveOnly four drink recipesBest for:simplicity£649 at Appliance City£895 at John LewisJura describes its C8 as its first entry into the “premium economy segment”, which gives you a good idea of how expensive the rest of its machines are. The C8 is, however, an example of trickle-down technology done right. It makes only four types of coffee, but makes them well. The design is astute, and it’s easy to use. A class act.One of my favourite features is the milk system: the optionalmilk carafe(about £45) itself is elegant, but you can dangle the rubber tube into a milk bottle or jug straight from the fridge instead. It’s far less faff to clean.Espresso is as good as any bean-to-cup machine I’ve tested in this price range, but be cautious of dialling the grind too fine – it tends to be bitter and overextracted at the finest setting. The black coffee is good, too, and although the cappuccino is similarly tasty, the latte macchiato was my favourite – the combination of a nice dense milk foam and well-extracted coffee is dangerously moreish.It didn’t make the final cut because …some of its competitors, such as the De’Longhi Rivelia, can be cheaper, have a broader drink selection and add useful hot-water or hot-milk dispensing modes. Make no mistake, though, it’s the C8’s simplicity that’s its most attractive trait. The simple, easily legible LCD screen, limited menu and ease of operation remain its trump card.Machine type:bean to cup;dimensions:26 x 44 x 33cm (WDH);time to heat up:30 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:70dB (average 45dB);warranty:25 months repair or replace at Jura’s discretionJuraC8from£649£649 at Appliance City£895 at John LewisWhat we loveGreat design; good coffee; optional milk coolerWhat we don’t loveOnly four drink recipesNinja Cafe Luxe ES601UKNinjaCafe Luxe ES601UKfrom£479£549 at John Lewis£479 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value for an assisted machine; lots of drink optionsWhat we don’t loveFiddlier than fully assisted modelsPhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£549 at John Lewis£479 at AmazonBest for:sublime espresso and milk-based coffees without the effort – or the expenseImagine a manual espresso machine that does all the hard work for you – that’s the Cafe Luxe in a nutshell. Pour coffee beans into the hopper on top, and it’ll grind, measure and adapt the settings automatically to produce the perfect espresso, long black and beyond.Indeed, espresso is just the beginning. Press a button on the shiny fascia, and it’ll whip milk into a hot, silken froth perfect for a cappuccino or flat white. But what if you fancy something more akin to a filter coffee? Or a cold brew coffee, for that matter? Not a problem: cold or hot, milk or coffee, the Cafe Luxe will brew, steam or froth it to perfection. Take a little time to decipher the busy control panel, and a whole world of coffee lies at your fingertips.If you’re wondering why you’d pick this over a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine, then the answer is the coffee quality. As this is a portafilter machine, the Ninja draws out a depth of flavour and complexity from good coffee beans that fully automatic machines can only dream of. The downside is more effort, but if you want manual espresso quality without the faff, this is as good as it gets for about £500 – Sage’s superior assisted machines cost twice as much.It didn’t make the final cut because …if you have the money to spend but don’t want a fully manual machine, the question is whether this will be automatic enough for you. If you’d prefer to simply press a button and get on with the washing-up, then a fully automatic bean-to-cup machine such as theDe’Longhi Magnifica Evo One Touchwill be a better pick.Machine type:assisted;dimensions:37 x 33 x 37cm (WDH);time to heat up:35 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:66dB (average 57dB);warranty:two yearsNinjaCafe Luxe ES601UKfrom£479£549 at John Lewis£479 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value for an assisted machine; lots of drink optionsWhat we don’t loveFiddlier than fully assisted modelsMoccamaster KBG SelectMoccamasterKBG Selectfrom£268£268 at Selfridges£268 at AmazonWhat we loveSimple to use; brews a tasty jug of coffeeWhat we don’t loveExpensive; no adjustable brew temperature£268 at Selfridges£268 at AmazonBest for:simple filter coffeeSpending more than £200 on a filter coffee machine may seem extravagant, but the KBG Select is anything but ordinary. Built to last a lifetime, it’s one of a few select machines to earn an accreditation from the Specialty Coffee Association and the European Coffee Brewing Centre for its brewing prowess.That the machine is designed and handbuilt in the Netherlands goes some way towards explaining the high price. As does the five-year warranty and the promise of lifelong repairability. It certainly doesn’t hurt that you can pick from more than 20 kitchen-matching colours.It couldn’t be simpler to use: pop in a paper filter, add the ground coffee to the filter and wait patiently. You can brew anything between four and 10 125ml cups of coffee – admittedly closer to five normal-size mugs – and a full jug takes a consistent six minutes to brew.If you’re making fewer cups, you can flick the half-jug switch to slow the brewing process and eke every last drop of flavour from smaller doses of coffee. However much you brew, the hotplate then stays on for 40 minutes, keeping coffee warm without stewing it.The quality of the coffee it makes, and the consistency with which it does so, is what sets the KBG Select apart. I’ve had surprisingly pleasant results from pre-ground supermarket coffee, but routinely enjoy wonderful cups from freshly ground beans. Feed the KBG Select with great coffee, and it quietly does the rest.It didn’t make the cut because …the machine feels lightweight, and the glass carafe doesn’t feel especially solid. That said, my unit has been used daily for almost two years now, and nothing has broken. Yet.One final word of caution for any coffee perfectionists: you may prefer a machine with more adjustability, such as the excellentFellow Aidenor Sage’s well-regardedPrecision Brewer.Machine type:filterDimensions:32 x 17 x 36cm (WDH)Time to heat up:25 secondsMakes milk-based drinks?NoPeak noise level:59dB (average 44dB)Warranty:five years (excluding carafe)MoccamasterKBG Selectfrom£268£268 at Selfridges£268 at AmazonWhat we loveSimple to use; brews a tasty jug of coffeeWhat we don’t loveExpensive; no adjustable brew temperatureDe’Longhi Magnifica StartDe’LonghiMagnifica Startfrom£339.99£339.99 at De’Longhi£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveFrothy coffee at the touch of a buttonWhat we don’t loveNoisy; not quite as refined as the Evo model£339.99 at De’Longhi£399.99 at AmazonBest for:a cheap bean-to-cup machineThe Start isn’t as fancy-looking as the step-up Evo family. You can pick from plain gloss black plastics and glossy grey. But the quality of coffee it makes is just as good as the Magnifica Evo – internally, they’re pretty much identical.Why we love itIt’s really easy to use. Fill the 250g hopper with beans, slot the supplied water filter into the 1.8-litre tank and after a 40-second warmup and initial rinse, it’s ready to brew.The little touch-sensitive buttons brew cappuccino, espresso, coffee (AKA a long black) or hot water. You can pick from three coffee strength levels, or choose to add your own pre-ground coffee via the chute.Hold down any drink button, and you can preset how much milk or how much coffee is poured. That means you can transform the cappuccino preset into more of a latte, if you prefer – or just ensure that the machine fills your favourite mug or cup just so.The coffee spouts slide up and down easily, too, so you can just about squeeze in a 15cm-tall cup, or slide them down to pour neatly into a tiny espresso cup.It’s a shame that …it’s rather noisy. The grinder chunters at 75dB, and the milk frother sputters up to 78dB. And talking of milk, there’s still no dedicated hot milk button. Thankfully, there is a trick: select the pre-ground coffee option and don’t add any coffee. Voilà! Hot, frothy milk.Do be careful when buying: there are several Magnifica Start models. Cheaper models swap the milk carafe for a steam wand, so check before you buy. And if you see a similarly specified Magnifica Evo (above) discounted for a similar or lower price – buy that instead. It’s slightly nicer looking, marginally easier to use, and some of its models have more drink options.Machine type:fully automatic bean to cup;dimensions:24 x 44 x 35cm (WDH);time to heat up:40 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:78dB (average 66dB);warranty:two years repair or replace at De’Longhi’s discretionDe’LonghiMagnifica Startfrom£339.99£339.99 at De’Longhi£399.99 at AmazonWhat we loveFrothy coffee at the touch of a buttonWhat we don’t loveNoisy; not quite as refined as the Evo modelLavazza Jolie EvoLavazzaJolie Evofrom£63.71£99 at Lavazza£63.71 at AmazonWhat we loveBrews strong Italian espresso or black coffeeWhat we don’t loveDesign a little rough around the edges£99 at Lavazza£63.71 at AmazonBest for:hassle-free Italian espresso and tasty black coffeeThere are cheaper capsule machines and there are far fancier ones, but the £99 Jolie Evo earns a recommendation by making consistently enjoyable coffee. Lavazza’sA Modo Miocapsule range is small, but each gives a pleasingly brash, nutty Italian espresso flavour with minimal hassle, and the machine is compact and uncomplicated.The Jolie Evo is small, so it fits into tiny gaps on a kitchen worktop. The removable 0.6-litre water tank saves you from carrying jugs of water across the kitchen, and the little bin holds five caps.The machine heats up in 30 to 35 seconds, then you drop a capsule in the slot, pull down the lever (which has a rather satisfying action) and press the button. The Jolie Evo will keep pouring until you press the button a second time, so you can have any amount of coffee from the shortest ristretto to a longer 160ml brew. It’s reasonably quiet, too: I measured a peak sound level of 45dB from a metre away.It didn’t make the final cut because …the water tank can be fiddly to slot back into place. Also, the capsule drawer doesn’t always push back flush with the surround.Machine type:capsule;dimensions:12 x 33 x 21cm (WDH);time to heat up:35 seconds;makes milk-based drinks?No;peak noise level:45dB (average 35dB);warranty:two years repair or replace at Lavazza’s discretionLavazzaJolie Evofrom£63.71£99 at Lavazza£63.71 at AmazonWhat we loveBrews strong Italian espresso or black coffeeWhat we don’t loveDesign a little rough around the edgesSage Barista Touch Express Impress with cold extractionSageBarista Touch Express Impress with cold extractionfrom£1,199£1,199 at John Lewis£1,199.95 at SageWhat we loveTouchscreen is welcoming; quality of drinks is superbWhat we don’t loveExpensivePhotograph: Sasha Muller/The Guardian£1,199 at John Lewis£1,199.95 at SageBest for:stunning espresso and cold coffee without the manual slogSage’s recently upgraded Barista Touch Impress with cold extraction takes everything I loved about the old model and adds cold-brew coffee and cold espresso to its drinks list. It’s basically identical in every other way – and that’s a very good thing.As ever, it makes consistently great coffee with minimal to zero faff. There’s not as much assistance asSage’s £1,699 Oracle Jet– norits £2,449 Oracle Dual Boilerfor that matter – but it’s a darn sight simpler than a manual machine. And as long as you don’t mind getting involved, it’s no slower than a fully automatic model. It just requires you to move the portafilter from left to right, slide a jug of milk under the steam wand and prod the touchscreen occasionally.The bright colour touchscreen is the gamechanger here – it gently introduces users to the machine, and the simple icon-based interface is easy to grasp even for complete beginners. Swipe through the wide selection of drinks, tap the one you want and then work through the process of grinding, brewing and steaming with a few taps of the touchscreen and a few twists of the portafilter.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s an awful lot of money to spend on a coffee machine. If you have the money burning a hole in your pocket, then a manual espresso machine and separate grinder will make better-tasting coffee (with a bit of skill and effort), and similarly priced automatic machines are far easier to use. And if the assisted espresso concept has caught your eye, you don’t have to spend four figures: the Ninja scratches that itch for half the price.Machine type:assisted manual espresso;dimensions:36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH);time to heat up:six seconds;makes milk-based drinks?Yes;peak noise level:73dB (average 60dB);warranty:two years repair, replace or refund at Sage’s discretionSageBarista Touch Express Impress with cold extractionfrom£1,199£1,199 at John Lewis£1,199.95 at SageWhat we loveTouchscreen is welcoming; quality of drinks is superbWhat we don’t loveExpensiveWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenDaily cleaning is non-negotiable for machines with built-in milk-frothing systems.Photograph: Sasha Muller/The GuardianWhat type of coffee machine is best for you?Buying the right coffee machine for you – and your wider household – boils down to two questions: how much coffee do you drink, and how much effort are you willing to put in? Here, I’ll cover the quick pros and cons of each type of machine.For more, read our full guide onhow to choose the right type of coffee machine for youFilter coffee machinesBest for:brewing big batches of coffeeIf you have multiple coffee drinkers in the house, or a slightly excessive daily coffee intake, a filter coffee machine will brew a big jug of black coffee in well under 10 minutes. Add (ideally, freshly) ground coffee and water. Press a button. Wait for the smell of freshly brewed coffee to waft. If you like to drink coffee throughout the day, opt for a model with a thermal jug.Capsule coffee machinesBest for:quick cups of half-decent coffeeMany capsule brands exist, but simplicity and consistency are a universal selling point. Add a capsule, press a button, and a coffee pours into your cup. For one or two quick coffees, these are a godsend. However, even the tastiest capsules are fairly average compared with good, fresh coffee in other machine types.Automatic bean-to-cupBest for:good coffee with zero effortKeep the water tank and bean hopper topped up, and these do the rest. Press a button, and everything from short shots to long blacks pours forth. Opt for a model with a milk carafe, and lattes, flat whites and cappuccinos are on the menu. Use good coffee and you’ll get good results, but even the best automatic machines pale in comparison with a good, cheap manual espresso alternative.Assisted espresso machineBest for:great coffee with minimal effortA halfway house between the automatic bean-to-cup models and a manual espresso machine. A robot barista, if you like. The fully assisted models guide every step of the process – the grind, dosage, brew and milk steaming is all optimised for you. More effort than an auto machine, but the vastly improved coffee may be worth it.Manual espresso machineBest for:the best possible coffee with lots of effortThese are the fiddliest machines to use and the hardest to master – yet they make the best coffee. Some include an integrated grinder, but it’s up to you to optimise the grind size, dosage, brew time and milk steaming yourself. Get it right, however, and affordable manual machines will trounce four-figure automatic models.For more, read our guide to thebest espresso machinesManual brewersBest for:great coffee on a budgetEven if you do have a coffee maker on your worktop, it’s great to have a simple, low-effort brewer close to hand for when you just can’t be bothered. Or for when you want to brew a big batch for a gathering. AHario V60 filter (£7.80 at the time of writing), which you can just throw on top of a cup or carafe, makes a lovely coffee. And don’t discount the humble cafetière, either – it’s the low-effort king of coffee brewing. Buy an eight- or 12-cup model, and you can caffeinate a whole table of guests. My favourite is theBodum Chambord (£29.95 at time of writing).For more, read our guide tothe best cafetièresWarrantyWhen things go wrong with your coffee machine, the first port of call is the manufacturer’s warranty. Most have a two-year repair or replace warranty as standard, but pricier models may increase that to three years or – in the rare case of Moccamaster – five years.For the most part, these will be a repair or replace warranty, which means the machine will have to be shipped back to the manufacturer, sometimes at its expense but not always (as ever, it pays to read the small print). It will then be at the company’s discretion as to whether a repair or a replacement is the best course of action.Before you buy, it’s advisable to shop around and check whether different retailers provide free extended cover or offer sensibly priced upgrades to the standard warranty – or alternatively, you can consider third-party appliance insurance. This is unlikely to be cost-effective for cheaper machines, though: even a small monthly outlay will quickly add up to more than the price of a new machine.RepairabilityWhen you’re out of warranty, things can get tricky. Generally speaking, the cheaper the machine, the less likely it is that repairs will be economical. Some machines, such as capsule, filter and low-end espresso models, are just not designed to be easily serviceable. Screws and bolts are often replaced by plastic clips, which generally aren’t designed to be unclipped once fastened. Spare parts are hard to come by, too, if they exist at all. And a repair is unlikely to be worthwhile anyway: labour charges will be in the region of £40 an hour.If you want to buy once – or like the popular Reddit communityr/Buy It For Life– you’ll need to spend more upfront for a machine with a repairable design and a healthy supply of spare parts.Everything you need to make great coffee – and the kit that’s not worth your moneyRead moreHow often should you clean your coffee machine?The oils in coffee are brilliant at creating sticky, hard-to-remove stains – and dried-on milk does a pretty good job, too. That’s why regular, light cleaning is always better than letting grime build up. A quick wipe with a wet cloth and a rinse of the machine’s washable or removable parts after every use can save a lot of hassle.If you’re not sure what the best approach is for your machine, then always consult your user manual as the first port of call. Some parts will be dishwasher friendly – or sink and soapy water friendly – while others may require dedicated cleaning products. You can read tips from coffee experts inour guide to making your coffee machine last longer.How to recycle your old coffee machineView image in fullscreenRepair shops can breathe new life into old coffee machines.Photograph: YakobchukOlena/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you’re tempted to just sling your old coffee machine in the bin, hang on. There are sustainable options you can consider.Repair:If you were happy with your coffee machine before it went kaput, the first option is to repair it. Have a look on Google to see if there are any coffee machine repair shops or technicians nearby. These experts may be able to give you some general advice about the viability and cost-effectiveness of a repair.Donate:Another option is to offer it for free on Freecycle, Ecobees, Freegle or a similar service. If the machine doesn’t work, you can state that it’s supplied on a spares or repair basis. Someone may relish the challenge of bringing it back to life.Refurbish:Some manufacturers provide the option to return your broken machine for repair, even if it’s out of warranty. In the event a repair isn’t possible or cost-effective, they may recycle or refurbish your machine for resale – and possibly offer you another refurbished machine for less. If in doubt, it’s always worth emailing or phoning your manufacturer.Reuse:If you’re replacing your machine with another from the same manufacturer, some parts may be interchangeable, so it could be useful to keep it for spares. Many espresso machines have similarly sized portafilters and filter baskets, and the same goes for other types of coffee machines: many manufacturers use compatible parts across multiple models in their ranges.Recycle:For the parts or machines you can’t reuse, most coffee machines – and most small appliances, for that matter – can be recycled. If you’re unsure about your nearest options, try the Recycling Locator onRecycle Your Electricals. Type in your postcode, the type of appliance and whether you want to recycle, donate or repair it, and you’ll find a list of your nearest options.For my postcode, this gave me the location and contact details for my local recycling centre, in addition to branches of Argos, Tesco, Asda and Currys. It also gave a list of which products would be accepted at each location. This, however, is worth taking with a pinch of salt; I’d contact the location before turning up with a trolley full of old appliances.For example, not all of those stores will provide free recycling for non-customers. Currys is a notable exception, accepting most small electrical items for free in-store recycling. Asda recycles goods only when customers are buying a replacement in-store. And although it said my local Tesco would accept coffee machines, the staff member I spoke to said that while they’d accept anything with a battery, they weren’t aware of an equivalent service for bigger items.The best bet is your local recycling centre, as it will be more likely to accept appliances, especially bulkier ones. Some centres also have dedicated repair boxes where items that may be repairable can be left – in my local borough, these are then taken to prison repair programmes so they can be donated to charity or other good causes.If you can’t get to your local centre, your council may collect smaller appliances alongside your bin collections. For reference, my council stipulates that the items be no larger than 35 x 40cm, fit in a carrier bag and not include any glass. Those dimensions cover most coffee machines, so the only challenge may be finding a carrier bag that’s big enough.Don’t miss our guide onhow to make your coffee machine last longerSasha Muller is atech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

Highly nutritional, keeps for ages.‘Boy’, though?It has also been referred to as “human kibble” as women have been eating it too, but lookingat social mediait seems to be mainly a guy thing.Got it– it’s the latest social mediafood trend, right?Right. Possibly as some kind of response to“girl dinner”a few years ago.Remind me what that was again?A snack plate, cobbled together and consumed alone.Delicious! Go on, then– how do you make kibble fit for human consumption?Food content creatorPatrick Kong’s recipeincludes rice, chopped vegetables, minced meat and eggs, which he cooks together in one big pan, divides into containers to be refrigerated or frozen, then takes out to eat twice a day …Twice a day! Where’s the joy in that?You can add different seasonings to relieve the monotony. But to be honest, this isn’t really about joy. Or aesthetics.What is it about?Trying to reduce body fat while keeping muscle mass. Kong lost 9kg (1st 6lb) over six months. And, judging by his before and after pics, got ripped in the process (he won’t have achieved this through diet alone, obviously).I guess it might be better than other high-protein diets often regarded as masculine,such asthe carnivore diet, which includes only animal products.Dr Emily Contois, the author ofDiners, Dudes and Diets: How Gender and Power Collide in Food Media and Culture, told the New York Times that the word “‘boy’ [in boy kibble] softens what could be perceived as toxically masculine consumptive behaviours”.Interesting.Yes, especially in the context of how diet and fitness – particularly masculine diet and fitness – is muscling its way into US politics.You’re talking about Robert F Kennedy Jr’sefforts to Make America Eat Meat Again?This, and his and Pete Hegseth’s pull-up competition, thePete & Bobby Challenge, which requires 50 pull-ups and 100 push-ups in no more than 10 minutes.I’m feeling tired just thinking about it. At least boy kibble looks easy to make and there are vegetables involved.True: any dish that doesn’t take long, uses one pan and makes a load of food for a week is going to appeal to a lot of boys I know.Do say:“Here boy, kibble!”Don’t say:“I don’t have the energy to cook – I’ll just open a tin of Pedigree Chum.”Explore more on these topicsFoodPass notesNutritionMen's healthSocial mediaMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A shoulder of lamb is one of my favourite cuts; you, or a friendly butcher, will need to trim away its excess fat, a job that will reward you with an exquisite flavour that marries beautifully with bold spicing. Here, we travel to Morocco, with sweetly aromatic ginger, turmeric and cinnamon, and follow that with cardamom, cream and rhubarb for pudding. A sumptuous, colourful feast to stave off any February blues.Moroccan lamb filo pie with honeyed carrots and almonds (pictured top)Many elements of this dish, with its falling apart, richly seasoned lamb and carrots encased in crisp, golden pastry, can be made the day before. The flavours will be much improved for it, too.Prep15 minCook3 hrServes6-81 large boned shoulder of lamb, trimmed of excess fatSalt and pepper60g butter, or oil2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped1 scant tsp ground ginger1 scant tsp cinnamon1 scant tsp turmeric2 large pinches saffron strands650g carrots,scrubbed (or peeled) and cut into thick, slanted chunks1 heaped tsp honeyTo finish80g blanched almonds50g butter270g packet filo pastryUse a sharp knife to cut the meat into six to eight pieces, trimming away any further excess fat revealed when doing so.Season the lamb pieces generously with salt and pepper. Put a casserole on a high heat and, when it’s hot, add a third of the butter (I like to add a dash of olive oil, too, to stop the butter burning). Brown the lamb pieces in two batches for a few minutes on each side, until nicely browned and caramelised. Set aside in a bowl, then turn down the heat to medium.Add a third more of the butter to the pan, tip in the onions, season well with salt and lots of pepper, then stir in the ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and saffron, and sweat gently, stirring often, for 10-12 minutes, until the onions are translucent and soft.Return the lamb to the pan, pour in enough water almost to cover the meat, and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, turning the lamb a couple of times.Meanwhile, put a large frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, add the last of the butter. Saute the carrots for four to five minutes, seasoning generously with salt and pepper, add the honey and cook for a few minutes more, until caramelised and fragrant.Once the lamb has had its 90 minutes, add the carrots to the mix and simmer, uncovered, for a further 30-60 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and the carrots are just cooked. (This can now be set aside to finish the next day.)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and toast the almonds inside while it’s heating up. Melt 50g butter in a pan, then use a pastry brush to grease a large ovenproof dish and the pastry, layering it up to four sheets deep in the pan. Tip in the lamb, top with the toasted nuts, then fold over the overhanging pastry and brush with more melted butter. Top the pie with a few extra scrunched-up filo sheets, brush with melted butter, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until piping hot and golden. Serve with greens.Cardamom panna cotta with baked rhubarbView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ cardamom panna cotta with baked rhubarb.Prep10 minInfuse30 minCook40 minChill3 hr+Serves4450ml double cream100mlwhole milkFinely grated zest of 1 orange100g caster sugar1 tsp green cardamom pods2½2g fine-leaf gelatine sheets200g greek yoghurtFor the rhubarb400g rhubarb, wiped clean and cut into 3cm lengths100g caster sugarJuice of1 orange2-3 tbsp PernodPour the cream and milk into a saucepan and add the orange zest and sugar. Bash open the cardamom pods with a rolling pin, then add them, too. Put the pan on a medium heat and warm gently until a few tiny bubbles break the surface. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for half an hour.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay out the rhubarb in a single layer in a large baking dish. Sprinkle over the sugar, orange juice and Pernod, cover with foil and bake for 20-25 minutes, until tender to the point of a knife but still keeping its shape. Taste and adjust the sweetness if the rhubarb is very tart.Submerge the gelatine in a bowl of cold water, leave to soften for five minutes, then drain and squeeze the water from the gelatine and put it in a bowl. Once the cream has infused, reheat it gently, then strain through a sieve into the gelatine bowl. Whisk until it melts, then beat gradually into the yoghurt. Pour into four small moulds, glasses or ramekins, then chill in the fridge for at least three hours, until set.To serve, dip the base and sides of the panna cotta moulds into boiling water and loosen with a palette knife. Turn them out on to plates and spoon the rhubarb around the creams.Explore more on these topicsFoodThomasina Miers recipesNorth African food and drinkMain courseDessertBakingPiePastryrecipesShareReuse this content"

This left 35 passengers unable to board.I was advised to book another flight and claim the cost of the new ticket via the easyJet website. The next available flight was with British Airways and cost me £472. EasyJet has since refused to refund me.Customer service staff first denied that the plane had been downgraded, thensaid my claim was rejected because I had booked the original easyJet flight through a third party, thensaid I was a no-show.IBLondonRyanair expects me to take the financial hit for helping othersRead moreTheair traffic control chaosdisrupted hundreds of flights, and easyJet’s obduracy is inexcusable.Your webchats with its agents make nonsensical reading. One told you the rejection was because “the email address on the booking does not match the one on the booking”. They then confirmed you were denied boarding before claiming that you weren’t denied boarding for commercial or operational reasons and therefore had no right to a refund.It seems the actual problem was that, since you weren’t allowed to check in, and could not therefore proceed to the gate, the system marked you as a no-show.EasyJet’s system was too inflexible and its staff too indifferent to override this. The airline changed its stance and promised you the money when I intervened, four months after you had lodged your claim, though it never got round to answering my questions.The refund took a further month to arrive because the company suddenly insisted that you provide proof that you had paid for the ticket, which you had booked through a travel agent.In future, I suggest you check in online so you have a better chance of boarding next time something goes wrong.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new Powerbeats Fit are the direct successors to 2022’s popularBeats Fit Pro, costing £200 (€230/$200/A$330). They sit alongside the recently redesignedPowerbeats Pro 2as Apple’s fitness alternatives of the AirPods.The Fit take Beats’ standard earbud design and add a flexible silicone stabiliser wing that curves around the inside of yourconcha, rather than around the outside of your ear like the Pro 2. The result is a far more compact and discreet earbud – particularly if you opt for a subtler colour than spark orange – and one that’s more comfortable to wear with glasses.View image in fullscreenThe wing is slightly more flexible than that from the Fit Pro without sacrificing purchase in your ear.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOnce twisted into place, the earbuds stayed firmly in my ears regardless of how vigorously I shook my head or how wet I got running in the rain. The new wing is a little more comfortable for extended periods than their predecessors, but I still found it put uncomfortable pressure on the inside of my left ear after an hour or so.A single button on each earbud takes care of playback and noise cancelling controls, or can be set to adjust volume on a press and hold. Call quality is very good – particularly for earbuds without stalks – sounding relatively natural and clear even when speaking softly in quiet environments and only allowing a little background noise through on busy streets.View image in fullscreenThe flip top charging case is light and 17% smaller than the previous version making it easier to fit in a pocket.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery in the earbuds lasts a good six hours of playback with noise cancelling and can be charged three times in the case for a total of 24 hours use before needing to be connected to power by USB-C.The earbuds have Apple’s older H1 chip for managing connectivity, which means a seamless connection to the iPhone and other Apple gear with spatial audio, music sharing and Siri. But theBeats app on Androidoffers many of the same advanced features, including instant pairing, customisation, updates and battery widgets, making them cross-compatible and ideal for people who use both platforms.View image in fullscreenThe Beats app for Android (left) enables most of the same controls and features for the Powerbeats Fit as built into the iPhone Settings app (right).Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth5, SBC, AAC, H1 chipBattery life:six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)Water resistance:buds and case IPX4 (splash resistant)Earbud dimensions:27.4 x 21.5 x 20.4mmEarbud weight:5.8g eachCharging case dimensions:62.5 x 55.4 x 27.5mmCharging case weight:49.8gCase charging:USB-CSound and noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe silicone earbud tips and the stabiliser wing do a good job of ensuring a seal in your ear once correctly twisted into place.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Beats sound far better than your average workout buds and are good enough to be general listening earphones. They produce fairly balanced sound with plenty of powered in the low end when required, good separation of tones and decent detail in the mids and highs. They are quite similar to the Powerbeats Pro 2 and do a great job with punchier rock, pop, hip-hop or electronic tracks, but fall short of theAirPods Pro 3.Unlike most workout buds the Beats have active noise cancellation, which works pretty well to dampen the drone of road noise or the commute. It can’t handle the difficult higher tones, such as clicks, taps and background chatter as well as the Powerbeats Pro or the best-in-class AirPods Pro 3, but it does the job most of the time.The earbuds also have a good and natural-sounding transparency mode, which helps with awareness while out running. But like the Powerbeats Pro 2 it isn’t quite as good as not having anything in your ears, so is still best used in safer environments such as parks.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth Beats case is one of the best on the market and fits fairly easily into pockets and bags.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.The earbuds are not repairable but Apple will offerindividual replacements for lost or damaged parts, including a £69 battery service. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe Beats Powerbeats Fit cost£199.95(€229.95/$199.99/A$329.95).For comparison, theBeats Powerbeats Pro 2cost£250, theBeats Studio Buds+cost£180, theBeats Solo Budscost£80and theAirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictThe Beats Powerbeats Fit are a minor revamp on the already greatBeats Fit Probringing them into line with the rest of Apple’s earbuds.They aren’t as comfortable or accomplished on the audio or noise-cancelling fronts as theAirPods Pro 3. Nor are they quite as great for running as thePowerbeats Pro 2with their volume rocker buttons. But the Fit are easier to live with on the commute without the big over-ear hooks and more comfortable to wear with glasses without sacrificing the secure fit.That makes them great workout buds that can pull double-duty as regular earbuds with good enough noise cancelling and great sound. Plus they have most of the fancy features of AirPods with Apple gear and full compatibility with Android thanks to the Beats app. Not many earbuds can claim that privilege.Pros:secure fit, good sound, solid noise cancelling and transparency modes, decent battery life, good case, good call quality, spatial audio, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.Cons:expensive for workout buds, no multipoint connectivity, ear hook can be uncomfortable after a while, battery can’t be replaced making them ultimately disposable.View image in fullscreenThe Powerbeats Fit straddle Android and iOS while being workout buds that are good enough to pull double duty as daily earbuds.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsApplereviewsShareReuse this content"

But a move towards upcycling old shirts and wearing vintage garments is on the riseXaymaca AwoyungboTue 10 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 03.01 ESTShareIt may have been a quiet January transfer window, but even so, thousands of new shirts will be printed for Lucas Paquetá, returning to his former Brazilian club Flamengo, while his West Ham shirt instantly feels old. Not to mention the thousands of other players moving from one club to another. Uefaestimates that up to 60%of kits worn by players are destroyed at the end of the season, and at any one time there are thought to be more than1bn football shirts in circulation, many of which are discarded by fans once players leave.The good news is that lots of designers are bringing their upcycling skills to old kits, taking shirts and shirring them, sewing them or, as in the case of designer and creative directorHattie Crowther, completely transforming them intoone-of-a-kind headpieces. “I’m not here to add more products into the mix, I’m here to reframe what’s already in circulation and give it meaning, context, and longevity while staying culturally relevant,” says Crowther, whose creations involving the colours and emblems of Arsenal, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain, are, she says, “a response to how disposable football product has become”.Crowther’s project, Soft Armour, is just one example of how women are leading this reinvention and rethinking of football shirts. Designers Renata Brenha and Christelle Kocher along with brands (re)boot and Rose Ojo have all reworked football shirts to create everything from dresses to puffer jackets. The clothing store Vintage Threads has a rework service transforming old football shirts into new, custom pieces, ranging from ashirred top(£180) toa leather football jacket(£525).View image in fullscreenA Vintage Threads reworked FC Barcelona football shirt.Photograph: Vintage ThreadsMany of its customers are women who, according to the head of the rework project, Caitlin Finan, want something “that’s maybe more their style than a big, baggy football shirt that doesn’t fit them well. That’s why we had a lot of interest in shirred football tops last summer. It just makes it a little bit cuter.”Vintage Threads founder, Freddie Rose, suggests that the uniqueness of the pieces,compared with the templated football shirts we’re used to seeing,is what attracts people. The difference in the price-point might be hefty but, as Finan points out, unlike in the case of fast fashion football shirts, “the person [who made the reworked garments] got paid correctly”. Plus, “it’s definitely a more valuable way of expressing your personal style than a shirt,” she says.View image in fullscreenA Vintage Threads reworked Saka no.7 football shirt.Photograph: Vintage ThreadsFootball and fashion journalist Felicia Pennant goes one step further and argues that “reworked football shirts are the answer when tackling the environmental waste that occurs when so many football shirts are being released every season”.Most modern football shirts [professional and fan shirts] are made from virgin polyester, a type of plastic created from oil.The synthetic material’s propertiesare great for performance (it’s light and doesn’t retain moisture); fantastic for style (bold colours and designs can easily be applied to the fabric through sublimation printing); and perfect for profits (it’s cheap,costing half as much per kilo as cotton).But it’s extremely energy-intensive to extract and the resulting polyester garmentreleases microplastics with every wash, before taking up to200 years to break down– still quicker than it will take Spurs to win the league. Worse still, the shirts are more overproduced than ever with clubs like Bayern Munich going from releasing three kits every four years in the early 1990sto about 20 kits over the same period 30 years later. No wonder an estimated100,000 tonnes of sports kitfrom the retail market ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone –that’s 951 football shirts per minute.Of course, not all clubs release kits in such excess. My football shirt,Walthamstow FC’s William Morris-inspired away kit, ran for two seasons. The celebration of heritage via a local hero and the use of Morris & Co’s kaleidoscopic Yare design, made it more than a football shirt. It was a symbol of pride and a fashion statement that I wore gleefully around my home town.View image in fullscreen‘More than a football shirt’ … Xaymaca in his Walthamstow FC shirt.Photograph: Talia WoodinThe increasing popularity of retro football kits has also helped to ease the flow of garments to landfill sites. Kim Kardashian and Timothée Chalamet have been spotted wearing an oversized Roma 1997/98 shirt and the 1994 Mexico home kit respectively, while on the fashion marketplace Depop, searches for them were up 38% over the last six months.Gary Bierton, co-founder of the retailer Classic Football Shirts, believes that “preloved football shirts remain loved because every shirt has a story, and that enduring legacy helps keep the product relevant”. But it’s not always the club’s narrative that makes a shirt appeal: he recalls once complimenting an LA local on a Sheffield Wednesday shirt, to which they replied: “What is a Sheffield Wednesday?” They had been drawn to the colours and stripes.Whatever the reason, keeping shirts in circulation is a good thing. Not-for-profit campaign Green Football estimates that extending the life of a shirt by nine months can cut its carbon, water and waste footprintby up to 30%. Its 2025 campaign, Green Football’s Great Save, focused on saving kits from landfill by encouraging people to swap, donate and repurpose their kits.View image in fullscreenKim Kardashian in her Roma 1997/98 kit.Photograph: MEGA/GC ImagesNottingham Forest Community Trust ran a workshop for local schoolchildren to turn football shirts into tifos, those huge, fan-organised flags that can take over whole sections of stadium crowds. By embedding climate consciousness in traditional football arenas, Green Football was able to meet fans where they were at.But how much of a difference will these examples make in a wider consumerist culture hellbent on overproduction and overconsumption? Football’s hyper profit-driven nature is often in conflict with sustainability. Take for instance the fact that competing stakeholders enable a club like Manchester City to wearfootball kits made 95% from recycled polyester from textile wastewhile their front-of-shirt sponsor Etihad Airways emittedan estimated 1.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023.Joanna Czutkowna, the director of5Thread, a consultancy specialising in sport, apparel and sustainability, believes reactive measures such as upcycling and vintage football shirt collecting are great entry points into discussions about sustainability. But even more change could come by integrating a circular economy into football’s ecosystem. “Circularity is about keeping products in use for as long as possible, getting maximum value,” she says.That value, she points out, can be financial as well as environmental. “Why sell your shirt once when you can sell it five or six times [through the pre-loved football shirt market]? Why doesn’t every club have an in-house upcycler they support rather than one-off projects?” There is, she says, “money being left on the table and I think that’s something clubs might be missing.” According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,circular business models could be worth $700bn for the global fashion market by 2030.View image in fullscreenMore Soft Armour headpieces, constructed by integrating multiple elements from existing football shirts into single sculptural forms.Photograph: Courtesy of Hattie CrowtherSome clubs are already starting to see the long-term benefits of a circular business model. In 2024 and 2025, Brighton teamed up with sustainable upcycling brand, FC88, to create bum bags and bucket hats from misprinted youth football shirts. Nicole Bekkers, founder and CEO, says football clubs are more open to upcycling than in the past. “Once clubs see the financial and fan engagement upside, it triggers broader conversations about production volumes, circular design, resale, and material choices for future kits.” But, she says, upcycled designs need to look good. Otherwise “fans won’t buy it. It’s as simple as that. The real impact comes when sustainability is aspirational, collectible and desirable, not something people buy out of guilt.”And that’s the beauty of upcycled football kits – not only are they good for the environment, they look beautiful too. Who knows, maybe I’ll upcycle my Walthamstow FC shirt back into a William Morris wallpaper?Explore more on these topicsFashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The path is as wide as a one-way street but Birgit Pichorner, the park ranger I’m taking a tour with, motions for me to move to the side, where we watch a couple with wide grins glide past on a wooden toboggan.We have seen families out hiking with young children and speed walkers pacing for the summit, while on a trail above us, four skiers are zigzagging up one of the nature park’s designated ski touring routes. For residents of Villach, the southern Austrian town at the foot of Dobratsch, this is very much theirHausberg, a much-loved “locals’ mountain”, says Birgit.Until 2002, it was a ski resort – Birgit points out the slopes where she learned and later taught her kids to ski – but after successive bad winters at the turn of the century, the town faced the same choice as many ski resorts across the Alps today, as the climate crisis brings higher temperatures and reduced snowfall. Bring in the snow guns and supplement your natural snow offering with the fake stuff? Or chart a different path?The environmental cost of artificial snow is high – it’s  energy- and water-intensiveThe environmental cost ofMaschinenschnee, as the Austrians call artificial snow, is high – it’s energy- and water-intensive, with many resorts pumping water up from the valleys to service their slopes. It also negatively affects these fragile ecosystems by introducing potentially pathogenic and stress-tolerant bacteria to the snow, meltwater and soils,according to the hydrologistProf Carmen de Jong.At Dobratsch, residents were worried about the effects theMaschinenschneewould have on the cleanliness of their drinking water, which is funnelled through the mountain’s karst limestone system. They decided it wasn’t worth the risk, so closed the ski resort and instead developed a community-focused nature park.View image in fullscreenDobratsch, Villach’s community-focused nature park, in Carinthia.Photograph: Tom Klar/Getty ImagesAlong with providing affordable year-round outdoor recreation for local people and tourists – accessed by a €5 bus from Villach or by paying a slightly higher fee at one of the parking spots – the nature park designation protects the local flora and fauna. This includes mountain hares, chamois, ptarmigan and black grouse, with schoolchildren regularly taking part in educational classes on the mountain.Visitors are encouraged to avoid specific “nature zones” and stick to the trails, which are prepared for them daily. There are three winter hiking routes, ranging from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on how hard you want to work; four ski touring routes, ranging from an-hour-and-a-half to three hours; plus a cross-country circuit and a toboggan slope.We plan to hike a two-hour route to the summit (2,166m) via the Dobratsch Gipfelhaus, though we modify our route slightly when the fog comes in – depriving us of views of nearby Slovenia and Italy – and visit another hut near the summit instead, which used to house the old ski lift. It’s such a beautiful wintry landscape and a treat to be hiking on real snow. There isn’t enough to require snowshoes today – I’m in snowboard boots, though Birgit is fine in walking boots – but the snow still makes that lovely squeaking sound under my feet, making me feel nostalgic for winter holidays past.View image in fullscreenA machine producing a cloud of artificial snow in St Anton, Austria.Photograph: David Hall/AlamyThe problem with fake snow, aside from its environmental and financial impact (the cost of producing it has forced many ski resorts to push up their prices), is that it’s not very nice to walk on, let alone ski or snowboard on; it’s more like ice and much harder and heavier than natural snow. Before I came to Carinthia, I spent a few days in St Anton in the west of the country, where the whirr of multiple snow cannons puffing out clouds of white mist like dragon’s breath was a constant, even at night.I had the discombobulating experience of snowboarding down ribbons of white pistes surrounded by muted-green hills, and riding through the mist feels unlike any weather I’ve ever experienced; it’s lighter and less powerful than rain but grittier than real snow. When it lands on your jacket it has none of the intricate beauty of a snowflake and disappears almost instantly.But it’s easy to see why ski stations are resorting to snow cannons to keep the lights on. St Anton had last seen proper snow in November yet was almost fully open for the New Year holiday crowds, which is no mean feat, and many local businesses will, of course, depend on that tourist spend.We have this glacial valley to ourselves – the polar opposite of factory farm skiingI visit the small mountain village of Mallnitz, about 50 minutes on a scenic train from Villach, for a day’s snowboard touring with Klaus Alber, a mountain guide who also runs theHotel Alber. The hotel has been in his family for four generations, and Klaus, who greets me in lederhosen despite the temperature hovering at -10C, has noticed the dramatic effects of the changing climate on the valley first-hand.Pointing to the hotel windows, he tells me the snow used to pile up to halfway most winters, but in recent years it’s barely covered the pavement. “Now we get long periods of cold, dry weather with no snow,” he says. The village’s small ski resort Ankogel, which doesn’t yet have snow cannons, is closed due to a lack of snow.View image in fullscreenThe writer snow touring in Mallnitz, a 50-minute train ride from Villach“Guests come because they want to ski, but we encourage them to be flexible and enjoy the nature as it is. If there’s no snow in December, we can hike to a summit, that’s still a very nice thing to do,” he says, adding that it forces him to be more creative and find new activities for guests, such as snow touring, where you hike up a mountain using adhesive “skins” for grip, then ski or snowboard down.We set out in theHohe Tauern national park, amid a wild, high mountain snowscape of extraordinary beauty. Klaus thinks we may find some good conditions for touring, as there was a recent dusting of snow, which has softened the snow that fell earlier in the season, and he’s right.Climbing across a series of gentle spines, with sweeping views of a dramatic amphitheatre-like range to our left, it’s clear we have this entire glacial valley to ourselves – the polar opposite of factory farm skiing at a purpose-built ski resort. But it’s not just the setting; the true pleasure of the day comes from being in this landscape with wonderful natural snow all around. It looks so much brighter than its human-made equivalent, dazzlingly so under blue skies and sunshine.After a couple of hours, we reach the Hagener hut at 2,446m, and Klaus points to an area of snow-covered wilderness that was nearly turned into a ski resort in the late 1960s, before the area became a national park – a resort that today would no doubt be debating the choice between snow cannons or closure.How to have a sustainable family ski holiday: take the train and head highRead moreAfter snacks and hot sweet tea, we begin our descent with no tracks in the snow ahead – Klaus thinks we’re the first people to do the route this winter. The snow will become bare and patchy lower down, but it feels amazing to be making swooping turns in this upper section, where it’s deep enough to spray in arcs across my face, a holy grail in snowboarding, but so rare these days if you only go to the mountains once a year.It’s an experience you can only have with snow that’s fallen from the sky, and one that could never be approximated by a machine. The tears behind my goggles aren’t just from the cold.This trip was provided by Visit Villach, National Park Region Hohe Tauernand Austria Tourism.

Make sure you change the water twice a week and keep the cutting in bright, indirect light. The goal is for the stem to produce strong, healthy roots.Houseplant hacks: can you really use banana water as a fertiliser?Read moreThe testI used a control: one cutting with the end dipped in cooled candle wax, one simply placed in water. The plain cutting rooted quickly and cleanly. The waxed one sat there sulking, with the sealed end doing nothing and roots eventually emerging from higher up the stem anyway.The verdictThe plant is doing the work, not the candle wax. Dipping pothos cuttings in wax adds faff, fragrance and potential contaminants for no benefit.

Surrounding villages will get a further £20m under Labour’s “pride in place” scheme over the next decade.Yet business owners said the disruption had hurt their takings and accused the Labour-led Wigan council of not listening to their concerns. “You put things across to them and they look at you like you’ve walked into their living room on Christmas Day and pissed on their kid’s Xbox,” said one shopkeeper, who did not want to be named.View image in fullscreenFran: ‘They’re all a joke – they’re all liars.’Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianAt The Cupcakery, co-owner Fran said they lost at least £3,000 in revenue last summer when her shop was covered in scaffolding, meaning children had to walk in the road to get to them.Fran, 36, who did not want to give her last name, said she refused to vote at the last general election because “they’re all a joke – they’re all liars”. Her friends felt similar, she said: “There’s so many women I know that refuse to vote and it’s because of the lack of trust in the government.”Labour’s share of voters has dropped by 23 percentage points since 2001, while Conservative support rose markedly after Brexit – 65% of the constituency voted to leave the European Union.The shift right took Reform UK to within 5,399 votes of Labour, in one of the 98 seats where it finished runner up to Starmer’s party.David Baxter, whose Wigan and Leigh community charity was namechecked in Simons’ maiden speech in the Commons, praised the MP for being “really connected” to the area but that he “may be in a minority across the country”.“I do feel people feel [that] politicians, across any party, are disconnected from their communities,” Baxter said. The prospect of a strong Reform UK vote in May’s local elections in Wigan, when a third of its seats are up for grabs, is a source of anxiety for other voluntary bodies.View image in fullscreenCarl Pilling: ‘They’re all just looking after one another.’Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianGetting his hair cut while wrapped in a red, white and blue barber cape, builder Carl Pilling, 56, said Starmer “needs to go”.“Everything’s just a shambles – it’s ridiculous,” he said complaining about small boats, the NHS and the Mandelson saga. “They’re all just looking after one another.”View image in fullscreenCallum Freeman: ‘Why can’t it be about making the country better?’Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianOver a bacon and cheese toastie at The Cupcakery, Callum Freeman, 29, said he refused to vote for the first time in 2024 but worried now about the rise of Reform. “Last time I didn’t because it doesn’t seem to matter,” he said. “Why can’t it be about making the country better?”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLocal politicsLocal electionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Since taking office, it has said it isdelivering savingsand a new approach, while critics have questioned some of its claims and accused the party ofbreaking pledgesnot to raise council tax. The Reform-led Worcestershire county council is likely to issue England’s largest council tax risethis April.With the party currently leading national polls, one of its highest profile council leaders has admitted that its performance in local government isReform’s “shop window”for the future as it looks towards the next general election.With this in mind, we’d like to hear from people who live in areas where Reform now leads the local or county council or mayoral authority about how it is going so far.What were your expectations after the election?

The bridge is due to open in early 2026.Trump threatens to block new bridge in latest tirade against CanadaRead moreIn his post, Trump had also claimed that Canada owns both ends of the bridge and made a bizarre assertion that increased trade between Canada andChinawould include a ban on Canadians playing ice hockey.“Now, the Canadian Government expects me, as President of theUnited States, to PERMIT them to just ‘take advantage of America!’ What does the United States of America get – Absolutely NOTHING!” he wrote.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of a flashpoint ice hockey game between the two countries at theOlympics, Carney downplayed Trump’s comments, telling reporters in French the “situation will be resolved”.“I explained that Canada paid for the construction of the bridge … that the ownership is shared between the state ofMichiganand the government of Canada, and that in the construction of the bridge, obviously there’s Canadian steel and Canadian workers, but also US steel, US workers that were involved,” he said. “This is a great example of cooperation between our countries.”Trump blamed his predecessor Barack Obama for “stupidly” approving the bridge project. But the former Conservative MP Jeff Watson pointed out “construction began in earnest in your first term as President … Back then you called forexpeditious construction” of the bridge.“It’s just insane, when I read that post I can’t believe what I’m reading, but it’s par for the course,” the Windsor mayor, Drew Dilkens, told CBC News.Since winning a second term, Trump has focused much of his attention and outrage onCanada, replaying many of his longstanding grievances in meandering social media posts, including frustration with the dairy industry and China.Trump has made a number of threats against Canada in his second term and drastically hiked tariffs. After the president imposed tariffs on goods such as steel, aluminum and automobiles, Canada’s most populous provincepulled US spirits and wines from the shelvesof its government-run liquor stores.“Ontario won’t even put US spirits, beverages, and other alcoholic products on their shelves, they are absolutely prohibited from doing so,” Trump wrote.On Tuesday, Ontario’s populist premier, Doug Ford, said he would “double down [on the US liquor ban] if we have to”, adding: “You want to fix it? Get rid of the tariffs.”Trump’s latest tirade reflects his apparently growing concern over Carney’s plans to step up trade withChina– a move the president initially praised.Last month, he said he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China.“China … will eat Canada alive,” Trump wrote on Monday, adding: “The first thing China will do is terminate ALL IceHockeybeing played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.”Canadians poked fun at Trump’s bizarre claim that China would force Canada to give up both its national pastime and the professional hockey’s most coveted trophy as part of a trade deal with Beijing.“if trump knew puck he’d know canada hasn’t had to worry about the stanley cup for a couple decades now,”wrote one user on X, a nod to Canada’s failure to win the top prize since 1993.“Whether this proves real or simply threatened to keep uncertainty high – blocking or barricading bridges is a self-defeating move,” Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.“Through decades of collaboration, Canada and the United States build things together, create jobs together and compete globally together.”Comedian Mark Critchsummed upa weary disbelief among Canadians: “Saying we can’t cross a bridge is epic troll behaviour.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMark CarneyCanadaMichiganTrump administrationChinaHockeynewsShareReuse this content"

This cancellation does not mean that the work to protect the skies is over.”Chile’s environmental evaluation service confirmed that, following meetings last week with AES Andes – the company which had proposed the facility – the project has now been formally withdrawn.Scientists had warned that the INNA facility would affect readings by raising light pollution, causing tiny vibrations in the earth which would affect instruments, aerialise dust which could settle on the mirrors of its precision telescopes, and increase atmospheric turbulence.They argued that there was no need to place the facility so close to the observatories given the potentially disastrous consequences for astronomy.Aes Andes, a subsidiary of US company AES Corporation which generates energy in Chile, Colombia and Argentina, with coal, gas, hydroelectric, wind and solar plants, declined to comment.However, in a press release it said: “After detailed analysis of its portfolio of projects, [AES Andes] has decided to cease the execution of the INNA project,” although it added that it was “absolutely compatible” with other activities in the area.An open letter published in December, led by 2020 Nobel prize winner Reinhard Genzel, had urged the Chilean government to kill the proposed project, as the facility would have been just 11.6km from Paranal, one of the world’s most important observatories.ItsVery Large Telescope(VLT), built 2,600 metres above sea level, has taken the readings that have won three Nobel prizes. And on nearby Cerro Armazones, theExtremely Large Telescope(ELT) – will be the largest and most powerful telescope ever built – is under construction.It will allow astronomers to scour distant galaxies, as well as Earth-like exoplanets in our own galaxy, that might support life.Explore more on these topicsChileAstronomySpaceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Construction began in 2018 and the bridge is nearing completion. The US homeland security department on 30 January published a rule declaring the bridge as an official port of entry.The Canadian embassy in Washington, the office of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and the bridge authority did not immediately comment.The cause of Trump’s rage appears to be a closer trading relationship with China negotiated by the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian imports. “China … will eat Canada alive,” Trump wrote.View image in fullscreenConstruction on the Gordie Howe Bridge last year.Photograph: Carlos Osorio/ReutersTo illustrate his point, Trump then added a particularly wild claim with no factual basis at all: “The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.”Trump’s bizarre claim that China would force Canada to give up its national pastime as part of a trade deal stunned many observers when they saw it in black and white on Monday, but Canadians have heard it before.“Canada’s not doing well, they’re doing very poorly,” Trump said last month at the opening of his wife’s documentary about herself, in commentsbroadcast by Canada’s CTV. “You can’t look at China as the answer,” Trump added.Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, said “canceling this project will have serious repercussions. Higher costs for Michigan businesses, less secure supply chains, and ultimately, fewer jobs.”She added that Trump is “punishing Michiganders for a trade war he started. The only reason Canada is on the verge of a trade deal with China is because President Trump has kicked them in the teeth for a year.”Trump has made a number of threats against Canada in his second term and drastically hiked tariffs on the US northern neighbor. Last month, he said he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCanadaAmericasTrump administrationMichigannewsShareReuse this content"

Donovan takes over after a US navy admiral, Alvin Holsey, chose to retire over reported disagreements over the boat-strike policy.The announcement, which was accompanied by video of the attack, was carried out on a boat “transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the eastern Pacific”, the Pentagon said. The US Coast Guard was called to search for a lone survivor of the attack, the statement said.The new killings bring the death toll to at least 130 in 38 strikes, according to Pentagon statementstallied by the Intercept.Earlier Monday,US militaryforces boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the ship from the Caribbean Sea as part of an oil quarantine meant to squeeze Venezuela, said defense secretary Pete Hegseth.Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Following the US raid to apprehend then president Nicolás Maduro in early January, several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight.Hegseth vowed to eventually capture all those ships, telling a group of shipyard workers in Maine on Monday that “the only guidance I gave to my military commanders is none of those are getting away”.“I don’t care if we got to go around the globe to get them; we’re going to get them,” he added.TheTrump administrationhas seized seven tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of Venezuela’s oil. Aquila II, a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil, has not been formally seized and placed under US control unlike previous actions, a defense official said.Instead, the ship is being held while its ultimate fate is decided by the US, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss decision-making.The Aquila II is owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location .It was one of at least 16 tankers that fled the Venezuelan coast last month, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, who said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship’s movements. According to data transmitted from the ship Monday, it is not currently laden with a cargo of crude oil.The Pentagon’s post on X said the military “conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction” on the ship.“The Aquila II was operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” the Pentagon said. “It ran, and we followed.”A navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, would not say what forces were used in the operation but confirmed the destroyers USS Pinckney and USS John Finn as well as the mobile base ship USS Miguel Keith were operating in the Indian Ocean.In videos the Pentagon posted to social media, uniformed forces can be seen boarding a navy helicopter that takes off from a ship that matches the profile of the Miguel Keith. Video and photos of the tanker shot from inside a helicopter also show a navy destroyer sailing alongside the ship.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaDrugs tradeAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He was described as having access to sensitive military information, including armed forces technologies under development, and is believed to have been recruited by Beijing last year.Greek media reports said he had admitted to photographing and transmitting classified Nato documents using specialised encryption software provided by Chinese intelligence. He allegedly received tradecraft training in China during an undeclared trip to the country that military sources claimed had ultimately exposed him.In a statement made by his lawyer after the court appearance, Flessas said: “Unknowingly and without intent, I became involved in something that developed in a way that became nightmarish, dangerous and illegal. In my testimony I did not try to justify myself or, in reality, even defend myself … I ask to be punished with a fair punishment.”Greek authorities were reportedly tipped off by the CIA about the extent of the leak, and in a highly unusual statement after Flessas’s arrest on 5 February the Greek general staff said there was “clear evidence of criminal offences under the military penal code”.Chinese operatives are thought to have initially approached their target online before recruiting him at a Nato conference in an unidentified European country. Flessas has been cited as saying he was lured with promises of financial rewards made in foreign currencies and digital payments of between €5,000 and €15,000 for every transmission made. He told the military magistrate on Tuesday that contact with agents that would lead to his handler was first made via LinkedIn.Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired US senior intelligence officer with considerable expertise in Chinese espionage operations, told the Guardian the case was a wake-up call for the Greek government and military.“[It’s] significant because it shows China’s desire and ability to penetrate the military communications infrastructure ofGreeceand other Nato members,” he said. “Nations spy against other militaries to give them an advantage in war. Despite all the proclamations of friendship and economic engagement, China continues to evolve as a threat to democracies worldwide.”Flessas had previously served as a Nato evaluator in information systems and at the time of his arrest was commanding a battalion in the Athenian suburb of Kavouri training in telecommunications.Eftimiades, whose book ChineseEspionageOperations and Tactics was released last year, said because citizens in China were required by law to support their country’s espionage efforts, the west was increasingly vulnerable to Beijing’s spymasters.Last week, four people including two Chinese nationals were arrested in France on suspicion of intercepting and collecting military intelligence. In Germany last September, aformer aideto a member of parliament for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party was sentenced to almost five years in prison for spying on behalf of China.“China uses a ‘whole of society’ approach to conduct worldwide espionage,” said Eftimiades, who now teaches homeland security at Penn State University. “[It] is unlike the efforts of any western government. The sheer volume of activity makes it impossible to counter … western societies are open democracies. This makes them extremely vulnerable to China’s covert influence efforts.”Hostile powers sending spies to west’s universities, says former security chiefRead moreMedia reports on Tuesday suggested the Hellenic air force officer was cooperating fully with authorities. Well-placed insiders said there were fears of other military officials being implicated. One said the armed forces were airing the case so publicly as a warning.“What we are seeing is unprecedented,” said Plamen Tonchev, an expert in Sino-Greek affairs. “Greece is seen as a relatively China-friendly country. This is the very first time that China is so openly implicated in an espionage case of this kind.”Tonchev said the episode was bound “to tarnish the image” of Beijing in a country where it had acquired control of much of the port of Piraeus a decade ago.An estimated 24% of imports to Europe from China are shipped through Piraeus’s container terminals, and Tonchev said this was a source of “great pride” for Beijing.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEspionageChinaEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The charges were widely seen as being politically motivated and designed to silence one of Hong Kong’s most influential pro-democracy campaigners.Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that was forced to close in 2021 amid a crackdown on dissent in the Hong Kong. After months of protests, which Lai and his newspaper supported, Beijing imposed a national security law on the city. Lai was one of the earliest, and most high-profile, people to be arrested under the new legislation.The US, the UK, the EU and the UN havecondemned the heavy sentencehanded down to Lai, a British citizen, and called for his release. Lai’s sentence is the harshest meted out under the national security law and is longer than the punishments given to mainland China’s most well-known dissidents.View image in fullscreenJimmy Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that was forced to close in 2021.Photograph: Vincent Yu/APBut Hong Kong’s press associations, once the voices of media freedom in the city, reacted with silence, underscoring the narrowing space for commentary that could be seen as critical of the authorities.Selina Cheng, the chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), said: “I’m not free to speak my mind on the Apple Daily sentencing.”The HKJA has been attacked before by the Hong Kong government for “whitewashing” Lai, and theassociation and Cheng personallyhave also been targeted by Chinese state media.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong (FCC) said it had no comment about the heavy sentence given to one of Hong Kong’s most influential media figures.7:19Jimmy Lai: will Hong Kong media tycoon die in jail? | The LatestMike Bird, a journalist for The Economist, wrote on X: “I am so glad in retrospect that I never joined the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents’ Club, an organisation that has repeatedly disgraced itself over the past half a decade in exchange for a cheap bar.”The FCC did not respond to an immediate request for comment about that characterisation.An analysis by Hong Kong Free Press, a local outlet,showedthat the number of statements issued by the FCC in support of press freedom has declined dramatically since the imposition of the national security law.Hong Kong’s three other press associations, the Beijing-backed Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, the Hong Kong News Executives Association and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association also did not publish statements about Lai’s sentence.Hong Kong authorities trying to disrupt independent press with ‘strange’ tax auditsRead moreRonson Chan, a former chair of the HKJA, said: “It’s abnormal for these five associations [to have] no response to Jimmy Lai’s case, whether they support or regret the sentencing”. Chan said it was a “manipulation by the authority” to “disconnect the sentencing” from press freedom issues.Hong Kong’s local media outlets, however, generally celebrated the sentence given to Lai and his co-defendants, who include six former executives from Lai’s media company.The SouthChinaMorning Post, which is owned by the Chinese tech company Alibaba, published an editorial arguing that Lai’s case shows that the rule of law remains “robust” in Hong Kong and that the sentence reflects “the gravity of his crimes”.HK01, a pro-Beijing outlet, also praised the sentencing and said that it “marks the end of that politically chaotic period”.Jimmy Lai’s sentencing tells me this: democracy is dead in Hong Kong, and I escaped just in time | Nathan LawRead moreTa Kung Pao, a state-owned newspaper, said: “The anti-China and pro-chaos forces represented by Jimmy Lai have been forever nailed to the pillar of historical shame.”Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager for Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said: “Since the enactment of the national security law, media organisations and journalists in Hong Kong have faced unprecedented pressure from the authorities. In addition to judicial harassment, they are subjected to surveillance, threats, doxing, and online abuse, while foreign reporters are increasingly denied entry … Hong Kong no longer provides space for critical voices.”Beh Lih Yi, the Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: “We need to be clear-eyed: it is the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities that have created a repressive climate of fear. Five years since the Beijing-imposed national security law, Hong Kong’s once-vibrant free press is a ghost of its former self.”Hong Kong has plummeted down RSF’s press freedom index in recent years, now ranking 140th out of 180 territories surveyed.Meanwhile, China’s State Council, the highest organ of government, published a white paper on Tuesday titled: “Hong Kong: Safeguarding China’s National Security Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems.”The policy document detailed the “unrelenting fight” for national security in Hong Kong and underscored the authority of the central government in Beijing.The paper said that the Beijing’s rule in Hong Kong “serves China’s fundamental interests, benefits the residents of Hong Kong, and meets the interests of external investors”.The Hong Kong government has been contacted for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

We had no idea the court case was going ahead.”While the men initially believed the court case was linked to the deaths of their daughters, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed the destruction-of-evidence charges only related to the death of the American tourist.“We’ve been in touch with the government yesterday and last night and what we’re … asking them to do is to step up and represent our girls in the way that they deserve to be represented,” Bowles said.“Because we just we’re out of options. It’s pretty devastating.”The department has apologised to the families for failing to keep it informed about the court outcome.“The department prides itself in its commitment to consular service and to ensuring that the interests of consular clients and their families are paramount,” it said.“On this occasion, we fell short of our aspiration.”Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said she had made it clear to her Lao counterpart that Australia expects “full accountability” and stressed charges should reflect the seriousness of the tragedy.“We continue to press Lao authorities on the cases relating to Holly and Bianca’s deaths, and we will continue to support Holly and Bianca’s families at this distressing time,” she said.The Laotian government previously vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice in accordance with the law”.In question time, Mr Albanese acknowledged the recent events had “added to the heartbreak” of the families.“We’ll continue to engage Laos authorities on these cases and we’ll do everything we can to support Holly and Bianca’s families at this distressing time,” he said.Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, who has previously met the victims’ families, had outright contempt for the court outcome.“You can’t even really call it a punishment, can you?

She filed lawsuits against Palmer in Massachusetts and in New York on the same day she filed the Wisconsin action.Gaiman has a home in north-western Wisconsin, and Palmer lives in Massachusetts. Pavlovich moved to drop the New York lawsuit against Palmer in May, explaining in court documents that she filed an action in that state because Palmer had recently relocated from New York to Massachusetts and she was unsure which state had jurisdiction. US district judge Mary Kay Vyskocil in New York granted the request in June.Pavlovich also dropped the portion of the Wisconsin lawsuit against Palmer in May, and US district judge James Peterson in Madison dismissed the rest of it in October, saying Pavlovich needed to pursue the case in New Zealand. US district judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston threw out the Massachusetts filing on Friday on the same grounds.Pavlovich’s attorneys did not respond to emails from the Associated Press seeking comment on Monday. Attorneys listed for Gaiman and Palmer did not respond to messages, either.The AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York magazine, which published an article in January 2025 detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.Pavlovich alleged in her lawsuits that she was 22 and homeless when she met Palmer in Auckland in 2020. Palmer invited Pavlovich to the couple’s Waiheke Island home, and she eventually became their son’s nanny, according to the filings.Pavlovich alleged in the lawsuits that Gaiman sexually assaulted her on the night they met in February 2022. The assaults continued, according to the filings, but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless, and Gaiman had told her that he would help her writing career.When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits. The assaults finally stopped when Pavlovich told Palmer that she was going to kill herself, according to the filings.Pavlovich went on to allege that Palmer knew of Gaiman’s sexual desires and presented her to him, knowing he would assault her. She argued that Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and demanded at least $7m in damagesGaiman released a statement after the New York magazine article was published, denying he had ever sexually abused anyone.Gaiman’s attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss the Wisconsin lawsuit that Gaiman and Pavlovich had a brief personal relationship that involved “consensual physical intimacy”.Police in New Zealand investigated her assault allegations and found them meritless, the motion says. The attorneys went on to argue that Pavlovich’s lawsuits were the culmination of a plan to smear Gaiman and that any legal disputes should be resolved in New Zealand, not the US.Gaiman has authored numerous science fiction and fantasy works, including the novels American Gods, The Graveyard Book, Anansi Boys and the children’s dark fairy tale, Coraline.His 2013 novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, won the National Book award in Britain.Explore more on these topicsNeil GaimanNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

At a glance, that seems more or less the same price as the loose cavendish bananas next to them on the shelf, priced at $3.50/kg.However, when a Guardian reader weighed a bunch of the “kids’ bananas” – which was 530g – they worked out their per-kilogram price was significantly more expensive at $6.98 – that’s a 99% price increase for smaller pieces of the same fruit.Guardian Australia has reviewed a range of examples of confusing and seemingly random per unit pricing, a practice the supermarkets are expanding that makes it extremely difficult for shoppers to compare prices.Confusing pricing conceals wild variationsUnder the existing rules, the major supermarkets can price fruit and vegetables per unit or per kilogram, whether they are packaged or loose.Because supermarkets are not required to display a per-kilogram price, or even the average weight of items, shoppers are unlikely to know whether they are actually getting a good deal when paying a set price for each item.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe same Guardian reader who weighed the bananas did another test at their local Woolworths, this time on cucumbers.Lebanese cucumbers were priced at $4.90/kg, right next to continental cucumbers, priced at $2.50 each. The continental variety might seem cheaper, especially because they are bigger.View image in fullscreenDario Bulfone from Aumanns in Warrandyte in Melbourne says presenting fixed per-unit pricing without a ‘true weight reconciliation’ can create confusion for customers.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianBut when the reader weighed one continental cucumber – at 340g – they worked out that the cost per kilogram was $7.35. While not exactly the same product, it cost 50% more per kilogram compared to the Lebanese variety.A Woolworths spokesperson said the pricing they used was “clearly communicated to allow our customers to make informed choices when it comes to their purchases”.Random nature of unit pricing on displayIn stores, Woolworths,Colesand Aldi have all been expanding their use of per-unit pricing, and often do not display per-kilogram pricing.Coles has said it is trialling an expansion of per-unit pricing. However, when Guardian Australia visited a Coles in Melbourne this week, more than half of the fresh produce was already priced per item, in what seemed like a random fashion.Cauliflowers were priced at $5 each, next to broccoli which was priced at $8/kg. Silver beet, kale, celery, spring onions, pak choy, leeks, wombok were all sold per-unit, as were kiwifruit, lemons, limes, sweet corn, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit and different melons.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

There was no per-kilogram price displayed on the tickets and no weight marked on the packaging.A spokesperson for Coles said the mix of per-kilogram and per-unit pricing made it easier for consumers.“Many items are commonly selected as individual pieces, and per-unit pricing makes it easier for customers to quickly choose the number of items they need,” they said.They said their goal was to “balance transparency with simplicity, so customers can easily understand prices and shop in the way that suits them best”.View image in fullscreenDario Bulfone says it isn’t complicated to take the average weight of products and adjust their final prices based on their actual weight.Photograph: Penny Stephens/The GuardianIt was similar at Aldi: rock melons priced at $4.99 each sat next to watermelons priced at $1.99/kg. You could buy bags of five lemons for $5.99 per bag which the price tag said worked out to $1.20 each, next to a basket of loose lemons for sale for $1.49/each.There are no scales in Aldi stores, so it’s impossible for a customer to weigh five loose lemons and work out if they are a better deal. Aldi declined to comment.Even more inconsistencies shopping onlineGuardian Australia reported last monththat the major supermarkets’ shift to charging customers for fresh produce by the item, rather than by weight, was leading to “wild volatility” in pricing with some items more than 50% more expensive.When buying groceries online from Coles and Aldi, the supermarkets displayed an approximate per-unit price for some fruits and vegetables online next to each item’s average weight and the price a kilogram.For these items, Coles and Aldi adjust the final price depending on the actual weight.Dario Bulfone, who works in operations at the local greengrocer Aumanns at Warrandyte, said it was “not complicated at all” to take the average weight of products and adjust their final prices based on their actual weight.When Woolworths sells groceries online it prices fresh produce items individually and the prices are fixed regardless of how much each piece weighs.Bulfone said presenting fixed per-unit pricing without a “true weight reconciliation” created confusion at best and, at worst, systematically disadvantaged customers.“The technology already exists. The systems already exist,” he said. “Choosing not to do it is not a technical limitation. It’s a decision.”A Woolworths spokesperson said it was “investigating additional system capability” for online customers who “might prefer an approach that mirrors how we price in our stores”.Consumer advocates have called for supermarkets to be required to consistently display and charge fresh produce prices per kilogram, in stores and online, with any displayed per-unit to be estimates only.The assistant competition minister, Andrew Leigh, did not answer directly when asked by Guardian Australia if he would support this mandate.Instead, he pointed to the Albanese government’s commitment to strengthening some other pricing rules, which he said was “about clear, accessible information which allows shoppers to compare prices fairly and make informed choices”.The government has not announced any reforms to per-unit pricing.Do you know more?

Eyewitness accounts and mobile phone footage captured officerspepper spraying demonstrators,punching a manwith his hands up, and forcibly dragging a group ofMuslim men kneeling in prayer.Sydney protest: NSW premier Chris Minns defends police in ‘impossible situation’ after video emerges of officers punching protestersRead more“We are disappointed that it is a Labor government – a government we worked to elect – that has presided over the terrible erosion of civil liberties in NSW and we are deeply distressed that it is a Labor government that enabled the violence we saw against protesters at Town Hall last night,” the letter, signed by ordinary Labor members, reads.NSW police on Tuesdaycharged nine people after the protest, with offences including assaulting police, assault, hindering police and behaving in an offensive manner. Police had previously said 27 people were arrested. An additional six people will be issued with court attendance notices for refusing or failing to comply with directions.2:00Pepper spray and questionable police tactics: how a Sydney protest ended in chaos – videoThe NSW premier, Chris Minns,defended the actions of police, claiming the protesters created an “impossible situation” as officers responded to the visit of Herzog at a major Jewish community event on the other side of the CBD. Minns said the actions of police would be investigated, including analysis of body-worn camera footage, but said critics should consider the “full context” of videos that went viral online, rather than making a judgment based on a “15 second social media clip”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailCatley said in a press conference that police had done a “good job under incredibly difficult circumstances”, claiming officers had told her the crowd had been more aggressive than they had encountered before.Stephen Lawrence, a NSW Labor MP, questioned the police tactics and said he’d witnessed violence at the rally.Map of march locations considered ahead of Isaac Herzog protestsIn the letter to Catley, the Labor Friends of Palestine group said some of its members were at the protest, and witnessed what they called “numerous examples of police harassment and violence”, including police pushing and shoving protesters, people being thrown to the ground, and a man being pepper sprayed while held down.“We write to you to express our distress and disgust at the police harassment and violence we experienced and witnessed at last night’s Town Hall protest,” the letter said.“We must also raise our deep distress at witnessing Muslim comrades being assaulted whilst praying. The police behaviour in this instance was completely unwarranted and utterly reprehensible.“We call on you to initiate a thorough independent investigation into NSW police behaviour before, during and after the Town Hall protest. We also urge you to work with police and civil society representatives to develop a more progressive approach to the policing of protest to ensure that the right to political expression is protected and we never see another protest like the one we experienced yesterday.”Sheikh who led prayer at Sydney protest against Herzog says police were ‘unhinged and aggressive’Read moreHerzog will visit Canberra on Wednesday, for meetings with the governor general, Sam Mostyn, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. In parliament on Tuesday,Albanese urged calmand said while there was a place for demonstrations, he called for them to be peaceful.“I’ve consistently said that every life matters, whether Israeli or Palestinian and the violence that we saw last night was devastating. All Australians would have found those scenes very confronting,” Albanese said.Specifically mentioning the incident around the group in prayer, Albanese said many people would “want to know all of the circumstances around that”, but added: “I will allow the police to do their job”.The federal Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, said on social media that police had appeared “to use excessive and unprovoked force against Muslims peacefully praying”, describing police actions as “unprovoked and unacceptable” and calling on Minns and police to apologise.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingLabor partyChris MinnsSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill also responds to the Wieambilla inquest.The state coroner, Terry Ryan,released his findings into the 2022 killingsof police constables Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow and neighbour Alan Dare in November.Queensland government to introduce new gun control laws criticised as ‘weakest in Australia’Read moreThey were gunned down on a rural property by a trio suffering from a shared delusional disorder. Some of the firearms used in the shooting were possessed lawfully, Ryan found, despite the owner, Nathaniel Train, being mentally ill.Ryan recommended last year that the government consider “the feasibility of the introduction of mandatory mental health assessments for weapons licence applicants”.The police minister, Dan Purdie, said there had been “issues” with the system in Western Australia, where a similar requirement applied.“In WA the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has raised concerns about whether GPs have the proper skills to do that risk assessment, and that has posed issues where this has been done in other areas,” Purdie said.“I’ve been told that that’s more assessed to a forensic psychologist or forensic psychiatrist, of which we don’t have too many of them scattered across Queensland.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe shadow attorney general, Meaghan Scanlon, said the government had “clearly buckled to the gun lobby”.The Queensland governmenthad also opted to not take part in the national gun buyback, and rejected putting new restrictions on the number or type of firearms that people can own.“The LNP have ignored the recommendations from the coronial inquest, and they have ignored the families of Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold,” Scanlon said.“None of these reforms would actually have prevented the fatalities that occurred in Bondi or Wieambilla. The reforms that David Crisafulli has put forward effectively just put in place things that already exist.”The McCrow and Arnold families said in a statement they “welcome any policies or procedure changes designed to better protect QPS officers”.“The families will always continue to advocate for improved training, communication and protective equipment.”Instead the government opted to change the rules to make it mandatory for carers in the public health system to report high-risk patients to Queensland police.Clinicians already have that power, but have the choice whether to use it. About 550 people were reported through the current system last year, according to the health minister, Tim Nicholls.The government would also simplify the paperwork requirements for police to issue a firearm prohibition order, and act on other coronial recommendations by investing $5.3m in drone technology, improving intelligence-sharing between Queensland and federal police and investing in better communications for police.The coroner found the Wieambilla shootings “were not a consequence of a systems failure, because the Trains were “not known to” any health professional.A senior advocacy adviser of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, Stephen Bendle, said the government had not considered any preventive measures “whatsoever”.“There is still nothing in there that goes any way towards preventing firearm violence or reducing the number of firearms in the community, which is what the majority of Queenslanders expect,” he said.Power to ban slogansThe government alsounveiled its hate speech reforms on Tuesday.The legislation grants the attorney general the power to ban slogans, which she has said she would use to prohibit “from the river to the sea” and “globalise the intifada”.The legislation is subject to a number of restrictions, including that the minister is satisfied that a prohibited expression “is regularly used to incite discrimination, hostility or violence towards a relevant group”.Justice for Palestine said on Monday it was considering legal action in a bid to overturn the laws.Anne Twomey, a professor of constitutional law, said it was difficult to say whether the “proposed offence of reciting, publishing or displaying prohibited expressions” would be upheld or not.Queensland moves to ban pro-Palestine slogan ‘from the river to the sea’ under sweeping new hate speech lawsRead more“On the one hand, the proposed laws permit regulations to be made to prohibit particular expressions. As this is not ‘content-neutral’, but rather directed at specified expressions of political views, it will require high level scrutiny by a court and a compelling reason to survive that constitutional scrutiny,” she said.“On the other hand, the offence is subject to a number of restrictions in its operation which tie it to serious harms and it also permits exclusions based upon a reasonable excuse.”Twomey said the law protected a much broader range of groups than recent commonwealth legislation, including religion, sexuality, sex characteristics or gender identity.“So a banned expression could be one that is regarded as inciting hostility towards people who have transitioned, for example,” she said.The legislation also allows police to detain and search a person reasonably suspected of the offence without a warrant.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsGun controlAustralian lawLiberal National partyLabor partyQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

New York and San Francisco had similar pilot schemes but Ireland is believed to be the first country to make one permanent.The pilot, for which 2,000 artists were randomly selected from 8,000 applicants, lowered the likelihood of artists experiencing enforced deprivation and reduced their levels of anxiety and reliance on supplementary income, a study found.The scheme recouped more than its net cost of €72m through increases in arts-related expenditure, productivity gains and reduced reliance on other welfare payments, according to a government-commissionedcost-benefit analysis.Peter Power, a member of the National Campaign for the Arts steering committee, said it was a real-world test of what happened when people were given stability instead of precarity. “Artists on the scheme spent more time creating and less time trapped in unrelated jobs just to survive, and many became better able to sustain themselves through their work alone,” he said.A more vibrant arts sector brought myriad benefits such as greater economic activity, improved mental wellbeing, critical thinking and innovation, Power added.Under eligibility rules, artists can receive support for three out of every six years. An artist selected for the 2026-29 cycle must skip the next cycle but can reapply for the following one.Guidelines about the scheme, which has an initial budget of €18.27m (£16m), will be published in April. Applications for the cycle that begins in 2026 will open in May, with payments starting September and continuing until September 2029. Applicants are to be randomly selected.Jenny Dagg, a Maynooth University sociologist whostudied the scheme, said it was a win for all but noted that eligible artists could not live solely on the weekly payments, which were considered supplementary income.Artists have welcomed the scheme but said they still faced a cost of living andhousing crisis. Rents in Dublin have doubled since 2013, forcing many young people to continue living with their parents.Explore more on these topicsIrelandArts policyUniversal basic incomeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These would be crucial if Russia came into conflict with Nato elsewhere.“We don’t take that off the table, because it’s still an option for Russia to do that in order to make sure that their nuclear capabilities, their second strike capabilities, are protected. That’s sort of the scenario in the high north that we plan for,” he said.In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Kristoffersen was sharply critical of recent comments by Donald Trump on Greenland, as well as of the US president’s“unacceptable” claimsthat allied countries had not served in frontline positions in Afghanistan while US troops had done the bulk of the fighting.“It didn’t make sense, what he said, and I know that all my American friends from Afghanistan know that,” said Kristoffersen, 56, a career army officer who served several tours in Afghanistan.Map of northern Norway“We were definitely in the frontline. We did all the full spectrum of missions, from arresting Taliban leaders to training Afghans to doing surveillance. We lost 10 Norwegians. I lost friends there. So we all felt it doesn’t make sense,” he said.“At the same time, I felt that this is President Trump. I never saw him in Afghanistan. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about when he says these things. A president should not say these things, but it didn’t really affect me. But my concern was for the Norwegian veterans, the relatives of the people we lost, soldiers we lost.”Kristoffersen has been Norway’s chief of defence since 2020, responsible for the country’s armed forces as well as its intelligence service. It has been a period of intense change as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced a rethink of European security, with neighbouring Sweden and Finland joining Norway in the Nato alliance, and the country reinforcing its border areas with Russia in the far north.Kristoffersen said that while Norway was keeping the threat of a traditional Russian invasion in mind, the current Russian tactics were more diffuse. “If you prepare for the worst, there is nothing that prevents you from also being able to counter sabotage and more hybrid threats,” he said.He added, however, that Norway and Russia still maintained some direct contact over search and rescue missions in the Barents Sea, and that there were regular meetings at the border between representatives of the two militaries.He has recommended setting up a military hotline between the two capitals to have a channel of communication to avoid escalation based on misunderstanding. He said Russian actions in the far north had generally been less aggressive than those in the Baltic Sea.“So far, what we have seen of airspace violation in our area has been misunderstandings. Russia is conducting a lot of [GPS] jamming, and we think that the jamming also affects their aircraft,” he said.“They haven’t said that, but we see that when something like violating the airspace happens it’s usually because of a lack of experience from the pilots. When we talk with the Russians, they actually respond in a very professional and predictable way.”On Norway’snorthern territory of Svalbard, which contains a Russian settlement and is not allowed to be militarised under the provisions of a 1920 treaty, Kristoffersen said Russia was “respecting the treaty” and that Norway had no plans to militarise the area.Moscow has accused Oslo of performing stealth militarisation of Svalbard but Kristoffersen said this was just a propaganda claim that Moscow did not really believe.View image in fullscreenNorway’s northern territory of Svalbard contains a Russian settlement.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhen it came to Trump’s assertion that China and Russia had military designs onGreenland, Krisoffersen said it was “very strange” to hear the claims.“We have a very good overview of what is happening in theArcticfrom our intelligence service and we don’t see anything like that in Greenland … we see Russian activity with their submarines and also their underwater programme in the traditional part of the Arctic … but it’s not about Greenland, it’s about reaching the Atlantic,” he said.His remarks came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, used an interview with a group of European newspapers to say Europe was in a “Greenland moment” and to call on countries to stand up to Trump.Macron said that when there was “blatant aggression … we must not bow down or try to reach a settlement. We tried this strategy for months and it’s not working. But above all, it strategically leads Europe to increase its dependence.”He said the scare over Greenland was far from over. “There are threats and intimidation and then suddenly Washington backs down. And we think it’s over. But don’t believe it for a second,” he said.Kristoffersen, asked whether Denmark and its allies would have any chance of repelling a US military takeover of Greenland if Trump went through with it, said: “They won’t do it, so it’s a hypothetical question.”But he added a word of warning for Trump and the US military. “If Russia is learning something from the war in Ukraine, I think it’s that it’s never a good idea to occupy a country. If the people don’t want it, it’s going to cost you a lot of money and a lot of effort and in the end you will actually lose.“To occupy in the first place is often very easy, but to keep the occupation going is very, very hard. And I think all expansionist powers have experienced that.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayRussiaArcticEuropeDonald TrumpGreenlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Ferries had struggled to keep up regular service in the frozen sea after weeks of temperatures dropping to -10C (14F).View image in fullscreenThe first official ice road of the season opened between Estonian islands Hiiumaa and SaaremaaPhotograph: Janis Laizans/ReutersPeople living on the smaller island of Hiiumaa, with a population of about 9,000, travel to Saaremaa, population roughly 31,000, for shopping, a cup of coffee or to drop-off children at school. Getting to the larger island also ensures connection to mainland Estonia.While opening the ice road came out of necessity, Hergo Tasuja, the mayor of Hiiumaa, said it was also “part of our culture”.“For generations and generations, local people who live here, especially those who live near the sea, swim and use boats in the summertime,” Tasuja said. “And in winter, it’s in their blood to go to the sea” and step out on the ice.View image in fullscreenAuthorities decided to open the ice road after local residents spontaneously began driving across the frozen sea, exposing themselves to serious risks.Photograph: Janis Laizans/ReutersThe “ice road” is essentially a marked corridor on the frozen sea where specialists have determined the ice is thick enough to sustain the weight of driving cars.Preparing the road is not easy, said Marek Koppel, a road maintenance supervisor at Verston Eesti, the Estonian construction company in charge of building and managing the road.Workers have to measure ice thickness every 100 metres to determine the areas with more than 24cm of ice, the minimum required for safety. They smooth over ridged ice and cracks. Weather conditions and the solidity of ice are monitored around the clock and the route amended accordingly.A vehicle cannot be heavier than 2.5 tonnes and must drive either below 20km/h (12.4mph) or between 40 and 70km/h (25 and 43mph) – anything in between can create a vibration that damages the ice.View image in fullscreenTwo cars cross the frozen Soela strait in the Baltic Sea near Hiiumaa.Photograph: Kostya Manekov/APCars are not allowed to stop and need to maintain a safe distance from one other. Passengers cannot wear seatbelts and doors must be easy to open, to allow for a fast exit in case of an accident.“The road was pretty good, it was easy to ride,” said Alexei Ulyvanov, who lives in nearby Tallinn and travelled to the islands to show his children “that it’s possible to ride a car over the sea”.According to Tasuja, an “ice road” was last used to connect the islands eight years ago. Since then, the country’s winters have been too warm.Verston, the construction company, said authorities had contracted them to open two more ice routes this week, this time linking mainland Estonia to two smaller islands.Explore more on these topicsEstoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

DNA traces detected on the firearms belonged only to the deceased men, they said.Then, on Sunday, the police discovered the bodies of three more people, two men aged 51 and 22 and a 15-year-old boy, in a campervan in the Okolchitsa Peak area, about 62 miles (100km) north of the capital, Sofia. The trio was tracked down by law enforcement as investigators suspected they were linked to the Petrohan pass deaths.View image in fullscreenZahari Vaskov, the director of the national police general directorate, told a press conference on Monday the deaths were ‘a case without comparison in our country’.Photograph: Bulgarian Ministry of InteriorAgence France-Presse reported that the prosecutors’ office said on Tuesday: “Based on the autopsy data for the [latter] three bodies, it appears that there were probably two murders committed successively and one suicide.”According to the police, five of the deceased were members of the National Protected Areas Control Agency, a non-governmental organisation devoted to nature protection which used the Petrohan pass lodge as a headquarters and also hosted rural holiday camps for young people.Some accounts have described its members as “forest rangers” who for years patrolled the area near the Serbian border and assisted border police. Meanwhile, law enforcement have said the men were involved in Tibetan Buddhism and quoted a relative of one member who spoke of “exceptional psychological instability” within the group.Those close to the deceased have said they must have been killed because they witnessed criminal activity around the Bulgarian-Serbian border, where people smuggling and illegal logging activities are not uncommon.Ralitsa Asenova, the mother of one of the victims found in the campervan, dismissed reports of tensions within the group. “They obviously witnessed something. For me, this is a professionally committed murder,” she said in an interview with Nova, a Bulgarian TV station.As details remain sparse, a lack of official information has led to often groundless speculation spreading online and has further undermined Bulgarians’ low trust in their institutions and authorities. The country is without a government and is headed towards its eighth parliamentary election in five years.The former president Rumen Radev called the case “a political shock and a sign of the country’s condition”, according to his press office. Radev, who resigned as head of state last month after nine years in office, offered his condolences to the deceaseds’ families and urged the authorities to solve the case.“I will not comment on this tragedy, which must be investigated by the competent authorities. The causes of these murders must be clarified as quickly as possible, because the public expects answers,” he said.In 2024 a survey found that 70% of Bulgarians believed in conspiracy theories while 37% had fallen foul of misinformation – so much so that the authors of the study, by the Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) and the Bulgarian-Romanian Observatory of Digital Media, said Bulgaria was living in a “post-truth” situation.Explore more on these topicsBulgariaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The safe list also includes Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia.Rights groups have raised the alarm about the inclusion of Tunisia, where President Kaïs Saïed has cracked down on civil society and opposition figures have beenjailed for up to 66 years by politically controlled courts. Tunisian forces have alsoforced back migrants to remote desert regions, where some have died of thirst.A coalition of 39NGOs said in a statementbefore Tuesday’s vote that designating Tunisia as a safe country of origin deprived “Tunisian nationals of their right to an individual, fair, and effective assessment of their asylum claims, while giving the Tunisian authorities a renewed carte blanche to continue their systematic violations against migrants, civil society and the wider civic space”.Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP, who led the European parliament’s work on the safe countries of origin list, hailed the result: “This is the beginning of a new phase: migration is no longer endured but governed.”He said: “For too long, political decisions in migration policy have been systematically called into question by divergent judicial interpretations, paralysing state action and fuelling administrative chaos.”Ciriani is member of Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, which has clashed with Italian and European judges, who have ruled against the government’s arrangements with Albania.In 2024an Italian court ruledthat seven men at the Albanian facility would be transferred to Italy, disagreeing with the safe country of origin argument presented by Italy.Italy had argued that the men could be transferred to their “safe” home countries of Bangladesh and Egypt, but the judges said there was a lack of transparency in how safety was assessed.The EU has been tightening refugee rules since more than 1.3 million people claimed asylum duringthe 2015 migration crisis, but the trend has accelerated with electoral gains by nationalist and far-right parties.In the search for “innovative solutions”, EU leaders in 2024endorsed the concept of offshore return hubs– processing centres for people denied asylum in the EU.The rightwing Dutch governmentannounced last Septemberit had reached a deal with Uganda to enable the deportation of Africans denied asylum in the Netherlands. Denmark’s Social Democrat government had previously explored processing asylum claimants in Rwanda, but never went ahead.Last year 155,100 people risked their lives travelling in unseaworthy boats across the Mediterranean, while 1,953 died or went missing, according to the UN refugee agency.The deadly toll has continued in the first weeks of 2026. As manyas 380 people were feared drownedafter a boat from Tunisia sailed into a cyclone last month.Supporters of the new measures argue they undermine the business model of people smugglers.“People who genuinely need protection must receive it, but not necessarily in theEuropean Union. Effective protection can also be provided in a safe third country, while individual assessment remains fully guaranteed,” said Assita Kanko, a Flemish nationalist politician.The International Rescue Committee described the votes as deeply disappointing.“The new ‘safe third country’ rules are likely to force people to countries they may never have set foot in – places where they have no community, do not speak the language and face a very real risk of abuse and exploitation,” said the IRC’s senior advocacy adviser, Meron Ameha Knikman.The two laws were passed with strong support from the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) and three nationalist and far-right groups.The votes were the latest sign of a new dynamic in the European parliament after the election of a record number of nationalist and far-right MEPs to the right of the traditional Christian Democrats in 2024.While critics accused the EPP of breaking thecordon sanitaire, voting lists revealed a more complex picture. The centre-left was deeply divided, with significant minorities of socialist and centrist MEPs voting in favour of the new laws, while many centrists abstained.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionMigrationEuropeRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

He is expected to provide Trump with fresh intelligence about Iran’s military capabilities, including new long-range ballistic missiles.Netanyahu faces a delicate task in setting out his stall because he risks being seen as challenging two of Trump’s most respected aides by mapping out a set of demands that could force the US into prolonged conflict with Iran.He also risks angering Trump by opening up divisions in the Republican party, especially if he reminds the US president that he made repeated unfulfilled promises to come to the help of Iranian protesters.Netanyahu’s turbulent relationship with Trump was already entering another rough patch as he continues to stall on his Gaza peace plan by barring a Palestinian technocratic body from entering the strip, and seeking in effect to annex the West Bank.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAIn a sign that he knows he is treading on thin ice, Netanyahu agreed to take the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, with him. Before heading to Washington, Huckabee said there was “an extraordinary alignment between US and Israel on Iran”, and that as far as he knew the two sides shared the same red lines.Iran expressed its anger at Israel’s intervention. Ali Larijani, the the head of the Supreme National Security Council, the body overseeing Tehran’s negotiating strategy, said: “The Americans should think wisely and not allow him, with his posturing, to create the impression before his flight that he is going to the United States to set the framework of nuclear negotiations. They must remain vigilant regarding Israel’s destructive role.”Larijani met the mediators between Washington and Tehran in Muscat to discuss the agenda for further talks.‘A step in the wrong direction’: Israel’s West Bank plans prompt global backlashRead moreIran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, said in his weekly press briefing: “Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region.”Israel’s alarm about a potential deal that undercuts its ambitions for regime change in Tehran has grown ever since the US agreed toreopen indirect talks with Iran, which started in Oman on Friday.The Iranian government also still faces political challenges at home, with more reformist groups and academics issuing statements protesting against the suppression of dissent and, in particular,the arrest of leaders of the Reformist Front.The front issued a further statement expressing its shock, and warning that the regime’s exclusionary approach and baseless accusations would worsen the political deadlock and “strengthen the violent and war-mongering factions supporting Israel”. It called on Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to intervene urgently to secure the release of its leadership.Even if the planned second round of talks are confined to Iran’s nuclear programme, as Tehran wants, there is no guarantee of success because it insists on maintaining its right to enrich uranium as fuel for nuclear power plants, something the US permitted under the 2015 deal but Trump has appeared to rule out.Trump has sent the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships to the region, which are capable of hitting a huge range of Iranian military and economic sties. The US has also buttressed the air defences of US bases across the region.The head of Iran’s atomic energy authority has said Tehran may be prepared to dilute its stock of highly enriched uranium to 60% purity, a limited concession given the 2015 deal limited it to enriching to 3.75% purity.Explore more on these topicsIran nuclear programmeIranIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuTrump administrationUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It would also put the world’s most populous Islamic country at the heart of the Middle East’s most intractable conflict.Maruli said he expected an army brigade, between 5,000 and 8,000 troops, to be sent but emphasised that the mission was still in the planning stages. “It’s all still being negotiated, not certain. So there’s no certainty on the number until now,” Maruli said.The potential role of an international force has been hazy since Trump suggested it as part of his ceasefire plan in September last year. Suggested troop contributors, Indonesia included, have been reluctant to put their forces in the position of trying to disarm Hamas on Israel’s behalf. Violence has reduced under a ceasefire announced in October, but there is still near-dailyIsraeli bombardment, and more than 500 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire was declared.Israel accepts health authorities’ Gaza death toll is broadly accurate, saying 70,000 have diedRead moreGen Maruli’s remarks suggested that he envisaged Indonesian troops would play a supporting role. “We’ve started training people who could potentially become peacemakers. So, we’re preparing engineering and health units like that,” the army chief said.According toa version of the Trump planput forward at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, an interim administration run by Palestinian technocrats would take on daily governance of Gaza, including the disarming of Hamas, with the help of a Palestinian police force being trained in Jordan and Egypt.1:17Jared Kushner outlines 'board of peace' plans for redevelopment of Gaza – videoThe deployment of a significant number of foreign soldiers, particularly those from an Islamic country, is likely to be fiercely opposed by the powerful far-right wing of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, who will see it as a step towards the realisation of a Palestinian state, which has alreadybeen recognisedby more than 80% of UN member states.Israeli extremists, inside and outside the government, want to force the Palestinian population out of Gaza and build Israeli settlements there.Netanyahu was due to fly to Washington on Tuesday for talks with Trump on Iran, Gaza and other regional issues, as rival actors seek to shape the US president’s views on how his ambitious but vague peace plan will be implemented.Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, has agreed to join the “board of peace”, a Trump-run collection of world leaders who are supposed to oversee the peace process in Gaza, and potentially other conflict zones around the world. The board’s first full meeting has been scheduled for Thursday next week, and Prabowo has reportedly been invited.When the peace plan wasfirst unveiled last September, Prabowo made an initial offer of 20,000 troops for the ISF. The president and former army general has been keen to raise Indonesia’s profile on the world stage. However, there is anxiety among some Indonesian observers that the country could become embroiled in a situation it cannot control.“Ultimately, Indonesia’s decision to join Trump’s [board of peace] is a diplomatic gamble that is only worthwhile if it produces real influence rather than mere symbolism,” a commentary in the Jakarta Globe said. It argued that if Indonesia could help shape the board of peace without being used for the interests of others, the board could have humanitarian benefits. But it added: “If not, Indonesia risks becoming part of a diplomatic problem larger than the conflict it seeks to end.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIndonesiaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Half were older than the 20-year recommended safe service life, the analysts said, and because they operate in the shadows, they are believed to be poorly maintained and could fail to meet international safety standards.More than50 incidentsinvolving shadow tankers from across the world have been reported in recent years, from collisions to oil spills.Nine oil slicks, from Thailand to Italy to Mexico, were attributed to Russian dark fleet vessels between 2021 to 2024. But the Iranian shadow fleet has been little scrutinised.Thenew analysisplaced seven of the 29 vessels in an “extreme risk” category, being over 25 years old, while three were more than 30 years old. Five vessels were both ageing and in the “very large crude carrier” class, able to hold about 300,000 tonnes of oil.Shadow fleet tankers were usually uninsured, the analysts said, meaning that the cost of cleaning up a spill would fall on the country where the disaster occurred. That cost could be between $860m and $1.6bn, according to arecent estimate.The total dark fleet of oil tankers is estimated to number many hundreds of vessels, with some assessments suggesting they make up 17% of the global tanker fleet. Russia has the largest shadow fleet and two ageing Russian tankers caused amajor spill in the Black Seain December 2024 after one sank and the other ran aground.0:57Two Russian tankers sink in Black Sea spilling 4,300 tonnes of oil – videoSaleem Khan, the head of data and analytics at Pole Star Global, said Iran’s shadow fleet had some of the oldest oil tankers seen in any of the fleets, with some far beyond the safe lifecycle for such vessels.“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” he said, adding that it was a “matter of time” before one of these ran aground and broke up, or an explosion led to a major oil spill. “They’re carrying oil, oftentimes pressurised, and there’s a ton of machinery on board that has to operate perfectly for there not to be an issue, such as a fire or explosion,” Khan said.“The big thing is just the scale of how big a disaster this could be – this could be multiples of the Exxon Valdez. But it’s a very, very lucrative trade for all these participants. So they have a vested interest in keeping it going.”Exxon Valdez oil spill – in picturesRead moreMark Spalding, the president of the Ocean Foundation, said: “Iran’s shadow fleet represents a significant and growing environmental threat. The question is not whether a major incident will occur, but when and which coastal communities and marine ecosystems will pay the price for a shipping system designed to evade accountability.“We are deeply concerned that the environmental dimension of shadow fleet operations has received insufficient attention.”The Iranian government did not respond to a request for comment.Shadow fleet vessels use deceptive practices such as false flags, false ownership and blocked or spoofedAISsatellite tracking in order to ship goods that are subject to sanctions. The trade in oil under sanctions is estimated to be worth many billions of dollars a year. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in October thatRussia’s shadow fleet trade was worth €30bn a yearand was funding 30-40% of the war in Ukraine.The US has been most active against shadow fleet tankers, seizing vessels linked toRussiaandVenezuelain recent months. France, Germany, Estonia and others have physically intercepted ships from the dark fleet. The UK has not, despite the Channel being a bottleneck for shipping, which is forced to pass through national territorial waters.However, theUK threatened to seizea Russian-linked shadow fleet tanker last week. The US chased the Russian-linked Marinera tanker from the Caribbean to the north Atlantic in January,seizing itbetween Scotland and Iceland with British help.View image in fullscreenThe Marinera oil tanker travelling off British waters in January.Photograph: @US_EUCOM/X/PAThe Pole Star Global analysis of Iran’s shadow fleet tankers concluded: “The combination of advanced vessel age, lack of western insurance, and reduced maintenance standards under sanctions creates an elevated risk of catastrophic environmental damage.”A single incident involving one of the larger tankers would, the report said, lead to toxic oil slicks covering thousands of square miles, mass mortality of marine life, contamination of 500-1,000 miles or more of coastline, and a severe impact on human health and livelihoods.The report recommended enhanced satellite monitoring systems to track the vessels, and stronger port inspections, including refusing entry to vessels that cannot demonstrate their safety. It also backed sanctions against the beneficial owners of high-risk vessels. But Khan said: “There’s definitely no coordinated international effort.”TheInternational Maritime Organization(IMO) is responsible for setting the regulatory framework that is enforced by member states. A spokesperson said: “Ships that do not comply with IMO safety and environmental regulations or that operate without transparency put seafarers, the marine environment and global trade at risk.”The IMO’s legal committee is reviewing existing international maritime rules and agreements to see how they can be used more effectively to stop illegal activities and is developing clear guidance on how ships should be registered, focusing on better background checks, greater transparency and stronger cooperation between countries to prevent fake registries and false flags.A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to disrupting and deterring shadow fleet vessels. We continue to take robust action including requesting proof of insurance and sanctioning suspected shadow fleet vessels transiting the English Channel. Since October 2024, the UK has challenged around 600 suspected shadow fleet vessels using this system.”Explore more on these topicsOil spillsOil (Environment)Shipping industryIranOceansMiddle East and north AfricaOil (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

The boy has been in the West Bank since 2022 where he was receiving medical care unavailable in the Gaza Strip. His doctors have determined that he urgently requires antibody immunotherapy.The decision reflects Israel’s sweeping ban on the entry of people living inGazaafter the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, including cancer patients who, before the war, had routinely been granted access to life-saving treatment in Jerusalem.‘I wish I had the power to ease his suffering’: Gaza’s cancer patients trapped by war and blockadeRead more“I have lost my last hope,” the child’s mothertold Haaretz, describing the ruling as a death sentence for her son. She said the boy’s father died of cancer three years ago.In his judgment, the Israeli judge Ram Winograd characterised the petition as an indirect challenge to the security establishment’s post-7 October restrictions, which have prevented Gaza residents from entering Israel for medical treatment. While acknowledging that thousands of children in Gaza are in urgent need of care, the judge argued there was no meaningful distinction between the boy’s case and those of other patients barred by the policy.“The petitioners failed to demonstrate a real and relevant difference,” Winograd wrote, noting that the child’s presence in Ramallah did not, in his view, justify an exemption from the blanket ban.Gisha, an Israeli human rights organisation, has been engaged in legal proceedings regarding the boy’s case since November 2025, arguing that the child’s situation exposed the cruelty of a rigid bureaucratic system that prioritises registry data over medical urgency.“This case once again illustrates the devastating consequences of a sweeping policy that denies Palestinians access to life-saving medical care solely on the basis of their registered address in Gaza, even when they are not residing there and no security allegations are raised against them,” Gisha said in statement. “The significance of this ruling is that the court is providing backing for an unlawful policy that effectively condemns children to death, even when life-saving treatment is in reach.”About 11,000 Palestinian cancer patients are still trapped in Gazadespite the reopening of the Rafah crossing last week. Doctors say cancer-related deaths have tripled in the territory since the war began, as Israel continues to hinder patients from leaving and restricts the entry of chemotherapy drugs. While some patients have left, they are far outnumbered by those deemed in medical need who have not.According to health officials in Gaza,there are about 4,000 peoplewith official referrals for treatment to third countries who are unable to cross the border. The World Health Organization says 900 people, including children and cancer patients,have already died while waiting for evacuation.Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestineGazaCancerChildren's healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Uncontrolled, it will eventually lead to premature death.“For many families, diabetes is not just a medical condition, but a long-term social and economic burden,” said Dr Ashish Tamang, a resident doctor based in Kathmandu.A pilot study in the Nepalese capital involving 70 hospital patients with long-established diabetes helped43% into remissionby putting them on a calorie-controlled traditional diet. An ongoing trial involving 120 people in villages and communities on the outskirts of cities has shown similar promise.“It is very early days but around half are free from diabetes at four months, with an average weight loss of only 4-5kg,” said Prof Mike Lean, a diabetes and human nutrition expert from the University of Glasgow.The approach is being rolled out more widely, as part ofa four-year studyled by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Dhulikhel hospital, Nepal. They hope to show the diet can also prevent people at high risk of type 2 diabetes from developing the condition.Type 2 diabetes is characterised by high blood sugar levels, caused by the body not making enough of the hormone insulin, or the insulin it makes not working properly. It is often triggered by excess weight.Lean was part of a UK team who showed in 2017 that putting patients on weight loss diets of soups and shakes couldreverse their diabetes. The programme is nowpart of standard NHS diabetes care.After the results were published, he was approached by doctors working in Nepal to see whether a similar approach could work in the south Asian country. It could, he believes, be even more effective there than it is in the UK.Peoplefrom Asian backgrounds, are genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes. This means “they only have to put on a smaller amount of weight before they start getting diabetes”, Lean said. But it also means that they “don’t have to lose a lot to get rid of it”.While UK patients might need to lose between 10 and 15kg to reverse their diabetes, “in Nepal it’s around half that,” Lean said. “It makes the task a fair bit easier.”The team therefore set out to develop a plan that used cheap, local ingredients.Participants were asked to follow a weight loss plan of 850 calories a day for eight weeks – typically a breakfast of yoghurt and fruit, and main meals of lentils and rice, known asdal bhat. They then switched to a higher-calorie version of the same diet to maintain their lower weight.During screening camps, people found to have diabetes, or to be at high risk of it were given a cup, measuring glass and weighing equipment along with a diet plan to ensure they were sticking to specific portion sizes. They were also invited to attend regular support group sessions.The idea was to deliver an intervention in communities, without the need for doctors or hospitals, with the help of thefemale volunteerswho make up the backbone of the country’s health system.Trial design documents describe the plan as one that “stresses a disciplined (traditional) eating pattern, avoiding snacking and high-fat/sugar processed western-type foods”.A 2025 studyfound 87% of packaged foods sold in Kathmandu shops exceeded World Health Organization recommended thresholds for contents such as sugar, fat and salt.Lean said the approach was “not rocket science”. But it was “way more effective than any drug or medicine, and traditional medicines that don’t do anything”.He also encouraged participants to turn back to brown rice rather than double-milled white rice, which has fewer nutrients – including lower levels of Vitamin B1, which plays a role in how the body deals with carbohydrates.The expanded study originally won UK government funding but fell victim to cuts.The Howard Foundationhas stepped in with £1.78m to allow it to continue. The project will also create educational materials on the drivers of diabetes.‘One bite and he was hooked’: from Kenya to Nepal, how parents are battling ultra-processed foodsRead moreLean puts the blame for soaring type 2 diabetes rates in Nepal squarely on the importation of western junk foods. He has spoken to Nepalis who “remember the first bicycle arriving in their village”. That bicycle was carrying sweets and soft drinks, he says. And as transport connections improved, junk food started arriving by motorcycle and then by car and van “and now the stuff is everywhere”.Lower activity levels, where advances in technology make work less physically intense, are also a driver of rising rates, the study team said.At conferences, Lean says he has been approached by officials from neighbouring countriesalso struggling with rising diabetes rates. “They all said: ‘if this works in Nepal, it will work for us.’”Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthDiabetesUltra-processed foodsNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The schools watchdog Ofsted will inspect how schools implement the policy.This week the NASUWT teaching union urged the government to introduce a statutory requirement – rather than just guidance – for schools to lock away pupils’ mobile phones for the whole school day.The study provides the first analysis of the economic impact of smartphone policies in schools and is based on data drawn from a nationally representative sample of 20 schools inEngland, 13 of which have “restrictive” policies and seven “permissive” policies.According to the research, restrictive policies require phones to be turned off and hidden in a school bag or handed in to reception throughout the school day, while permissive policies allow use during breaks and lunchtime.The self-reported data showed that on average, schools with restrictive policies spend 102 hours – or the full-time equivalent of 3.1 staff a week overall – on implementing policies.Schools with permissive policies spend slightly more time on average – 108 hours or the full-time equivalent of 3.3 staff a week – potentially costing £94 per pupil per school year more than more restrictive policies.Schools in England should be phone-free all day, education secretary saysRead moreProf Victoria Goodyear, of the University of Birmingham, who is chief investigator of the Smart Schools Study, said: “School phone policies, whether permissive or restrictive, are a huge drain on a school to enforce.“The high proportions of teacher time spent managing phone use or phone-related behaviours during the school day is potentially being diverted away from other types of wellbeing-promoting activities, such as pastoral support or extracurricular activities.“We therefore need new ways of approaching adolescent smartphone use in schools.”Prof Miranda Pallan, one of the report’s authors, said: “It is unknown how a statutory ban may impact on the staff burden of dealing with phones.“There will be different ways of implementing a statutory ban such as handing in phones, pouches, or complete site bans, which will each have a different impact on staff time and school resources.“Even with a ban, there will be breaches that will need to be dealt with, which will still place a burden on staff time.”Data from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology shows 99.9% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools have mobile phone policies. However, 58% of secondary school pupils reported phones being used without permission in some lessons, rising to 65% among key stage four pupils.The NASUWT general secretary, Matt Wrack, said: “From interrupted learning and reduced concentration to confrontations when staff ask pupils to hand over devices, the situation has reached a critical point. Schools cannot be expected to manage this alone while the government offers no meaningful support.”Sarah Hannafin, the head of policy at the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We recognise that effective enforcement activity can be time-consuming, but as parents’ and pupils’ expectations about being able to access their phone in school hours change, and bans become the norm, we hope the need for such activity will be reduced.”Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We would like to see funding support provided to schools for the safe and secure storage of mobile phones, such as storage lockers or locked pouches.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Mobile phones have no place in classrooms. Without the distraction, children learn better and teachers can teach.“Our guidance helps schools implement phone-free policies effectively, with practical case studies showing how schools across the country are making this work without it becoming a burden on staff time.”Explore more on these topicsSecondary schoolsSchoolsTeachingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

When they arrived at the scene, officers found a 12-year-old boy who had also been stabbed.Police said a 13-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.DCS Luke Williams, who leads policing in north-west London, said both injured boys were in a serious condition and police were awaiting a further update.He said: “The thoughts of everyone at the Met are with them and their loved ones, and we want to thank the doctors and nurses who are providing the boys with urgent care.”Williams said the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism officers, who were working alongside local police.He said: “After urgent inquiries, our officers arrested him [the boy] and also recovered a weapon, which we believe to have been used in the stabbing.“The suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody for questioning by our officers.”He said police were not currently looking at any other suspects in relation to the incident.“This has not currently been declared a terrorist incident and the investigation team will now be working at pace to gather any evidence and to establish the full circumstances of what has happened as quickly as possible.”A police van was seen blocking the entrance to Kingsbury high school’s lower school after the incident.Pupils, some of whom were in tears, continued to be spoken to by police officers in one of the school’s halls on Tuesday evening, more than three hours after the school day finished.A father of a year 8 pupil who had been kept by police as a potential witness said children had been “traumatised by what happened in front of them”.Alex Thomas, the headteacher of the school, described the incident as “a deeply traumatic event for the whole school community” in a letter sent to parents and carers in which he confirmed two students had been stabbed.He said: “Our thoughts and best wishes are with our students and their families at this incredibly difficult time.“We would also like to thank the emergency services for their swift response and our staff for the calm and dedicated way they supported students throughout the day.“Students in the lower school were kept in the playground at the request of the police while they began their investigations, they were incredibly patient and respectful of others during this time.”He said the lower school would be closed on Wednesday and advised students to stay at home. The upper school will be open for students in years 10-13.“The situation is under control, but a live investigation is taking place. We are working closely with the authorities and I will provide further updates as soon as I am able to share confirmed information. Please keep the students and their families in your thoughts.”The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said her thoughts and prayers were with the two children who were stabbed.She wrote on X: “The police have arrested the suspect, and I would like to thank them for their rapid work in doing so. We must now give them the space to pursue their investigation.”The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said she was “heartbroken” about the stabbings and said her team were in contact with the school and Brent council to offer support.She wrote on X: “My heart goes out to the families affected and the young people, teachers and school community at this awful time.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged anyone with information about the stabbings to contact the police, saying “there is no honour in staying silent”.He said in a statement: “My thoughts are with the family, friends and wider community in Brent following the appalling stabbings today. This awful violence has absolutely no place in our city.“I am in close contact with the Met as they investigate this terrible incident. The investigation is in its early stages and it’s right the police are investigating every possible element.”Bob Blackman, the MP for Harrow East, said he was “deeply shocked and saddened” by the stabbing. In a post on X, Blackman said: “Two boys have been stabbed, and my thoughts are with them, their families and the whole school community.“I want to thank the emergency services for their rapid and professional response. I know this will shock our local community, and I am in close contact with the police and will continue to seek updates as they work to keep everyone safe.”Muhammed Butt, the leader of Brent council, described the incident as “deeply shocking and distressing” and thanked emergency services and school staff for their “swift response”.He added: “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured, their families and the whole school community.”A London ambulance service spokesperson said: “We sent resources to the scene including ambulance crews, incident response officers an advanced paramedic, a paramedic from our tactical response unit and a clinical team manager. We also dispatched a trauma team in a car from London’s air ambulance.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials in January decided to stop fully recommending one-third of routine childhood vaccines, including flu vaccines.“This is likely to discourage industry from investing in future influenza vaccines, and makes working with the US FDA uncertain and problematic,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco.“They are refusing to review a new vaccine with a more flexible technology, while creating a real risk we will not have traditional vaccines for next year.”Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines have shown the potential to be more effective at protecting against some illnesses, and they may also be updated more quickly than traditional egg-based flu vaccines – an important consideration since flu evolves quickly and may have pandemic potential.FDA officials will not review the evidence from Moderna’s clinical trials on the new mRNA flu shot because the trials compared Moderna’s shot to existing standard flu shots, rather than shots for high-risk individuals, according to alettersigned by Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).The FDA does not consider the Moderna trial to be “adequate and well-controlled” because comparing the new shot to standard flu shots “does not reflect the best-available standard of care”, Prasad wrote.Yet Moderna did compare their vaccine against an existing high-dose flu shot in adults aged 65 and older; in adults under 65, they compared the new shot with standard flu vaccines.“For those under 65, the high dose is not standard of care,” Reiss said. “So their argument is also false.”The new vaccine elicited better antibody responses than the existing vaccines did, and no safety concerns were seen, the researchersfound.Another Moderna trial, the results of which have not yet been published, compared the new vaccine against standard flu shots in adults aged 50 and older.The FDA issued a refusal-to-file letter, which means it will not consider the licensing application until Moderna provides more information. The letter did not specify which information it would require. It’s unusual for a refusal-to-file letter to be signed by the CBER director, as these are usually decisions made by the review team.There have been no public changes to rules and guidance on conducting clinical trials on vaccines. But in aleakedinternal email in November, Prasad said the FDA would “revise the annual flu vaccine framework”, including the tests that show how well the vaccines work.The US Department ofHealthand Human Services (HHS) did not respond to questions about whether the FDA rules have changed and if the move represents a change in policy toward approving flu vaccines for everyone, not just those at risk.The decision “did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns” with the shot, Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive, said in a statement. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.”Moderna has asked the FDA for a meeting to discuss why the application was refused.“Combined with other steps, it shows FDA’s intent to make licensing vaccines for respiratory disease harder, without serious notice or consideration, and in ways that appear arbitrary,” Reiss said.The licensing application is already under review in the European Union, Canada and Australia.In January, the HHS unilaterally changed its recommendation for children’s flu shots, recommending it only under “shared clinical decision-making” – a decision made without consulting outside vaccine advisers, medical providers or the public.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsVaccines and immunisationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Heath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and other charges in the 1989 killing of Michael Sheridan.It was the state’s first execution of 2026 and followed a record 19 executions in Florida last year. The state’s Republican governor,Ron DeSantis, oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in the US in 1976. The previous Florida record, set in 2014, was eight executions.Texas Black man exonerated 70 years after execution in case marked by racial biasRead moreAccording to court records, Heath and his brother Kenneth Heath met Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.At some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.As Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.The brothers dumped Sheridan’s body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car, according to the court record. It said the brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan’s credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.Ronald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his home in Douglas, Georgia, after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing bought with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan’s watch, according to court records.Kenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan’s murder, but was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.The Florida supreme court denied appeals filed by Ronald Heath last week. His attorneys had argued that Florida corrections officials had mismanaged the state’s own death penalty protocols, that the state’s secretive clemency process blocked due process, that Heath’s incarceration as a juvenile stunted his brain development and that jurors did not recommend the death penalty unanimously.On Tuesday morning, the US supreme court denied Heath’s appeal.A total of 47 people were executed in the US in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second, with five executions each that year.Two more Florida executions have already been scheduled for later this month and next month. Melvin Trotter, 65, is scheduled to die on 24 February, and Billy Leon Kearse, 53, is set to be executed exactly a week later, on 3 March.All Florida executions are carried out via lethal injection using a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state’s department of corrections.Explore more on these topicsFloridaCapital punishmentRon DeSantisGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Born in 2023 in Plumas county in the Beyem Seyo pack, she “traversed nearly the entire range of the Sierra Nevada mountains”, probably in search of a mate, said Hunnicutt.Wildlifeofficials have been able to track her location because BEY03F was fitted with a GPS collar in May 2025 while passing through Tulare county. To date, California fish and wildlife has not received any reports or sightings from the Los Angeles county public.On Tuesday, she was traveling further north, “likely deterred by the Interstate 5”, said Hunnicutt. Vehicle strikes area leading cause of deathfor wolves.“It’s possible she may continue to travel hundreds of miles in search of a mate or she may come across a male tomorrow.”The continental United States was historically home to thousands of gray wolves, but hunters and trappers extirpated the species, with the last wild wolf in California shot in 1924. In 1973, the population was protected by the Endangered Species Act and later reintroduced to Yellowstone national park in the 1990s. Those wolves eventually dispersed across the lower 48 states, with the first wolf crossing into California in 2011. By 2024, the California department of fish and wildlife estimated that there were at least70 gray wolvesin the state, up from 44 the year before.“Just over 30 years ago, gray wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone national park and central Idaho. The wolves in California are [descendants] of these animals and made their way to California because of wolves doing what BEY03F is doing now: being an explorer,” said Hunnicutt. “Each year, we see continued successful reproduction and expansion of packs into new areas. This is driven by this dispersal movement.”Although conservationists heralded BEY03F’s arrival in LA county as a win for wildlife, advocates are still trying to shore up protections for gray wolves nationwide.On 10 February, the Center for Biological Diversity filed alawsuitchallenging the Trump administration’s refusal to develop a national gray wolf recovery plan. In 2024, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Serviceannouncedthat it would develop a national recovery plan for the species, but in 2025 the service published afindingsaying it would no longer prepare an updated recovery plan, calling the gray wolf’s listing under the Endangered Species Act “no longer appropriate”.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesEndangered speciesWildlifeCaliforniaWest CoastAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Why are you so small? “Stuff nobody asks,” she said.The man then started talking loudly into his phone. “I’m here doing a dip in a restaurant. There’s not a lot of people here, so I don’t know if it’s worth coming,” Ramirez recalled him saying. The encounter left her unnerved.Ramirez has owned and run Crasqui, a Venezuelan restaurant, in Saint Paul,Minnesota, since 2023. Though she never got confirmation – the man left once it became clear restaurant staff were concerned about his presence – she concluded he was likely a federal immigration officer in plainclothes.“It’s terrifying. All my employees are legal. I’m 100% legal,” said Ramirez, a political refugee from Venezuela who moved to the US in 2016. “But that doesn’t mean anything any more.”TheTrump administrationin December launched “Operation Metro Surge”, sending more than 2,700 federal agents to Minnesota, with a concentration on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, as part of its crackdown on immigrants.The operation seeks to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants from the region, officials said. Both cities have become home to large immigrant communities over the last few decades, with considerable Somalian, Hispanic, Hmong, Laotian and Ethiopian enclaves across different neighborhoods.Minneapolis residents say these communities are nowunder attack, pointing to sporadic and often brutal arrests by federal immigration officers, including those from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The killings ofRenee Nicole GoodandAlex Pretti, who were protesting immigration enforcement, are just examples of how violent agents can be. Even those who are in the country legally don’t feel safe.In Minneapolis and Saint Paul, small businesses have been on the frontlines. Immigration officers have proven themselves unafraid of arresting people evenon the job, including US citizens who say they wereracially profiled.The Guardian spoke to several small business owners in the Twin Cities, some who are immigrants themselves, about how the surge has affected the local economy that sustains its immigrant communities.View image in fullscreenCustoms and Border Protection agents detain a man who did not provide documents proving he’s a US citizen while patrolling a neighborhood in Minneapolis.Photograph: Octavio Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesBustling neighborhoods have turned into ghost towns. Some small businesses have temporarily closed with no signs of reopening. Businesses that stay open keep their doors locked, to prevent agents from entering without a warrant. Many restaurants are doing takeout only.For some, it’s reminiscent of when the city was under lockdown due to Covid-19 restrictions. Ramirez said this is worse.“In Covid, the federal government was helping with relief,” she said. Revenue at Crasqui is down 65%. “I have so many friends, they have closed their businesses. All of them,” she said. “I don’t even know how you can recover from that.”Both customers and employees areafraidto leave their homes. They fear encountering federal agents, regardless of their immigration status.Oscar Murcia, owner of El Guanaco Bakery y Cafe, which has three locations across the Twin Cities, said sales have halved since the surge. He temporarily closed his cafe on Minneapolis’s Lake Street, in a neighborhood full of Hispanic restaurants and businesses.“We have seen how ICE has focused a lot on doing operations in that area. Most of the stores surrounding Lake Street have closed,” Murcia wrote in an email to the Guardian. “Right now, most of our customers are not leaving their houses because they are afraid, and that has impacted us severely.”In a survey of more than 90 Latino-owned businesses in the Twin Cities area conducted by the Latino Economic Development Center, nearly a third said they were temporarily closed due to staff shortages or a drop in foot traffic.For small business owners, even small drops in revenue can have cascading effects, like an inability to pay rent or vendors. Alma Flores, CEO of the Latino Economic Development Center, said there are deep concerns that many small businesses, especially those with immigrant owners, will not survive the coming months. Many face both existential business challenges and constant fear of encountering agents at work.“Their presence is fear-inducing,” said Flores. “People don’t want to be near them because, if you have darker skin, you’re a target.”Gustavo Romero opened his Mexican restaurant, Oro by Nixta, with his wife, Kate, to be a hub for Minneapolis’s Mexican community. A recent James Beard nomination has garnered enough attention to sustain business, but Romero said the last few weeks have taken a heavy toll.“We work in an industry where a lot of labor is dependent on immigrants,” Romero said. “We are also a Mexican restaurant, and so it impacts the whole community, from the people that work with us to our clientele. We always look at our place like a cultural center. A lot of people come here because they can get a little feel of home.”The possibility of racial profiling is a constant in Romero’s mind. It looms over many immigrant business owners.“I’m Mexican and I have all my paperwork in order, but I don’t feel comfortable being out on the streets,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who you are. If you look like what they’re profiling, you’re going to get stopped and you’re going to get asked questions.”View image in fullscreenKate Romero and Gustavo Romero in the kitchen of Oro by Nixta in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Bridget Bennett/The GuardianOne local grocery store owner, who wished to remain anonymous due to safety concerns, said he closed his store in East Saint Paul and now only does home deliveries after loyal customers stopped coming in. Though he is a naturalized citizen, “I feel the fear of going out and being arrested every day I go to work, and I think many people experience the same”, he wrote in an email to the Guardian.The presence of immigration enforcement is felt across the city. Victoria Ford, owner of Comma bookstore, said she’s seen federal agents in the neighborhood, Linden Hills, which is among city’s the most affluent.“We have, within a block, half a dozen restaurants and other shops. ICE has attempted to enter multiple of those shops and restaurants,” Ford said. “And we’re in a neighborhood that is seeing much less than neighborhoods that are home to more immigrant-owned businesses.”Non-profits such as theMinnesota FoundationandLatino Economic Development Centerhave set upemergency relief fundsfor small businesses, but local business owners and their advocates say sustaining the Twin Cities’ small businesses will require help from the city and state.“The onus should not be on the philanthropic community alone,” said Flores, of the Latino Economic Development Center. “And since we can’t rely on the federal government to assist, cities need to step up. They will lose their tax base. They will lose the vibrancy of their corridors and main streets.”Entrepreneurship has been a keystone for immigrants coming to the US, she noted. For those who don’t speak English too well, opening a Main Street business – such as a restaurant, grocery store, gas station or nail salon – may be the best, and sometimes only, way to make a living.View image in fullscreenPosters dedicated to Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Bridget Bennett/The GuardianSmall business owners say they don’t take this diversity for granted and they’re deeply worried about the damage “Operation Metro Surge” will ultimately have on the small businesses that have come to define the Twin Cities.“It’s hard to think ‘Oh, the economy is important during this time,’ but at the same time, these are people’s livelihoods,” said Dylan Alverson, owner of the Post Modern Times cafe, a restaurant in south Minneapolis that he recentlyrenamedto reflect the state of the city. “And we can’t have cities without immigrant restaurants.”When Tammy Wong first opened her restaurant, Rainbow Chinese, on Nicollet Avenue in 1987, the Minneapolis neighborhood had few cuisine options. She and two of her siblings opened up businesses, two restaurants and a grocery store, on the same street shortly after moving to the US from Vietnam.“We wanted nothing else than to make a living serving food to people. We were starting in this spot where the city didn’t have a lot of ethnic food,” Wong said. Soon, she said, “I just became more passionate about introducing food that people might not be familiar with.“Over the years, it’s been beautiful to see it evolve, to be able to witness this part of the neighborhood get revitalized,” she said.But in recent weeks, Wong has been losing sleep. Though business has been OK, she’s operating with a smaller staff. Her kids remind her to carry her ID when she’s out. “We’re living with fear,,” she said. “You kind of don’t know what is going to happen next.”In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security denied that the surge in immigration enforcement is causing economic damage. “Let’s be clear, if there was any correlation between rampant illegal immigration and a good economy, [Joe] Biden would have had a booming economy,” a spokesperson claimed. “Removing these criminals from the streets makes communities safer for business owners and customers.”Despite the fear and exhaustion, people in the Twin Cities say the surge in law enforcement has brought their communities together more than ever. Neighborhood groups station volunteers on street corners, and warn others when immigration officers are spotted, often withwhistles. Mutual aid groups deliver food to those afraid to go out and help vulnerable parents drive their kids to school. Tens of thousands showed up to two massiveprotestsagainst immigration enforcement in January.View image in fullscreenA nearly empty Hmong Village, an indoor marketplace in Saint Paul, Minnesota.Photograph: Bridget Bennett/The GuardianWong’s restaurant is just a block away from where Pretti was killed byfederal agentslast month. Wong’s sister, who owns a restaurant across the street from her own, was setting up her store, My Huong, for lunch when Pretti was killed.“She was about to open her store and ended up providing shelter for people who were teargassed,” Wong said. “I thought that was what the neighborhood does: treat everyone like an extended family when they need help.”Alverson, of Post Modern Times, which is a few blocks north from where Good was killed in early January, recently made his restaurant completely free for patrons and is operating off of donations.“We make our own buttermilk. We make all of our own bread. We’re all still just working around the clock to produce food, and we’re giving it all away,” Alverson said. “It’s giving staff and customers hope.”Ramirez compared the current atmosphere of fear in the Twin Cities to what it was like living under Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez. “For me, it’s kind of like a playbook. I’ve seen this before, I’ve gone through this before,” she said. Though it’s unclear when relief for the Twin Cities will come, “we just need to keep fighting and just praying for the best”.“They are not going to break us,” she said. “They are going to keep trying, but I really believe in our community.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaSmall businessUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Minnesota ICE shootingsMinneapolisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than $100m were bets on Bad Bunny’s opening song and $45m on which artists would perform with him on stage. In comparison, the platformsaw $27min total trading volume at last year’s Super Bowl.Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to trade on the outcomes of virtually anything, from sports and elections to what color someone will wear during a performance. Unlike casinos or traditional sportsbooks, users effectively bet (or “trade”) against others on the platform, instead of an established “house”, and the platforms earn revenue by charging trading fees.‘We all on Kalshi now’: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the quiet collapse of sporting trustRead moreKalshi and competitorPolymarketargue that this model distinguishes them from traditional casinos or sportsbooks. Since the US supreme courtoverturnedthe federal ban on sports betting in 2018, state gambling agencies regulate traditional gambling outfits, but prediction markets are currently overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The reason people are flocking to prediction markets, especially Kalshi, is that our incentive as a company [is] we win when the customers win, we don’t win when the customers lose, and that’s a huge difference in the model,” Mansour said on Tuesday.On Sunday, Kalshitoldusers that although some deposits were “delayed because of the amount of traffic and deposits we’re getting”, their money “is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land”.Prediction markets have risen in popularity in recent months and are now used beyond sports, edging into other events such as the Grammys and Oscars. Last week, Kalshiannouncedthat the NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was joining the company as a shareholder.But in recent months, critics have raised concerns about potentialmarket manipulation and insider tradingon these prediction market sites. Ahead of the Super Bowl, Kalshi said it expanded itssurveillance and enforcement effortsto detect and remove accounts engaging in insider trading or market manipulation.In aposton X days before the Super Bowl, Mansour said the company over the past year “ran over 200 investigations and froze relevant accounts” and referred several active cases to law enforcement.Explore more on these topicsBusinessSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSport bettingUS sportsBad BunnynewsShareReuse this content"

You know, my heart really goes out to victims of this scandal and these crimes,” he said.However, the Barclays boss – speaking as the bank reported annual profits – stopped short of commenting directly on allegations against his predecessor, Staley.The Guardian reported last week that, in 2019, US prosecutorsreviewed allegations of rape and bodily harm against Staley, including that he forced a woman to touch his genitals during a massage before raping her, and left “bloody marks” on the arms of a woman he called “Tinkerbell”.There is no evidence that prosecutors decided to pursue the allegations. Staley, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, has not responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment made over several months, either directly or via his lawyers. He has never been charged with a crime related to the allegations.During a UK court hearing in 2025, Staley admitted to havingsex with a member of Epstein’s staffin New York, but agreed with a lawyer during cross-examination that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”.When Venkatakrishnan was asked whether the allegations outlined in the Epstein files had prompted any further internal reviews at Barclays, the bank’s head of media said: “We have nothing further to add on that point.”It comes as the bank and its chair, Nigel Higgins, continue to battlea class action lawsuit in the USover claims they defrauded and misled investors over Staley’s relationship with Epstein.The US class action suit, led by pension funds in New York and Missouri, alleges that Barclays, Higgins and Staley repeatedly misrepresented Staley’s history with Epstein to media and investors, starting in July 2019, weeks after Epstein was arrested on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.They claim they were ultimately defrauded, having learned about the true nature of Staley and Epstein’s relationship only after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publicly released findings of its investigation and banned Staley from the Cityin October 2023. The news caused the value of their shares and American Depositary Receipts to drop, resulting in “significant economic losses”, they argued.Higgins and Staley have not commented on the case.Staley hadresigned from Barclays two years earlier, in 2021, over preliminary findings from the FCA’s investigation. Staleyfailed to overturn a banon his return to the UK’s financial sector last year and lost out on £18m worth of pay and bonuses from Barclays as a result of the ruling.Venkatakrishnan’s comments echoed those of the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who said last week thathe was “shocked” by revelationsin the Epstein files.That included information thatappears to have been sharedwith Epstein by the former UK business secretary Peter Mandelson regarding highly confidential government deliberations after the 2008 financial crisis. The revelations resulted in Mandelson resigning from the Labour party and House of Lords last week.Bailey said: “I don’t want to sound pious, but this is for all of us: how is it that we live in a society in which this happened, and the cover-up happened as well? I think that is a very fundamental question that we have to ask ourselves.”HSBC and Barclays are facing a $12bn (£8.7bn) lawsuit by a US heiress, Tanya Dick-Stock, over a Jersey trust allegedly linked to the Epstein scandal. The Times, which first reported the lawsuit, said both banks declined to comment.Barclays posted a near-13% increase in profits to £9.1bn in 2025 and said it planned to return more than £15bn to shareholders between 2026 and 2028. Profits for the final three months of last year rose 12%.Explore more on these topicsBarclaysBankingJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Some restaurateurs fear speaking out as immigrants themselvesSupported byAbout this contentAdam ReinerTue 10 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 15.26 ESTShareAmid calls for a national shutdown on 30 January, Anton Kinloch displayed a sign on the sidewalk outside Lone Wolf, his craft cocktail bar and restaurant in Kingston,New York. In large block letters he wrote: “WE LOVE ICE IN DRINKS. WE DON’T LOVE ICE IN REAL LIFE. SOLIDARITY ALWAYS.”Along with his wife and business partner, Lisa Dy, he had made the difficult decision to stay open, electing instead to donate a portion of the night’s proceeds to a local immigrant advocacy group. With frigid temperatures and inclement weather stymying business in the region this winter, he simply could not afford the lost revenue. But he refused to stay silent in the aftermath of the brutal killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti byImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents inMinneapolis.‘These are people’s livelihoods’: Minnesota’s economy in crisis amid ICE surgeRead moreWithin hours, Kinloch discovered that the sign had been vandalized and thrown into the middle of the street. Its wooden frame was splintered and the chalkboard surface shattered; it appeared to have been run over by a car several times. Earlier in the day, he’d received at least a half-dozen derogatory messages after posting support for immigrants on social media. “I spoke to other business owners in the area, and they said that they had received similar threats,” he said. “They also saw a decline in their social media followers after speaking out. People were unfollowing them, blocking them and sending them hate messages.”Since Donald Trump returned to office last year, restaurants and bars across the country have found themselves on the frontlines of aggressive immigration enforcement and intimidation by masked federal agents. According to the American Immigration Council,immigrants comprise 22% of the restaurant industry’s workforce, a figure that exceeds 30% in states with large foreign-born populations such as California, New York and Texas. Withthreats against immigrants rising, many restaurant owners have been vocal in their opposition to ICE in their communities. But the most outspoken businesses said they’ve also become a target for vitriol by ICE supporters: online harassment, boycott threats and even physical confrontations. Some restaurateurs claim they have been besmirched by phony negative reviews on sites like Google and Yelp.View image in fullscreenJamie Kenyon, the executive chef of Bottino and ’ino in New York City, has faced backlash for his pro-immigrant views.Photograph: Ellen McDermottJamie Kenyon, executive chef and partner of Bottino in New York City, said that within minutes of posting a pro-immigrant message on his restaurant’s social media page the day of thenational shutdown, his restaurant received an obscenity-laced phone call from a stranger condemning the post. Kenyon was taken aback by the threatening response to what he considered a benign show of solidarity. “We are all immigrants,” it said,explaining the restaurant group’s decision to stay openand its plans to donate 15% of sales to the National Immigration Justice Center. “One less place to visit,” one commenter responded. “Maybe when some illegal sets you on fire you’ll grasp why.”Later that day, the restaurant received two blistering one-star Google reviews in quick succession. “Their horrendous values and morals do not represent us,” the reviewer wrote. “They are extremely hateful and immoral. Would not go here under any circumstances.” Kenyon suspects that the angry caller may have been responsible for the slanderous reviews and, while he and his partners are working to have them expunged, the reputational harm is irreversible. A2015 report by Moz, a software company specializing in search engine optimization, revealed that over 67% of respondents were influenced by online reviews and that businesses risk losing 22% of customers when one negative review turns up in their search results. “When you get good reviews, they’re so precious, and bad reviews are devastating,” Kenyon said. “But when they’re fake and total nonsense, it’s just infuriating and really damaging to businesses.”At Pizza Matta in Chicago’s Logan Square, a dispute over the immigration issue led co-owner Jason Vincent to refuse service to an ICE supporter who had been leaving the restaurant harassing, politically charged messages on Instagram for months. The conflict escalated when the customer came into dine the same day thatfive-year old Liam Ramos was abductedby federal agents in Minnesota. After a contentious exchange, Vincent demanded he vacate the premises. “I refuse to cook for fascists and their enablers,” he said. While it isn’t official policy in his restaurants, Vincent said he reserves the right to refuse service to anyone who comes in wearing a Maga hat or a pro-ICE T-shirt. “I was raised Jewish, and I was taught from a young age ‘never again’,” he said. “What is happening here is ‘never again’.”View image in fullscreenCheetie Kumar, the chef and co-owner of Ajja in Raleigh, North Carolina, has faced online backlash for speaking out against ICE.Photograph: Baxter MillerRising hostility toward immigrants has some business owners increasingly on edge about the risks of being too vocal. “It’s really important for small businesses to speak up and make our point of view clear,” said Cheetie Kumar, co-owner of Ajja in Raleigh, North Carolina, and a board member and vice-president of the Independent Restaurant Coalition. “But at the same time, I’m an immigrant, there are people in my restaurant who work for me who are immigrants, and I definitely don’t want to put a target on anyone’s back.”The plight of immigrant workers resonates with many foreign-born restaurateurs, especially ones who’ve experienced uncertainty around their own immigration status in the past. “I’m so thankful that I just received my citizenship a year ago because it’s scary,” said Kenyon, who relocated to the US from Manchester, England, when he was 14 years old. “Without that, I’d be up at night. I have a family to feed, too.” He believes that sensible immigration enforcement should focus on removing criminals who pose a threat to the community, not targeting innocent people based on the color of their skin. “The biggest ‘crime’ that immigrants are committing in restaurants every day is working,” he said. “They’re giving back to the community. That’s the best crime in the world.”Most industry leaders agree that deporting the millions of immigrant workers whose labor is the industry’s lifeblood would be catastrophic. “People of color and immigrants have been holding up the entire food system in this country since its existence and historically without any equality,” said Sean Sherman,chef-owner of Owamni, an indigenous restaurant a few miles from where Alex Pretti and Renee Good were killed. “You can’t just pull all of this massive workforce out and expect these systems to continue to work.”Restaurants across the country are already battling rising inflation and skyrocketing costs. They can ill afford reckless immigration enforcement that threatens their workforce and destabilizes their communities. In Minneapolis, where federal agents have been aggressively targeting the hospitality industry, sales at local restaurants are down as much as 50-60%, according to Sherman. “At this rate and this pace, every restaurant in Minneapolis would probably be shut down in two months.” (Tom Homan, the border czar, announced last week the administration’s plans todraw down 700 officersin Minnesota.)Vincent has seen a similar effect in Chicago, where ICE had been conducting regular enforcement operations late last year. In October, whenagents deployed teargasacross the street from a school on the same block as his restaurant Giant, he said it was the slowest night the establishment has ever had in its 10-year history.Sherman recently traveled to Washington DC todeliver a petitionwith more than 3,000 signatures to Minnesota’s junior senator, Tina Smith, urging Congress to rein in ICE. Days before his visit, an Owamni employee wasapprehended outside of the restaurantby immigration agents and disappeared to a detention center in Texas, despite being properly documented (the employee has since been released).“Our priority is not fighting trolls online,” said Sherman. “We’re trying to figure out how we can make some noise to alert people that this is not the America we want to be living in.”Explore more on these topicsUS small businessOur unequal earthUS immigrationRestaurantsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)FoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The plan had been to send a total of 620,000 won ($423) in prizes to 695 qualifying customers, but the employee instead sent 620,000 bitcoins ($42bn). Of those eligible, 249 opened their prize boxes and received their reward, equivalent to roughly 14 times more bitcoin than the exchange owns.Bitcoin loses half its value in three months amid crypto crunchRead moreLee Chan-jin, governor of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS),called it“catastrophic” for those who sold the bitcoin they received. Bitcoin prices have risen since Friday, meaning any customers required to return cryptocurrency could face losses. Leeadded thatthe incident exposed “structural problems” in how exchanges operate internal ledger systems.Separately, legal expertsare dividedon whether recipients who sold what they received could face criminal prosecution, given a 2021 supreme court ruling that cryptocurrency does not constitute “property” under Korean criminal law.Bithumb said it corrected 99.7% of the erroneous credits by reversing internal ledger entries andissued an apology. However,86 customers soldabout 1,788 bitcoins in the 35 minutes before the exchange froze the affected accounts, financial authorities said, triggering a brief price drop on its platform. Some had been withdrawn to personal bank accounts, and some was used to buy other cryptocurrencies, according to local media.The exchangeis now holdingwhat it described as “one-on-one persuasion” talks with roughly 80 customers who cashed out, asking them to return the won equivalent voluntarily.It is reportedly seeking to avoid civil lawsuits, where courts could, under civil law, order the return of the original asset rather than its cash equivalent.The FSS escalated its response to afull investigation, while the country’s parliamenthas scheduledan emergency hearing for 11 February to question both the exchange and financial authorities.Bithumb said in its apology: “Bithumb takes this incident very seriously and will do its utmost to prevent recurrence by redesigning the entire asset payment process and enhancing the internal control system.“We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaCryptocurrenciesBitcoinnewsShareReuse this content"

So there’s something to learn from this day. And I’m going to learn it.”After taking two golds and a silver from her first two Olympics, Shiffrin didn’t win a medal in any of her six races at the Beijing Games four years ago.“No tricks here at all,” Shiffrin was told over team radio before her run on a course set by an Austrian coach. “Actually it’s nothing to report. You got it.”But Shiffrin lost time to the leaders at every checkpoint and crossed 0.31 seconds behind – missing a medal by finishing 0.06 behind the other American team of Jaqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan, who took bronze. In the finish area, Johnson – who was coming off a gold in the individual downhill – embraced Shiffrin, while the podium finishers began celebrating.Shiffrin and Johnson are childhood friends and Johnson had said after her downhill run, “I already have my gold medal. I hope that she has fun and does her best. But if anything happens I’m not going to be like, ‘Oh you ruined anything.’”Ariane Raedler and Katharina Huber of Austria won gold.The team combined event consists of one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom run, with the times from the two added together to determine the results.Shiffrin still has her individual events of giant slalom and slalom to come.In Beijing, Shiffrindidn’t finish three of her six racesand her best individual result was ninth in super-G. She has narrowed her focus for the Milan Cortina Games and is competing in only three events.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinWinter OlympicsSkiingWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Various entities have estimated that up to 10 million people could visit the 11 US host cities for the quadrennial tournament. However, ICE’s role in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown – including an extended and widespread operation in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area in which two people were killed by federal agents – hasraised serious concerns among fans.‘They’re not getting a cent of my money’: how readers feel about World Cup ticket pricesRead moreSpeaking before the House committee on homeland security, Todd Lyons was testifying publicly for the first time since the deaths of those two Minnesotans, Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Towards the end of a hearing marked by verbal sparring with Democratic representatives, Lyons faced questioning from Representative Nellie Pou, who represents New Jersey’s ninth district. Pou’s district includes East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium, the site of the World Cup final and seven other games, including England’s group-stage finale v Panama.After saying that visitors’ “confidence is plummeting and jeopardizing the World Cup”, Pou asked Lyons if ICE would commit to pausing operations around Fifa events.“ICE, specifically Homeland Security Investigations, is a key part of the overall security apparatus for the World Cup,” Lyons said. “We are dedicated to securing that operation and we are dedicated to the security of all of our participants as well as visitors.”Pou responded: “You realize that if [fans] feel they are going to be wrongfully incarcerated, wrongfully pulled out, that is going to hurt this entire process? I hope you realize that.”Lyons responded by saying that “ICE is dedicated to ensuring everyone who visits the facilities will have a safe and secure event.”In his opening remarks, Lyons said ICE arrested 379,000 people in the last year, of whom 8,400 were known or suspected gang members or terrorists. Federal datahas shownthat the majority of people arrested by ICE do not have criminal history.The actions of ICE, along with other US foreign policy moves, have resulted inlimited calls for a boycottof the tournament.As early as last year, World Cup host city CEOsexpressed concernabout the “uncertainty” they said would arise from Trump’s immigration crackdown.ICE’s involvement in international sporting events has also been under the microscope at the Winter Olympics in Italy.Protests in Milanover the agency’s role at the Games have drawn thousands of participants.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now a new unit has taken up the mantle – and delivered another titleAndrew Lawrencein Santa ClaraTue 10 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 06.56 ESTShareSuper Bowl LXwas a two-score game with less than five minutes remaining. New England had the ball on the Seahawks’ 44-yard line and – after reaching the end zone in the fourth quarter, finally – that familiar sense of possibility. But that quickly vaporized when Devon Witherspoon knifed in on a corner blitz and jarred the ball loose from the Patriots quarterback, Drake Maye, mid-throw. Uchenna Nwosu snatched it in stride and rumbled 45 yards to the end zone,sealing Seattle’s 29‑13 victory.That the league’s top defense was able to punctuate this moment, more than a decade in the making, with an interception as theSuper Bowl XLIX hero Malcolm Butlerlooked on made the Seahawks’ revenge all the sweeter. “They lived up to the Dark Side today,” the Seattle head coach, Mike Macdonald, said of his defense. “It’s going to go down in the history books.”It seems every great Seahawks defense earns a slick nickname to match its reputation. At their 2010s peak,the Legion of Boomwas the NFL’s most feared gang. This year, the Dark Side took up that mantle. As the geek lore references suggest, both of those defenses proved rough, relentless and ready to throw down at a moment’s notice.By retracing the Legion of Boom’s arc and claiming the grand prize, the Dark Side is set for a few sequels, too. The Seahawks not only have youth and cap space on their side, but also continuity under their longtime general manager, John Schneider. His speed and skill in assembling a championship-caliber defense in Macdonald’s second year, after gutting the roster down to the studs, stands as one of the NFL’s all‑time renovations.The teardown began in 2022, when Schneidershipped the quarterback Russell Wilson, linchpin of the franchise’s Super Bowl win 12 years ago, to Denver in exchange for the linebackers Boye Mafe and Derick Hall, a 2023 draft pick that became Witherspoon and then followed it with a late-season trade for the tackle Leonard Williams.The flawed Patriots face a harsh truth: only the very best teams get a Super Bowl sequelRead moreIn 2024, Schneider made an even tougher call, replacing Pete Carroll, his collaborator in 137 regular‑season wins and twoSuper Bowlappearances, with Macdonald (then the Ravens’ defensive coordinator) in a move that bucked the trend of hiring offensive assistants.Schneider did not stop there, trading for the linebacker Ernest Jones IV that same year while spending the team’s first-round draft choice on the standout University of Texas nose tackle, Byron Murphy II. For a coup de grâce, in 2025, Schneider added the Pro Bowl pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence to supercharge Macdonald’s swarming defensive schemes.“Even before I got here, Mike was doing special things with this team, special things with this defense,” Lawrence said in the run-up to the game. “I was able to see it from afar. Now just being here and seeing the creative mind he has, the way he sets us all up to make plays and go hunt the quarterback, it’s truly amazing.”Every move paid off on Sundayas the Dark Side held New England scoreless into the fourth-quarter and hammered Maye 11 times – including a brutal second‑quarter sack by the rookie defensive tackle Rylie Mills, a fifth-round pick from Notre Dame, with New England’s 310lb guard Jared Wilson caught squarely in the middle. (On social media, many watching wondered whether “flogging a Drake” had become a Super Bowl rite.) The Seahawks limited the league’s second-best scoring offense to its second‑lowest point total of the season, while Maye, a regular‑season MVP frontrunner, turned the ball over three times and posted his third‑worst QB rating of the year.The defensive effort – backed by a special teams masterclass, an MVP performance from the running back Kenneth Walker III and steady if unspectacular quarterback play from Sam Darnold – was easily the most lopsided defensive Super Bowl showcase since the Legion of Boom throttled Peyton Manning and the Broncos in February 2014. It reduced yet another politically charged edition of the spectacle, this one powered by Bad Bunny’slayered half‑time set, to a bog standard blowout.Andy yet, for all the Dark Side’s obvious comparisons to their forebears, they have been notably reluctant to trade on that pedigree. Unlike the Legion of Boom, which was studded with homegrown blue‑chip prospects, many on the current Seattle defense arrived with something to prove, having been overlooked and undervalued before Schneider and Macdonald handed them to Aden Durde – himself a league long-shotfrom England.The safety Julian Love, who spent years buried on the New York Giants’ depth chart before Seattle snapped him up in 2023, quickly emerged as a 100‑plus tackle force under Macdonald and Durde. Lawrence, long among the league’s premier pass rushers, saw his star dim in Dallas as the Cowboys defense reconfigured around the stud linebacker Micah Parsons.When Lawrence joined the Seahawks last March, he seemed to do so with some reluctance and a touch of wistfulness about what he left behind. “Change of scenery is always good,” he said, “but Dallas is my home. My family lives there. I’m forever gonna be there, but I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there. So yeah. We here.”Last week, Williams revealed that he, Lawrence, Jones, and fellow tackle Jarran Reed – on his second Hawks tour after brief stops in Kansas City and Green Bay – came up with the Dark Side nickname during a midseason bus ride. They wanted to distinguish themselves from the Legion of Boom and leaned into the ominousness of Pacific Northwest winter vibes.But their Star Wars reference does not evoke the same feelings New England’s nickname did. The Patriots of the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era were likened to an Evil Empire on par with that of the New York Yankees. But under Maye and the head coach, Mike Vrabel, they have become strangely Jedi‑like: principled, disciplined, andalmost likablein a way that defies the old narrative.Seattle’s Dark Side, by contrast, appears to be stacked with genuine Sith Lords wholead with emotionas they pound opponents into submission. But because they have overcome so much, not least the shadow of those old Boston bullies, you can’t help but admire these new gridiron oppressors.“This is the best team we’ve faced obviously this year,” Vrabel said of the Seahawks after the game on Sunday. “We had a really, really good year and one that I am proud of. This game is not a reflection of our year. But we lost and were beat, outcoached and outplayed. Give them the credit.”After an intense confetti shower, the Seahawks cracked beers and puffed on cigars in the locker room – a marked contrast from 2014, when I witnessed them spendingthey spent the aftermath of their Super Bowl win grumbling about failing to shut out the Broncos. But this year’s their victory this year was a sunny scene for a group that embraces the Dark Side, and a clear reminder that the nickname is mostly for fun – even if the misery they inflict on opponents still very much isn’t.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXSeattle SeahawksSuper BowlNFLUS sportsWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Frank Ilett, the man who pledged never to visit a barber again untilManchester Unitedwon five matches in a row, may have been denied a viral haircut, but United’s resilience came to the fore here to deny the Hammers what would have been a deserved victory deep into added time.A studded finish from the fan favourite Tomas Soucek was cancelled out by an impressive, instinctive strike from Benjamin Sesko to leave this match honours even. United lacked energy and snap, West Ham saw two precious points fall away at the last; both sides will leave frustrated but not disconsolate. The Hammers remain in 18th place, United stay in fourth, their contrasting objectives remain in play.Okafor grabs comeback draw for Leeds as wasteful Chelsea’s bad habits returnRead more“The fans, the players and ourselves are disappointed to take this blow in the final moments of the match,” Nuno Espírito Santo said. “But we’ve been able to contain a team in a good moment. The way we started the second half was very positive. In the final moments we had two or three occasions with space in behind where we should have scored the second. Overall it was a very positive performance.”For Michael Carrick there was an admission that things could have gone better. “We were not quite at our best and you have to credit West Ham, but the boys are a bit frustrated in the dressing room and that’s a good sign,” he said. “We know how hard it is to build a run in this league, sometimes it comes naturally and there’s a spark, sometimes it’s maybe a little more stodgy. You’ve got to find the answers and find a way.”View image in fullscreenGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen despairs after West Ham concede late on.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCarrick mulled on the adjustments he had to make after Soucek turned home a low Jarrod Bowen cross to give West Ham the lead. If Sesko had come on earlier than the 69th minute might United have won the game? Carrick wasn’t sure, and certainly it was only after the clock passed 90 minutes – and Carrick had also replaced his full‑back Diogo Dalot with the forward Joshua Zirkzee – that United were able to finally put their hosts under pressure in their own box.With five of seven added minutes passed, an uneven cross from Bryan Mbeumo finally found Sesko, and the emerging forward picked out a flicked finish that deviously switched the angle of the ball to send it inside Mads Hermansen’s far post.For West Ham there were lots of positives to take, despite the ultimate result. Going up against the league’s form side, they showed no signs of self‑doubt and indeed relished the opportunitychance to put United to the test physically. Bowen was his usual self, a ball of energy who executed each moment to the best benefit of his team.View image in fullscreenTomas Soucek prods West Ham in front in the 50th minute.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoAaron Wan‑Bissaka and Crysencio Summerville were equally blurred presences on the pitch, getting up and down and causing their opponents endless trouble. Summerville might have had his sixth goal in six games with a fine first‑half effort, Wan‑Bissaka somehow managed to clear a goalbound Luke Shaw shot off the line with a jutted leg 22 minutes in.“We have been able to bounce back from disappointing moments before and the boys have always been able to react and compete,” Nuno said, looking forward. “There is no other way. Our standards are high.”For United there will be no diminishment of the enthusiasm that Carrick’s tenure has brought to the club and the fanbase. What’s more the interim boss, by taking the risk to score late on, will have further endeared himself as someone in tune with United’s traditions.There will be questions bubbling under, however, as to how sustainable their recent form will be. Matheus Cunha was ineffectual here and withdrawn for Sesko. Mbeumo was often to be found on the periphery of events too. Questions of quite how to knit up the team’s attacking talent at places where the battle off the ball is just as significant will have to be resolved over time.“I think it’s going to shift a little bit with different games as well as the situation within games and how you want to attack,” Carrick said. “It’s where the spaces are, what the game looks like. We probably didn’t quite get a bunch of it right, if we’re honest, for the first part of the game. And that happens, especially against a team going all out to stop you scoring.“So we’ve just got to find that way, but we kept going and mixed things up because we have got that flexibility, and I think it certainly helps to find different solutions …”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Team USA swept all four preliminary-round games by a combined score of 20-1 and brought back memories of how a Canadian team in their prime rolled to winning gold at the 2022 Beijing Games.The tables have since turned, and it was evident on the scoresheet from a roster that features seven players still in college.The University of Wisconsin’s Caroline Harvey had a goal and two assists, with Badger teammates Laila Edwards and Kristen Simms also scoring. The goal was Edwards’s first in her Olympic debut in being the first Black woman to represent the US.University of Minnesota captain Abbey Murphy set up three goals.Winter Olympics 2026 day four: Slovenia win ski jumping gold as Sweden’s Wranå siblings star – as it happenedRead moreAerin Frankel stopped 20 shots for her third win and second shutout in her first Olympic tournament. And even 36-year-old captain Hilary Knight added an assist – the 32nd Olympic point of her career to tie Jenny Potter for most by a US women’s hockey player.Canada, meanwhile, opened tentatively, and then ran into penalty problems without their longtime leader, Marie-Philip Poulin.Poulin was ruled out about five hours before puck drop, a day after she limped off with an apparent lower-body injury in the first period of a 5-1 win over the Czech Republic. The 34-year-old Poulin is considered day to day, though it’s unclear when the player nicknamed “Captain Clutch” will be available for Canada’s closing game of the preliminary round against Finland on Thursday.Poulin’s availability is also uncertain for Saturday, when Canada is scheduled to play their quarter-final.The US will open the quarter-finals against host nation Italy, which went 2-2 in clinching the third and final Group B playoff spot. The Americans are two-time Olympic gold medalists.Whatever “O, Canada” buzz there was amid a large Maple Leaf flag-waving capacity crowd quickly dampened on a drizzly day outside the 11,600-seat Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. And the soundtrack instead became the sound of the U.S. goal song, Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Free Bird.”Harvey opened the scoring 3:45 in by driving in from the left point and snapping a shot beating Ann-Renee Desbiens.‘My needles are waiting’: Ben Ogden credits knitting habit after cross-country silverRead moreThe Americans’ speed and quick-strike ability was evident on their next goal when Murphy chased down Harvey’s pass in the right corner. Murphy immediately spun and sent a no-look pass Bilka converted by driving to the net.Simms made it 3-0 by jamming the puck over the line 72 seconds into the second period and Murphy set up Bilka for another one-timer some six minutes later.Desbiens allowed five goals on 27 shots and was pulled after Edwards scored with 8:07 left. She was replaced by Emerance Maschmeyer, who finished with five saves.Canada’s worst fears were realized in opening the game minus Poulin, after concerns were already raised after the US dominated in sweeping a four-game exhibition pre-Olympic Rivalry Series. The Americans outscored Canada by a combined margin of 24-7.The US has now defeated Canada in seven straight meetings, dating to the preliminary round and gold-medal game of the world championships in April.Though the Canadians kept the US mostly to the perimeter, they were unable to generate any hint of a sustained offense. Canada was out-shot 11-4 through the first period – and one shot credited to Canada included a dribbler on net from the neutral zone.Rounding out the day is Finland playing Switzerland in a Group A outing.Ebba Svensson Traff stopped 20 shots to post her first Olympic shutout and Group B champion Sweden completed its four-game preliminary round sweep with a 4-0 win over Japan.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Laura Kluge scored the second goal in her team’s 2-1 win over Italy.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty ImagesJosefin Bouveng had a goal and assist, and Hanna Thuvik, Mira Hallin and Hanna Olsson also scored.

The world’s most beautiful and nicest person. Three months ago I made the mistake of my life and cheated on her, and I told her about that a week ago. This has been the worst week of my life.‘My needles are waiting’: Ben Ogden credits knitting habit after cross-country silverRead more“I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her. Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.”Asked by the interviewer how he managed to finish third, Lægreid replied: “I try to be a good role model and I did something stupid. I got a nice video from the club at home and I used that as motivation today. As I said I want to be a good role model but I have to admit when I get something wrong. You have to admit when you do something you can’t stand for and hurt someone you love so much.”Lægreid won gold in the relay in Beijing four years ago and has 14 world championship medals, including seven gold. After the medals ceremony he spoke to NRK again: “I do not want to say who it is. She has had enough to deal with after last week but I hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel for us both. And that she can continue to love me.”It was a hugely emotional day for Botn, too. He pointed to the sky as he crossed the finish line and shouted “We did it Sivert!” to the TV cameras, remembering his teammate Sivert Guttorm Bakken,who was found dead in his hotel roomin Lavazè, Italy, in December.“My thoughts felt OK all the way,” he told NRK.“I went out on the last lap and had an incredible emotional rollercoaster. It was very special. When I crossed the line I broke down. I was thinking about him all the way through the last lap. I started to think about the whole year and us training every day for this. It had been such a clear goal for us. I felt that he was with me that whole lap. I hope he was watching today.”Lægreid said: “Of course, now I hope I didn’t ruin Johan’s day. Maybe it was really selfish of me to give that interview. So yeah, I don’t know. I was, I’m a bit, I don’t know … I’m not really here mentally. So yeah, we will see what happens.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Hesingled out freestyle skier Hunter Hessfor criticism after the Oregon native said he felt “mixed emotions” about competing in the current political climate.Trump calls Hunter Hess ‘a real loser’ for skier’s ambivalence about representing USRead more“Hess, a real loser, says he doesn’t represent his country in the current Winter Olympics,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, failing to convey the nuance of the skier’s expression. “If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the team.”The exchange has quickly become the most visible example yet of political friction surrounding the US team at the Milano Cortina Games, where athletes have largely avoided direct criticism of the Trump administration but now appear increasingly willing to discuss the tensions they are experiencing.The shift has come as the Trump administration has taken a more aggressive posture internationally – includingtariffs on key allies,military action in Venezuelaandrhetoric about acquiring Greenland– moves that diplomats and analysts say have strained relations with traditional partners and contributed to a more politically charged atmosphere at the Games.It has also unfolded against a visible political backdrop in Italy. Vice-president JD Vance spent five days in Milan attending multiple Olympic events, often alongside US secretary of state Marco Rubio in what at times felt like a soft-launch of the 2028 GOP presidential ticket. Vance took separate meetings with US athletes, Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and IOC president Kirsty Coventry, whiledrawing audible and sustained booswhen shown on stadium screens during the opening ceremony (a reaction thatappeared to be edited out of the telecastback in the US).Athlete comments first drew attention during a news conference in Milan on Friday, when reporters asked the members of the US freeski team how they felt representing the country amid heightened immigration enforcement and domestic political division.Hess said he saw a distinction between representing his nation and endorsing every policy carried out in its name.“If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I’m representing it,” he said. “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Fellow freestyle skier Chris Lillis struck a similar tone, saying he felt “heartbroken” about recent developments in US immigration policy while stressing that he still saw his Olympic appearance as a chance to represent a different vision of the country.“I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent,” he said.View image in fullscreenAmber Glenn said she received a “scary amount” of online hate after speaking publicly on the US political moment.Photograph: Paul Kitagaki Jr/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFigure skater Amber Glenn, days beforewinning an Olympic goldin the team event, said she believed LGBTQ+ Americans were facing a particularly difficult political moment. She later said she would be taking a break from social media after receiving what she described as a “scary amount” of hate messages and threats in the wake of her comments.In response to questions, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) said it was monitoring abusive online activity directed at athletes and working with social media platforms and law enforcement when credible threats emerged.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety,” the organization said.The hostility has not been limited to current Team USA athletes. Team GB freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, who previously represented the United States and won Olympic slopestyle silver in 2014, said he had received death threats afterposting an image on social mediacriticizing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.“The other day I posted a photo with my thoughts on ICE and that photo has since gone everywhere,” Kenworthy said in an Instagram video posted on Sunday. “I’ve gotten a ton of messages and most of them honestly have been supportive and encouraging. But a lot of the messages have been awful – people telling me to kill myself, threatening me, wishing they’ll get to see me blow my knee or break my neck during my event, calling me slurs. It’s insane.”Kenworthy, who will compete in the snowboard halfpipe in Livigno later in the Games, also voiced support for current US athletes who have spoken publicly about their discomfort with the political climate.“I think sometimes people forget that you can love the US and be proud to be an American – I am – and still think they can be better,” he said. “Just because you love the US doesn’t mean you stand with this administration.”3:51Winter Olympian Gus Kenworthy reveals he has received threats over anti-ICE post – videoThe backlash has not been limited to the political sphere. Influencers and conservative commentators have also weighed in, includingthe YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who criticized Hess on social media before attending a US women’s hockey game alongside Vance.Former NFL quarterback Brett Favre, actor Rob Schneider and Florida congressman Byron Donalds were among public figures who also criticized athletes speaking out.Richard Grenell, the Kennedy Center head who was the US ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first term, criticized Hesson social media, suggesting he “move to Canada if you aren’t proud to wear USA”.“The guy said he has mixed emotions about representing America,” Grenellsaid. “[H]e is a loser for saying that while representing the greatest country in the history of the world.”But many athletes have stopped short of directly attacking the administration, instead emphasizing a distinction between government and country.Snowboard starChloe Kimand cross-country skierJessie Digginshave both spoken about representing what they describe as core American values – inclusion, opportunity and community – even while acknowledging political divisions.Kim framed the moment through her family’s immigration story, saying recent events had “hit really close to home”.“It is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another with all that’s going on,” said the two-time Olympic halfpipe champion, whose parents immigrated from South Korea. “I’m really proud to represent the United States. It’s given my family and I so much opportunity. But I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going on. And I think that we should lead with love and compassion. And I’d love to see more of that.”Diggins, who helped the USwin a historic team sprint goldat the 2018 Winter Olympics and later added two individual medals in Beijing, said she saw her Olympic performances as representing Americans she believes are defined by empathy and community.“I’m racing for an American people who stand for love, for acceptance, for compassion, honesty and respect for others,” Digginswrote in an Instagram post. “For everyone out there caring for others, protecting their neighbours and meeting people with love – every single step is for you.”The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in the US | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreAlpine skierMikaela Shiffrinstruck a similarly careful balance, saying it remained “an honor and a privilege” to represent the United States while adding she hoped to demonstrate values of diversity, inclusion and respect through her performance and public platform.The tension has also intersected withprotests in Italylinked to the presence of US immigration enforcement personnel supporting Olympic security operations. Demonstrations in Milan have drawn thousands of participants, with smaller groups clashing with police after rallies targeting the role of US immigration agencies abroad.US officials and Italian authorities have emphasized that the personnel deployed are part of investigative units that typically assist with cross-border crime and athlete security rather than enforcement operations. Still, the optics have fueled criticism and reinforced the sense among some US athletes that domestic political debates are following them to the global stage.The dynamic reflects a longer Olympic history of athletes navigating national identity and personal conscience, but the speed and scale of online reaction has given rise to new concerns about athlete safety and mental health.Taken together, comments from several US athletes and former Olympians point to what many see as a defining tension of modern Olympic sport: representing a nation while maintaining individual political and moral beliefs.“I’m representing my family, my community, the people who helped me get here,” Hess said. “That’s what wearing the flag means to me.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamUnited States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC)Amber GlennMikaela ShiffrinJessie DigginsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Ukrainian team have appealed against the helmet ban, arguing that it is not in breach of Article 50 of the Olympic Charter which ­prohibits political statements while in competition.After finishing second in his ­training run, Heraskevych said that he planned to continue to use his banned helmet in competition. “I used it in all trainings. I used it today, I will use it tomorrow, and I will use it on race day,” he said. “I truly believe that we didn’t violate any law and any rules.”The images on the helmet include those of the weightlifter Alina Peregudova, the strongman Pavlo Ishchenko and the ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, who were all killed.View image in fullscreenOlena Smaha’s glove reads: ‘Remembrance is not a violation’.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesHeraskevych, who has the support of theUkrainepresident, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has also accused the IOC of betraying those dead Ukrainian athletes. “A decision that simply breaks my heart,” he said on ­Instagram. “The feeling that the IOC is ­betraying those athletes who were part of the Olympic movement, not allowing them to be honoured on the sports arena where these athletes will never be able to step again.”Earlier the IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that, while the helmet was banned, the committee would make an exception to allow ­Heraskevych to wear a black armband during competition.“There was an informal meeting last night with Mr Heraskevych, his coach and the delegation, and we ­reiterated our understanding of the athlete’s wish to pay tribute to his ­fellow Ukrainian athletes, which he’s done during training and on social media,” Adams said.“What we’ve tried to do is to address his desires with ­compassion and under­standing. We will not stop him expressing himself in press conferences, in the mixed zone and elsewhere. And we feel that this is a good compromise.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUkraineInternational Olympic CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

And afterwards he credited the relaxation he finds in knitting.The mustachioed 25-year-old finished in 3min 40.61sec after surging through the final with his trademark classical technique, less than a second behind Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo, who secured the seventh Olympic gold medal of his career in 3:39.74. Klæbo’s teammate Oskar Opstad Vike took bronze after climbing from 20th in qualifying to the podium.Winter Olympics 2026 day four: more golds for Italy, Norway and Sweden; GB curling heartache – liveRead more“It’s an unbelievable dream come true,” Ogden said. “Everybody who races dreams of being on an Olympic podium. Last year I really dared to set my expectations on an Olympic medal. Every day in training I thought about how I could get better and be the best version of myself on this course.”Ogden became the second US man to win an Olympic cross-country skiing medal and the first since Bill Koch, also a Vermonter, who earned silver in the 30km at the 1976 Innsbruck Olympics.Skiing was embedded in Ogden’s life long before it became a career. His father, John, a former Middlebury skier who later coached a local club in Vermont’s Bill Koch Youth Ski League network, helped build a routine around snow and trails for his children. Winters meant loops groomed into fields near the family home and daily time on skis, an upbringing Ogden has described simply as normal for his family.Coaches later credited that environment – competitive but not results-obsessed – with helping shape Ogden’s racing style.A three-time NCAA champion at the University of Vermont, Ogden built his medal run methodically through the day. He qualified second fastest in the morning round, then won his quarter-final in 3:26.10 before advancing from the semi-final as a lucky loser – finishing just 0.60sec behind Klæbo in a photo-finish chase for automatic qualification.View image in fullscreenJohannes Høsflot Klæbo moved closer to the record of eight cross-country skiing golds.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP“It’s a dream,” Ogden said of racing Klæbo, who moved one step closer to passing compatriots Marit Bjoergen’s and Bjorn Dæhlie’s record of eight cross-county golds. “When you know you have to face Johannes in every race, you have to bring the best version of yourself. He wins a lot of races, but it doesn’t mean one of us can’t give him a run for his money. Today I did my best – he was better. Maybe next time.”Away from racing, Ogden has also become known among teammates for his knitting habit, whichhe has saidhelps him decompress during the long World Cup and championship schedule. He said last week his latest project is a pair of mittens that feature Joan of Arc.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

After a day like today, my knitting needles are probably waiting for me.”A ripping yarn: Olympian Tom Daley opens knitting exhibition in JapanRead moreOgden is not the only Olympian to take up knitting. Several US teammates, includingJessie Digginsand Julia Kern, have spoken of making sweaters and hats. At the Tokyo Games in 2021, Team GB diver Tom Daleywent viralfor knitting between events. Three years later, he headlined an exhibition of his woven creations at a Tokyo art museum.His medal is the first by an American man in any individual Olympic cross-country sprint event and represents a major step forward for a US men’s program that had never previously finished higher than 19th in an Olympic classical sprint.The breakthrough comes amidsteady growth across American cross-country skiing, long driven by the success ofDigginsbut increasingly reinforced by a younger men’s core that includes Ogden and fellow rising contender Gus Schumacher. Both 24, the pair have helped shift expectations for the US men from simply racing in the pack to targeting podiums – a change Ogden has credited to team culture. “We all grew up racing each other,” he said last year. “Now it’s about pushing each other to get better. We want to take this team to the next level.”Tuesday’s race capped a strong day overall for the Americans, even as Sweden dominated the women’s sprint. Linn Svahn led a Swedish sweep ahead of Jonna Sundling and Maja Dahlqvist, with King Carl XVI Gustaf among those in attendance.View image in fullscreenBen Ogden celebrates his drought-breaking win with a backflip.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APAll four American women – Diggins, Kern, Sammy Smith and Lauren Jortberg – advanced from qualifying into the quarter-finals. Diggins later said she was managing bruised ribs suffered in theskiathlon, limiting her ability to accelerate after a strong start in her heat. Kern advanced to the final via the lucky-loser rule and finished sixth, matching the best Olympic result by an American in the event.But the day ultimately belonged to Ogden, roared on by dozens who had made the long journey to Val di Fiemme from his home town of Landgrove (population: 177).“There’s all kinds of people here from Vermont,” Ogden said. “My mom is here. A bunch of people from my home town are here. If I wasn’t doing this I’d be over there celebrating with them. I’m just excited I was able to put on a good show with so many Vermonters here and watching back home.”Ogden is expected to compete in additional distance events later in the Games as the United States looks to build on one of its most significant Olympic cross-country results in decades.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsOlympic GamesWinter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamSkiingShareReuse this content"

However it led to problems that began on Saturday when the American downhill skiing champion Breezy Johnson revealed that her gold medal had fallen off her ribbon as she jumped in celebration.Speaking at the daily Milano Cortina briefing, spokesman Luca Casassa said: “Following reports of issues affecting a small number of medals, the organising committee immediately reviewed the matter, working closely with the State Mint, which produced the medals.“A solution has been identified, and a targeted fix has been put in place. Athletes whose medals have been affected are encouraged to return them through the appropriate channels so that they can be promptly repaired and returned.“Milano Cortina 2026 remains fully committed to ensuring that medals, which represent the pinnacle of every athlete’s journey, meet the highest standards of quality and care.”Other athletes have also reported problems, including the Sweden cross‑country skier Ebba Andersson, who said that her medal “fell in the snow and broke in two” – while the US figure skater Alysa Liu also posted on Instagram that the ribbon had come off her team gold medal.Casassa admitted that he did not know the precise number of medals that had been broken or damaged. “But it is important to stress that, as a precaution, we are rechecking all the medals to make sure that the athletes’ joy can really be 360 degrees when they conquer something which is so precious and so important for them, but also for us, the supporters,” he added.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple of hours spent in Brussels Expo Hall 3 will be largely procedural but the Fifa president’s messaging will be worth delegates’ attention. Even by the standards of relations between football’s major governing bodies, the past 12 months have been fractious. The fault lines hardly get narrower and there is certainly no reduction in the number of thorny issues simmering away.At last year’s edition, in Belgrade, Infantino used the gathering of European football’s great and good to make a caveated case for Russia’s return to competitive action. If that was a rolling of the pitch, his comments on the matter in an interview last week amounted to letting the sprinklers loose.Infantino said the ban on Russian sides should be reassessed, at least for age-group teams, but there is little chance of his views gaining weight around Europe even if he elects to revisit the argument.You may not like the Liverpool red card, but it was the right call | Jonathan WilsonRead moreIt is inconceivable that Uefa’s executive committee, which meets the day before congress, tables a vote to let Russia back in. Even if a constituency exists in favour of their return, it has nothing like the clout to push that through. Privately, a number of Football Associations wonder how the subject can seriously be raised given nothing has changed for the better since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A fear in some quarters is that Infantino may attempt to pull levers at Fifa’s congress, in Vancouver on 30 April, to get what appears to be his wish.The sojourn in Belgium’s capital should be more noteworthy for what is said, in the open and on the sidelines, than any decisions taken. There are many in Europe who would like reassurance that theUnited States is a fit and proper co-host for this summer’s World Cup, even if the urgency of mid-January has abated. It seems several news cycles ago that potential collective responses were being anxiously discussed by FA heads while Donald Trump stepped up the rhetoric about an annexation of Greenland. Any faint notion of a boycott, always the most extreme scenario, has in effect disappeared. But deep unease, better described as disgust in certain cases, atInfantino’s relationship with Trumpis widely felt in Uefa’s corridors of power.So perhaps Infantino, who sparked awalkout of Uefa representatives at Fifa congresslast May after showing up late from business in the Middle East, will attempt a moderate tone. He cut a buoyant figure in last year’s Belgrade address, the expandedClub World Cupin his sights, but the tenor and context of scrutiny have ratcheted up considerably since.View image in fullscreenUefa president Aleksander Ceferin (left) and his Fifa counterpart, Gianni Infantino (right), have built their own rival powerbases in football.Photograph: Tullio Puglia/UEFA/Getty ImagesMost of the other geopolitical headaches facing the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, can be kicked down the road for now. There has been no serious movement towards banning Israel since the Gaza ceasefire plan commenced in October, although widespread violations have been reported. Israel’s FA would like to see its country’s sides allowed to stage international games on home soil this year but is understood not to be pushing for that outcome in the short term because of the situation surrounding Iran.Nor will there be a volte-face in Brussels on the stance around Greenland despite the recent turmoil. Some senior figures believe Greenland, who have long hoped for some form of Uefa or Concacaf membership and were shocked to be rejected by the latter last year, must pick a side if any hopes of involvement in the European scene are to be revived. The subject may arise at a meeting of the heads of the Nordic FAs on Wednesday.Ceferin’s position, a subject of high controversy in Paris two years ago when he extended Uefa’s presidential term limits before claiming he would step down in 2027, looks unassailable. From virtually that moment it has been widely held that he will, in fact, run for an unprecedented fourth term next year and the expectation among leading FAs is that he will do so unopposed. Suggestions that the Danish FA head, Jesper Møller, made a Uefa vice-president last year, could stand look unrealistic and there is no former player pushing through to make their case as a wildcard.For now Ceferin can point to a successfulwomen’s European Championshipand dance another victory lap for the revamped men’s Champions League, particularly in light ofJanuary’s climactic matchday eight. Uefa has also been keen to talk up the success of the new women’s format. He could reflect in his speech to congress that, however Uefa eventually got there, thethreat of top leagues hosting domestic games on other continentshas been postponed. Now that Barcelona have finally ditched the Super League project he may also claim that, bar Real Madrid, Europe’s superpowers have been lassoed into line.The extent to which that is true may be seen in any further changes to the Champions League format from 2030, not to mention a potential fresh bloating of the Club World Cup. The ever-increasing power of the European Football Clubs group means Ceferin, who has complained of feeling tired in the past, needs a steady hand and strong voice if he really is staying for the long haul. His approach toFifa, which some regard as too passive despite his public distaste for many of Infantino’s schemes, surely requires similar heft.Thursday’s addresses to the continent’s big hitters may shine further light on the state of that relationship. The sense persists, though, that football’s biggest tinderboxes are still waiting to be lit elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsFifaGianni InfantinoUefaFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hornets coach Charles Lee was ejected in the fourth quarter after he had to be restrained from going after an official while arguing a call.The Pistons won the game 110-104. The loss ended the Hornets’ bid to match a franchise record with 10 straight wins.Duren had the ball and was driving toward the basket with just over seven minutes left in the third period when he was fouled by Diabate. Duren turned around to get face-to-face with Diabate and the two appeared to butt heads. Duren then hit Diabate in the face with his open right hand, starting a confrontation that lasted more than 30 seconds and ultimately ended with a brief police presence on the floor.While Pistons forward Tobias Harris was holding Diabate back, Diabate threw a punch at Duren. Duren walked away and Bridges charged at him, throwing a left-handed punch. Duren retaliated with a punch. Diabate attempted to charge again at Duren and had to be held back.Stewart left the bench to confront Bridges, who responded with a punch, and the players tussled. At one point, Stewart got Bridges in a headlock and delivered multiple left-handed blows to his head.Duren called it an “overly competitive game”. “Emotions were flaring,” he said. “At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard.”Duren said that opposingNBAteams have been trying to “get in our head” all season. “This isn’t the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be,” Duren said. “But as a group we have done an OK job of handling that energy and intensity. At the end of the day, emotions got high with everybody being competitive. Things happen.”Duren did not say how the fight started, referring reporters instead to the video replays. The Hornets did not make Bridges and Diabate available for interviews after the game. However, Bridges took to Instagram late Monday night to say: “Sorry Hornets nation! Sorry Hornets Organization.! Always gonna protect my teammates forever.”“It looked like two guys got into a heated conversation and it just kind of spiraled from there,” Lee said.Crew chief John Goble said in a pool report after the game that the players were ejected because they “engaged in fighting activity during the dead ball. After review, we assessed fighting fouls and by rule they were ejected from the game.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons coaches try to break up a fight in the second half.Photograph: Nell Redmond/APPistons coach JB Bickerstaff defended his players after the game. “Our guys deal with a lot, but they’re not the ones that initiated, they’re not the ones who crossed the line tonight,” Bickerstaff said. “It was clear, through frustration, because of what [Duren] was doing, that they crossed the line. I hate that it got as ugly as it got.“That’s not something that you ever want to see,” Bickerstaff added, “but if a guy throws a punch at you, you have a responsibility to protect yourself. That’s what happened tonight. If you go back and watch the film, they’re the ones who initiated crossing the line and our guy had to defend himself.”Tensions continued to mount at the Spectrum Center after the fight. Midway through the fourth quarter, Lee was ejected and had to be restrained by Hornets guard Brandon Miller while yelling at officials for a no-call after Charlotte’s Grant Williams collided with Detroit’s Paul Reed.“Grant was walking down the paint and barely touched somebody and the guy fell over and that is what we are going to call a foul,” Lee said. “They have a hard job to make these calls, but I don’t think that was the consistency with which that had been called the rest of the game.” As for being ejected, Lee said he has to have more control of emotions moving forward.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsCharlotte HornetsDetroit PistonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The manager is dealing with a ghost from the club’s more successful recent past. There were 49 minutes on the clock when the South Stand choir took up the song. “He’s magic, you know. Mauricio Poch-e-ttino.” The message was clear. They want their former idol back. They cannot persist any longer with Frank.The only wonder here was that Newcastle, who had arrived on the back of three successive Premier League defeats and with numerous issues of their own, were not out of sight at the interval. If they were bright in the first half, Spurs were impossibly awful. Frank’s injury list numbered 10 players and he lost another one – Wilson Odobert – in the 34th minute. The captain,Cristian Romero, is suspended, of course. Nobody wants to hear excuses.Chelsea 2-2 Leeds, Tottenham 1-2 Newcastle, Everton 1-2 Bournemouth: football – live reactionRead moreThere was a period at the start of the second half when Spurs threatened an improbable comeback. Trailing to Malick Thiaw’s goal just before the interval, they re-emerged with a bit of purpose and Archie Gray would find the equaliser after a set piece.Newcastle simply went again and there was an inevitability about Jacob Ramsey’s winner, his first for the club. It was entirely merited from a Newcastle point of view. They had brought an unwanted statistic to London, having given up 19 points from winning positions; the most in the league. It was never going to be a tale of frustration for them. Eddie Howe called it one of Newcastle’s best performances of the season.The celebrations of the manager and his players in front of the travelling fans at full time stood in sharp contrast to the unhappiness of everybody connected to Spurs. The soundtrack to the evening from their point of view had been boos and more boos – and even more when Frank ventured on to the field after the final whistle.At the start of stoppage time, he had heard another chant from them: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.” There was an end of days feel about it all. Where does Frank go from here? Next up is the derby against Arsenal on Sunday week.A word on Pochettino. He is preparing to lead USA at the World Cup this summer and it feels inconceivable that he could be available before then. After the finals would be a different story.View image in fullscreenJacob Ramsey’s neat finish gives Newcastle a winner that always seemed inevitable.Photograph: John Walton/PAWhen the dust settled, it did so on a grim detail for Frank and Spurs: they have won only twice in 17 league matches. It is relegation form. And, playing like this, with so little attacking intent and cohesion, it is impossible to say the club is not in a relegation battle.Howe had gone for pace and mobility in his front three; it was Anthony Elanga and Harvey Barnes either side of Anthony Gordon. Newcastle settled quickly and their control of the first half would be total. The assurance on the ball belonged to them, with Bruno Guimãraes always seeming to have an extra second in possession. The only blot for Newcastle would be a suspected hamstring injury for him towards the end.Joe Willock was a whisker away from the far corner with a low shot on nine minutes and the pressure from the visitors mounted inexorably. The Spurs support wanted something to get behind. Anything. There was zero from their team before the interval. Anxiety filled the void with Guglielmo Vicario a focus for it. When he punched weakly midway through the first half, there were howls from the South Stand. He was jittery on the ball, too.The snap‑shots in Spurs anguish built up. When players went back rather than forwards there were yells. Where were the options? When Vicario collected an easy ball, there were cheers. Pape Sarr and Xavi Simons would be booked for diving.There were boos from the Spurs fans after Willock ran on to a Ramsey pass on 44 minutes, cut inside Micky van de Ven and located the far corner with a cool finish. The goal would be disallowed when the video assistant referee spotted Willock was fractionally offside but Spurs’ reprieve did not last long. The breakthrough came when Thiaw rose unmarked to meet Elanga’s cross and Vicario could only pat the ball out weakly. Thiaw got to his own rebound ahead of Sarr and Gray. He wanted it more.View image in fullscreenMalick Thiaw pokes the ball over the line to give Newcastle the lead just before half-time.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesSpurs did restart with a bit of feeling. Mathys Tel, who had come on for Odobert, lashed high after good work from Gray. Sarr forced Nick Pope into a save. It was better and the equaliser came when Sarr headed back a Simons corner and there was Gray to volley home.Newcastle’s response was emphatic and, after Barnes was denied by a Van de Ven block, they restored their advantage. Conor Gallagher squandered a counter‑attacking opportunity with a poor pass and Newcastle came back up the Spurs right. It was Gordon with the low pass into the area and, with nobody in white close enough, Ramsey shot low and first time into the far corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The lapses in concentration have piled up and there was another to add to the list after Stamford Bridge witnessed an inexplicable collapse against Leeds, who took another step towards staying up fighting back from 2-0 down to keep themselves six points above the bottom three.The turnaround was not on the cards when Cole Palmer, who had earlier collected his first assist in thePremier Leaguethis season, extended Chelsea’s advantage by scoring from the spot for the third time in two games. By the end, though, Liam Rosenior was ­watching the prospect of an eighth win in 10 games slip away. The implosion was staggering. Lukas Nmecha and Noah Okafor had capitalised on dreadful defending to make it 2-2 and, while Chelsea rallied, their hopes of a late winner ended when Palmer produced a contender for miss of the season.Rayan and Adli stage Bournemouth fightback against 10-man EvertonRead morePalmer was no more than two yards out when he connected with a cross from Moisés Caicedo and somehow fired over. Chelsea, who have dropped 17 points from winning positions, flailed at both ends. They kept Leeds at arm’s length for 67 minutes, only to reckon without the unlikely restorative powers of Jayden Bogle.The versatile 25-year-old defender sparked the comeback when he thundered into the area, drew a clumsy challenge from Caicedo and stepped aside for Nmecha to halve the deficit. More was to come. Josh Acheampong was flimsy, Bogle forced the error and Okafor was free to score for the ­second time in five days.“Six minutes of switching off,” Rosenior said. “We have to make sure we are switched on for 90 minutes. As simple as that. We should come away with three points. We haven’t because of two moments.”Rosenior’s wait for the perfect 90 minutes goes on. The frustration is that Chelsea were impressive for an hour. Palmer looked free and João Pedro scored again. “Some of our football was everything I wanted to see,” Rosenior said. “That makes it even more of a bitter pill to swallow.”Part of the problem is how ­Chelsea respond to setbacks. The loss of ­composure and shape at 2-1 was impossible to defend. Bogle ­handled ­during the buildup to the equaliser but he should never have been allowed to advance so far. Leeds simply wanted it more in that moment. Daniel Farke’s side were without key ­players but ­relished giving ­Chelsea a bloody nose for the second time since promotion.“Great vibes from everyone in the team,” Farke said. “I’m very proud of my players. I just have compliments for them for such a fightback. If you go 2-0 down, of course it can be a long night, but our players have this never‑say-die attitude.”Chelsea needed patience against a deep five-man defence. They looked for solutions with rotational movement in possession. Andrey Santos, who has been one of the benefi­ciaries of ­Rosenior ­replacing Maresca, dropped into defence to start moves, Marc Cucurella pushed into eye‑catching areas from left‑back and there was plenty of ­freedom for Palmer.Gaps started to appear after a quiet 20 minutes. The opener came when Santos threaded a pass through the lines. Palmer took it on the half-turn and released João Pedro, who collected his sixth goal in eight games by lifting a clever finish over Karl Darlow.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer, who scored in the first half, puts the ball over the open goal late on against Leeds.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesChelsea were glad to see Palmer and João Pedro on the same wavelength. They are a devastating duo when they are fit and on song. Palmer has three assists in all competitions this season and it is no coincidence that they have all been for João Pedro.It is not all one-way, though. João Pedro has won three ­penalties in two games for Palmer. The ­Brazilian works so hard. He raced on to a long ball in the 58th minute and got there before Jaka Bijol, who was ­penalised for a crazy shove on the Chelsea striker.Up stepped Palmer to send Darlow the wrong way from the spot. Leeds had offered nothing with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Anton Stach ­missing up front. It is rarely simple with Chelsea, though.Without a clean sheet in six games, they were rattled when Nmecha pulled a goal back from the spot. Leeds went direct. Bogle bustled into the area, held off Acheampong and pushed the ball away from Robert Sánchez. Okafor, on as a substitute, tapped into the empty net.Chelsea threw on Liam Delap. João Pedro headed just over the bar. Palmer produced his miss. Chelsea grasped for answers.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Not yet, anyway. Sixth place and momentum in the push for European qualification was the tantalising prize for beatingBournemouthbut, not for the first time at their plush new stadium, David Moyes’s team let it slip through their grasp.Andoni Iraola’s visitors extended their unbeatenPremier Leaguerun to six games courtesy of second-half headers from Rayan, the 19-year-old Brazilian who could well be their latest gem, and Amine Adli. Bournemouth’s goals and a red card for the Everton defender Jake O’Brien arrived in an eight-minute spell in which the hosts imploded to leave themselves without a home win since 6 December. Moyes’s side have collected 17 points from their last eight away games but only eight from the last nine at home. Their quest for Europe is floundering on home soil.West Ham United v Manchester United: Premier League – liveRead more“We missed a couple of good chances to get the second goal so we only have ourselves to blame, no one else,” said theEvertonmanager in a monosyllabic press conference that was over inside three minutes. His anger was palpable. Iliman Ndiaye had put Everton ahead from the penalty spot five minutes before the interval and Moyes’s side were superior when reduced to 10 men. But the clinical touch and the resolute defending that Everton routinely show on the road was absent once again.Thierno Barry squandered two gilt-edged chances while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had a goal-bound drive blocked by the impressive James Hill. Both teams were responsible for a turgid, laboured opening half hour in which a disallowed goal by the offside Ndiaye was the only incident of note.Mercifully, the contest improved after Djordje Petrovic spilled James Garner’s ambitious free-kick into the path of Barry. The striker had to react sharply but, unmarked inside the six-yard box, he sliced woefully wide. European football would be a considerable achievement by Moyes under any circumstances this season, but even more so given the painful lack of quality from Barry and Beto.The miss did spark the home team into life, however. A minute later Ndiaye met Dewsbury-Hall’s cross with a first time effort that Petrovic turned on to a post. Everton were then presented with a penalty when Rayan was harried off the ball by Jarrad Branthwaite and unwittingly clipped the defender inside the area. Ndiaye swept the resulting spot-kick inside Petrovic’s right hand post.View image in fullscreenJanuary signing Rayan scores for the second successive game for Bournemouth.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersEverton started the second half strongly but Barry failed to convert a delightful pass from Ndiaye, his tame effort allowing Álex Jiménez to block, and Dewsbury-Hall was denied following a mistake by Petrovic. Barry was distraught on the bench after being withdrawn shortly afterwards. He could have no complaints with Moyes’s decision.Adrien Truffert served notice of Bournemouth’s belated improvement with a long-range drive that fizzed past Jordan Pickford’s far post. The left back’s effort arrived between two penalty appeals by the visitors, for a handball by Garner before the interval and a trip by Vitalii Mykolenko on Rayan, and though neither were given Iraoli’s players never lost focus. Rayan atoned for Everton’s penalty by scoring for the second game in succession for his new club. Truffert sent a cross over Vitalii Mykolenko and the winger, the recent £24.7m signing from Vasco da Gama, soared at the back post to beat Pickford with an emphatic header.Three minutes later, with Everton again unconvincing in the air, Bournemouth were ahead. Pickford and his defenders were all at sea when Alex Scott delivered a free-kick into the Everton area. Hill headed across goal for Adli to steer a diving header into an empty net and, despite Enes Unal being in an offside position when the free-kick was taken, the winner stood.O’Brien’s straight red for colliding into Adli and denying a clear goalscoring opportunity completed Everton’s costly meltdown.“I’m very happy with the result,” said Iraola. “To be honest it wasn’t our best performance but football is like this. A draw would have been a fair result but we found a way.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Hearts eventually found the breakthrough in the closing stages when Milne’s low cross from the left was forced in from close range by the onrushing Magnusson.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsHiberniannewsShareReuse this content"

Afterwards, Haaland stated he must improve his output and refused to blame fatigue for his form. Guardiola, though, has praised the contribution of the 25-year-old, who has 28 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for the club this season.David Squires on … the chaos at Anfield as Manchester City stay in title chaseRead more“We cannot forget he’s not 29, 30 years old; he’s young and it’s part of the process,” said Guardiola. “Every season he lives, he’s a better player for the next one. How he knows his body better, how he knows what it means to play every day. We cannot forget the last games. Maybe he doesn’t have the numbers that he wants, but we are in the position that we are thanks to him.“For three-quarters of the season, if he didn’t score, I don’t know who’s going to score. We are in the position in the Champions League [into the last 16], and especially in the Premier League, without Erling it would not be possible.”Guardiola was impressed with Haaland’s calm when converting from the spot at the weekend. “It’s not easy – Anfield, 91, 92 minutes, and the situation that we have, taken there and taken with this composure, his body language, in his eyes there was fire there, and it’s not easy,” he said. “That defines the good players. Hopefully he can be lifted. And the reason why he is tired, a little bit down, it’s down to one reason – the calendar. So no more than that.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland put away his penalty on Sunday to take all three points from the game.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesAbdukodir Khusanov has started City’s last 10 games and impressed. The defender was taken off on 61 minutes at Anfield with a suspected concussion but tests showed he did not suffer one and so will be available for Fulham’s visit to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.Khusanov’s English is not great but Guardiola insists there are no communication problems as far as the 21-year-old Uzbek is concerned. “He doesn’t speak like William Shakespeare but he’s getting better and better. He understands what we want and every time he is getting better. He is so intelligent.“Normally you have the opinion that because he is so physical and strong and fast that he’s not able to think, but it’s completely the opposite – he always makes good decisions.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaErling HaalandnewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal and Manchester United are among eight teams vying to join Barcelona, Lyon, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, who automatically qualified for the quarter-finals as the top four in the league phase.As in the men’s competition, a switch from a group stage to the league format has been made. However, with the UWCL group stage having been introduced only for the 2021-22 season, there was scepticism about a change coming so soon, with the group stage viewed as a big step forward and in its relative infancy.WSL talking points: Arsenal punish City and Chelsea get into the grooveRead moreThere are few surprises in the playoffs, given three of the four ties taking place this week and next bring together teams who met during the league phase, with four teams seeded and four teams unseeded for the draw, but the new format has yielded plenty of positives.Statistically, its success is clear, with Uefa data showing a 27% rise in the number of matches decided by a single goal and a 16% increase in the number featuring goals from both teams compared with the same stage last season. The win rate for the team who scored first is down from 88% to 61% and the lowest-ranked teams in the league phase took an average of 1.1 points a game compared with 0.6 last season.OH Leuven’s midfielder Julie Biesmans spoke of the significance of the format for lower-ranked sides. “For teams like us the new format is really interesting, because you play against different opponents, and mostly, when there is a group stage, you already kind of know who is going to finish first or second,” she said. “This [format] gave us a bigger chance to actually go through, and that’s what happened, even if we didn’t think about it, we didn’t dream about it.”The league phasewent to the wire, with seven of the nine games in the final round having some form of jeopardy. The audience has grown, with cumulative live viewership reaching 13.5 million, a figure reached only during the final between Arsenal and Barcelona last season.Statistics don’t always present the truest picture but they help shape it, and come the end of the competition we will be able to reflect on the season of change and draw conclusions about how successful the switch to the format deemed best for the men’s game has been.On Wednesday, Arsenal play at Leuven, the competition’s lowest-ranked remaining side, with Renée Slegers’s team hoping to replicate the performance that yielded a3-0 win away to the Belgian sidein December. Arsenal are coming out of an intense period, with winsagainst ChelseaandManchester Citysandwiching their Champions Cup victory. They have weathered the impact of high-intensity games in quick succession and, in theory, beating Leuven should be straightforward. However, Leuven’s record in the league phase demonstrates their potential threat, with Arno Van den Abbeel’s team beating Twente and securing draws against Paris FC, Roma and Paris Saint-Germain.View image in fullscreenFridolina Rolfö celebrates her winner in October against Atlético Madrid, who meet Manchester United again this week.Photograph: Diego Souto/Getty ImagesLater on Wednesday, Real Madrid host Paris FC, the Spanish side having had to rely on a Caroline Weir goal in the eighth minute of added time to cancel out Lorena Azzaro’s first-half penalty when the teams met in November.On Thursday Wolfsburg play Juventus in the only new tie. The Italian side sit third in Serie A, a point behind Inter but six behind the leaders, Roma, but have strung together five back-to-back wins in all competitions since their loss to Inter on 18 January. Wolfsburg have had their 2026 interrupted by postponements owing to poor pitch conditions and have played only one game, a 2-1 win over Köln, since beating Hamburg on 21 December.Manchester United travel to the Spanish capital for a second meeting with Atlético Madrid on the same night, Fridolina Rolfö’s goal having been the difference in atight encounterin Madrid in October. Marc Skinner’s side were forced to work hard to earn their 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday and Thursday kickstarts a fierce run of fixtures, with London City Lionesses their opposition between the two legs against Atlético, after which they face back-to-back games against Chelsea, in the fifth round of the FA Cup and League Cup final, to test the strength and depth of their squad.The playoffs add games that many teams – the Women’s Super League clubs in particular – could probably do without but will they add more exciting data points and present some interesting games before the tastier quarter-finals? We will see.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Dane watched his team lose 2-1 at home to Newcastle on Monday night; they have won just twice in 17 Premier League games and lag 16th in the table, five points above the relegation zone.It was another night whenthe Spurs fans booed and jeered him. At one point, they sang for Mauricio Pochettino, their former manager, who is now in charge of the USA national side, while they also told Frank towards the end of the game that he should be “sacked in the morning”.Frank must beware ghost of Tottenham managers past to avoid Nuno’s fateRead moreFrank was defiant, citing an extensive injury list and the club’s difficulties in combining the demands of domestic and European football. He was without 10 injured players against Newcastle and lost another one, Wilson Odobert, in the 34th minute. Thecaptain, Cristian Romero, is suspended.Spurs’ next game is the derby at home against Arsenal on Sunday week and Frank was asked whether he would still be in charge for it. “Yeah, I’m convinced I will be,” he said. “I understand the question and I understand it’s easy to point on me but I also think it’s never only the head coach or the ownership or the directors or the players or the staff. It’s everyone.View image in fullscreenWilson Odobert may be the latest Spurs man to need time on the treatment table after he was injured in the first half.Photograph: John Walton/PA“How convinced am I that I am the right man for the job? 1,000% sure. I am also 1,000% sure that I never expected us to be in a situation like this with 10 or 11 injuries. But I know when you need to build something and need to get through things, you need to show unbelievable strong resilience. You need to have a calm head and carry on.“I understand the mechanism in football [to sack the manager] – no doubt about that – but there are a lot of studies that [show] it is not the right thing to do. I know it’s the only movement they [the board] have, but there’s also plenty of situations where it’s not the right thing to do.”Frank was also asked in a TNT Sport interview whether his job was under threat. “I spoke to them [the owners] yesterday so no,” he replied. Could the fan fury during and after this latest defeat change their view. “No,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankNewcastle UnitedEddie HowenewsShareReuse this content"

That does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run, that is clear. We are completely aware.”Despite that admission, Slot claimed his position is not inextricably linked to Champions League qualification and the Liverpool hierarchy would consider a range of factors when assessing his performance this season. He drew parallels with the 2022-23 season, when Liverpool missed out on the Champions League but allowed Jürgen Klopp to rebuild his midfield with Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo.“That is a difficult question for me to answer because I don’t decide on my future,” said the Dutchman. “The only thing I do know is that it happened before, and recently, and it didn’t affect the future of that manager. But that doesn’t guarantee anything of course.“Maybe somewhere else it is not only about results, but mainly. And at some clubs they also look at the progress the players make, the progress the team makes, the circumstances are sometimes taken into account. That is not at all clubs but I think I am working at a club that does look at those things. As it has shown that in the past when the club did not qualify for the Champions League.”Slot has faced a wide range of issues this season but believes his team can achieve “something special” in the Champions League and FA Cup. But he accepted the campaign had been the hardest of his 10 years as a coach.“By a mile,” he said. “Because all the other seasons I’ve managed there were only positives. I don’t think I’d ever lost two games in a row, so it’s an exception this season for me as it is for the players. The players are not used to losing a lot or having a lot of draws. I’m not used to that as well. So, yes, this season has been more challenging for me but you also take nice things out of it – that might sound weird – because I also look at how much improvement we are making.“In my opinion, everyone is now able to play every three days at an intensity level that is needed at this club and, as a result of that, I think our performances are much better than they were in the period at the start of the season when we started playing a double programme.”Liverpool could be without four right-back options at the Stadium of Light with Dominik Szoboszlai suspended afterhis red card against Manchester City. Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley are injured and a late call will be made on Joe Gomez after his return to training on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m proud of the level of care.”It is the fourth injury to strike the Australian team, with aerials medal favourite Laura Peel injuring her knee at a pre-Olympics training camp, while young freeskier Daisy Thomas also suffered a knee injury in a fall.Snowboard halfpipe Olympian Misaki Vaughan was also ruled out of making her debut after failing a HIA, hitting head while training on Monday.Under the team’s head injury protocols, the 20-year-old can’t participate for a minimum of seven days.While Thomas withdrew from slopestyle, she is hopeful of competing in the big air while four-time Olympian Peel hasn’t given up hope of landing an elusive medal.“Unfortunately with winter sport injuries happen along the way, in 53 athletes doing relatively high risk sports it’s not something that’s unusual I’m afraid to say,” said Camplin, who won an aerials gold medal in Salt Lake City in 2022 skiing on two fractured ankles.“My heart breaks on their behalf – I know how much work goes into an Olympic dream.”Camplin said the two-time world champion Peel continued to “make progress”.“Our aerials team haven’t even arrived yet so we don’t need to rush her,” she said.Bolton was the highest-placed Australian men’s snowboard cross rider in Beijing in 13th place, while he also finished ninth in the first ever team event alongside Belle Brockhoff, whose own career was ended by serious injury.He was due to line up in the men’s seeding round on Thursday morning in Livigno with the opening round getting underway later that day and has been replaced by debutant James Johnstone.View image in fullscreenJakara Anthony during moguls qualification.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockOlympic champion Jakara Anthony has kept her stunning Games record alive, making it five rounds of competition unbeaten after she topped moguls qualifying in Livigno.Four years ago, Anthony also opened with a bang in qualifying and then swept through the next three rounds en route to Australia’s first women’s moguls gold medal.The 27-year-old joined her fellow opening ceremony flagbearer Matt Graham as the two Australian skiers to bypass the next qualification round, with the 2018 silver medallist grabbing the 10th and final spot in the men’s event.Anthony was satisfied with her performance, saying she did what she needed to do. “I felt like it was what I needed to put down for qualifications, it felt pretty tidy and that’s what we came out here to do today,” said Anthony.“My goal was just that I wanted to get through in qualification one so that I just have the chance to come out for finals tomorrow and I don’t need to worry about qualification two.

I was told recently that he has the best win record of any Scotland coach in the professional era. Sir Ian McGeechan had two spells and I think Gregor sits above that. The way he has coached the attack they have, and the way they move the ball, when they do that, they look terrific.“I have immense respect for him as a coach and I find it surprising that people are not spending more time talking about Scotland rather than not supporting their coach. I think he’s a phenomenal coach and they should spend more time supporting him.”England have won only once at Murrayfield since 2016 but are on a run of 12 successive victories. Borthwick has kept changes to his side to a minimum, restoringMaro Itojeto the captaincy, promoting Luke Cowan-Dickie to start at hooker to maximise Jamie George’s strengths of the bench but largely keeping faith with the team who thumped Wales last week.With Fin Smith replacing namesake Marcus on the bench, England appear light on three-quarters cover but Ben Earl has regularly been deployed at centre while Henry Pollock will continue to have “freedom to roam” when he comes on as a replacement.View image in fullscreenLuke Cowan-Dickie will start at hooker against Scotland.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“[Henry’s] got incredible pace and super handling skills and you see not just his ability to make breaks, but how he supports breaks,” Borthwick said. “How often do you see him on somebody’s shoulder taking an offload and then running on and scoring or potentially giving another offload for somebody else to score? His skill set and the way he plays the game is less within a structure and more within having freedom to roam to go and find the ball and find where he needs to be. I’m very confident with him in that position.”Borthwick also believes his side is well equipped to deal with any Scottish skullduggery at Murrayfield, with previous Calcutta Cups featuring a tunnel bust-up involving Ryan Wilson, George Ford and Owen Farrell in 2018 as well as bagpipers encroaching on England’s half in the warmup.“This is a brilliant place to play rugby, against a very good team,” the England head coach said. “If you go back, how have I, how have we approached it? How exciting is this, another brilliant international in this fantastic championship and another step in the development of this team and a great challenge playing against a Scotland team who have a lot of top quality players in it.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamMaro ItojeSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

More than $100m were bets on Bad Bunny’s opening song and $45m on which artists would perform with him on stage. In comparison, the platformsaw $27min total trading volume at last year’s Super Bowl.Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to trade on the outcomes of virtually anything, from sports and elections to what color someone will wear during a performance. Unlike casinos or traditional sportsbooks, users effectively bet (or “trade”) against others on the platform, instead of an established “house”, and the platforms earn revenue by charging trading fees.‘We all on Kalshi now’: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the quiet collapse of sporting trustRead moreKalshi and competitorPolymarketargue that this model distinguishes them from traditional casinos or sportsbooks. Since the US supreme courtoverturnedthe federal ban on sports betting in 2018, state gambling agencies regulate traditional gambling outfits, but prediction markets are currently overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The reason people are flocking to prediction markets, especially Kalshi, is that our incentive as a company [is] we win when the customers win, we don’t win when the customers lose, and that’s a huge difference in the model,” Mansour said on Tuesday.On Sunday, Kalshitoldusers that although some deposits were “delayed because of the amount of traffic and deposits we’re getting”, their money “is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land”.Prediction markets have risen in popularity in recent months and are now used beyond sports, edging into other events such as the Grammys and Oscars. Last week, Kalshiannouncedthat the NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was joining the company as a shareholder.But in recent months, critics have raised concerns about potentialmarket manipulation and insider tradingon these prediction market sites. Ahead of the Super Bowl, Kalshi said it expanded itssurveillance and enforcement effortsto detect and remove accounts engaging in insider trading or market manipulation.In aposton X days before the Super Bowl, Mansour said the company over the past year “ran over 200 investigations and froze relevant accounts” and referred several active cases to law enforcement.Explore more on these topicsBusinessSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSport bettingUS sportsBad BunnynewsShareReuse this content"

He later congratulated Glennon her team gold medal, and both sides have since described the episode as a misunderstanding rather than a conflict.Winter Olympics 2026 day four: more golds for Italy, Norway and Sweden; GB go for first medal – liveRead more“The issue of music rights can be complex and confusing, and it seems like there was a hiccup somewhere in that process,” Glenn said in a statement. “I’m glad we were able to clear things up and I’m excited about the possibility of collaborating with Seb moving forward.”Glenn has performed to The Return for roughly two seasons without prior objections. It remains unclear where the breakdown occurred, though skaters typically rely on federations, event organizers and clearance processes recommended by the sport’s governing bodies to secure permissions.The episode reflects a broader trend across figure skating, where athletes have increasingly encountered last-minute licensing complications as the sport has shifted toward contemporary music. Spanish skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faced a similar scare last week when music from the Minions franchise used in his short program was initially not cleared for Olympic competition. After a public push from fans and direct outreach, Universal Studiosultimately granted permission, allowing him to keep a routine he had built over months of competition.Officials say the challenge stems from structural gaps in the music industry, where rights are often split across multiple holders and platforms, complicating clearance across global broadcast and streaming markets.For Glenn, the copyright episode has unfolded during an Olympics where she has also become an unexpected focal point off the ice. The three-time US champion has spoken openly about LGBTQ+ rights andsaid she stepped back from social mediaafter receiving what she described as a “scary amount” of hate messages and threats following pre-Games comments about pressures facing queer communities in the current US political climate.While she called the backlash “disappointing”, she has continued skating with visible LGBTQ+ symbols on her team gear and said she sees her platform as part of the responsibility that comes with Olympic visibility.Glenn is scheduled to compete next in the women’s singles event, beginning with the short program on 17 February, where she said her focus remains on performance rather than controversy.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Amber GlennWinter OlympicsUS sportsFigure skatingnewsShareReuse this content"

Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.However, the commitments do not cover asignificant bugbear for app developers– the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.The CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.View image in fullscreenApple has committed to giving app developers easier ways to request use of features such as the digital wallet.Photograph: Ascannio/AlamySarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”Under the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.The CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.Smith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”The News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.An Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.A Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.Explore more on these topicsAppleGoogleCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsAppsMobile phones (Money)Mobile phones (Technology)newsShareReuse this content"

Today in tech, we’re discussing the Persian Gulf countries making a play for sovereignty over their own artificial intelligence in response to an unstable United States. That, and US tech giants’ plans to spend more than $600bn this year alone.Can the Gulf states capture some of the US’s tech dominance for themselves?I spent most of last week in Doha at the Web SummitQatar, the Gulf’s new version of the popular annual tech conference. One theme stood out among the speeches I watched and the conversations I had: sovereignty.The conference’s founder set the Summit’s tone on opening night: “Three years ago [when Web Summit Qatar began], people were talking about entering a multipolar world. We are now living in a multipolar world,” said Paddy Cosgrave.As evidence, he referenced the fieryrebukeof Donald Trump given by the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, at Davos a few weeks prior. He pointed to the act that had preceded him on stage: dancing robots built by a Chinese company, which he called the most advanced in the world. Cosgrave also brought on two speakers who would act out the dynamics he had mentioned. First was the Qatari prime minister, who announced a series of billion-dollar moves meant to foster startups in the country. Then came the Palestinian-Jordanian founder of UpScrolled, an insurgent TikTok competitor whose founder announced on stage that the app had crossed 2.5 million users amid theconfusedbacklashto thenew US entity of TikTok.As the US becomes a more unstable place to immigrate to and start a company, all three major Gulf powers are making a show of their multibillion-dollar push into AI. It’s not just Qatar that is spending big. Last year, the UAE signed a deal with the US for advanced chips that will fill one of the largest datacenters in the world to be constructed outside Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia’s state-owned AI firm, Humain, has inked billions of dollars in deals to create a “full-stack AI ecosystem”, which is to say the kingdom wants its own datacenters, training data, cloud services and AI models, perhaps even its own chips. The aim ofsovereign AI– artificial intelligence under the control of its home country from tip to tail – is explicit.The move towards greater AI capabilities in the Gulf does not entail an end to cooperation with the US, though. While I was there, a newspaper owned by members of Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family trumpeted a deal between Jared Kushner’s AI company, Brain Co, and Qatar’s ministry of municipality to automate construction permitting. The first linein the storygives an idea of the message: “Qatar is gaining prominence as a key player in practical artificial intelligence employment, leveraging partnerships that combine Silicon Valley expertise with local knowledge.”Will the Gulf’s push for its own AI succeed? That was the second question on everyone’s lips. (The first, of course, was: “Is AI a bubble?”) Multiple major factors are stacked against the region’s development of sovereign AI. Regional access to semiconductor chips is limited, though growingby hook or by crook. There is not enough homegrown engineering talent in the region to power an AI industry, but Doha offers India’s wellspring of engineers a much more attractive time zone for connecting with family than San Francisco does, as well as a price tag that’s lower than Trump’s$100,000 per visa. For the construction of AI models, there is far less Arabic textual content online than English.Tech’s financiers, venture capitalists, are debating where to invest money amid the upheaval. The participants in one of the panels I moderated had competing visions. A French venture capitalist argued for backing startups across Europe and the Middle East. He and a German VC on another panel said that investing in the US had become more difficult in recent years due to huge valuations, which entail less percentage ownership for investors. A partner at a venture capital fund that invests only in San Francisco firms argued that Silicon Valley’s companies possess a genuine moat that will fend off challengers and ergo are still the best bets to place.The Gulf is not alone in doing its best to build its own tech ecosystem. Europe is in the throes of similar angst over sovereignty, spurred on by Trump’s antagonism towards the region. But the bloc has crucial challenges to resolve. The EU’s relatively strict tech regulation has led to world-leading privacy protections for its citizens, but the continent’s tech sector is relatively weak in comparison with the laissez-faire US. Will the EU’s parliament sacrifice the privacy guaranteed by the proposedAI Actin favor of the deregulation companies say they need?Europe’s governments are investing far less than the cash-rich petrostates in the Gulf. Can the EU’s companies and governments replicate all the tools they need without a significant influx of funding? France recentlydumpedZoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet in favor of an application called Visio, which, coincidentally, is already the name of a Microsoft diagramming software. Belgium and the Netherlands are still essential for the global semiconductor supply chain, though only part of it. Elon Musk’s Starlink looms large over the continent as it attempts to boost the homegrown alternative Eutelsat, which has quite a long way to go to catch up to its American counterpart.One notable exception to Europe’s lagging at the Web Summit: the London startup ElevenLabs, seen as the developer at the forefront of generating voices and music with AI. The company’s Polish founder announced on the first day that his company had closed a $500m fundraising round, led by blue-chip American firms, including the Maga-allied Andreessen Horowitz, which tripled ElevenLabs’ valuation.Crypto suffers major blowsBitcoin loses half its value in three months amid crypto crunchHow cryptocurrency’s second-largest coin missed out on the industry’s boomFiles cast light on Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to cryptocurrency$600bn+ in one year: tech giants’ staggering spending on AI keeps growingView image in fullscreenAmazon stands out among the four for informing investors that its capital expenditure would increase the most.Photograph: Jacob King/PAThroughout the past two weeks of quarterly earnings calls, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta informed Wall Street that they would collectively spend more than $600bn in the coming year, mostly on the infrastructure that underpins AI. The amount of money dwarfs what many governments around the world spend to operate entire countries. Each company’s capital expenditure – money spent on fixed, physical assets (in this case the land, buildings and chips for datacenters) – equals or surpasses that of the past two years combined. Last year’s total for the four was $359bn, and 2024’s was $217bn, perBloomberg.Alphabet told Wall Street itwould spendbetween $175bn and $185bn in the same time period, almost doubling from last year. Meta reported between $115bn and $125bn. Microsoft is slated to spend some $105bn, Bloomberg reports.Amazon stands out among the four for informing investors that its capital expenditure would increase the most, jumping from $125bn last yearto $200bn in 2026. The day before Amazon’s earnings, Jeff Bezos’s Washington Postlaid offa third of its staff. The two are not directly linked corporations, but the contrast is stark. Bezos bought the Post in 2013 for 0.125% of what Amazon will spend this year alone, $250m.Even Tesla, an AI company in a more oblique sense than the others, revised its capital expenditure upward to $20bn, far more than analysts expected – or frankly wanted, given the company’sdecliningrevenue.The figures are astronomical in scale, but there is reason to believe they will grow larger yet. Take a look at the number ofads for AI products in the Super Bowl, which did their best toconvince Americansthat they actually like AI. The market for these products has not settled or matured into a sector with unseatable incumbents. AI is still a land grab, and the tech giants want to grab as much as they can.The wider TechScapeWhy has Elon Musk merged his rocket company with his AI startup?Hail our new robot overlords!

The cuts wouldn’t affect retail customers,it said.In May 2025, Telstra said “AI efficiencies” would allow it to shrink its workforce by 2030.Telstra’s chief executive, Vicki Brady, said AI would “be a significant unlock when it comes to enabling our workforce”.Agentic AI – which can work autonomously – would be working alongside Telstra staff, she said.Optus has previously said AI would have a big role to play in telecommunications but thathumans would remain central.Announcing the JV, Telstra said it would drive productivity and growth, “build on Telstra’s work creating a world-class data and AI ecosystem, modernising its data and AI platforms, and embedding responsible AI by design”.“We are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention,” the Accenture chair and chief executive officer, Julie Sweet, said at the time.Explore more on these topicsTelstraBusinessAI (artificial intelligence)Telecommunications industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new Powerbeats Fit are the direct successors to 2022’s popularBeats Fit Pro, costing £200 (€230/$200/A$330). They sit alongside the recently redesignedPowerbeats Pro 2as Apple’s fitness alternatives of the AirPods.The Fit take Beats’ standard earbud design and add a flexible silicone stabiliser wing that curves around the inside of yourconcha, rather than around the outside of your ear like the Pro 2. The result is a far more compact and discreet earbud – particularly if you opt for a subtler colour than spark orange – and one that’s more comfortable to wear with glasses.View image in fullscreenThe wing is slightly more flexible than that from the Fit Pro without sacrificing purchase in your ear.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOnce twisted into place, the earbuds stayed firmly in my ears regardless of how vigorously I shook my head or how wet I got running in the rain. The new wing is a little more comfortable for extended periods than their predecessors, but I still found it put uncomfortable pressure on the inside of my left ear after an hour or so.A single button on each earbud takes care of playback and noise cancelling controls, or can be set to adjust volume on a press and hold. Call quality is very good – particularly for earbuds without stalks – sounding relatively natural and clear even when speaking softly in quiet environments and only allowing a little background noise through on busy streets.View image in fullscreenThe flip top charging case is light and 17% smaller than the previous version making it easier to fit in a pocket.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery in the earbuds lasts a good six hours of playback with noise cancelling and can be charged three times in the case for a total of 24 hours use before needing to be connected to power by USB-C.The earbuds have Apple’s older H1 chip for managing connectivity, which means a seamless connection to the iPhone and other Apple gear with spatial audio, music sharing and Siri. But theBeats app on Androidoffers many of the same advanced features, including instant pairing, customisation, updates and battery widgets, making them cross-compatible and ideal for people who use both platforms.View image in fullscreenThe Beats app for Android (left) enables most of the same controls and features for the Powerbeats Fit as built into the iPhone Settings app (right).Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth5, SBC, AAC, H1 chipBattery life:six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)Water resistance:buds and case IPX4 (splash resistant)Earbud dimensions:27.4 x 21.5 x 20.4mmEarbud weight:5.8g eachCharging case dimensions:62.5 x 55.4 x 27.5mmCharging case weight:49.8gCase charging:USB-CSound and noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe silicone earbud tips and the stabiliser wing do a good job of ensuring a seal in your ear once correctly twisted into place.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Beats sound far better than your average workout buds and are good enough to be general listening earphones. They produce fairly balanced sound with plenty of powered in the low end when required, good separation of tones and decent detail in the mids and highs. They are quite similar to the Powerbeats Pro 2 and do a great job with punchier rock, pop, hip-hop or electronic tracks, but fall short of theAirPods Pro 3.Unlike most workout buds the Beats have active noise cancellation, which works pretty well to dampen the drone of road noise or the commute. It can’t handle the difficult higher tones, such as clicks, taps and background chatter as well as the Powerbeats Pro or the best-in-class AirPods Pro 3, but it does the job most of the time.The earbuds also have a good and natural-sounding transparency mode, which helps with awareness while out running. But like the Powerbeats Pro 2 it isn’t quite as good as not having anything in your ears, so is still best used in safer environments such as parks.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth Beats case is one of the best on the market and fits fairly easily into pockets and bags.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.The earbuds are not repairable but Apple will offerindividual replacements for lost or damaged parts, including a £69 battery service. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.PriceThe Beats Powerbeats Fit cost£199.95(€229.95/$199.99/A$329.95).For comparison, theBeats Powerbeats Pro 2cost£250, theBeats Studio Buds+cost£180, theBeats Solo Budscost£80and theAirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictThe Beats Powerbeats Fit are a minor revamp on the already greatBeats Fit Probringing them into line with the rest of Apple’s earbuds.They aren’t as comfortable or accomplished on the audio or noise-cancelling fronts as theAirPods Pro 3. Nor are they quite as great for running as thePowerbeats Pro 2with their volume rocker buttons. But the Fit are easier to live with on the commute without the big over-ear hooks and more comfortable to wear with glasses without sacrificing the secure fit.That makes them great workout buds that can pull double-duty as regular earbuds with good enough noise cancelling and great sound. Plus they have most of the fancy features of AirPods with Apple gear and full compatibility with Android thanks to the Beats app. Not many earbuds can claim that privilege.Pros:secure fit, good sound, solid noise cancelling and transparency modes, decent battery life, good case, good call quality, spatial audio, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.Cons:expensive for workout buds, no multipoint connectivity, ear hook can be uncomfortable after a while, battery can’t be replaced making them ultimately disposable.View image in fullscreenThe Powerbeats Fit straddle Android and iOS while being workout buds that are good enough to pull double duty as daily earbuds.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsApplereviewsShareReuse this content"

So they shelled out $3,500 to do the unconventional: hire a horse and a cowboy to lasso the bull of Wall Street.On a sweltering evening in late September, the cowboygallopedtoward the iconic sculpture in lower Manhattan. Wearing ranch gear and a western hat stamped with the Lunos logo, he lassoed the bull’s horns as invitees and curious passersby watched. He and the horse then circled the statue, handing out cowboy hats and branded stress balls.The goal was simple: deliver Lunos’s pitch of “taming the wild west” of accounts receivables in the most literal, public way possible. The startup uses AI to automate invoices, track balances and follow up on payments.“We were trying to figure out in a sea of sameness how we could stand out as a startup to be reckoned with,” said Alex Mann, Lunos’s head of growth.How cryptocurrency’s second largest coin missed out on the industry’s boomRead moreWith more than90,000 AI companiesworldwide, according to one tally, many businesses promising to automate the same tasks across work and daily life are having increasing difficulty differentiating themselves by their products alone. Many AI companies geared towards businesses have relied on hype-filled messaging delivered through predictable channels like trade shows, white papers, billboards and digital ads. A live stunt in front of the Wall Street bull represents a departure in form that can feel oddly out of sync with the conventional back-office software these companies build.The stunt reflects a broader shift among AI companies turning to provocative marketing to stand out in an overcrowded, capital-rich sector. In 2025 alone, AI startups raised roughly $202.3bn globally, up from $114bn the year before, according toCrunchbase. Digital ad spending for generative AI apps also surpassed $200m in Q2 2025,SensorTowerdata shows.As standard claims about productivity and speed blur together, some startups are abandoning corporate messaging in favor of spectacle. And while these stunts appear to be working, marketing experts say the shift reflects an industry under mounting pressure.Provoking startupsStartups such as Artisan AI, Cluely andFriendhave provoked backlash for ads implying their tools could replace human workers, help cheat in job interviews or substitute for real friendships: decisions that critics say amount to distasteful messaging orchestrated for “ragebaiting”.Wary of similar accusations, business-focused AI startups are experimenting with less controversial gimmicks for a range of reasons.For Virio, the draw isviral content. In September, the AI marketing startup hired cowboys to walk two horses around the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco during HubSpot Inbound, a major marketing conference. From 8am to 11am, co-founder Emmett Chen-Ran walked beside the horses holding a Virio banner reading “Content that drives pipeline.”The aim was to catch the attention of founders and C-suite leaders at companies with 50 or more employees, Virio’s target customers. Chen-Ran said such theatrics are rare in the B2B world, where companies sell products to other companies rather than consumers, giving the stunt an added novelty. The real goal, though, was for conference attenders to take photos and share them on LinkedIn, fueling the online engagement at the center of Virio’s marketing strategy.“You don’t do the stunt for the stunt itself,” Chen-Ran said. “You do it for the LinkedIn posts and the content it drives.”While Virio leaned into spectacle, Personal AI, a small language model startup, used provocation as a visual metaphor for its core message.In June, at the HubSpot AI Summit (a separate conference from HubSpot Inbound) in San Francisco, Personal AI’s CEO, Suman Kanuganti,walked onstage toplesswearing only gym shorts. Kanuganti opened with the line “LLMs are naked” splashed across the screen behind him. He argued that the large models powering ChatGPT and Gemini leave users feeling “exposed” and “insecure”. Personal AI, which allows businesses to create individuated AI models by training on their own documents, he said, is the “missing gear”. As he slowly dressed, each item of clothing, from the Arc’teryx jacket to his Salomon shoes, symbolized a layer of protection he personally trusted. The point was to show that, just as people select clothing from familiar brands, businesses should have access to AI systems built with transparent guardrails: privacy, safety and reliability.Trapped in ‘land grab mentality’Marketing experts say the rise of these tactics speaks to the pressure facing enterprise AI startups in a rapidly expanding sector.Emily Heyward, co-founder and CEO of Red Antler, a marketing agency for startups, said founders feel trapped in a “land grab mentality” desperate to seize attention before a rival does, even if the product is still maturing, as investors pour billions into AI firms.“Few, if any, of these businesses are currently delivering on their ultimate product vision,” Heyward said. “It’s really about drumming up enough noise that people try you versus the other guy, then stick with you as the tech evolves.”Tom Goodwin, co-founder of All We Have Is Now, a business consulting firm, takes a more cynical view. Goodwin says there is “a degree of desperation and urgency” driving many of these stunts. AI is subversive, he argues, which lends itself to marketing that is provocative and attention-grabbing.“These companies are terrified that no one’s going to notice them,” Goodwin said.He goes further, arguing there is “a degree of lack of morality” embedded in some AI products, pointing to intellectual property theft, job displacement and the dismissal of human values. In a media environment splintered across social platforms and heightened political theater, fear, he says, becomes a marketing tool. Startups tapping into that anxiety are reaching for one of the few reliable ways to claw back attention.While these startups insist their tactics were strategic and effective in driving sales, Virio, Personal AI and Lunos say stirring up negative discourse solely for attention does not align with their values.The less inflammatory, more controlled version of stunt marketing appears to be paying off, though with mixed results.Virio’s stunt did not unfold as planned. Few people walked by, and the horses at the Moscone Center moved too quickly for most people to capture good photos. Still, Chen-Ran said the company created its own LinkedIn content from the event, generated more than 300 qualified website visitors and gained visibility after “countless” people recognized the team inside the conference, leading to calls with a few potential customers.At Personal AI, Kanugati said his stage performance helped cement the company’s positioning and secure additional conference bookings, which have led to a handful of small customer deals.For Lunos, the impact was immediate. Mann said thousands of people visited the site, LinkedIn posts about the Wall Street stunt drew hundreds of likes and comments, and word-of-mouth referrals spiked across CFO Slack groups. In the three months following the launch, Mann said inbound leads filled the sales pipeline with hundreds of qualified prospects. The publicity even triggered an influx of job applications, including McKinsey consultants seeking leadership roles across business operations.Lunos now has paying customers, and the team says the volume and quality of inbound interest has left them confident they can convert even more early leads into clients.As Mann put it, the stunt “opened the door for us to think creatively about how we want to design future activation campaigns”, a sign that the pressure to stand out is unlikely to fade.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAI (artificial intelligence)featuresShareReuse this content"

From parodying the banality of open-world games with 2007’s No More Heroes to collaborating with James Gunn for 2012’s pulpy Lollipop Chainsaw, his games often offer a welcome reprieve from soulless, half-a-billion-dollar-budget gaming blockbusters. It was with considerable excitement that I fired up Suda’s first new game in 10 years.The game kicks off with a slick cartoon that shows our hero, Romeo Stargazer, being eaten by a zombie. Hastily resurrected by his zany scientist grandfather, Romeo returns from the brink imbued with new powers – and then we’re off. Almost immediately I am bombarded by an impenetrable wall of proper-noun nonsense. It’s like this for the next 20 hours.Romeo is now a “deadman” – a being trapped between life and death – who has been recruited by the FBI’s space time police to stop interstellar criminals from terrorising the cosmos. Along the way you’ll be taking down wave after wave of unstoppable zombies – known in this world inexplicably as “bastards” – while a woman called Juliet sporadically appears in different dimensions, terrorising your dreams in PS2-era 3D, before battling you as an end of level boss. If this description sounds like it’s been written by a kid who hasn’t done his homework, I’m sorry to say that’s because even after playing this game to completion, I’m still none the wiser.In an interview last year, Suda cited Rick and Morty as a major influence on Romeo Is a Dead Man, struggling to explain the game’s story while espousing his love of chicken katsu and sticking it to “the bastards”. I remained hopeful that there would be a deeper meaning underneath all the bafflingly juvenile nonsense, but more fool me.Outside of the story, the game itself initially seems promising. Main missions see you swinging a legally distinct lightsabre as you carve up wave after wave of “bastards”, playing like a souped up successor to the seminal No More Heroes series. Hacking and slashing at zombies is dumb fun, with stylish attacks inviting screen-filling bursts of colour. The boss fights are fun and stylised, and everything feels satisfyingly chaotic. Yet as the game drags its nonsensical story kicking and screaming to the end, even the game engine decides it’s had enough. Despite reviewing this on a PS5 Pro, I found that the frame rate regularly slowed to a crawl as I was mobbed by waves of enemies in later levels, making an already flawed game almost unplayable.In between inter-dimensional killing sprees, players roam a charmingly retro hub world – your FBI-branded spaceship. Here everything is depicted in 16bit-era 2D pixel art, as you roam the spacecraft chatting to Romeo’s shipmates – which include an ancient Roman god, a talking cat and a Jamaican journalist. You can buy new stuff, play mini games and tend ability-granting plants inspired by the different zombies you slay along the way.View image in fullscreenDon’t let the bastards bring you down … Romeo Is a Dead Man.Photograph: Grasshopper Manufacture IncOne thing Romeo Is a Dead Man has going for it is it’s always interesting to look at. From fully animated cartoon sequences to PS2-tribute polygons and sculpture-esque art, this is a game that features more disparate visual styles than most game publishers’ entire catalogue. Yet while it looks eye-catching in trailers, the final playable collage ultimately feels less auteur-led and closer to a child mashing together all the disparate contents of their toybox.Romeo Is a Dead Man is certainly not predictable. It’s capable of getting a baffled smile out of you, and its anti-gaming-establishment attitude will have diehard fans searching for an irony-drenched reason to celebrate it. But where No More Heroes’ simplistic yarn kept the fights flowing and the jokes rolling, Romeo Is a Dead Man’s sprawl feels disappointingly directionless. Instead of coming together as a kitschy universe-spanning epic, this sci-fi story is sadly told with all the mastery of a rambling drunk in Wetherspoons.Romeo Is a Dead Man is out 11 Feb; $49.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5XboxPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a dense, rich set that invites rewatching to take in every thoughtful, exuberant detail – even though it’s barely 14 minutes long.Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show review – a thrilling ode to Boricua joyRead moreMy most beloved part occurs a little more than nine minutes into the homage, when thecuatro puertorriqueñoappears. The stringed instrument has its own moment in the spotlight, shown in the talented hands of thecuatristaJosé Eduardo Santana just before Ricky Martin performs.I spent months last year reporting an episode of the podcastLa Bregaabout our champion instrument and why it inspires such pride in Puerto Ricans. Yet seeing the cuatro have its moment at the Super Bowl was not on my bingo card for this lifetime. The cuatro’s presence in that arena invites deeper questions: what does it mean that a colony has a national instrument? Could it mean that Puerto Rico is actually a country?For Bad Bunny, who proudly advocates for Puerto Rico’s independence and flies a light blue Puerto Rican flag associated with that stance, there is no doubt that the answer is yes.Puerto Ricois anAmericancountry in the broadest sense of that weighted word: it is part of a bigger family, one that doesn’t revolve around the US.It’s clear that Bad Bunny has been thinking of Puerto Rico’s place in the Americas for some time, and of what realAmericancitizenship means. There’s a clue in his defiant bangerLa Mudanza, the last track on his album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, when he name-checks the Puerto Rican educator and intellectualEugenio Maria de Hostos.Hostos died in the Dominican Republic in 1903, and famously said he’d want to be buried in an independent Puerto Rico. When the day comes for Hostos’ remains to be finally put to rest in a free Puerto Rico,Bad Bunny, named Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, tells us in La Mudanza that he wants one of his songs to be playing. And it’ll be the sky blue Puerto Rican flag that adorns Hostos’ coffin.Hostos was known as “El Gran Ciudadano de las Américas” – the great citizen of the Americas – who dreamed of unity for the Antilles and for the Americas. Benito didn’t perform La Mudanza on Sunday night, but I couldn’t help but think of Hostos as I watched Bad Bunny say “God Bless América” before listing the countries of this hemisphere – his hemisphere – and leading a parade of flags that included the US on equal footing with its neighbors. He strode through a football game, the most “American” of pastimes, and challenged the very meaning of the word.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny holds the Puerto Rican flag of independence while performing at the NFL Super Bowl LX half-time show.Photograph: Chris Torres/EPAFor many of us who carry Puerto Rico in our hearts, there are certain words that are impossible to swallow. When we read a description of Puerto Rico as a “territory” or “commonwealth”, we know that the speaker is uncomfortable with the reality that Puerto Rico is a colony and that the US is a colonizer. “Mainland” is another giveaway. Main to whom, exactly? The word telegraphs that the United States is the epicenter of the speaker’s world, and Puerto Rico is some faraway place studied through a telescope.The term “American” is perhaps the worst of these. It applies to every country in the hemisphere, and yet one nation, the US, has long claimed a monopoly on its use. Perhaps you’ve heard a common refrain: that Puerto Ricans deserve dignity and respect because,as US citizens, they are “Our Fellow Americans”.That was more or less the liberal response (“He’s Puerto Rican, that’s part of America!”) when rightwing critics objected that Bad Bunny isn’t “an American artist” and didn’t deserve the glory of the Super Bowl half-time show. It’s OK, they seemed to say, because Puerto Rico is a US colony, and US colonial subjects can hang out at the Super Bowl.I admit that it can feel tedious to push back on the arrogance of using “American” only to describe the US. Who wants to be the wet blanket in a US newsroom who reminds everyone that America is an entire hemisphere?But on Sunday night, Bad Bunny did it with joy. He invited the US to a party where it wasn’t the center of the universe – and showed the empire that’s OK. It can even be fun.Alana Casanova-Burgess is a New York-based journalist and host ofLa Brega, a bilingual podcast about the Puerto Rican experience.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyPuerto RicoUS politicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXcommentShareReuse this content"

The governor – who hasconfirmed he’s mullinga 2028 run – plans to defeat Trumpism by imitating Trump. His amusing copycat antics have generated media attention, boosted his poll numbers and earned him the label of Democratic “frontrunner”. But the termed-out governor has a reality check in the mail, since his presidential ambitions will soon bring scrutiny of his record. Unfortunately for Newsom, his eight-year tenure as governor offers a buffet of failed hopes and broken promises. The politician who recently blasted world leaders’ responses to Trump as “pathetic” has a talent for talking big but falling short.Newsom ran for governor in 2018 as an unabashed progressive, bristling with liberal righteousness, under a campaign slogan of “courage for a change”. This seemed like a jab at his predecessor, Governor Jerry Brown, the elder statesman who focused on stabilizing California’s budget after years of massive deficits.To prove his grit – and to win support from the powerful California nurses’ union – Newsom said he would seek to create a single-payer public healthcare system in the state. When a critic assailed this as a “pipe dream”, Newsom chided their lack of vision.“I’m tired of politicians saying they support single-payer but that it’s too soon, too expensive or someone else’s problem,”he said.Then, as governor, hedumpedhis signature campaign pledge, opting for lesser reforms.“This is a flip-flop,” said one union organizer ofNewsom’s betrayal. “This is absolutely unacceptable.”Unfazed, Newsom moved on to other bold visions.In 2019, he promised to build 3.5 million new units of housing by 2025. Three years later, he backed away from that idea, too, dismissing it as a mere “stretch goal”. “Just 13% of the 3.5 million homes he campaigned on building have been permitted, let alone built,”reported CalMattersin 2022.Newsom also pledged to appoint a “homeless czar” to address California’s surging homelessness. That promise also fell through the cracks. Frustrated by reporter questions, Newsom eventually declared himself the homeless czar. Then, as homeless numbers spiked, he pivoted to blaming local officials.Newsom spent unprecedented amounts of money on these issues – thanks to multibillion-dollar surpluses he inherited from his fiscally disciplined predecessor. But when it came to delivering on his key proposals, Newsom flopped. Making matters worse, the California legislative analyst’s office says he’ll leave the state with looming multibillion-dollardeficits.Newsom says Americans want strength, but his wishy-washy ways are legendary in Sacramento.As a staunch opponent of the death penalty, Newsom declared amoratoriumon capital punishment in 2019. Yet he stopped short of commuting death sentences to life imprisonment, meaning the next governor can resume executions.During the early days of Covid in 2020, Newsom drew praise for his decisive action to halt the spread. Then, afterElon Muskreopened his California Tesla factory in violation of public health rules and rightwingers began protesting against lockdowns, Newsom caved. He rushed toreopen the stateand push responsibility down to county officials. Infections and deaths surged.After the police killing of George Floyd, Newsom embraced the idea ofreparationsfor descendants of slavery. He created a Reparations Task Force to propose legislation, earning him national headlines. In 2025, with racial justice out of style, Newsomvetoedmany of the taskforce’s most significant bills to provide tangible reparations.“Mr Newsom may have less political motivation than he did before as he weighs the possibility of running for president in 2028,” reported theNew York Times. “A majority of Americans oppose taxpayer-funded reparations, and the nation as a whole is more conservative than California.”Politicians shapeshift frequently, but it takes gall for the Golden state’s squishy governor to criticize other leaders as pathetic. In fact, Newsom pioneered the art of placating Trump –praisinghis botched Covid response in 2020 even though Trump had called the pandemic a “hoax” that would “disappear”.“He said everything that I could have hoped for,” Newsom said in March 2020, after talking with the president. “Every single thing he said, they followed through.”“Newsom has repeatedly said he has no criticisms for Trump’s coronavirus response,” reported theSacramento Bee. “Yet his state is still waiting on needed equipment from the federal government to run tests and prepare its medical system for a surge in new patients – equipment the Democratic governor says he’s been requesting for weeks.”In Newsom’s defense, Trump had warned governors to be “appreciative” if they wanted federal help. So,Governor Knee Padspuckered up.“Governor Newsom has been very generous in his words, and I’m being generous to him, too,” Trump said.Newsom’s Trump-loving phase was among the lowest points of his career. He understands exactly why many world leaders now hesitate to provoke Trump’s wrath. But while he disparages others as cowards, his own courage remains quite selective.For example, Newsom is largely silent about the California tech oligarchs backing Trump’s regime.In 2024, hesidedwith many Silicon Valley venture capitalists and tech companies tovetoan expansive AI safety bill. He signed a narrower version in 2025, but critics say he’s avoiding tough questions about how AI will kill jobs and harm workers.“This is a ‘which side are you on’ moment,” said the AFL-CIO president, Liz Schuler, at apress conferenceon 4 February where labor leaders from swing states threatened to complicate Newsom’s presidential run unless he stops siding with his “big tech billionaire friends” over workers.Tellingly, Newsom currently finds himself aligned withPeter Thiel– a Trump backer andmajor donorto Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign – in an effort to kill a union-backedbillionaire taxthat would help offset Trump’s healthcare cuts. Newsom mocks others for kowtowing, but he regularly bows down to the powerful California interests bankrolling the very authoritarianism from which he claims he can save the nation.This glaring hypocrisy fits with Newsom’s embrace of Trumpian tactics, but even his overwrought trolling shtick is a symptom of weakness. Desperate to cover up his liberal California past, he hosts rightwing figures like Steve Bannon and Ben Shapiro on his podcast, berates world leaders for the cameras, and pushes the cynical idea that Americans’ only choice is between glib loudmouths in different colored ties.Like Trump, Newsom breaks promises, serves billionaire interests and mistakes social media theatrics for leadership. Is that really what American voters will want in 2028? After Richard Nixon, Americans chose Jimmy Carter. After George W Bush, they chose Barack Obama. After Trump, they’ll likely want change – authentic, strong, moral leadership, a leader with competenceandvision.Having watched Newsom for two decades, I don’t see why anyone thinks he’s it. He’s not even “strong and wrong” – just highly ambitious, strategically dishonest and blatantly opportunistic.Gil Durán is a California journalist and author of the forthcoming bookThe Nerd Reich: Silicon Valley Fascism and the War On Democracy.

Still, the marriage of big tech and politics demands we take a standTue 10 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 11.17 ESTShareOn a recent trip to the San Francisco Bay Area, I was shocked by the billboards that lined the freeway outside of the airport. “The singularity is here,” proclaimed one. “Humanity had a good run,” said another. It seemed like every other sign along the road was plastered with claims from tech firms making outrageous claims about artificial intelligence. The ads, of course, were rife with hype and ragebait. But the claims they contain aren’t occurring in a vacuum. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, recentlysaid: “We basically have built AGI, or very close to it,” before confusingly qualifying his statement as “spiritual”. Elon Musk has gone even further,claiming: “We have entered the singularity.”Most people aren’t fretting about an AI bubble. What they fear is mass layoffs | Steven GreenhouseRead moreEnter Moltbook, the social media site built for AI agents. A place where bots can talk to other bots, in other words. A spate of doom-laden news articles and op-eds followed its launch. The authors fretted about the fact that the bots were talking about religion, claiming to have secretly spent their human builders’ money, and even plotting the overthrow of humanity. Many pieces contained suggestions eerily like those on the billboards in San Francisco: that machines are now not only as smart as humans (a theory known as artificial general intelligence) but that they are moving beyond us (a sci-fi concept known as the singularity).Based upon my years of research on bots, AI and computational propaganda, I can tell you two things with near certainty. First, Moltbook is nothing new. Humans have built bots that can talk to one another – and to humans – for decades. They’ve been designed to make outlandish,even frightening, claims throughout this time. Second, the singularity is not here. Nor is AGI. According tomost researchers, neither is remotely close. AI’s advancement is limited by a number ofvery tangible factors: mathematics, data access and business costs among them. Claims that AGI or the singularity have arrived are not grounded in empirical research or science.But as tech companies breathlessly promote their AI capabilities another thing is also clear: big tech is now far from being the countervailing force it was during the first Trump administration. Theoverblownclaims emanating from Silicon Valley about AI have become intertwined with the nationalism of the US government as the two work together in a bid to “win” the AI race. Meanwhile,ICE is paying Palantir $30mto provideAI-enabled softwarethat may be used for government surveillance. Musk and other tech executives continue to championfar-right causes. Google and Apple alsoremoved apps people were using to track ICEfrom their digital storefronts after political pressure.Even if we don’t yet have to worry about the singularity, we do need to fight back against this marriage of convenience caused by big tech’s quest for higher valuations and Washington’s desire for control. When tech and politicians are in lockstep, constituents will need to use their power to decide what will happen with AI.Many people understandably believe that socially beneficial technology regulation is not possible in the current political climate. Luckily, governmental and corporate policy are not the only way to combat the challenges and uncertainties presented by AI. The recent protests in Minneapolis have reminded us about the power we have as a collective, even one loosely organized. Minnesotans’ display of strength has caused theTrump administrationand the corporations supporting it to retreat. In the past, public pressure has caused big tech to make changes related to users’ privacy, safety and wellbeing.The recent protests, and subsequent retreat by powerful organizations, demonstrate that the powerful run things at the sufferance of the people. This is true about politicians and it’s also true about business leaders. AI is not a runaway force in the hands of those at the top, but, as two Princeton scientists put it, a “normal technology”. Its effects upon the world will be decided by people. We have the capacity to allow its impact to accelerate, but we also have the ability tocontrol and regulateits use. As the Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei,recently argued, AIcanandshouldbe governed. The risk AI poses to society, not least in perpetuating growing inequality and informational slop, are real but manageable challenges.This is not to say that AI – particularly generative AI and large language models (LLMs) – are not already changing how we communicate and even how we conduct other aspects of daily life. Yet Moltbook, and the AI agents that populate it, are not a demonstration of scientific benchmarks of intelligence. A reporter who recently “infiltrated” the bots-only platform found as much,describingit as “a crude rehashing of sci-fi fantasies”. Others have noted similar mundanities about the site – that many of its posts actually seem to come from humans and, more importantly, that the bot-generated posts are simply “channeling human culture and stories”. They spout nonsense about religion and bogusly herald the age of superintelligent machines because that’s how humans often talk about robots and digital technology.These so-called “agents” don’t have agency in the way people do, and they aren’t intelligent in the way people are. In fact, they are mostly reflections of people. Like the social bots that came before them, they are encoded with human ideas and biases because they are trained on human data and designed by human engineers. Many of them also operate via mundane automation, not actual AI (a term that continues to berigorously disputed and debatedby scientists).People have managed changes spurred by new technologies many times before, and we can do it again. Again, Anthropic’s Amodei presents analternative viewto many of his cohorts: AI governance must be focused and informed. It does not have to be antithetical to reasonable technical progress or democratic rights. We must demand that AI be effectively governed and we must do so soon. AI is causing change and politicians are creating chaos, but the power to decide the future still lies in the hands of humans.Samuel Woolley is the author ofManufacturing Consensus: Understanding Propaganda in the Era of Automation and Anonymityand co-author ofBots.

Let’s jog some memoriesGeorge MonbiotYes, he betrayed the national interest in his dealings with Jeffrey Epstein – but also in his sanctioned role as enabler of corporate powerTue 10 Feb 2026 13.07 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 13.13 ESTShareHistory is being rewritten. The story we are told is that an evil man called Peter Mandelson, pursuing his own interests,went rogueto collaborate with a serial abuser of girls and women, undermining the good work of people seeking to defend the public interest. All this is true. But – and I fear many will find this hard to accept – it is only half the story.The much harder truth is that Mandelson’s disgraceful dealings with Jeffrey Epstein were less a betrayal of his brief than an unauthorised extension of it. In 2009 – just as, we now know, Mandelson was passing sensitive information to Epstein – I argued that thegovernment department he ran, called Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Berr), “functions as a fifth column within government, working for corporations to undermine democracy and the public interest”.Berr was a smaller and less chaotic version of Elon Musk’s“department of government efficiency”(Doge). Its purpose, I suggested, was to bypass the House of Commons on behalf of capital. It allowed Gordon Brown’s government to create the impression that it was defending the public interest while simultaneously, but more quietly, appeasing powerful lobbyists. In contrast to other government departments, Berr was largely run by unelected lords, who had either been corporate executives, corporate lobbyists or, like Mandelson, members of a concierge class operating on their behalf. I wrote that these ministers, appointed by Brown, “appear to have formedtheir own lobby group within government”.Berr sought topart-privatise Royal Mail, breaking a manifesto commitment. It succeeded. It tried to block theEU working time directive: UK government filibusters delayed and weakened it. It attempted, less successfully, to undermine theequality bill, whose aim was to ensure equal pay for women (Mandelson’s simultaneous dealings with Epstein were not the only respect in which he showed disdain for women’s rights). It undermined environmental legislation. It was “quietly building a bonfireof the measures that protect us from predatory corporate behaviour”.So when Brown, who was prime minister at the time, expresses his shock and betrayal, please forgive me a small gasp of frustration. In his interview on theBBC’s Today programme, Brown claimed that in 2009: “We were solving a major financial crisis … all my thoughts were on how we could save people’s jobs and savings and their livelihoods.” But not only did he allow Mandelson to attack the public interest on behalf of business, he greatly increased Berr’s budget. This was despite the fact that, as I noted at the time, Mandelson “was partly responsible, both in Blair’s government and as European trade commissioner, for promoting the culture of deregulation that catalysed the economic crisis”. On one hand, Brown was trying to solve it. On the other, at the behest of corporate lobbyists, he was setting up the next one.Brown also told the BBC, in justifying his appointment of Lord Mandelson, that the man had “an unblemished record as the [European] trade commissioner”. An unblemished record of what, exactly? Neocolonialism, perhaps. While Mandelson was in that post, he sought to imposedraconian trade provisionson some of the poorest countries on Earth. He put pressure on them to let EU corporations muscle out local firms and make privatisation legally irreversible, threatening people’s access to health, education and water. He sought toforce African countriesto hand over crucial resources at the risk of widespread hunger.Yes, when Mandelson was a minister in Brown’s government, he betrayed the national interest. But this is what, by other means, he was appointed to do. His treachery, while it went way beyond his official mandate, was not a bug, but a feature. The corrosion of democratic values was institutional. And this spirit has prevailed ever since. Keir Starmer’sgovernment of all the lobbyistsis no exception.Brown, inproposing remediesfor the secretive machinations Mandelson conducted, writes: “Conventions about commercial confidentiality should no longer prevent public service contracts delivered by private companies being subject to reasonable freedom of information requests.” I could scarcely breathe when I read that. It is exactlythe demand some of us madewhen Brown rolled out theprivate finance initiative (PFI)across the public sector, enabling businesses to get their hooks into every aspect of state provisioning. When we tried to see the contracts, to understand what was being done in our name, Brown’s Treasury repeatedly blocked our information requests on the grounds of “commercial confidentiality”.The sense of betrayal that Brown quite rightly feels is the same sense of betrayal some of us felt towards the governments in which he served. Yes, Brown had and retains some great qualities, anddid much good. But he is also a remarkable escapologist. Almost everyone appears to have forgotten how his PFI programme planted atimebomb in public services, enabling corporations to take the profits while leaving the risks with the state: one of the reasons why they arenow in so much trouble. Almost everyone appears to have forgotten his crucial role in the Iraq war: standing with Tony Blair andfinancing it. He rightly called for Vladimir Putin and his “enablers” toface justice for their crime of aggressionin Ukraine. Yet it’s the same crime that Blair and his enablers (including one G Brown) committedin Iraq.But it is not just Brown who is rewriting history. The media are 50% of any problem, and the story most of it loves to tell is of one bad apple. Heaven forfend that we see the systemic problems. There is a reason why Mandelson kept returning to government, despite sackings for his over-enthusiastic relationships with plutocrats. He was brought in to do the dirty work. The governments in which he served could loudly claim to be doing something, while subtly and simultaneously undoing it.Mandelson’s treachery is an extreme instance of the dominant mode of UK politics over the past 45 years: the subordination of democracy to thedemands of the ultra-rich. Abuse and exploitation – of women and children, of poorer countries and their people, of workers and contractors, renters and customers – are baked into the system.If you cannot diagnose a problem, you cannot fix it. We urgently need to see this for what it is. Mandelson’s grovelling to the sinister rich is disgraceful, disgusting, deceitful, a crushing of women’s rights and of democracy. But it is not a deviation from the system. It is a manifestation of it.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why isn’t Britain?Pippa NeillIn Lancashire, I met people living with dangerous levels of Pfas, including in their food. The government is failing themTue 10 Feb 2026 10.32 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 10.49 ESTShareLast week, on the morning the government published itsPfas action plan, I got a worried phone call from a woman called Sam who lives next door to a chemical factory in Lancashire. Sam had just been hand-delivered a letter from her local councilinforming herthat after testing, it had been confirmed that her ducks’ eggs, reared in her garden in Thornton-Cleveleys, near Blackpool, are contaminated with Pfas.Pfas – per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment – are a family of thousands of chemicals, and I have been reporting on them for years. Some, including those found in the eggs Sam and her family have been eating, have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses,including certain cancers.The levels recorded in one of the eggs was so high that if Sam ate just one a week, it would exceed the European safe weekly level for Pfas exposure 10 times over. Thisthresholdsets out the maximum level of Pfas that can be consumed weekly over a lifetime without risking adverse health effects. Sam and her children have been eating these eggs every single day for decades.This is what living on the frontline of regulatory failure looks like.Sam stopped eating the eggs about a year ago, when the local council started investigating the factory at the end of her garden due to concerns around thehistoric airborne emissionsof PFOA, a banned and carcinogenic type of Pfas chemical. But before this, Sam believed she was making healthy choices, growing her own vegetables and rearing her own ducks, aiming to teach her children where their food comes from.View image in fullscreen‘Sam has now stopped eating her eggs, but has the damage to her health already been done?’Photograph: Kilian O’Sullivan, ENDS ReportShe told me over the phone that she now feels terrified to go into her own garden. The following day, she messaged to say she had been unable to sleep. “Are these chemicals in my blood?” she said.On the one hand, it’s great to see that the government has finally published its plan for Pfas. It has been a long time coming. On the other, this plan fails to lay out any concrete steps that the government will take today to help people like Sam. It is a plan to make a plan, a promise to act – when parliamentary time allows, subject to consultation, and as thegovernment itself says, taken in collaboration with the chemical industry. All the while, Sam, and who knows how many others across the country, are still at risk of potential exposure to toxic chemicals.The factory on the edge of Sam’s garden is still allowed torelease large amountsof a new Pfas chemical into the environment, despite evidence that this chemical could cause damage to a person’s sexual function, fertility or their child’s development. This chemical was not mentioned once in the plan.After years of reporting on industrial Pfas pollution, I know only too well that Sam is not the only person living with the real-world impact of this chemical pollution. In aninvestigationfor the ENDS Report and the Guardian in 2024, I revealed that the small Yorkshire town of Bentham is polluted with what was described by experts as the highest level of Pfas pollution ever recorded in the UK. How many more communities are going to learn that their homes and public spaces are contaminated with toxic chemicals before the government finally does something?Since Brexit, the UK’s regulation of Pfas has fallen woefully behind the EU’s. The bloc is drawing up plans for ablanket banon all Pfas. The UK, meanwhile, is looking to group and then restrict certain chemicals – an approach described as being akin to “Whac-A-Mole”. Why? Because when you ban one chemical, the industry can simply tweak the formulation slightly to produce a new variant that, while slightly different, may pose identical or perhaps even worse health risks.Speaking at aparliamentary inquiryon Pfas last week, the lead chemical expert at the Health and Safety Executivedescribedthe UK’s reason for not matching the EU’s safeguards with a direct copy as being philosophical in nature. “There is a slightly different way of thinking in the UK [compared with the EU] in terms of philosophy,” he said. The difference was that rather than a blanket ban, the UK would choose what to ban a “a bit more slowly or gradually in a prioritised way”.Environmentalists decry ‘crushingly disappointing’ Pfas action plan for UKRead moreI haven’t asked Sam, but I’m not sure that she and the other people in her position have time for a slow, gradual approach from government when weighing up the potential risks to their health – and that of their families. They just want to be safe, and to live without fear.What the government’s new plan does do is pledge to undertake more research. While no one could deny that more research is needed, this seems to be coming at the expense of acting on what we do already know. For example, we already know,without doubt,that a number of these chemicals are toxic, that they are persistent, and that they are everywhere. The Environment Agency hasitself estimatedthat there could be as many as 10,000 Pfas hotspots across England. Until these chemicals are banned at the point of production, that number is not going to get smaller.Back inLancashire, Sam has now stopped eating her eggs, but has the damage to her health already been done? These are the questions she is left to grapple with alone, while the government pledges to take action – once it has spoken with the chemical industry.Pippa Neill is an environmental journalist and the news editor at ENDS ReportExplore more on these topicsPfasOpinionChemical industryEuropean UnionEnvironment AgencyLancashireEnglandPollutioncommentShareReuse this content"

My hand reaches for her pulse in her neck, wrist or groin but I feel nothing. A nurse says the patient was just speaking, which doubles my consternation.When we see others in distress we can suffer too. How do we heal from this collective trauma? | Sara MussaRead more“No pulse, we need compressions,” she prompts.In her late-80s, the patient has end-stage kidney disease and other serious conditions. Having consistently refused dialysis, she has identified her priority as spending her remaining days at home with her husband. Wanting only to be kept comfortable in case of an emergency, here she is – unconscious – and by all appearances, comfortable.Suddenly, the room is teeming with people and a crash cart. “Wait, she doesn’t want to be resuscitated,” I exclaim.“It’s not in her notes,” says the nurse, hands primed over sternum.Apparently, the overnight junior doctor was not convinced the patient meant what she said and had left the morning team to revisit the issue, not expecting the patient to crash. To many readers, this will seem like a material overriding of autonomy but suffice to say this kind of back and forth is all too common in hospitals.I rapidly summarise the patient’s situation to the gathered crowd and miraculously manage to reach the patient’s usual specialist to confirm the patient’s long-held stance against being resuscitated.The resuscitation attempt freezes but given the rapid-fire decisions, uncertainty hangs in the air. An emergency physician wheels in a portable ultrasound and declares the patient’s heart to be barely contracting. Together, we call off the code but not before someone says, “Soyouare deciding to call off resuscitation.”“Yes,” I say, my own heart palpitating.The crowd thins, leaving a couple of nurses to attend to the patient who is still taking shallow breaths.In the corridor, a resident is quietly typing notes. A nursing student hovers. Needing to say something to someone, I ask the nurse, “Are you OK?”“Totally fine,” she says. I don’t believe it.“I feel so bad,” says my trainee.There is so much to feel bad about but I say something anodyne, making a mental note to debrief later. (Spoiler alert: it never happens.)Before moving on, I glance inside the room to ensure our dying patient is comfortable. I am shocked to find her in animated conversation with the nurse, seemingly oblivious to her near-death experience.This happy sight leaves me floored. Had I been too hasty to call time on her life? What could I have done differently? How will I explain this to her family?I’m distracted by our many other patients until I hear that she, now alert and awake, says that the next time “this” happens, she wants “everything done”.The easier thing might be to say sure, but we take the harder route of a sympathetic conversation about her goals of care. Sure enough, she reverts to her original decision to avoid futile measures.This specific sequence of events is uncommon but not unheard of. I daresay if the patient had died, it would have been a routine occurrence but the fact she survived against our expectations creates complicated feelings.In the days ahead, I feel a jumble of doubt, lament, guilt and worry. I feel wound up even though I get exercise and sleep.Somethingfeels heavy. And because I can’t name it, I don’t know how to deal with it. But worse, when I stay silent my team stays silent. Which means all of us keep going without ever discussing an event that any reasonable-thinking person might say deserves some form of reckoning. It’s only when a friend points out that this is how vicarious trauma occurs that I stop to think about this condition experienced by those who do intense emotional work over sustained periods.What’s it like when your job involves wading through others’ suffering? I was left weeping and hopelessRead moreIn healthcare, the cost is frequently borne by nurses, first responders, social workers and doctors. Vicarious trauma is bad for the provider and bad for the patient because a provider who is not whole cannot provide care that is whole.Another friend observes that one hospital invests in a skilled therapist to help professionals address issues ranging from ethical dilemmas to interpersonal conflict. They seldom engage the therapist, but when they do it’s a gamechanger for thecollectivegood.I find the idea entirely sound and sadly fanciful. Between inaugurating another building and quietly engaging a therapist, the building usually wins.To be fair, hospitals today are more interested in provider wellbeing. However, the sessions on offer are brief and of variable quality. They might suffice in a crisis but not for the kind of slow-burning things that add up to vicarious trauma. For this, providers need experts who spend time getting to know them, their colleagues and their specific environment. This kind of longitudinal investment in provider health has not been a priority but might just be part of the answer to stemming burnout.I feel bad that the intended debrief with my team didn’t happen. I just didn’t feel equipped for it. Eventually, we all moved away. But in doing so, I suspect we shifted the cost to future patients.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

After yet another day of drama, we kept hearing that the prime minister would be pressing the reset button. Not again! Starmer’s reset button is like the OK button on your TV remote – worn blank through overuse. He has pressed that thing more often than you’ve decided another 44 minutes of a crap thriller is somehow less of an effort than getting yourself to bed. Anyway, next episode in five, four, three …Fine. One more.The inciting incident for yesterday’s deranged chapter was another comms chief leaving, followed by an objectively hilarious call for Starmer’s resignation by the Scottish Labour leader,Anas Sarwar, that accidentally forced Labour’s big guns to swing publicly behind Starmer. That said, you couldn’t claim the cabinet came off as one big happy family, with a ministerbriefing darkly: “We’ve all been made to tweet.” Buck up, Cruz. Think of Sarwar as the Labour family’s Brooklyn Beckham, the latter havingnotably observedlast month that “Family ‘love’ is decided by how much you post on social media”.Anyway, having seen off Sarwar’s desiccated power move, Starmer supposedly crushed it at Monday evening’s gathering of the parliamentary Labour party. Entering the meeting room, the PM is reported to have got a standing ovation that lasted 37 seconds. But don’t set too much store by a standing ovation. At the Cannes film festival, you can get double that even for a documentary claiming that every single Cannes film festival attender is a necrophiliac bestialist. A fired-up Starmer apparentlytold his parliamentary colleagues: “I have won every fight I’ve ever been in.” The prime minister is now seeking a match-up with either Jake Paul or Tommy Fury.He can butch it up all he likes, but the Peter Mandelson revelations have exposed Starmer as an alleged fallen nice guy and dubious ally to women. He’s kind of the Justin Baldoni of Westminster. Who’s the Blake Livelyin all this? I desperately want to quit this analogy but find it impossible when Wes Streeting keeps claiming that he is being covertly briefed against by Starmer’s team. If these dark arts start to impact unit sales of Wes’s affordablehaircare lineit may be time to go nuclear.In fact, maybe that was what was already happening late yesterday afternoon, when Streeting went full drama, claiming Downing Street wasbriefing against him, thenreleasing his own messageswith Mandelson. Do people now leak their own messages? It’s so hard to keep up with the sheer naffness of our politics, particularly given Streeting’s other sighting was during a media appearance wherehe explainedpeople needed to “give Keir the chance [to turn it around]”.Elsewhere, it emerged that Angela Rayner is doing all she can to getHMRC to hurry upand conclude its review of her tax affairs – so maddening when one has to spend more than five seconds in the political wilderness. We also learned that a partly constructed website claiming to launch Rayner’s leadership campaign, created by the same company that does her official parliamentary website,briefly went livein January before being instantly pulled. A Rayner ally described it as a “false flag” operation. So, like Operation Himmler, but a website. Any other news? Oh yes, anothercabinet secretaryis on the way out – the third in eight years for a job that used to be all about stability.When he took office, Starmer stood outside No 10promising“to restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives”. Yet his government has trodden on people like the Serengeti wildebeest migration – a million cock-ups and U-turns stampeding over a squashed Britain for 19 months, with absolutely no sign of let-up. Even the attempts to defend his record sound like satire. Yesterday, allies sent round a rallying note explaining that thegovernment was delivering“on many areas of incremental change”. The trouble is it delivers like Evri. Your incremental change has been left in a safe place. Notyoursafe place, obviously, but somewhere you may never find.Arguably, the most intriguing line of defence yesterday came from two cabinet ministers, Shabana Mahmood and Bridget Phillipson. “Labour governments don’t come along often,” said Mahmood. After a day like yesterday, I can’t imagine why. Phillipson went onto wibble: “Change is hard. Government isn’t easy.” Really? Many will be able to live without the pronouncements of the cabinet sounding like tactical self-care posts from an influencer who promoted a dodgy meme coin and is now on a sober-curious journey. No idea where we’ll get to by the end of the week at this rate. The chancellor explaining that “it’s OK not to feel OK”? Anas Sarwar declaring “I’ve had to teach myself to hold myself in the moment”?Public faith in politics is now in the gutter. Here’s how Labour should drag it out | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThat said, it wasn’t a massively edifying day for the news media, much of which could probably do with stepping away from the news as a wellness exercise. A mad world it may be, yet Chris Mason seemed somewhat overexcited by the idea that his audience wanted to see him as the White Rabbit. Next time you see the BBC’s political editor on screen, imagine every report he presents being prefaced with the words: “Oh my paws and whiskers!” It works better that way.As for the many branches of what could happen next, Theresa May showed us that governing as a wounded meme was possible for at least two years, while some of the suggestions should a sudden replacement for Starmer be required are genuinely insane. Take the people suggesting that enough MPs could probably rally round John Healey as a unity candidate. Sorry, but what? And, indeed, who? At the last measure (Q4 2025), a mere 36% of the public said theyrecognised John Healey. I hate to break it to Labour’s delulu-is-the-solulu power brokers, but after this rolling horror show, assuming the British people would be totally cool with some guy the vast majority of them have literally never heard of being anointed their prime minister may be a piss-take too far.The fact is the UK is on its sixth prime minister in 10 years, and at least teetering near breaking the glass on a seventh. We’ve had more CEOs in a decade than a failing 00s telecoms firm. We’rebasically Yahoo. Or maybe it’s worse. Maybe we’re one of those countries that even the neocons refused to invade because there was no figure that any meaningful number of the local populace would coalesce around. It’s all very last-days-of-the-frying-pan. As for Labour’s next destination?

It’s the type of argument you would expect to hear in the context of the “culture war”; but is it what you would expect to hear from French culture warriors? From a country thatuses language quotasto maintain its musicians on broadcast media, has fought to promote its language abroad and has always seen itself as a place that radiates art outwards? After all, this is a country that put on an opera for the 2024 Olympic closing ceremony.Enter Sébastien Chenu, vice-president of Marine Le Pen’s far-rightNational Rally(RN). Chenu advanced the box-office success argument as a reason for his party’s proposal to eliminate, Doge-style, France’s National Cinema Centre (CNC) – the public body that subsidises almost every nook and cranny of the country’s heavy-hitting film industry. Let the market take over? Quality as a derivative of quantity? If the RN is perfectly happy to surrender Audiard for Avengers 18 (or whatever), why not apply the logic elsewhere as well?Out would gosubsidies to artisanal boulangeriesand in with McDo (which, after all, can boast “billions and billions served”). Why bother stipulating a certainpercentage of French musicon the radio when American labels can easily take over? And, while we’re at it, why not recuperatethe fundinggoing to all the Institut Français centresaround the world that promote the French language in the face of the numerical superiority of English?Let’s be clear, the arts and culture subsidies at hand are relatively small – but have outsize impact. The CNC’s €850m in annual subsidies to French cinema amount to about €12.50 per person – or roughly one movie ticket a year for each of France’s 67 million citizens. For that,France– the birthplace of cinema itself – continues to boast one of the world’s most vibrant independent film industries.Of course, it’s not really the savings that Chenu and the RN are after. It’s that they think they’re fighting a culture war against “lewokisme”supposedly imported from the US; against public media and arts establishments that produce “leftist” output.Chenu’s reasoning clarifies that if the RN took power, it would launch the biggest attack on French global soft power since the US right’s forlorn attempt in 2003 to make “freedom fries” a thing over the war in Iraq. The irony should be clear to anyone that a party that has spent decades dripping France-first poison into public conversation should attack the funding that has done more than anything else to protect France from a “great replacement” of its culture by an onslaught of things backed by US money.Though the party’s official manifesto is relatively vague on culture, the flurry of far-right activity when it comes to the arts and media is blazing and neon. Party figures polemicised the funeral in December ofBrigitte Bardot, a convicted racist, who was open in her support of Le Pen and the RN’s “vision of France”. That vision now involves a project to reshape French culture around a sclerotic, imagined view of a country as myth, rather than a society that is fervently alive.The RN has,in the past, proposed eliminating funding for contemporary art, targetedmodern danceand, most recently (in a move whose tragicomedy cloaks its underlying cruelty), an RN deputy proposed a budget amendment tostrip fundingfrom an avant-garde music festival named Trans Musicales because he thought it was a showcase for transgender musicians. In place of all that, the far right and its ultra-wealthy allies propose mainly to focus efforts on protecting France’s “patrimoine” or heritage – that is, chateaux, monuments and other buildings – while weaving togetherpolitical project and entertainmentwhen it comes to history with medievaltheme parkssuch as Puy du Fou.I want to be fair to the RN for a minute: France’s built heritage is stunning, and no expense should be spared to preserve it. Contemporary art? I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t rolled my eyes from time to time at work displayed atPalais de Tokyo. And I’vewritten beforeabout the importance of regional traditionsand festivals.But the RN’s approach to preserving heritage puts history on a pedestal that simultaneously denigrates the present. That is not the foundation for a culture that radiates, it’s an attempt to turn culture into an ideological vehicle that, in the end, preserves France in amber.There is nothing wrong with increasing funding to protect France’s existing heritage – as the Louvre’s recent woes show, it is often necessary. The problem is that the RN wants to use the weight of the state (or its absence) to shape what art ends up being created.The party plans toprivatiseFrance’s public broadcasters. At a time when the billionaire media tycoonVincent Bolloréhas consolidated a business empire in the style of Rupert Murdoch, this would leave everything from journalism to pop-cultural production more dependent than ever on Bolloré-backedrightwing media.Ifmunicipalitiesalready under the control of the party are any guide,the far right would undermine if not destroy the next generation of French art and culture, just as the equivalent of “anti-woke warriors” in previous eras tried to prevent the creation and dissemination of some of the major works now associated with “la vieille France” that the far right purports to defend.Pablo Picasso? Kept under police surveillance on suspicion ofbeing an anarchistand denied French nationality in 1940. Edouard Manet? Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe was considered scandalous and obscene, barred from the official Paris art salon of 1863 andrelegatedto the “rejects’ hall”.Spanish jamón is the best ham in the world – but culture warriors are reviving its dark history | Abbas AsariaRead moreIn 1930, Luis Buñuel’s L’Âge d’Or was banned for 51 years after far-right activists rioted and stormed a theatre where it was being shown. (Buñuel would eventually win a Palme d’Or for Viridiana at Cannes in 1961.) Jean-Luc Godard’s 1960 film Le Petit Soldatwas bannedfor three years by the French authorities over its depiction of the Algerian War.It is in the DNA of authoritarians everywhere to try to co-optart and cultureto their own ends.Donald Trump is suing the BBC and hasslapped his nameon the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.But art that is interested in glorifying theleitkultur, in promoting existing power, is not often art that is remembered. Art that endures is frequently art that unsettles. Just glance at the works the Nazis featured in a 1937 exhibition meant to prompt public disgust over “degenerate art” (and which weredisplayed again, for quite obviously different reasons, by Paris’s Picasso museum last year): they included Chagall, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Klee.If the RN takes power, it will deal a savage financial blow to France’s performers and painters, theatres and museums. But a word of comfort to the artists they would target. If history is a guide, the works they produce despite far-right censorship will one day be venerated, and the politicians who tried to stamp them out will be the stuff of a future France’s disdain.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist.

I say Britain shouldNathan Law is a politician and activist from Hong KongTue 10 Feb 2026 05.39 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 09.14 ESTShareWaking up on Monday morning to the news of the pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai’s20-year prison sentencefor national security offences felt surreal. I could have easily been in his position if I hadn’tfled Hong Kongright before the implementation of the notorious national security law (NSL), under which Lai has faced the harshest penalty ever given. In fact, Laichose to stayand stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong in the face of an uncertain and repressive future. Now his family fears that he will die in prison.A mix of emotions filled my mind. I was immensely disgusted by the audacity and malevolence of such punishment. This sentence has a transparently political end, but theHong Kongand Chinese governments make no bones about it. Their sole purpose is to silence critics, and they have succeeded: civil society and domestic media, which should be the watchdogs of individual rights and government overreach, are dead silent on criticising the trial.The so-called neutral institutions no longer hold that status. Carefully handpicked NSL judges in the Hong Kong judiciary claim in their verdict that Lai has “rabid hatred” and “deep resentment” toward the Chinese Communist party (CCP), even though he repeated that he embraces the People’s Republic of China as a country. The court also accused Apple Daily, the newspaper that Lai founded and that was critical of the CCP’s human rights records, of “poisoning the minds of his readers” and spreading “venomous assertions”. These emotionally charged terms are rare in court documents; theverdict readsmore like a political statement than a legal one.7:19Jimmy Lai: will Hong Kong media tycoon die in jail? | The LatestThe chief executive of Hong Kong, John Lee, celebrated theeffective life sentencingand described Lai’s crimes as “heinous” and “utterly despicable”. Many branches of the civil servants union united toglorify the verdictas though it were a victory for Hong Kong against foreign intervention. There is no counter-voice in the legislature, as thelatest election overhaulhas eliminated the possibility of opposition in the council; the lastpro-democracy partydisbanded last year, leaving no Hong Kong-based political group to express concern over the judgment.The one-sided celebration of Lai’s sentencing in Hong Kong reflects the importance of what he was fighting for: the right to express oneself and the right to conscience. The pervasive political violence against the people of Hong Kong has resulted in hundreds being jailed and has silenced millions. Political consciousness is dangerous in today’s Hong Kong; you can becharged with seditioneven for creating children’s books that are metaphorically critical of the regime.Jimmy Lai: will Hong Kong media tycoon die in jail? – The LatestRead moreI feel immensely lucky that I can wake up in a place of my choosing and write freely. I still live with restrictions and intimidation: I face an active arrest warrant from Hong Kong, I have been disinvited from events due to fears of Beijing’s reprisal, I have beendenied entryto some countries (despite holding a legal visa), and I have beenspied onby the Hong Kong government. But these hurdles are trivial compared with the suffering of friends still in Hong Kong, who have served years behind bars.The situation reflects the consequences of allowing an emboldened authoritarian regime to expand its influence globally. What happens when bad actors are unpunished or even welcomed? They tend to act more aggressively. And why wouldn’t they? If the rights of the persecuted inChinaare seen as secondary, or even trivial, and leaders of democratic countries prioritise “repairing relationships” to navigate between major powers, then why should the CCP feel compelled to change its actions?It appears we have entered an era where discussions about values and rights have become cheap and obsolete. Power is seen as transactional, and international politics has devolved into pure “realpolitik”. It is compelling for the UK to follow suit, but I believe we can do better. I still believe that one of Britain’s strengths lies in its foundation of liberalism and democratic values. These principles set it apart from countries such as China and are embodied by individuals such as Lai.Given Lai’sdeteriorating health, time is running out for action. In the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984, the Chinese government was obliged to uphold the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The UK can safeguard this agreement by placing the argument for Lai’s release at the heart of UK-China relations and elevating his case to a matter of national importance. It is the strongest way for Britain to show its leadership in promoting freedom and democratic values on the world stage.Nathan Law is a politician and activist from Hong Kong, and was leader of Demosistō from 2016 to 2018Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiOpinionHong KongChinaAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder it’s now the top GCSE language choiceTue 10 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 11.32 ESTShare“Now, Gary, repeat after me:Quiero una margarita, por favor,”my Spanish tutor instructs. I cringe at the butchered Spanglish myestuary accentproduces. LikeDel Boy Trotterordering a cocktail: “Key – yeah – row oon margari’a, pour far four.”It’s 2023, I’m 41, living in Argentina and battling the frustration and disempowerment of learning a new language at this age, longing for my elastic 11-year-old brain over this husked-out mush. I’m also wishing, for the umpteenth time, that I was taught Spanish instead of French at school.Not to throw shade on French: it’sa beautiful language, and I studied it until my first year at university. I even worked in Nice for three summers. But Spanish would have really set me up for life – and that is even more true for today’s students. Yet we are still teaching far more of our youngest students French than Spanish. It’s outdated. Partly, it’s a simple numbers game. Spanish is the world’ssecond-most-spoken first language– 484 million speakers. French is 22nd, with just 74 million native speakers. Spanish wipes the floor with French for overall speakers, too.Logically, we should teach French to half as many students of compulsory schooling age as we do Spanish, which would come close to matching the proportion of speakers of each worldwide. We are nowhere near those numbers yet – meaning we are failing to best prepare our students for modern-world realities.The numbers alone, though, haven’t persuaded all of those responsible for the education system in Britain to change the curriculum at anything more than a glacial pace. As of 2025,French was offered in about 70% of England’s primary schools, with Spanish in just 26%, with a similar though less pronouncedgap in Wales. French is themost offeredlanguage at key stage 3in England and Wales, and inScotland at level S1 and S2, covering ages 11-14. It is also dominant at GCSE level in England: last year,90% of schools offered French to GCSE, while 76% offered Spanish; in Wales, meanwhile, the split is 79% to 54%. Scotland offers French and Spanishabout equallyto that age group.The interesting trend is what students are choosing. In August last year, Spanishbecame the most popular languageGCSE in England for the first time, with more than 136,000 entries. French was still just behind with just under 133,000 entries. In Scotland, Spanish passed French for the same age group in 2024. It suggests pupils are ahead of education professionals with their thinking. It’s a trend we should rapidly accelerate. Imagine how much higher that Spanish entry rate could have been if at least an equal number of schools offered Spanish as French.Prominent language-learning experts agree that the younger you begin, the better. A developmental psychology lecturer, Dr Eleonore Smalle, recentlytoldthe UN that learning a new language becomes harder from about age 12. Before then, children learn language unconsciously: through passive exposure without awareness of what they are learning, but it sticks.We should tell young people the pros and cons to learning each, and be frank with them about the utility of Spanish. It goes beyond the numbers. In terms of employability, cultural cachet and future exciting post-Brexit travel opportunities as potential “digital nomads”, Spanish will serve Britain’s students better than French.If someone had told me that by learning Spanish early I could remote-work my way across Latin America and learn to salsa withguapomen in nightclubs, I would have had an exciting incentive. Although I worked as a freelance journalist in Argentina, then Medellín in Colombia for a few years, I constantly struggled with my embarrassing Spanglish.While British students notoriously groan at foreign language learning, the increasing confidence of Latino culture might persuade them. In Medellín, the sounds of locals Karol G and Maluma echo across its hillycomunas. On Sunday, Bad Bunnybecame the first Spanish-language artist to headlinethe Super Bowl half-time show. Hispanic music more broadly is having a moment, evidenced by the popularity of today’s boldest creative artist,Rosalía. Learning Spanish has never been cooler.Does a bit of booze really make us better at languages? – podcastRead moreBy still mostly defaulting to French, schools cling to a past that prizes France’s proximity and erstwhile nobility. Of course, it isn’t either/or. There are still solid reasons to speak French; it is (along with English) the language of the Olympics and the UN, and, most importantly, Céline Dion’s mother tongue.But working-class families such as mine holiday in Benidorm or Lanzarote, not in luxurious Cannes or Monaco, or on the expensive boulevards of Paris. We are more likely to become holiday reps in Magaluf than ski instructors in the Alps. Emerging digital nomad hubs are in Spanish-speaking affordable cities such as Medellín or buzzy ones such as Buenos Aires.Modern foreign-language uptake hasdeclined in recent years; it’s crucial our students are offered the chance to study, and the information they need to choose their language wisely if they are to become global citizens.Two years after nervously ordering that margarita in Spanglish, I can now ask to peruse a wine list (malbec, malbec or malbec?) in almost-correct Spanish.

In the last three years, for example, that has led me to both consistently defend our police and to consistently stand up for the right to protest.Many community members however will understandably immediately form a view, take sides and inevitably emphasise the wrongdoing by the side they don’t politically favour.I must confess that what I saw last night, as I proudly protested along with hundreds of Labor party members, looked like instances of excessive force by police as well as some assaults on police.This is not an attempt at finding a “sensible centre”, nor an effort to achieve some kind of political compromise.2:00Pepper spray and questionable police tactics: how a Sydney protest ended in chaos – videoWe need to move beyond a false dichotomy between totally amazing and perfect police and horrible dangerous protesters, or the opposite.There were a lot of people there, strong differences of opinion over a most incendiary state visit and a conflict between the law, police operational decisions and the desire of some protesters to march to state parliament. Conflict was almost inevitable. I don’t say that being wise in retrospect; I actually predicted it in parliament last year.The most important question for me now is the legal framework and the reality that it placed police and protesters in this situation of almost inevitable conflict.At the moment inSydney, under the public assembly restriction declaration continuously extended by the police commissioner, there is no independent arbiter to decide what protest routes will be lawful. The police decide if a protest route in the area of the declaration can proceed.View image in fullscreenPeople gather at Town Hall in the Sydney CBD to protest Isaac Herzog's visit to Australia.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianThe 1978 Mardi Gras riot has many similarities to the Town Hall riot. A large group of protesters wanted to take a particular march route and police disagreed. The result was violence, arrests and huge social concern. I note a stigmatised minority was involved in that protest and prejudice played a big role. Last night we saw a protest involving several minorities, but also a protest movement that has been thoroughly demonised.After the excesses of 1978, lessons were learned and the parliament engaged in serious law reform; removing ultimately from police the role of being the arbiter of street protest and granting that power to our independent courts. Another important change related to the disapplication of police “move on powers” from lawful protests.Since those reforms as a community, we seem to have unlearned those lessons. We have adopted a view that it can legitimately be the role of the state to suppress mass protests. We have done so despite the obvious potential for violence.Contentious legislative reform can of course relate closely to the political ebb and flow of the community. A pernicious injection into the public debate occurred after the Bondi atrocity: the appalling suggestion that the attack was caused by lawful and peaceful protest. That has driven many of the subsequent developments. I was heartened to see the shadow attorney general, Damien Tudehope, recently reject this link.

Britain’s muted response to a media mogul’s harsh sentence suggests a narrowing view of what confrontation is worthTue 10 Feb 2026 13.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 18.41 ESTShareIf thesentencehanded to the media mogul Jimmy Lai was meant to surprise, it would have been shorter. Twenty years behind bars is not a burst of rage. It is a sentence designed to make repression routine in Hong Kong. The 78-year-old founder of the shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily is now likely to die in prison after being convicted of sedition. The court was telling Hongkongers what kind of place they now live in, and signalling to foreign governments what kind of relationship Beijing expects them to accept.China’s national security law, imposed on Hong Kong in 2020, was designed to dismantle the former British colony’s pro-democracy movement and to place freedom of expression under permanent political constraint by the Chinese Communist party. From 2020 to 2026, at least385 individualshave been arrested and 175 convicted under national security-related offences.The day after Mr Lai’s verdict, China released a securitywhite paperon Hong Kong. The timing was no coincidence. It described the national security law as a “legal shield” that had restored order. The message was that Hong Kong cannot be a special case within China: its courts, legislature and civil service are instruments of Beijing’s security apparatus. Mr Lai’s sentence, the heaviest yet imposed under China’s national security law, drew international criticism. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk,calledfor his release, warning that the verdict violated international law, criminalised journalism and relied on conduct that predated the legislation under which he was prosecuted.Hong Kong’s chief executive said the security laws target “hostile” foreign intervention. Britain stopped short of contesting that framing. Ministers haveexpressedconcern, called on China to honour the Sino-British Joint Declaration and said the government had raised the case privately. Their appeal for his release rests on humanitarian grounds, not on the unsoundness of the conviction.Brussels’responsewas tougher than London’s, even though Britain is the former imperial power and Mr Lai is a British citizen. That reluctance is often justified as realism: China is simply too important to confront. But realism cuts both ways. Beijing reads restraint as a signal of limits. The point of cases like Mr Lai’s is not only to punish an individual, but todemonstratethat guarantees – even “legally binding” ones – are no constraint.Britain sees itself as a defender of a rules-based order. But it is also, regrettably, saying that those rules will not be enforced where the costs appear too high. The continued presence of some British judges in Hong Kong’s top court was once defended as a safeguard of judicial independence. They ought to leave as the role now risks legitimising Beijing’spersecutionof democracy activists.Australia’s experience offers a contrast. When a high profile China-born Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, was detained for three years on national security charges, Canberra treated herdetentionas political, and campaigned despite the risk of retaliation. Australia clearly said that there were costs to be weighed on both sides. The reporter waseventuallyfreed. Britain could take a tougher stance. That would not guarantee Mr Lai’s release. Nor would it require Britain to abandon engagement with China. But if a British citizen can be ruled unlawfully imprisoned and the response stops at private appeals for mercy, a line has been drawn – and others will notice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now the Japanese artist’s ‘wild, fascinating’ life has inspired an operaMichael DownesTue 10 Feb 2026 11.05 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 15.50 ESTShareOpera has inspired many of the 20th century’s greatest artists to create extraordinary sets. Oskar Kokoschka designed a Magic Flute for Salzburg and a Ballo in maschera for Florence. Salvador Dalí produced a controversial Salome for London; David Hockney’s designs for Glyndebourne’s Rake’s Progress complement Stravinsky’s sound-world so miraculously that they are still in use 50 years after their creation. Marc Chagall’s ceiling fresco for Paris’s Opéra Garnier and murals for the New York Met testify to the intimate connection between opera and painting.And yet remarkably few operas portray visual artists. Something about their painstaking work seems to resist representation in this most extravagant of artforms. Only two operas about artists are regularly performed: Hindemith’s Mathis der Maler, depicting the German Renaissance painter Matthias Grünewald, and Berlioz’s Benvenuto Cellini– and Cellini gave Berlioz a head-start with his rollicking memoirs about his scandalous adventures in 16th-century Florence.He constantly reinvented himself, using at least 30 different namesBy taking a piece of art as subject matter, then, Scottish Opera’s The Great Wave enters largely uncharted territory. The print that gives the new production its name is one of the most familiar images of the past 200 years, even if relatively few of those who encounter it on fridge magnets or phone cases realise exactly where it comes from or know much about the life of the artist who created it.Katsushika Hokusai was born in 1760 in Edo, now known as Tokyo, then the world’s largest city with over a million inhabitants. He lived to 88 at a time when only a handful of Japanese each year passed 60. His life was eventful: he survived being struck by lightning, a stroke that forced him to relearn how to draw, and a fire that destroyed his studio. His output was prolific and diverse – his 30,000 or so surviving works include paintings, sketches and the illustrations that fill Hokusai Manga, a drawing manual for students, as well as woodblock prints – and he constantly reinvented himself, using at least 30 names. He was a gifted self-publicist, attracting huge crowds by painting a gigantic portrait in a public square, but often in financial difficulty.View image in fullscreenThe boats seem to move …  Under the Wave off Kanagawa, as the work was originally titled.Photograph: Universal Art Archive/AlamyUnder the Wave off Kanagawa – his most celebrated work’s original title – was one of his Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, a series of woodblock prints produced around 1831, which was so successful that Hokusai later added another 10. It is an unforgettable image: although our attention naturally focuses on the cascading foam and menacing undertow of the wave, so vividly depicted that the boats that ride it seem to move as we look, the image’s still centre is Mount Fuji itself, regarded in Hokusai’s time as a deity.Just as Hokusai’s sequence of prints viewed the mountain from various viewpoints, many unexpected, the opera’s five acts approach the artist himself from different angles, arranged in a sequence that’s anything but chronological – the opera begins with Hokusai’s funeral. As librettist Harry Ross explains, the decision to tell Hokusai’s story in a non-linear way was taken in solidarity with the worldview of Hokusai and the culture of which he was part: “We’re teleological in the west – this is very much an eastern thing.”The thread that runs through the libretto, drawing together scenes otherwise highly diverse in setting, character and dramaturgy, is Hokusai’s relationship with his daughter, Ōi, also a significant artist. It is Ōi that we see at the start, supervising her father’s burial, and Ōi with whom he is conversing at the end, as the pair resolve to continue artistic exploration together.Ōi had married another artist, but divorced him, as Ross recounts with evident admiration: “He wasn’t a very good artist, and she wasn’t going to run a business with someone who wasn’t going to succeed.” Instead she returned to her father’s studio. Ross and composer Dai Fujikura are fascinated by these decisions, very unusual for the time, and by the two artists’ bond. “Ōi is an extraordinary character – we don’t know much about her but we know enough,” Ross says. “The relationship between father and daughter was very special,” Fujikura notes. “We both have daughters, so it was very easy to tap into that.”View image in fullscreenFather-daughter dynamic … Daisuke Ohyama as Hokusai and Julieth Lozano Rolong as Ōi.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicFujikura grew up in Japan, but until he visited the British Museum’s Hokusai exhibition in 2017, all he knew about the artist was that he had produced The Great Wave. It was Fujikura’s wife, after they read more about him in the exhibition catalogue, who suggested the artist as a subject for an opera and he was intrigued – “I’d never written an opera set in Japan.”“It is a wild ride, a fascinating life,” Fujikura says with relish. He began to share ideas with Ross, a close collaborator since the 1990s when they met as students at Trinity College of Music. Together they devised a scenario drawing on an unpublished English translation of the first Hokusai biography, written by Iijima Kyoshin in 1893.Much of their work on the scenario was done during the Covid lockdown, a situation uncannily mirroring the closed nature of Japanese society in Hokusai’s lifetime. During theEdo period, the Tokugawa military government who ruled Japan imposed a policy ofsakoku, literally “locked country”. Between the early 17th century and the mid-19th, international trade was all-but forbidden, and Japan was closed to almost all foreign visitors.Indeed, the only non-Japanese character in The Great Wave is the German botanist and traveller Dr Philipp Franz von Siebold, played by a countertenor – the “falsetto” voice aptly reflecting how strange Siebold’s western face would have seemed to most Japanese of the time. Siebold brings a large sack of Prussian Blue pigment (a rare commodity in Japan at the time) in payment for some of Hokusai’s prints: an acquisition that delights Hokusai, since it enables him to realise the vibrant colours he has imagined for his Mount Fuji series.View image in fullscreen‘He’s quite contemporary’ … composer Dai Fujikura and librettist Harry Ross.Photograph: Julie HowdenFujikura relished the opportunity the scene offered to represent Hokusai’s new colour in music: “People are seeing an object they’ve never seen before, something very special – it’s like the moment in Pulp Fiction where they open the attache case and we don’t know what it is.” He found a combination of timbres to represent Hokusai’s blue: “Natural harmonic trills blended with artificial harmonics and a shimmering vibraphone played with soft mallets.”Fujikura’s early musical training as pianist and composer in Osaka, not untypically, was entirely in western styles; traditional Japanese instruments formed no part of his musical upbringing: “Even my parents never heard them live.” It was only in the early 2000s, at a festival in Darmstadt, that he first encountered these instruments, and had to learn about them as a western composer would: “They have such a long history, they make Bach look like a baby.” He has now composed about 40 works for Japanese instruments, including concertos forshō(a bamboo mouth organ),koto(a long, plucked zither),shamisen(a three-stringed lute) andshakuhachi.It was the last of these – a traditional Japanese flute which makes a softer and breathier sound than the western version – that Fujikura has included in The Great Wave. “I wanted to transport listeners into another realm.” Fujikura explains that the noise of the player’s breath is part of the performance, and that he has encouraged the player – Shozan Hasegawa, who has travelled from Japan to perform – to improvise in traditional style around the notated pitches.Theshakuhachiis heard in the opera’s opening bars, and reappears at the end, where the director Satoshi Miyagi features the instrument on stage: he interprets its sound as the voice of Hokusai, resonating in his daughter’s mind. What comes between uses only traditional western instruments, but deployed with a colourfulness and immediacy that reflects Fujikura’s initial ambitions to compose for film. “I can express everything with my music: the orchestra is my palette.”The production has been a remarkable example of cross-cultural collaboration: there was financial support from Japanese government agencies (plans are well under way for the production to transfer in 2027 to Tokyo and Kyoto) and in Glasgow, Miyagi is joined by a team of Japanese designers and choreographers from the Kajimoto company. Although the set and costumes do not attempt to recreate Hokusai’s Japan – “by not specifying the cultural background or the time period, it allows the piece to be universal,” Miyagi explains – the Japanese influence is clear. How to feature The Great Wave itself was a particular challenge for scenographer Junpei Kiz: “It is such an iconic piece. There is going to be anticipation of how it will be presented.” His intriguing solution was to introduce it in monochrome before revealing the full colour spectrum.It is clear, however, that for Ross and Fujikura, as for Miyagi, Hokusai’s story is one whose message is universal. Ross finds cause for optimism for today’s artists in the resourcefulness and capacity for reinvention that Hokusai showed throughout his career. “He’s quite contemporary – we have this notion of the Romantic artist who’s always struggling, but in the 21st century we’re more like Hokusai – we must change to stay the same.” Fujikura agrees: “He shows such strong energy, just to be an artist, a better artist. Nonstop creativity – that’s something I absolutely love about this person.”The Great Wave is atTheatre Royal Glasgow, on 12 and 14 February and Festival Theatre, Edinburgh 19 and 21 February.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaScottish OperafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The so-called “concrete monstrosities” of the Hayward Gallery, Purcell Room, Queen Elizabeth Hall and its skatepark undercroft have finally been Grade II-listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Traditionalists may be spitting feathers, but as football pundits are apt to assert: “It was the right result.”Campaigners welcome ‘long overdue’ listing of brutalist Southbank CentreRead moreHowever, it turned out to be a very long and very tetchy game. Constructed between 1949 and 1968 in an uncompromisingly brutalist style, theSouthbank Centrewas once voted Britain’s ugliest building. Since 1991, the Twentieth Century Society (C20), champions of all things modern, and Historic England had recommended listing on six separate occasions, yet their advice was rejected by successive secretaries of state. Until now. The decision brings to an end an unprecedented 35-year-long impasse, one of the longest-running battles in British architectural heritage.The brutalist era produced some of the boldest, architecture in Britain, constructed on a scale unlikely to be repeated“The lack of listing had become a complete anomaly,” said Catherine Croft, C20’s director. “The Southbank Centre is admired as one of the best brutalist buildings in the world, so this decision is obviously very well deserved and long overdue. The arts complex is a highly sophisticated sculptural masterpiece, with enormous richness of form and detail inside and out. The experience it gives concert-goers and gallery visitors is unlike any other venue in the country, its virtuoso spaces still unrivalled.”View image in fullscreenThe Upper Ground of the South Bank, circa the opening of the National Theatre in 1967.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesIronically for the spitting feathers traditionalists, the origins and present form of the Southbank Centre can be traced back to Winston Churchill, whose Conservative government spitefully swept away most of the oldFestival of Britainsite, except for the Royal Festival Hall. This scorched earth policy paved the way for new development along the Thames, in the style of the day.EnterNorman Engleback, who helmed London County Council’s youthful architectural team charged with designing the Southbank Centre. Eschewing the more milquetoast, Scandinavian-style modernism of the neighbouring Royal Festival Hall, Engleback and his gang opted instead for a full-ondroogs’ paradiseof board-marked concrete walls, walkways, staircases and rooftop terraces, punctuated by concrete air conditioning ducts and pyramidal glazing.As an architectural movement, brutalism has oscillated wildly in public affection and critical standing. But the wheel turns, and since the 2010s it has been rediscovered by a new generation of admirers, drawn not only to its aesthetic qualities but also to what it represented in terms of progressive social reconstruction in the postwar era. The listing of the Southbank Centre is merely the long overdue cherry on the concrete cake.View image in fullscreenQueen Elizabeth Hall.Photograph: John Maclean, View/AlamyYet the saga was not without its bizarre twists and turns. The abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986 led to the creation of the South Bank Board, which sought to generate more income from the site, and the reviled “concrete monstrosities” were an obvious target for redevelopment. The next four decades saw numerous putative salvoes, from cosmetic tweaks to outright demolition.A 1989 proposal by postmodernist imperatorTerry Farrellwould have wrapped the buildings in a po-mo shell, but was abandoned in 1993. The Wave, a £70m Richard Rogers scheme from 1994, would have involved a curved glass roof enclosing the buildings and outdoor spaces, like a giant and somewhat preposterous conservatory. Criticised for its lack of practicality and exorbitant cost, it was axed after failing to receive National Lottery funding. A 1999 masterplan for the entirety of the South Bank by Rick Mather was touted by some as “the perfect antidote to the centre’s drab squalor”, but again remained unexecuted.In 2013, Feilden Clegg Bradley put forward theFestival Wing, a £120m proposal featuring a 60-metre-long glazed pavilion looming over the Hayward Gallery and commercial spaces housed in shipping containers. Vigorously opposed by C20, this plan was also dropped, largely due to the protests of the skateboarders who frequent the undercroft of the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and whose “Long Live the Southbank” campaign attracted more than 80,000 supporters and the backing of the London Mayor.View image in fullscreenBoard meeting … the skates who gather in the undercroft below the Queen Elizabeth Hall campaigned to save it from demolition.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFollowing a £16.7m grant from Arts Council England, Feilden Clegg Bradley instead went on to lead an exemplary conservation and restoration programme for the Hayward Gallery, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room in 2018.The brutalist era produced some of the boldest, most uncompromising architecture in Britain, constructed on a scale unlikely to be repeated. Paradoxically, a style that was once seen as ugly, aggressive and alienating now features as sanitised decoration on plates, mugs, tea towels and a host of other merch. Yet as the Southbank Centre amply demonstrates, brutalism’s real power lies in its buildings: things of supreme heft, surprising beauty and audacious ambition.“The battle has been won and brutalism has finally come of age,” said Croft. “This is a victory over those who derided so-called ‘concrete monstrosities’ and shows a mature recognition of a style where Britain led the way.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureSouthbank CentreHeritagecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a dense, rich set that invites rewatching to take in every thoughtful, exuberant detail – even though it’s barely 14 minutes long.Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show review – a thrilling ode to Boricua joyRead moreMy most beloved part occurs a little more than nine minutes into the homage, when thecuatro puertorriqueñoappears. The stringed instrument has its own moment in the spotlight, shown in the talented hands of thecuatristaJosé Eduardo Santana just before Ricky Martin performs.I spent months last year reporting an episode of the podcastLa Bregaabout our champion instrument and why it inspires such pride in Puerto Ricans. Yet seeing the cuatro have its moment at the Super Bowl was not on my bingo card for this lifetime. The cuatro’s presence in that arena invites deeper questions: what does it mean that a colony has a national instrument? Could it mean that Puerto Rico is actually a country?For Bad Bunny, who proudly advocates for Puerto Rico’s independence and flies a light blue Puerto Rican flag associated with that stance, there is no doubt that the answer is yes.Puerto Ricois anAmericancountry in the broadest sense of that weighted word: it is part of a bigger family, one that doesn’t revolve around the US.It’s clear that Bad Bunny has been thinking of Puerto Rico’s place in the Americas for some time, and of what realAmericancitizenship means. There’s a clue in his defiant bangerLa Mudanza, the last track on his album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, when he name-checks the Puerto Rican educator and intellectualEugenio Maria de Hostos.Hostos died in the Dominican Republic in 1903, and famously said he’d want to be buried in an independent Puerto Rico. When the day comes for Hostos’ remains to be finally put to rest in a free Puerto Rico,Bad Bunny, named Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, tells us in La Mudanza that he wants one of his songs to be playing. And it’ll be the sky blue Puerto Rican flag that adorns Hostos’ coffin.Hostos was known as “El Gran Ciudadano de las Américas” – the great citizen of the Americas – who dreamed of unity for the Antilles and for the Americas. Benito didn’t perform La Mudanza on Sunday night, but I couldn’t help but think of Hostos as I watched Bad Bunny say “God Bless América” before listing the countries of this hemisphere – his hemisphere – and leading a parade of flags that included the US on equal footing with its neighbors. He strode through a football game, the most “American” of pastimes, and challenged the very meaning of the word.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny holds the Puerto Rican flag of independence while performing at the NFL Super Bowl LX half-time show.Photograph: Chris Torres/EPAFor many of us who carry Puerto Rico in our hearts, there are certain words that are impossible to swallow. When we read a description of Puerto Rico as a “territory” or “commonwealth”, we know that the speaker is uncomfortable with the reality that Puerto Rico is a colony and that the US is a colonizer. “Mainland” is another giveaway. Main to whom, exactly? The word telegraphs that the United States is the epicenter of the speaker’s world, and Puerto Rico is some faraway place studied through a telescope.The term “American” is perhaps the worst of these. It applies to every country in the hemisphere, and yet one nation, the US, has long claimed a monopoly on its use. Perhaps you’ve heard a common refrain: that Puerto Ricans deserve dignity and respect because,as US citizens, they are “Our Fellow Americans”.That was more or less the liberal response (“He’s Puerto Rican, that’s part of America!”) when rightwing critics objected that Bad Bunny isn’t “an American artist” and didn’t deserve the glory of the Super Bowl half-time show. It’s OK, they seemed to say, because Puerto Rico is a US colony, and US colonial subjects can hang out at the Super Bowl.I admit that it can feel tedious to push back on the arrogance of using “American” only to describe the US. Who wants to be the wet blanket in a US newsroom who reminds everyone that America is an entire hemisphere?But on Sunday night, Bad Bunny did it with joy. He invited the US to a party where it wasn’t the center of the universe – and showed the empire that’s OK. It can even be fun.Alana Casanova-Burgess is a New York-based journalist and host ofLa Brega, a bilingual podcast about the Puerto Rican experience.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyPuerto RicoUS politicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXcommentShareReuse this content"

His teachings were for life as well as the stagePhilippe Gaulier, clown guru and mentor to theatre and comedy greats, dies aged 82Tue 10 Feb 2026 08.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 16.59 ESTShareWhen I was starting out as a theatre-maker, back in the last millennium, there were three ways (or so we thought) you could educate yourself in the trade. If you wanted to be taken seriously and say a lot of words, drama school in the UK was your bag. If you wanted to make theatre with your body, École Jacques Lecoq in Paris beckoned. And if you wanted to perform with your whole heart, shared innocence and transcendent idiocy, you went to ÉcolePhilippe Gaulier. That’s what my pal Alex Murdoch did, and she returned with a suite of his teachings (about clowning and so much more than clowning) that the two of us made theatre with for the next 17 years.Few knew back then, although the process was already under way, that Gaulier –who has died aged 82– would go on to become a bigger name in comedy than in theatre training. This was much to the great man’s disgust. “I hate standup comedy,”he growled at mewhen I interviewed him a decade ago. “I would never teach something so horrible.” And nor did he. But he did teach skills – of playfulness and alertness to a crowd; of being vividly alive in the moment; of celebrating your own ridiculousness – that made standups, sketch comics and clowns much better at their jobs. In his later years, “Gaulier-trained” became a must-have imprimatur for scores of comic acts, particularly those wishing to join in the thrilling boom in innovative clown-comedy that has lit up the circuit in recent times.View image in fullscreenPhilippe Gaulier and Bridget Brandon (director of Drama Action Centre) in 1988.Photograph: Fairfax Media Archives/Getty ImagesThe list of his students and acolytes is long and illustrious, and includes Sacha Baron Cohen (who called him “the funniest man I have ever met”), Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Roberto Benigni. And more recently, the granddaddy of nu-clown, Phil Burgers, alongside smash-hit acts such asJulia Masli,Damian Warren-Smith(of West End hitGarry Starr: Classic Penguins) and Britain’s Got Talent champViggo Venn.Gaulier and his philosophies have had an immeasurably joyful impact on that area of comedy that overlaps with theatre, resulting in a generation of comics who are not just wannabe TV presenters or panel show talking heads in waiting, but who make their work out on a limb, in open dialogue with whomever is in the audience on the night, brimming with (often delinquent) pleasure just to be on stage.Like most great pedagogies, Gaulier’s was an instruction for life as well as for performances. And in his, pleasure and lack of self-seriousness were key. We are all ridiculous. Gaulier taught his students to stop hiding it – to delight in it, in fact, because the specific ways in which we’re ridiculous may be precisely what might make us unique and engaging on stage (and off?). And to have a whole audience looking at you and hanging on your every word? How lucky you are! Don’t squander it, and don’t dare – the worst form of ingratitude, this – be tedious or predictable. Should they ever be, his ex-students would find themselves for years afterwards haunted by a croaky French-accented voice in their heads. “This ees boring. Eet ees so shit!”None of which is to say that Gaulier-trained skills don’t lend themselves to serious theatre, too: his graduates include Kathryn Hunter, Rachel Weisz and the Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush. But even a dramatic actor can bring to their performance – as the best do – a sense of privilege and pleasure that what they’re doing, really, is just playing at being someone else. Gaulier certainly never forgot that it was all, life as well as theatre, a big game – and for teaching so many to play it a little bit more joyfully, he will be long and warmly remembered.Brian Logan is the Guardian’s comedy critic and the artistic director ofA Play, a Pie and a PintExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)TheatreComedy (Culture)ClownsPhilippe GauliercommentShareReuse this content"

He is framing The Fall Off as a graceful bowing out – “to do on my last what I was unable to do on my first”, he has said – and it’s almost as if he is a student coming to the end of a long period of study, with this double album as his graduate thesis.Across 24 tracks and 101 minutes, The Fall Off is full of technical proficiency, raw lyrical skill, citation, interpolation and sampling, and it attempts nothing less than to embody a half-century of hip-hop. Through direct and indirect references, lessons unfold throughout. The Fall-Off Is Inevitable is inspired by Nas’s 2001 Stillmatic track Rewind. I Love Her Again is an obvious nod to Common’s I Used to Love HER. Bunce Road Blues borrows lyrics from Usher’s Nice & Slow but connects to R&B’s present with guest vocals from Nigerian singer Tems. The Let Out is reminiscent of SpottieOttieDopaliscious from OutKast’s Aquemini, and so forth: all ample material for audiences to think through hip-hop’s past and future.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover of The Fall Off.Photograph: Interscope RecordsBut not every fan wants to study, and those who do are left with questions. The Fall Off seems like an attempt to convey Cole’s growth and development but it’s lacking in the emotional depth that comes from real human interactions: he is the only fully realised person on this album, and the people he engages with, both metaphorical and real, seem to function more as props.On Legacy, he confesses his earlier callow attitude towards women – “I need a Yelp for hoes / I need to read reviews” – but by the time we get to Life Sentence, a nod to DMX’s How’s It Going Down, those impulses are tamed by his marriage to long-term partner Melissa Heholt: “Found out who I want to be / Slowly, but surely he cut off his hoes / If you gone do it, do it right / Put ring on your finger, now me and you is doing life.” She gives birth to his two sons, making him a thankful husband and father, but for a four-verse song billed as the “realest one” in his discography, his wife is sketched lightly, a strangely faceless presence.Like many tracks here, it’s pure autobiography, and while any autobiography is fascinating to fans, they don’t always illuminate broader truths. On Safety, Cole keeps the lens squarely on him even as he broadens the cast list, rapping from the perspective of people who have messages from home for this now-famous star (it might immediately bring to mind Nas’s One Love, or perhaps the most famous epistolary rap song, Eminem’s Stan). But again, despite the letter-writing device, it feels like these thoughts are merely J Cole’s.He is stronger when examining hip-hop itself, and at times the album reminds me of Ralph Ellison’s 1952 novel Invisible Man. In the book’s famous Battle Royal scene, the naive narrator believes he’s been invited to give a speech. When he arrives, he’s blindfolded at the door and forced into a brutal competition, fighting against other young Black men for the entertainment of the drinking and cheering crowd. Relatedly, the public rap battle between Kendrick Lamar and Drake – which briefly involved Cole before he apologised and bowed out, to the consternation of many – had fans wondering if Cole would have more to say about the feud on The Fall Off. He addresses it obliquely on What If by citing hip-hop history, channelling the Notorious BIG and 2Pac to form a conversation that might have prevented two of the genre’s most famous tragedies. It’s another device that may seem a bit heavy-handed, but Cole understands that violence and death are cash crops in the current attention economy, and that the stakes remain high.Like Ellison writing the fight scene in Invisible Man, Cole uses The Fall Off to write about new takes on old practices in the US: the fickleness of fans, the intoxicating allure of the limelight and the spectacle of Black male combat are all addressed. Toward the end of Bombs in the Ville/Hit the Gas, present-day J Cole offers sage advice to his younger self: “Fame is a drug you was chosen to take / Unfortunately, can’t be sober and great / You’re just like a flower the world wanna hold / They sniff on your petals until you get old / And then they dispose, a new flower grows / Can’t take it personal, that’s just how it go.”A$AP Rocky: Don’t Be Dumb review – a charismatic, playful return, but it’s no slam dunkRead moreFellow students of hip-hop will notice the drum track sounds like Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99) by Cole’s former mentor, Jay-Z, and Jay-Z’s former mentor, Jaz-O. For better or worse, The Fall Off is J Cole, the student, fully transitioning into J Cole, the teacher. If he’s truly finished recording music, then perhaps this album will stand not as his thesis, but his instruction manual to others: a masterful, deeply knowledgeable but rather brittle read.Explore more on these topicsRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Long since converted into shops and then flats, it had a magnetic appeal to a generation of 1990s clubbers whose desire for dancefloor escape justified their queuing for an hour (excepting those who had finessed the art of snogging their way to the front).The Coach and Horses is still up the road, though, as is a town centre that revels in a hedonistic spirit more commonly associated with Magaluf. It is, as Danielle Phillips’s lively play has it, “Yorkshire’s very own Vegas”.The reason for that lies in the town’s proximity to a score of mining villages.Doncasteris where working-class revellers have traditionally gravitated – and continue to do so long after Margaret Thatcher’s assault on the coal industry robbed the area of its economic heart.This is a seam that runs just beneath the surface of Children of the Night which, inspired by interviews with Karisma regulars, is both a celebration of teenage exuberance and a reflection on the social forces shaping popular culture. Writing in a spirited urban poetry – and performing with a brassy confidence – Phillips takes us to a 1997 when the Tories have been kicked out, Robbie Williams has released his first solo LP and the UK has won Eurovision withLove Shine a Light.Guidelines review – teens try to escape the aftermath of a murder filmed on a phoneRead moreThings can only get better and, as two best friends, Lindsay and Jen, make their debut at Karisma (Phillips joined by an equally fizzy Charlotte Brown), the force of DJ Don’s bass heightens the pleasures of dance, drink and debauchery. Darkening the mood in the years to come are acluster of HIV casesand Lindsay’s kindly father (Gareth Radcliffe) suffering cerebral hypoxia, a consequence of his time down the mines.The pacy staging by Kimberley Sykes for Mad Friday Productions is at its zingiest at the start, when references to Mothercare corner and Biscuit Billy’s score laughs of recognition from the home crowd.

Over the years, many critics and fans have celebrated Michel Gondry’s film as a tender-hearted love story. But a rewatch might reveal that Gondry’s second collaboration with postmodern American screenwriterCharlie Kaufmanis much closer to another, twistier genre: hard sci-fi.‘Crime is a disease. Meet the cure’: Sylvester Stallone’s self-serious cop movie is ludicrous funRead moreBy now, the story of Eternal Sunshine is familiar. Depressed introvert Joel (Jim Carrey) meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), whose box-dyed hair colour and moods change as often as the weather. A mismatch made in heaven. The troubled couple eventually find a fix for their rocky, codependent relationship: a service provided by a sketchy medical company called Lacuna Inc that offers to erase their memories of each other. Clementine goes first. Out of spite, Joel follows.Early on in the film, a nervous Joel asks about the risks of brain damage before committing to the procedure. Dr Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna Inc’s founder and chief technician, says matter-of-factly: “Technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage. It’s on par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you’ll miss.”Joel’s fears are soothed, but mid-procedure, something shifts. Trapped inside his own consciousness, Joel realises he doesn’t want to lose Clementine. In an attempt to outsmart the Lacuna Inc technicians, he tries to conceal her in his oldest, deepest, most buried memories – childhood moments she was never part of. Hiding under the kitchen table from his mother. Being bullied. Moments that the technicians haven’t mapped out yet on their clunky equipment.View image in fullscreen‘Eternal Sunshine is about technology failing – from the very start.’Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarTypically, sci-fi films are about what can happen when technology works too well, and the characters can’t handle the ensuing moral and psychological consequences. Eternal Sunshine, on the other hand, is about technology failing – from the very start. Joel interferes with his own procedure. The Lacuna Inc technicians are hilariously unprofessional. The company founder is sleeping with patients. Everyone’s sloppy, human, compromised.Most sci-fi aims to demonstrate what happens when you solve the problem. Eternal Sunshine is about what happens when the problem was never solvable in the first place.The film keeps undercutting its own romantic moments with genuinely uncomfortable reality. In flashbacks, Joel calls Clementine “selfish” and “pathetic”. She’s mean to him at parties, dismissive of his interests, gets drunk and embarrassing. He’s passive-aggressive, judgmental and withdrawn. These aren’t quirky flaws – they’re the day-to-day of two incompatible people hurting each other. Their relationship is doomed from the beginning.Eternal Sunshine, then, is far from a love story – but rather a warning about how technology can’t really fix all our romantic mishaps. In 2004, the idea of erasing someone required literal brain damage. Now we have a softer, more insidious version: you can curate someone out of existence digitally. Block, unfollow, mute, delete, untag and archive entire text threads. We’ve built the infrastructure for memory erasure into our daily lives. In 2004, scrubbing someone out of our life on purpose was a thought experiment. In 2026, we’re discovering, like Joel, that erasure doesn’t actually work.View image in fullscreen‘The version of love that the film believes in isn’t about erasing or curating or controlling, but accepting the whole mess in front of us.’Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarWe may mute an ex, but their account still exists. We block their number but remember the texts. We archive photos but actually deleting feels too permanent. We’re never fully erasing, never fully remembering. We’re constantly trying to move on without fully committing.Like the existential terror of time travel narratives like Back to the Future – or even the Sundance-approved cult puzzler Primer – Eternal Sunshine unravels in gloriously non-linear fashion. Scenes interrupt each other. Time scrambles. We are immersed inside Joel’s consciousness, watching memories break apart and warp.As Clementine starts to disappear from Joel’s memories, they have conversations they could never have in linear time. In one flashback, the couple talks at a beach party, sitting far away from everyone else. “This is it, Joel. I’m going to be gone soon,” Clementine says, knowing they’re existing only briefly in a reconstructed memory. “What do we do?” Rather than scheming, Joel gives up: “Enjoy it.”That’s not romantic in the traditional sense. Because the version of love that the film believes in isn’t about erasing or curating or controlling, but accepting the whole mess in front of us and choosing it anyway, knowing exactly what we’re signing up for. This is a sci-fi film that argues for accepting our imperfect selvesagainstthe illusion of technological perfection. We try to delete. We try to refresh. But really, the best we can do is hope that things can be different this time around.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is available to rent in Australia and available to stream on Mubi in the UK and Hulu in the US.

It’s an industrial town surrounded by the Irish sea on three sides, known for its 140-year history of submarine building. The corrugated peaks of BAE Systems’ Dock Hall dominate the skyline over Barrow’s red-brick terraces, and roughly a third of working-age locals are employed in its sprawling complex. This militarised landscape is the unlikely home of Full of Noises, an experimental music and arts venue with a capacity of 40 whose first event featured krautrock legends Faust destroying an electric guitar with a pneumatic drill.View image in fullscreen‘An interesting context to be working in’ … BAE Systems’ base looming over Barrow-in-Furness.Photograph: Dan McCarthyHaving secured funding to launch a two-day festival in 2009, artistic director Glenn Boulter and four other local artists took on temporary custodianship of the crumbling canteen building on wind-lashed Barrow Island, “a building that’s part of this big military-industrial complex,” Boulter says. “It’s heavily security-controlled.” He recalls a game they would play on a nearby bridge, where they would pull their phones out as if to take photos and count the seconds until they were accosted by security. “For us, that was an interesting context to be working in.”The paradox of existing in this highly surveilled complex was that its far-flung location offered a rare kind of creative freedom: there was no established scene to satisfy. “You could do anything because no one was really bothered or looking,” says Boulter. That first festival with Faust set the tone – “big German men banging on an oil drum and setting fire to stuff” – and brought together a group of local ex-submariners to perform Kurt Schwitters’ dadaist poetry in morse code.Full of Noises kept moving around, “commissioning work, drawing on the town’s history, architecture and communities”, and 16 years later, now has a permanent home in Piel View House, a former park keeper’s lodge perched on a hill in Barrow Park. Its traditional red brick facade has been expanded with a Scandi-esque black cuboid extension, which houses an acoustically engineered space with pristine white interiors and high rectangular windows that frame the surrounding tree canopy. It has hosted stand-out names in experimental and improvised music, from LA-based Tashi Wada and Julia Holter to Marisa Anderson and Jim White. At the end of 2025, Lonnie Holley played to a room of 40 people here, having performed at London’s 1,500-capacity Roundhouse a week earlier. Beyond concerts, the venue hosts film screenings and creative workshops, and has welcomed artists-in-residence including Lee Gamble. “We’ve always enjoyed the challenge of putting on this kind of work in a place that’s fairly small and isolated,” says Boulter.View image in fullscreenLou Barnell and Amy Clark performing at Piel View House in August.Photograph: Laurence CampbellI spend two days at the venue getting to know the team during Independent Venue Week, as they prepare for a cohort of graduates from London College of Communication (LCC), who are travelling up to showcase their work.“When I was touring, I remember sleeping on astroturf in someone’s kitchen,” venue programmer Amy Stretch-Parker tells me as she cooks the meal for the night. She wants to make sure the venue feels like a “home away from home”, and cooks a communal meal for every visiting artist. “No matter who’s performing, everyone’s treated the same,” she adds. The upstairs of the venue is set for further renovation dependent on funding, which will include bedrooms for visitors and artists-in-residence.View image in fullscreenJim White and Marisa Anderson performing at Piel View House in September 2024.Photograph: Laurence CampbellThis care and programming is sustained by a unique financial model. Full of Noises holds a 25-year lease on a peppercorn rent from the local authority, who supported redevelopment over demolition. Arts Council England (ACE) funding covers the majority of their overheads, and Barrow’s recent designation as an ACE Priority Place has been transformative. “It meant being able to access money for the building and increasing our funding enough to have a proper team,” says Boulter. Additional funding from the local authority, trusts and foundations allows this arts and culture hub to host more than 60 events a year, most priced at just £5 or pay-what-you-feel. “It’s about being really open and welcoming to anyone that wants to engage with us.”‘Conga line around the car park!’ A week in the life of a British venueRead moreAt seven o’clock on this damp January evening, Full of Noises comes to life. The LCC graduates have set up an array of hardware – modular synthesisers, contact mics, even children’s toys. Around 20 people file in, order drinks from Boulter, bartender for the night, and take their seats. One performer, Sanki, captivates the audience with an illuminated tank of water and metal chains to produce sub-aquatic, mechanical distortions that vibrate the walls and feel fitting considering our surroundings.After the show, I get chatting with a local regular, who tells me to look up Caliban’s speech in The Tempest if I want to understand the venue’s name. “Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises / Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.” It’s a fitting parallel – the team behind Full of Noises having found their own enchantment in Barrow’s isolation.“As an artist, it’s just a really unusual, interesting place to be,” says Boulter. “An unlikely place where excellent art can happen.”Explore more on these topicsMusicCumbriaExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When it was completed in 1967, engineers voted Queen Elizabeth Hall “the supreme ugly” in a poll of new buildings.

This is a victory over those who derided so-called ‘concrete monstrosities’ and shows a mature recognition of a style where Britain led the way.”She also pointed out that the decision ended an anomaly of the centre being the only unlisted building in the arts complex on the south side of the Thames.View image in fullscreenThe Southbank Centre was commended for its use of ‘exposed concrete in which the building’s monumental scale is countered by the fine texture and tactility of its surface finishes, executed with exemplary technical skill’.Photograph: John Maclean/AlamyIts neighbouring buildings are deemed to be of higher architectural value. The modernist Royal Festival Hall is Grade I-listed and the National Theatre, which like the Southbank Centre is also brutalist in style, is Grade II*.Croft said: “We’re absolutely thrilled that this internationally recognised concrete masterpiece of postwar architecture has finally been accepted as part of our national heritage, some 35 years after the C20S first campaigned for the Southbank Centre to be protected.”She added: “The lack of listing had become a complete anomaly; it is admired as one of the best brutalist buildings in the world, so this decision is obviously very well-deserved and long overdue.”In 2018, the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) justified its decision to reject listing the Southbank Centre by saying its architecture was “not unique or groundbreaking”. In 2020, it made the building immune from listing in a licence thatexpired last February.The owners of the building had requested to extend this immunity for five years, but the DCMS has accepted the advice of its heritage body, Historic England, which said the Southbank Centre had “bold geometric formations clustered to sculptural effect with a correspondingly dramatic silhouette”.Its recommendation praised the building’s “use of exposed concrete in which the building’s monumental scale is countered by the fine texture and tactility of its surface finishes, executed with exemplary technical skill”.View image in fullscreenSkateboarders at the Southbank Centre skatepark.Photograph: Ed Brown/AlamyThe Southbank Centre urged ministers to fund a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme of the buildings. A spokesperson said: “The listing underlines the need for government investment in our buildings – all of which they own. The Southbank Centre has asked the government for £30m to support improvements to our infrastructure in our 75th anniversary. We look forward to working with the government to ensure these buildings are able to thrive long into the future.”Previous plans for the Southbank Centre have included wrapping it in a shell designed by the late Terry Farrell, and putting it under a glass roof in a £70m scheme by the late Richard Rogers.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureHeritageLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

But the film has been met with near universal critical disdain.Over the weekend, a spokesperson for Rotten Tomatoes defended the unusually wide gap between these reviews and those posted by audience members on their site, saying “there has been NO manipulation on the audience reviews for the Melania documentary”.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreThey added: “Reviews displayed on the Popcornmeter are VERIFIED reviews, meaning that it has been verified that users have bought a ticket to the film through Fandango.”A streaming date for the Amazon film – for which the company paid $40m (£29m), plus an additional $35m (£25m) on marketing – is anticipated to be announced soon.Explore more on these topicsFilmMelaniaBiopicsFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.”Documents recently released by the US justice department included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman, who was married at the time, and Maxwell from 2003. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal charges that she conspired with Epstein to sexually abuse teenage girls.Wasserman, who is in charge of organising the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, hasapologised for communicating with Maxwell. “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said, adding that it occurred “long before her horrific crimes came to light”.Sex and snacks, but no seat at the table: the role of women in Epstein’s sordid men’s clubRead moreRoan did not mention Epstein or the Epstein files in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure from Wasserman.The 27-year-old said she refused to “passively stand by” and that artists “deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity”.The decision to leave Wasserman “reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust”, she concluded.Wasserman has said he “never had a personal or business relationship” with Epstein but that he did take part in a “humanitarian trip” on his plane. “I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them,” he said.Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing by any of Epstein’s victims, but since the revelations he has been facing mounting pressure to remove himself from his talent agency and to step down from the Olympics organising committee.Roan, who has more than 35 million monthly listeners on Spotify, is the most high-profile artist to cut ties with Wasserman. Her announcement came after other bands it represented released statements distancing themselves from the agency.The indie rock bandWednesday saidthey were “aghast” to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and they hoped he would step down “for the sake of his staff”.The Dropkick Murphys posted on social media: “The namesake of the agency is in the Epstein files so … we GONE.”The rock band Beach Bunny said they were “hugely disappointed and disgusted” that Wasserman “had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell”.Others who shared statements about Wasserman included Best Coast’s frontwoman, Bethany Cosentino, who wrote “people in power can’t keep skating by”, and the experimental indie rock duo Water From Your Eyes, who said they had “no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman”.Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells said the duo would not leave the company, citing the financial impact it would have on the band. “Do I wish I could burn it all down, boycott and divest? Sure I do,” she wrote.Other prominent musicians represented by Wasserman include Ed Sheeran, Kendrick Lamar, Coldplay, SZA, Lorde and Tyler, the Creator.Maxwell is serving a20-year prison sentenceafter being found guilty by a jury in New York of charges including sex trafficking of a minor. She was arrested in 2020 after being accused by federal prosecutors of recruiting and grooming girls for sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.The US justice department’s release of millions of internal documents related to Epstein has revealed the late financier and sex offender’s ties to many prominent people, both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges, including soliciting an underage girl.Epstein’sdeath in 2019in a Manhattan jail cell was ruled a suicide.Explore more on these topicsChappell RoanGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

She filed lawsuits against Palmer in Massachusetts and in New York on the same day she filed the Wisconsin action.Gaiman has a home in north-western Wisconsin, and Palmer lives in Massachusetts. Pavlovich moved to drop the New York lawsuit against Palmer in May, explaining in court documents that she filed an action in that state because Palmer had recently relocated from New York to Massachusetts and she was unsure which state had jurisdiction. US district judge Mary Kay Vyskocil in New York granted the request in June.Pavlovich also dropped the portion of the Wisconsin lawsuit against Palmer in May, and US district judge James Peterson in Madison dismissed the rest of it in October, saying Pavlovich needed to pursue the case in New Zealand. US district judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston threw out the Massachusetts filing on Friday on the same grounds.Pavlovich’s attorneys did not respond to emails from the Associated Press seeking comment on Monday. Attorneys listed for Gaiman and Palmer did not respond to messages, either.The AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York magazine, which published an article in January 2025 detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.Pavlovich alleged in her lawsuits that she was 22 and homeless when she met Palmer in Auckland in 2020. Palmer invited Pavlovich to the couple’s Waiheke Island home, and she eventually became their son’s nanny, according to the filings.Pavlovich alleged in the lawsuits that Gaiman sexually assaulted her on the night they met in February 2022. The assaults continued, according to the filings, but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless, and Gaiman had told her that he would help her writing career.When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits. The assaults finally stopped when Pavlovich told Palmer that she was going to kill herself, according to the filings.Pavlovich went on to allege that Palmer knew of Gaiman’s sexual desires and presented her to him, knowing he would assault her. She argued that Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and demanded at least $7m in damagesGaiman released a statement after the New York magazine article was published, denying he had ever sexually abused anyone.Gaiman’s attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss the Wisconsin lawsuit that Gaiman and Pavlovich had a brief personal relationship that involved “consensual physical intimacy”.Police in New Zealand investigated her assault allegations and found them meritless, the motion says. The attorneys went on to argue that Pavlovich’s lawsuits were the culmination of a plan to smear Gaiman and that any legal disputes should be resolved in New Zealand, not the US.Gaiman has authored numerous science fiction and fantasy works, including the novels American Gods, The Graveyard Book, Anansi Boys and the children’s dark fairy tale, Coraline.His 2013 novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, won the National Book award in Britain.Explore more on these topicsNeil GaimanNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

St Paul’s Cathedral.Photograph: Finchley Thompson/AlamyBook of the dayBooksReviewYour Life Without Me by James Meek review – angel of destruction haunts a domestic dramaA plot to blow up St Paul’s Cathedral is seen through the lens of family tragedyXan BrooksTue 10 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTShareAgreat demolition is also an act of creation, so long as its execution is bold and impressive enough, so long as it clears out the dead wood and opens up the terrain. It’s the ethos that links Pablo Picasso to 1970s punk, Shiva the Destroyer to the anarchist hero of Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent. Rip it up and start again. Or rip it up for the pure thrill of the ripping. In Graham Greene’s short storyThe Destructors, the schoolboy vandals of the Wormsley Common Gang systematically unpick a Christopher Wren-designed London house, working from the inside out so that it dissolves into rubble the moment a supporting post is pulled down. The crime’s one adult witness, a lorry driver, guffaws at the sight. “I’m sorry, I can’t help it,” he tells the home’s distraught owner. “There’s nothing personal, but you got to admit it’s funny.”Raf, the angel of destruction who haunts the wings of James Meek’s graceful, death-haunted domestic drama, is likewise drawn to the work of Wren – although his project is conceived on a much grander scale. Raf is a professional demolition man, a gifted young engineer and natural born radical, easily moved to laughter or tears and effortlessly dazzling everyone in his orbit. For his PhD project, he has been granted free run of St Paul’s Cathedral in order to test the old building’s resistance to modern traffic vibration. He drills discreet holes in the masonry to install movement censors. But he also packs the cavities with Semtex.It’s no spoiler to reveal that Raf never actually completes his masterpiece. At the start of Meek’s novel he’s confined to Belmarsh prison, held without charge and refusing to speak with the authorities, while the narrative doubles back and pitches camp next door, viewing the ripple effect of this would-be terrorist on his unofficial adoptive family. Why does Raf want to blow up St Paul’s Cathedral anyway? He suggests it is because the building gives shape to the city and ennobles its worst excesses. Also because it is obsolete, a tired prop, an unquestioned symbol of virtue and grace. Removing it would be liberating, he thinks. People would mourn it, appreciate it, and then go and build something fresh and new in its place.Meek builds us a beautiful set of protagonists –intricate and compromised, complex, flawed but durableMaybe more institutions would benefit from a visit from Raf, the cab driver’s son from smalltown Lancashire who swings his metaphorical wrecking ball through the home of the respectable Burman family. Middle-aged Mr Burman (we are never told his first name) was Raf’s English teacher and a surrogate father of sorts. He now worries he may have inadvertently sent Raf down the wrong path, fired the kid up with his idle Marxist chatter to the point where Scotland Yard might even view him as an accessory. But it is clear that Raf’s crime is part of a wider, quieter family tragedy. Burman is still reeling from the death of his charismatic wife, Ada, while his adult daughter, Leila, is burning with resentment over a lifetime of slights, perceived or otherwise.Confoundingly, with a neat narrative sleight of hand, Meek reroutes the drama of Raf’s terrorist plot to the comfortable rooms of the Burman family home. He makes the house feel fraught and hazardous, a shell of its former self, with broken glass under every anxious step. Burman longs to speak to Leila as though they are a pair of normal human beings. His daughter is having none of it. She says: “Talking like human beings isn’t how human beings talk.”Meek – the Guardian’s one-time Moscow bureau chief – is best known for his lightly allegorical historical fiction: the 2005 Booker-longlistedThe People’s Act of Loveand 2019’s exhilaratingTo Calais, in Ordinary Time. Despite the modern-day setting, Your Life Without Me is just as interested in the past’s vexed interplay with the present, gliding along the family timeline and across differing viewpoints (Mr Burman, Leila, Raf) to weigh the merits of conservation and demolition, obligation and freedom.The narrative floorplan is that of a high-concept thriller or a state-of-the-nation epic. But the tale unfolds like a magic eye trick, an experiment in psychogeography that makes St Paul’s a proxy for the absent Ada and observes how the landscape is changed by her loss. It’s a neat marriage metaphor that slowly but surely comes into focus; teasingly at first and rather too explicitly near the end. Because for all its precision plotting and insurrectionist flurries, Your Life Without Me works best as a compelling, compassionate portrait of an English family in flux. Meek builds us a beautiful set of protagonists in Burman and Ada, Leila and Raf. His people are intricate and compromised, complex, flawed but durable, and look solidly three-dimensional right up until the moment that they’re not.Your Life Without Me by James Meek is published by Canongate (£18.99).

However, rather than suburban Australia, writer Owen Egerton and director Corin Hardy relocate us to an autumnal, Springsteen-ready North American steeltown, where artsy high-schooler Chrys (Dafne Keen) inherits the locker of the star basketballer we’ve just seen flambeed in a prologue. The deadly doodad she finds there is a skull-shaped Aztec whistle with either “summon the dead” or “summon your dead” (there’s some linguistic quibbling) inscribed on the side. Naturally she puts it back, and everybody lives happily ever after.I kid, of course. For a while, the horror element is less in-your-face than it was in the pummelling Antipodean predecessor, but whistleblowing soon makes everyone’s worst fears about dying literal. That development gives Hardy’s increasingly bloody kill scenes a Final Destination-like piquancy: your heart can only go out to the boy racer who perishes via car crash in his upstairs bedroom. One similarity to the Philippous’ film is the sympathy for insecure, troubled teens who couldn’t seem more unlike the usual disposable jocks and prom queens. Egerton observes courtship rituals with tenderness, quietly foregrounding Chrys’s struggles to come out to upright classmate Ellie (Sophie Nélisse); beneath the looming shadow of death, this is an attempt to live one’s truest life.British director Hardy has far more fun here than he did with2018’s mechanical franchise entry The Nun. He runs with a solid in-joke – naming objects, places and Nick Frost’s doomed teacher Mr Craven after noted horror directors – and pushes a sequence involving a labyrinthine straw maze, surely beyond the actual resources of a small town harvest festival, towards the pleasingly surreal. If the film can’t successfully integrate a loose-end preacher-slash-drug dealer (Percy Hynes White), elsewhere it pulls off the deft trick of being familiar without seeming derivative, with scenes you remember from films you like, occasionally with a novel twist. Enough for Friday or Saturday night enjoyment, certainly.Whistle is out now in the US, on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsNick FrostreviewsShareReuse this content"

But given that the “blood” being spurted out is mostly bright orange and belongs to extraordinarily fake-looking alien creatures, the effect is neither gross-out nor even the slightest bit engrossing; it is just boring and headache-inducing. Just as you shouldbring tissues to see Hamnet, viewers are advised to bring painkillers to this, and possibly a good book to read during the dull interstitial bits.Made over several years in a single scuzzy apartment, Jimmy and Stiggs is the brainchild of writer-director-producer-star Joe Begos, who made the marginally betterChristmas Bloody Christmasa few years ago and who plays title character Jimmy here. Having made a bunch of horror films with his lifelong friend Stiggs (Matt Mercer) – we see fictional trailers of them at the beginning, definitely the high point from which it all goes downhill – Jimmy’s career is evidently in a slump and he spends his time getting drunk and high in his grimy hovel, which has a cool jellyfish tank and seems lit exclusively by black-lights, like a 14-year-old metalhead’s dream digs.Then aliens invade and Jimmy must fight back, although he’s not sure if they haven’t implanted him with mind-control devices, as such creatures are wont to do. Luckily, alcohol is poisonous to them and that’s one thing Jimmy has a generous supply of. Stiggs is persuaded to come over and help but is reluctant to prove he’s not an alien by drinking whisky, given he’s been sober for six months. It’s hard not to wonder if Begos and co have had a bad experience with AA or rehab and this is all some kind of metaphorical revenge, but in all honesty, if it is, it’s a pretty dumb takedown.● Jimmy and Stiggs is on digital platforms from 16 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the reason the TV series always seemed up to date, and still does 40 years later, is that nothing ever really changes. When I was writing the sequel Yes, Prime Minister in 1986, I went to the Daily Telegraph’s offices in Fleet Street to read stories from 1956. I was curious to see how much things had changed. Guess what? They hadn’t.The biggest story was about war in the Middle East (the Suez crisis). The government had lied about its Middle East adventure, which was an abject failure, and the truth was seeping out in spite of its attempt to suppress it. Soviet troops invaded Hungary, creating a refugee crisis in Europe. The “special relationship” with the US was in doubt because of Washington’s disapproval of UK and French defence policy. Questions were raised about the impartiality and independence of the BBC. There was fear of inflation, and a plan to improve regional disparities. I could continue but you get the idea.Last month there was a story about the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. She had promised legislation to protect freedom of speech and to protect academics from their students. But 370 university teachers, including three Nobel laureates, accused her of kicking it into the long grass. Followers of Yes Minister know that just because a minister wants something done, that doesn’t mean it will be. My guess is that some officials in the department were not unhappy to see professors cancelled, and they obstructed it.View image in fullscreen‘Most people thought civil servants were silly chaps’ … Nigel Hawthorne, Paul Eddington and Derek Fowlds in the TV series Yes, Prime Minister, 1987.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesBefore our programme, most people thought that civil servants were silly chaps who wore bowler hats and sat around drinking tea. That’s how they were usually portrayed in comedy shows. We revealed that Whitehall employed 3,000 clever, highly educated people who were unknown to the public and discreetly ran the country. This is one of the reasons politicians loved Yes Minister. It gave them an alibi.We didn’t actually reveal it. Richard Crossman did. His Diaries of a Cabinet Minister were serialised by the Sunday Times, and the government of which he had been an important part sued Jonathan Cape, the publisher. From 1964-66 Crossman had kept detailed notes of cabinet meetings, and the attorney general asked for an order “restraining” the book because of breach of confidentiality which, he alleged, threatened collective responsibility. This was nonsense. As always, the government simply wanted to avoid embarrassment, but it lost this landmark case. It was a huge victory for freedom of the press, and our first major source for Yes Minister.In the diaries Crossman’s private secretary says “Yes, minister” when he means “No, minister” and when Crossman is confronted by an overflowing inbox, the private secretary explains that if he simply transfers everything from the inbox to the outbox the civil service will take care of it. The minister need do nothing more. Very few people read political memoirs and the general public still didn’t know how things were done, or rather not done. Reading the Crossman diaries was a revelation and confirmed to us that there was a comedy series waiting to be written.People said that the series, the books and the new play I’m Sorry, Prime Minister were about politics. But we were writing about government, which is not the same thing. At its best, politics is the legitimate conflict of vested interests, a struggle over the best way to improve society for the people. At its worst it is simply a struggle for power – power over one’s fellow citizens, power for the pleasure of it.Like most politicians, our minister (later prime minister and now master of an Oxford college) Jim Hacker started out with the best motives, a desire to make the world a better place. But he is like Graham Greene’s whisky priest. As you climb what Disraeli called “the greasy pole”, you support many policies you think are wrong because, as they used to say in the US Senate, “you have to go along to get along”.Why? Because even though you’re not quite sure what you believe any more, you want the power to carry it out. And you want to win the next election. Otherwise you’re out in the cold, politically frozen on the green opposition benches. In the immortal words of Snoopy creator Charles M Schulz: “Winning isn’t everything. But losing isn’t anything.”I’m Sorry, Prime Minister is at theApollo theatre, London, until 9 May.Then touringExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreTelevisionTV comedyComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)commentShareReuse this content"

Watching her command this arena during the first of two sold-out shows in Glasgow in honour of Florence + the Machine’s sixth albumEverybody Scream, it’s hard to imagine Welch fearing anything. Just seconds ago, she was racing barefoot, flouncy skirts gathered in one hand, ripping through Spectrum (the band’s first UK No 1, back in 2012) and its searing demand: “Say my name!”But the new song she is steeling herself to sing presses on a bruise. With ratcheting intensity, You Can Have It All grieves an ectopic pregnancywhich almost killed her, as well as a music industry that punishes its stars for motherhood. Over grungy electric guitar, her tempestuous voice billows like sails in high wind: “Am I a woman now?” It leaves the arena in stunned silence. She gives a wry curtsey.View image in fullscreenFlorence Welch with her choir.Photograph: Lillie EigerEverybody Scream deals in familiar Florence tropes – mountainous emotions, thundering drums, glittering harp – but with a new sombreness, particularly as she wrestles with questions of legacy. On earlier songs she raged against metaphorical demons; now, on One of the Greats, her targets are more explicit as she stares down male peers making “boring music” and sings, her face tight with frustration, about what it would take “to conquer and crucify”.‘The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death’: Florence Welch on sexism, screaming and the lost pregnancy that nearly killed herRead moreWith her longstanding band the Machine performing in the shadows, Welch is accompanied by a choir who writhe and scream and rip at their frothy petticoats. This high-drama show could never be boring but it threatens to overwhelm: the choir’s folksy horror pulls focus away from a performer who can transfix a crowd, alone, with ease.Last year’s single Sympathy Magic is an instant Florence classic: a sky-high plea for catharsis through song. “What else?” she yells, before throwing herself into the arms of a fan on the barrier. It makes the aching, pretty closer And Love feel intentionally anticlimactic. It is tender, quiet, about finding peace. “If we sing it, it might come true,” she offers, but Welch, like her audience, thrives on the edge of a precipice.Florence + the Machine are atUtilita Arena, Newcastle upon Tyne, 11 February;then touringExplore more on these topicsMusicFlorence + the MachinePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Other sightings placed him in the indie venuethe Brudenell Social Club.Like most things surrounding the rapper, myth, rumour and lore envelop his story. But the central question of why one of hip-hop’s most loved figures spent the final years of his life in Leeds drove Batty and the BBC 6 Music DJAfrodeutscheto attempt to solve the mystery, in MF Doom: Long Island to Leeds.Born in Hounslow in 1971, the rapper – whose real name was Dumile Daniel Thompson – died aged 49 at St James’s hospital in 2020 due to a lack of oxygen to his brain after a reaction to a drug prescribed for blood pressure.View image in fullscreenAdam Batty and Afrodeutsche, the team behind the MF Doom podcast, at a mural celebrating the rapper.Photograph: Adam Batty/MF DOOM: Long Island to LeedsThe fact he was even in Leeds after being barred from entering the US in 2010 was news to many people, including Batty, a journalist and Doom mega-fan. “In a way his story is tragedy,” says Batty. “He was failed by many institutions around the world.”In the podcast Doom-heads, including the comedian Romesh Ranganathan opine about the brilliance of the rapper, who became known in the late 1980s alongside his brother DJ Subroc as the duo KMD. After his brother was killed in a car accident in 1993, Dumile Daniel Thompson re-emerged in 1999 with the album Operation: Doomsday under the moniker MF Doom.His new mask-wearing image and sound was influenced by superhero and comic-book culture. His records, including the 2004 collaboration with Madlib, Madvillainy, are considered some of the best hip-hop records ever made. “Nobody else can tell a story the way he did,” says Afrodeutsche. “It was funny, it was intellectual, it was something that you couldn’t keep still to as well.”The legacy of Doom is contested. The rapper’s wife and former A&R recently resolved a long-running legal disputerevolving around his notebooks, while concrete details about his life in the UK remain thin on the ground. “A lot of people won’t speak,” says Batty. “The family are very suspicious of who’s doing what and why they’re doing it.”That lack of clarity seems to have only driven interest in the rapper who was once described as being “an obstinate and one-of-a-kind genius in the Mingus mould”.Fellow musicians including Yasiin Bey continue to perform his tracks, reissues of his work abound, and a new illustrated biography published by Faber last year added to a growingDoom bibliography. His lyrics were also included in the first new Dr Doom comic published by Marvel in 20 years.The reason he was in the UK is clear: despite arriving in the US as a one-year-old infant, he never secured citizenship or residency in the country. In 2010, after returning from a tour, a border official denied him entry, partially based on the fact he had a criminal record dating back to the 1990s.He then found himself only able to travel to the UK, which meant he had to leave behind his wife and children in Atlanta. In 2023, Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trustissued an apologyfor the substandard care he was given. “I was most shocked about how he was treated,” says Afrodeutsche. “That broke my heart – he was a humble man.”Ultimately, the pair don’t find out why Doom moved to Leeds. Does Batty wish he had solved the riddle of Doom’s time in Leeds? “I don’t think it is an anticlimax as such – the best ending for us is that the mystery lives on.”MF DOOM: Long Island to Leeds is available on BBC Soundsfrom Tuesday 10 February.Explore more on these topicsHip-hopPodcastsRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The riotous, post-apocalyptic buildings of ‘eco-brutalist’ Renée GailhoustetThe French architect, who once had her nose broken by Jean-Marie Le Pen, created apartment blocks with cascading terraces that seemed to have surrendered to nature. They are still loved by their residentsCatherine SlessorTue 10 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 10 Feb 2026 13.05 ESTShareWhen the French architect Renée Gailhoustet died in 2023, the residents of Le Liégat, a social housing block she completed in 1982, put up a large handmade sign saying: “Merci Renée.” Architects are often accused of designing impersonal rabbit hutches that they themselves would never deign to inhabit, but when Gailhoustet died at the age of 93, she had been living in her Liégat duplex in the Parisian suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine for more than 40 years.Outside her living room window, several storeys up, was a large cherry tree and a profusion of greenery. Characterised by their riotous informality, Gailhoustet’s free-plan apartment blocks invariably featured cascading terraces and loggias covered with a foot of soil, so residents could cultivate and enjoyunjardin derrière,a back garden.Over time, planting has enrobed the angular contours of Le Liégat, as it has her other housing schemes, softening and subverting its concrete armature in a kind of post-apocalyptic, nature-takes-over way that plays well on Instagram. Yet it originally sprang from the socially minded view that people should have access to green space, anticipating today’s preoccupation with a more eco architecture, capable of mitigating the effects of rising temperatures. In 2003,around 15,000 people diedin France in a heatwave. Planting provides natural shade and cooling.View image in fullscreen‘We merely wish to create possibilities for choice’ … Gailhoustet in 2014.Photograph: Valérie SadounGailhoustet might be described as an “eco-brutalist”, but her work across the decades, after she graduated in architecture from Paris’s École des Beaux-Arts in 1961, cannot be easily pigeonholed. She specialised in social housing and urban planning in the suburbs beyond thepériphérique–the less privileged, less photogenic Paris, where few tourists venture. Often combined with communal facilities such as shops and cafes, her housing megastructures were formally and spatially complex, like modern mini-cities. Designed to be adaptable over time as residents’ living arrangements changed, individual apartments were generously proportioned, with space, light and air flowing in all directions.Homes are not machines for living in – but gentle, human, individual spacesLe Corbusier famously remarked that a house was “a machine for living in”, anaperçuthat has dogged modernist architecture down the decades. Although her work is undoubtedly modernist, Gailhoustet took the opposite position: that homes should be shaped by their occupants and architecture should provide a template for elaboration and enrichment, rather than soul-numbing constriction. “The idea of social housing as an addition of little functional room boxes,” she once wrote, “should not be given sociological sanction. Almost no one living in those conditions chose to. We are not so pretentious as to propose an ideal dwelling. We merely wish to create possibilities for choice.”Architect and academic Nichola Barrington-Leach, editor of a hefty forthcoming tome on Gailhoustet, explains her appeal: “Her work invites us to imagine new ways of living together as an ecosystem, to reframe our relationship with nature, the city, with each other and ourselves. Homes are not machines for living in – but gentle, human, individual spaces.”View image in fullscreenRadical … La Maladrerie in Aubervilliers.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyIn a career dedicated to building more than 2,000 social homes, Gailhoustet offered a visionary riposte to thegrands ensembles,the industrialised and standardised postwar housing developments that dominate the peripheries of most French cities. Commissioned directly by leftwing municipalities, she was able to work freely and experimentally to an open brief but still had to conform to a limited budget. “She used those constraints to develop her vision and ideas,” says Barrington-Leach. “And I think that’s the message I get from her – which is, actually, you can do so much with so little.”In tandem with the book, which will be the first English language book solely dedicated to Gailhoustet’s oeuvre, Barrington-Leach has curated an exhibition,A Thousand and One Ways of Living, at London’s Architectural Association (AA), where she teaches. The exhibition takes its title from the words of Rima Abdul Malak, a former French minister of culture, who observed that Gailhoustet’s architecture offers “a thousand and one ways of inhabiting our world”.Part of the AA’s grand Georgian interior has been subtly transformed into a 1:1 scale installation of a Le Liégat apartment. “The aim was to bring one of her flats into the AA,” says Barrington-Leach, “to show her spaces rather than just her ideas.” Walls are represented by thick sheets of white paper suspended by cable ties from steel wires strung across the exhibition space defining the level of the apartment’s ceiling height. Intended to convey proportions and relationships, the effect is both abstractly sculptural and intimately functional, poetry infused with pragmatism.Along with photographs and drawings, different dwelling types are further represented by smaller scale models in card and cast concrete – bizarre, sharp-edged and waywardly random. Yet the appearance of complexity belies an underlying constructional simplicity and clarity, based on a hexagonal structural grid and lightweight partitions that could be easily rearranged. Gailhoustet once described the architect’s role as being “an artisan of a difficult material: space”.View image in fullscreenSo much with so little … housing in Ivry-sur-Seine.Photograph: Sacha Trouiller / NVBL ArchitectsBorn in Oran, Algeria, in 1929, the daughter of the deputy director of the Echo d’Oran newspaper, Gailhoustet grew up in the coastal city’s European quarter before moving to Paris for university. She alighted on architecture after studying philosophy at the Sorbonne, a move impelled by an ambition to build rather than theorise, underscored by her political convictions. She was active in the Young Communist movement and, during periodic clashes with far-right groups, had the dubious distinction of once having her nose broken by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the country’s National Front party.Between 1963 and 1985, Gailhoustet oversaw the radical transformation of Ivry-sur-Seine, on the south-east edge of Paris, while working on projects in other suburban locales, including La Maladrerie in Aubervilliers, to the north. Animated by an abundance of civic spaces – a library, cultural centre, home for elderly people and a children’s centre, along with shops, gardens and artist’s studios – La Maladrerie was designed in 10 phases, took 10 years to build and is her largest project, with 850 dwellings.By the 1990s, however, the political context had changed, with France’s central government increasingly hostile to large-scale housing projects. Work began to dry up and in 1999 she closed her practice for good.Cage fights at the White House! A gigantic arch! Trump’s gaudy plans for America’s 250th anniversaryRead moreFor decades, Gailhoustet has remained on the margins of architectural history, her reputation overshadowed, to an extent, by Jean Renaudie, whom she met in her mid-20s. They lived together for around 15 years, had two daughters, and collaborated on several projects. But her pioneering contribution is now being acknowledged, albeit belatedly. In 2022, a year before she died, she was awarded the Royal Academy architecture prize. “Her achievements reach far beyond what is produced as social or affordable housing anywhere today,” said jury chair Farshid Moussavi.Crucially, rather than top down, her design process was collaborative. Concepts such as open-plan living and garden terraces were discussed with residents through large-scale physical models. And though some occupants initially struggled with the lack of conformity, finding it difficult to imagine themselves in unorthodox geometries and unprescribed spaces, the homes she built are still loved and sought after.Most of Gailhoustet’s housing is still council-owned and, despite decades of state neglect and some misguided renovations, resident groups continue to fight for the preservation of her work, successfully listing several buildings. “She proved that we can explore alternative ways of living and create a framework for our cities that allows for adaptation and reuse,” says Barrington-Leach. “Her legacy, like her architecture, is growing as a living archive: evolving with every resident and every season.”Renée Gailhoustet: A Thousand and One Ways of Living is at the Architectural Association, London, until 21 MarchRenée Gailhoustet, edited by Nichola Barrington-Leach, will be published by AA Publications in late March and is available to pre-order from the Architectural Association BookshopThis article was amended on 10 February 2026 to clarify that the forthcoming book on Renée Gailhoustet will be the first English language booksolelydedicated to Gailhoustet’s oeuvre; an earlier version indicated it would be the first per se.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The path is as wide as a one-way street but Birgit Pichorner, the park ranger I’m taking a tour with, motions for me to move to the side, where we watch a couple with wide grins glide past on a wooden toboggan.We have seen families out hiking with young children and speed walkers pacing for the summit, while on a trail above us, four skiers are zigzagging up one of the nature park’s designated ski touring routes. For residents of Villach, the southern Austrian town at the foot of Dobratsch, this is very much theirHausberg, a much-loved “locals’ mountain”, says Birgit.Until 2002, it was a ski resort – Birgit points out the slopes where she learned and later taught her kids to ski – but after successive bad winters at the turn of the century, the town faced the same choice as many ski resorts across the Alps today, as the climate crisis brings higher temperatures and reduced snowfall. Bring in the snow guns and supplement your natural snow offering with the fake stuff? Or chart a different path?The environmental cost of artificial snow is high – it’s  energy- and water-intensiveThe environmental cost ofMaschinenschnee, as the Austrians call artificial snow, is high – it’s energy- and water-intensive, with many resorts pumping water up from the valleys to service their slopes. It also negatively affects these fragile ecosystems by introducing potentially pathogenic and stress-tolerant bacteria to the snow, meltwater and soils,according to the hydrologistProf Carmen de Jong.At Dobratsch, residents were worried about the effects theMaschinenschneewould have on the cleanliness of their drinking water, which is funnelled through the mountain’s karst limestone system. They decided it wasn’t worth the risk, so closed the ski resort and instead developed a community-focused nature park.View image in fullscreenDobratsch, Villach’s community-focused nature park, in Carinthia.Photograph: Tom Klar/Getty ImagesAlong with providing affordable year-round outdoor recreation for local people and tourists – accessed by a €5 bus from Villach or by paying a slightly higher fee at one of the parking spots – the nature park designation protects the local flora and fauna. This includes mountain hares, chamois, ptarmigan and black grouse, with schoolchildren regularly taking part in educational classes on the mountain.Visitors are encouraged to avoid specific “nature zones” and stick to the trails, which are prepared for them daily. There are three winter hiking routes, ranging from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on how hard you want to work; four ski touring routes, ranging from an-hour-and-a-half to three hours; plus a cross-country circuit and a toboggan slope.We plan to hike a two-hour route to the summit (2,166m) via the Dobratsch Gipfelhaus, though we modify our route slightly when the fog comes in – depriving us of views of nearby Slovenia and Italy – and visit another hut near the summit instead, which used to house the old ski lift. It’s such a beautiful wintry landscape and a treat to be hiking on real snow. There isn’t enough to require snowshoes today – I’m in snowboard boots, though Birgit is fine in walking boots – but the snow still makes that lovely squeaking sound under my feet, making me feel nostalgic for winter holidays past.View image in fullscreenA machine producing a cloud of artificial snow in St Anton, Austria.Photograph: David Hall/AlamyThe problem with fake snow, aside from its environmental and financial impact (the cost of producing it has forced many ski resorts to push up their prices), is that it’s not very nice to walk on, let alone ski or snowboard on; it’s more like ice and much harder and heavier than natural snow. Before I came to Carinthia, I spent a few days in St Anton in the west of the country, where the whirr of multiple snow cannons puffing out clouds of white mist like dragon’s breath was a constant, even at night.I had the discombobulating experience of snowboarding down ribbons of white pistes surrounded by muted-green hills, and riding through the mist feels unlike any weather I’ve ever experienced; it’s lighter and less powerful than rain but grittier than real snow. When it lands on your jacket it has none of the intricate beauty of a snowflake and disappears almost instantly.But it’s easy to see why ski stations are resorting to snow cannons to keep the lights on. St Anton had last seen proper snow in November yet was almost fully open for the New Year holiday crowds, which is no mean feat, and many local businesses will, of course, depend on that tourist spend.We have this glacial valley to ourselves – the polar opposite of factory farm skiingI visit the small mountain village of Mallnitz, about 50 minutes on a scenic train from Villach, for a day’s snowboard touring with Klaus Alber, a mountain guide who also runs theHotel Alber. The hotel has been in his family for four generations, and Klaus, who greets me in lederhosen despite the temperature hovering at -10C, has noticed the dramatic effects of the changing climate on the valley first-hand.Pointing to the hotel windows, he tells me the snow used to pile up to halfway most winters, but in recent years it’s barely covered the pavement. “Now we get long periods of cold, dry weather with no snow,” he says. The village’s small ski resort Ankogel, which doesn’t yet have snow cannons, is closed due to a lack of snow.View image in fullscreenThe writer snow touring in Mallnitz, a 50-minute train ride from Villach“Guests come because they want to ski, but we encourage them to be flexible and enjoy the nature as it is. If there’s no snow in December, we can hike to a summit, that’s still a very nice thing to do,” he says, adding that it forces him to be more creative and find new activities for guests, such as snow touring, where you hike up a mountain using adhesive “skins” for grip, then ski or snowboard down.We set out in theHohe Tauern national park, amid a wild, high mountain snowscape of extraordinary beauty. Klaus thinks we may find some good conditions for touring, as there was a recent dusting of snow, which has softened the snow that fell earlier in the season, and he’s right.Climbing across a series of gentle spines, with sweeping views of a dramatic amphitheatre-like range to our left, it’s clear we have this entire glacial valley to ourselves – the polar opposite of factory farm skiing at a purpose-built ski resort. But it’s not just the setting; the true pleasure of the day comes from being in this landscape with wonderful natural snow all around. It looks so much brighter than its human-made equivalent, dazzlingly so under blue skies and sunshine.After a couple of hours, we reach the Hagener hut at 2,446m, and Klaus points to an area of snow-covered wilderness that was nearly turned into a ski resort in the late 1960s, before the area became a national park – a resort that today would no doubt be debating the choice between snow cannons or closure.How to have a sustainable family ski holiday: take the train and head highRead moreAfter snacks and hot sweet tea, we begin our descent with no tracks in the snow ahead – Klaus thinks we’re the first people to do the route this winter. The snow will become bare and patchy lower down, but it feels amazing to be making swooping turns in this upper section, where it’s deep enough to spray in arcs across my face, a holy grail in snowboarding, but so rare these days if you only go to the mountains once a year.It’s an experience you can only have with snow that’s fallen from the sky, and one that could never be approximated by a machine. The tears behind my goggles aren’t just from the cold.This trip was provided by Visit Villach, National Park Region Hohe Tauernand Austria Tourism. A snowshoe hike at the Dobratschnaturepark with a ranger costs €30including snowshoe and pole rental,naturpark-dobratsch.at.

The non-digestible carbohydrate has two main functions: “There’s insoluble fibre, which is found in things such as whole grains, brown rice or vegetable skins, and I think about it like a broom,” Tew says, “in that it brushes the system out.” Then there’s soluble fibre (oats, beans, lentils), which she likens to a sponge: “It turns into this gel in your gut, and aids digestion and keeps us regular.” But that’s only part of the story, because fibre can also help lower cholesterol and stabilise blood sugar.So, are you getting enough? “The aim is 25-30g fibre a day, but in reality most of us are maybe getting 15-18g,” Tew says, so we’ve got a little way to go. That said, some folk on the #fibremaxxing train have set their sights higher, which is where things can become problematic. “If you’re having too much fibre, you can end up feeling bloated, constipated or have abdominal pain,” she says, and that can occur when you increase your fibre intake too quickly: “The body needs time to get used to what’s happening.”As with most things in life, it’s far better to take things one step (or one meal) at a time. “Think about adding a bit of fibre to breakfast, lunch and dinner,” Tew advises, whether that’s sprinkling chia seeds or linseed over porridge, adding some fruit (“a banana, say, or raspberries, which contain a lot of fibre”), plus that eternally important spoonful of nut butter.The same sprinkling strategy also applies to soup, and you could up the fibre content further by tossing in some lentils (“instead of carrot and coriander, try carrot and lentil”) and serving with wholegrain or rye bread. “Our gold standard carrot and hummus is a good snack, as are apples [keep the skin on, mind] paired with almond butter.” Happily, popcorn also falls into the “good fibre content” snack camp, as do roast chickpeas, which you could (quite literally) spice up with smoked paprika, ground cumin and coriander, plus a pinch of cayenne.Come dinner, Niall Kirkland, author ofThe Good Bite Easy: High Protein, High Fibre, Delicious Meals, is all about a one-pan creamy bean and lentil number: “Saute an onion with garlic, add a dollop of miso, chuck in some butter beans, lentils, stock and blended silken tofu [which also adds a hit of protein], and simmer until thick.” Garnish with soft cheese and chilli oil, then scoop up with toasted sourdough: “You’ll be in heaven.”Tew also homes in on pulses, stirring lentils through chicken curries and pasta sauces, or tossing kidney beans into a chilli – just be sure to serve the latter with basmati or brown rice, because “they’ve got a better fibre content”, she says. “Think: where can I add that sneaky bit of fibre without going over the top? Otherwise, you’ll end up feeling rubbish.” And that’s definitely something to minimise.Got a culinary dilemma?

A shoulder of lamb is one of my favourite cuts; you, or a friendly butcher, will need to trim away its excess fat, a job that will reward you with an exquisite flavour that marries beautifully with bold spicing. Here, we travel to Morocco, with sweetly aromatic ginger, turmeric and cinnamon, and follow that with cardamom, cream and rhubarb for pudding. A sumptuous, colourful feast to stave off any February blues.Moroccan lamb filo pie with honeyed carrots and almonds (pictured top)Many elements of this dish, with its falling apart, richly seasoned lamb and carrots encased in crisp, golden pastry, can be made the day before. The flavours will be much improved for it, too.Prep15 minCook3 hrServes6-81 large boned shoulder of lamb, trimmed of excess fatSalt and pepper60g butter, or oil2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped1 scant tsp ground ginger1 scant tsp cinnamon1 scant tsp turmeric2 large pinches saffron strands650g carrots,scrubbed (or peeled) and cut into thick, slanted chunks1 heaped tsp honeyTo finish80g blanched almonds50g butter270g packet filo pastryUse a sharp knife to cut the meat into six to eight pieces, trimming away any further excess fat revealed when doing so.Season the lamb pieces generously with salt and pepper. Put a casserole on a high heat and, when it’s hot, add a third of the butter (I like to add a dash of olive oil, too, to stop the butter burning). Brown the lamb pieces in two batches for a few minutes on each side, until nicely browned and caramelised. Set aside in a bowl, then turn down the heat to medium.Add a third more of the butter to the pan, tip in the onions, season well with salt and lots of pepper, then stir in the ginger, cinnamon, turmeric and saffron, and sweat gently, stirring often, for 10-12 minutes, until the onions are translucent and soft.Return the lamb to the pan, pour in enough water almost to cover the meat, and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, turning the lamb a couple of times.Meanwhile, put a large frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, add the last of the butter. Saute the carrots for four to five minutes, seasoning generously with salt and pepper, add the honey and cook for a few minutes more, until caramelised and fragrant.Once the lamb has had its 90 minutes, add the carrots to the mix and simmer, uncovered, for a further 30-60 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and the carrots are just cooked. (This can now be set aside to finish the next day.)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and toast the almonds inside while it’s heating up. Melt 50g butter in a pan, then use a pastry brush to grease a large ovenproof dish and the pastry, layering it up to four sheets deep in the pan. Tip in the lamb, top with the toasted nuts, then fold over the overhanging pastry and brush with more melted butter. Top the pie with a few extra scrunched-up filo sheets, brush with melted butter, then bake for 20-25 minutes, until piping hot and golden. Serve with greens.Cardamom panna cotta with baked rhubarbView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ cardamom panna cotta with baked rhubarb.Prep10 minInfuse30 minCook40 minChill3 hr+Serves4450ml double cream100mlwhole milkFinely grated zest of 1 orange100g caster sugar1 tsp green cardamom pods2½2g fine-leaf gelatine sheets200g greek yoghurtFor the rhubarb400g rhubarb, wiped clean and cut into 3cm lengths100g caster sugarJuice of1 orange2-3 tbsp PernodPour the cream and milk into a saucepan and add the orange zest and sugar. Bash open the cardamom pods with a rolling pin, then add them, too. Put the pan on a medium heat and warm gently until a few tiny bubbles break the surface. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for half an hour.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay out the rhubarb in a single layer in a large baking dish. Sprinkle over the sugar, orange juice and Pernod, cover with foil and bake for 20-25 minutes, until tender to the point of a knife but still keeping its shape. Taste and adjust the sweetness if the rhubarb is very tart.Submerge the gelatine in a bowl of cold water, leave to soften for five minutes, then drain and squeeze the water from the gelatine and put it in a bowl. Once the cream has infused, reheat it gently, then strain through a sieve into the gelatine bowl. Whisk until it melts, then beat gradually into the yoghurt. Pour into four small moulds, glasses or ramekins, then chill in the fridge for at least three hours, until set.To serve, dip the base and sides of the panna cotta moulds into boiling water and loosen with a palette knife. Turn them out on to plates and spoon the rhubarb around the creams.Explore more on these topicsFoodThomasina Miers recipesNorth African food and drinkMain courseDessertBakingPiePastryrecipesShareReuse this content"

Created in the 1980s by the fine dining chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, it was probably one of the original viral foods, and scores of chefs have tried to recreate its fluffy exterior and luxurious, melty interior since. If you’re not in New York, or would rather not drop $400 on a dinner, just order the sweetest part of Vongerichten’s menu to your door. It comes in a gift tin with a baggie of powdered sugar and even a mini sieve so you can dust it yourself. And best of all, it can arrive within two days.Sakuraco Kyoto Valentine’s Snack BoxView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SakuracoFrom $37.50 a month at SakuracoFounded in Japan, Sakuraco is (probably) the only snack box subscriptionrecognized by the Japanese governmentas “an important bridge to the rest of the world”. Every shipment is crammed withJapanese snacks, teas and home goods (such as ceramics and chopsticks) sourced directly from family artisans, plus a booklet introducing each treat and its maker. February’s box is themed A Kyoto Valentine’s. Expect regional goodies such as fluffy Amaou strawberry cake and caramel bergamot hojicha tea. Depending on location, it can come in three business days.Bokksu Kit Kat SamplerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Bokksu$49.99 at BokksuOr get your favorite sweet tooth this variety box of 50 mini Kit Kats.

They’re chewy and crispy, just how I like them.” Another testimonial: a friend who recently became a new mom received these as a gift. Did I mooch several when the new mom hosted dinner and put them out for dessert? Absolutely. We cleared those cookies.These are baked to order and can arrive within two days.Fly By Jing Hot Pot Bomb and Mini Hotpot for TwoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Fly By Jing$50 at Fly By JingIt’s hotpot weather. Eat hotpot. Don’t have time to make it at home? I’m sorry to say this hotpot base from Fly By Jing eliminates that excuse. As a deeply lazy cook, I love that it turns plain water into a roiling, rich hotpot broth in a few minutes. Its ingredients are simple: chili crisp, soy sauce, garlic and peanut butter. You can make it extra romantic by getting it with Fly By Jing’s brand-new mini hotpotfor two.Sauz x California Naturals Tomato BundleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Sauz$34.98 at SauzEverytomato lover’s dream: two big jars of very good marinara sauce plus tomato sauce-scented lip balm. This concoction from buzzy sauce brand Sauz somehow works. The Hot Honey Marinara is my favorite: it’s not too sweet, spicy enough to feel it andworth getting on its own.As for the lip balm, it’s unsettling how much it smells like freshly jarred tomato sauce. That’s a plus for me, but lest that turn you off: it won’t look like tomato sauce on your lips. Instead, it gives off a light and demure reddish tint akin toBurt’s Bees tinted lip balm, plus lots of hydration thanks to California Natural’s organic blend of aloe, coconut oil and beeswax. Apply it before or after having a big bowl of pasta marinara. Or just pull it out of your bag and make people sniff it incredulously, which is my favorite party trick at the moment.Lover’s Classic Cheese & Charcuterie BoardView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of BoarderieFrom $139 at BoarderieBoarderie’s cornucopia has 19 different cheeses, meats, dried fruits, nuts, chocolates, crackers … you get the idea. It’s a lot of charcuterie. On top of all that, you get two big hokey cheddar blocks in the shape of you and your dining partner’s initials. You can also reuse the wood tray it comes on. If you’re burnt-out from gift shopping and stressing over what foods are “romantic” but “fun” but “unique” but “will actually get eaten”, just get this board. It can arrive within two days in insulated packaging.Fly By Jing Chili Crisp BundleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Fly By Jing$45 at Fly By JingAs chili crisp hasbecome more popularin the US, I’ve tried probably dozens ofchili crispbrands. Some are crunchier, some oilier, some full of heat, others mild. I think the best chili crisp has enough balance to enhance (almost) everything you eat it with – and for me, that’sLao Gan Ma, the OG. But Fly By Jing is a close second and offers a gift box of three of its most popular flavors: original, sweet and spicy, and xtra crunchy.Primis Pizza OilView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Primis Imports$18 at Primis ImportsInfused with cayenne and herbs; smells and tastes exactly like a chili-flaked, basil-topped Neopolitan pizza. Lately, I can’t stop dousing popcorn in this stuff like a maniac, and now I’m happily passing along the curse to you and your loved one.Jeni’s A Date With the Couch CollectionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Jeni’s Ice Creams$58 at Jeni’sThe trick to Jeni’s super smooth and decadent buttercream ice cream is its cream cheese. The brand pioneered the cream cheese trick – recently, its founder Jeni Britton evenaccusedthe New York Times cooking section of “stealing” her recipe when the newspaper ran its own recipe with cream cheese. All this is to say that Jeni’s makesthecreamiest ice cream, and it’s best eaten straight from the pint. This collection offers six crowd faves including Darkest Chocolate, Boston Cream Pie and Brown Butter Almond Brittle. Share them on the couch for a sweet night in.Kolsvart Torsken Raspberry and Blackcurrant Mix FishView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$11.49 at AmazonMaybe you don’t want to go formal with that box ofchocolatesbut do want to get alittle treat. From Guardian copy editor Tammy Tarng: “I’m big on gummy candies and very particular about them: too much elasticity and they’ll stick to your teeth (Swedish Fish feel that way sometimes), too little and it lacks a playful chew. These are the perfect level, and the blackcurrant’s very tasty.”Oddbird GSM Nonalcoholic Red WineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of The Zero Proof$24.99 at The Zero Proof$26.99 at AmazonNonalcoholic red wines are“famously tricky”to nail, and many end up tasting like red wine vinegar, according to wine expert Oset Babür-Winter. Not Oddbird’s GSM blend (grenache, syrah and mourvèdre). With juicy black fruit notes and a bold finish, it’s one of the rare nonalcoholic red wines that tastes just like its alcoholic counterpart. Babür-Winter recommends pairing it with steak or acharcuterie boardstacked with prosciutto and other cured meats.Canaan Palestine Jenin Olive OilView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Canaan Palestine$32 at Canaan Palestine$39 at Wine + EggsFor a gift with a meaningful backstory: this olive oil is made by farmers living in villages surrounding the Palestinian city of Jenin. West Bank-based brand Canaan Palestine works with local farmers to use regenerative agricultural practices and preserve the region’s ancient native trees, even as attacks by Israel have made olive oilharvest difficultin recent years.Explore more on these topicsGift ideas from the Filter USThe Filter USValentine's DayFoodShops and shoppingShopping tripsRelationshipsDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"
