And that’s before you consider the challenges …Lucy ManganWed 30 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt’sThe Traitorson a bus! It’sRace Across the Worldin blindfolds! It’s the BBC’s new reality competition series, Destination X!The premise is simple. A baker’s dozen of contestants assemble at Baden-Baden airport in Germany, from where they are transported via helicopter and a luxuriously appointed coach with blacked-out windows to various mysterious locations in Europe – one an episode – taking part in challenges en route to earn clues to help them work out where they are. At the end of each episode, the contestants enter the “map room” and indicate where they think they are by placing an X. The person who is least accurate is thrown under the bus. The overall winner will net £100,000.The US version is presented byJeffrey Dean Morgan– an unsettling choice for those of us who associate him inextricably with his grotesquely violent character in The Walking Dead, but perhaps Americans feel the need to be protected as they venture into the wilds of Europe in a way that, even post-Brexit, Britons do not. Whatever the reason, we have gone for a warmer, less armed-with-a-barbed-wire-wrapped-baseball-bat approach and given the gig toRob Brydon, in an array of natty suits. “I’m actually Anton Du Beke,” he jokes.The contestants are as carefully cast as ever. We have the sweet, hapless contingent – foremost among them 23-year-old James, who has been on holiday only once without his mum and dad and who describes himself, on this voyage predicated on deep geographical knowledge and cultural inference, as “not the best traveller”. We have the feelings-first brigade, led by poor Deborah, a crime author who is consumed by guilt and self-loathing when she is required to tell a white lie in pursuit of a competitive advantage. Then there are the terrifyingly competitive types, such as the endurance athlete Nick, who was the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world and fibrillates with energy and ambition (“I wouldn’t let a child win something, no”), and the surf school director Ben, hiding his tendencies a bit better under a bonhomous mien and a shock of blond hair. But we see you, Ben. This isn’t our first rodeo.Credit where it’s due, though – it’s Ben who takes one look at the tiny toilet on their coach and suggests they make it a rule that everyone has to sit down “for everything”. Ben has four children.View image in fullscreenThe ‘carefully cast’ contestants … Destination X.Photograph: BBC/TwoFourAs is now de rigueur in reality competition series, a good chunk of the cohort do not make it past the preliminary stage. Three of the 13 fail the first challenge and don’t even make it out of the departure lounge. The remaining 10 go on a disorienting 125-mile helicopter ride, during which Judith, a 28-year-old nuclear engineer, notes that they are flying backwards with the sun to their right and therefore probably southwards. Dawn reckons that flicking through her toddler’s atlas before she set out is likely to have given her the edge.The challenges and rewards are, of course, set up to sow division, requiring alliances and betrayals as the journey unfolds (“I think my competitiveness will alienate me,” says Nick). This will have to be enough to keep viewers watching, because the challenges are baffling. At one point, the contestants find themselves in a picture-lined cubicle in the middle of an unknown market square “bordered by two countries and influenced by all three” and must answer multipart questions to earn the right to peek out of one of two windows; one gives a clue to their location and the other is a red herring, with no way of discerning which is which. A further clue will be presented to the participant who has given the most right answers – although we don’t know what they are – who is then allowed to tell one other person what it is. Are we in Vienna? Or Amsterdam? It becomes slightly hallucinatory and I truly do not know what is going on.Viewers are invited to play along via QR codes and place their own Xs in a virtual map room. This is more involvement in my small-screen entertainment than I like to undertake. But have at it if that’s what floats your boat – possibly down a Dutch canal. Also, where do they speak Flemish, because the local people sound very unusual here, but the street signs are in French, despite there being a Café Mozart – what gives?Destination X does not close like a vice around you in the manner of The Traitors, nor does it have the cockle-warming aspect of Race Across the World. But it’s fun to go along for the ride.Destination X aired onBBCOne and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVRob BrydonBBCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her line to Paltrow eventually fell silent, and her book,Gwyneth, has just been published to much buzz, without the star’s participation. Paltrow, a source claimed to Odell, “inventedghosting”.Now, post-publication, you can picture dozens more being cast out of her golden glow. Odell spoke to more than 220 people for her book, on and off the record; more rebuffed her. “Many were terrified to talk about Gwyneth,” she writes.The result is nonetheless thoughtful, fair and fastidiously researched – even without Paltrow’s oversight. It is also brimming over with gossip. Here are 10 standout topics.Gwyneth Paltrow may be the signature nepo babyPaltrow’s pedigree makes many of the “nepo babies” (lately singled outfor havingbeen given a leg-upinto Hollywood) look like competition winners. Her mother, Blythe Danner, is a critically acclaimed actor of stage and screen (best known to a younger generation as the mother in Meet the Parents). She met Bruce Paltrow when he was producing one of her plays.Gwyneth and her younger brother, Jake, grew up in a five-storey brownstone close to Central Park in New York. She attended the Spence school, a private girls’ school on the Upper East Side, along with Mick Jagger’s daughter Jade and the princesses Alexandra and Olga of Greece (“their last name just ‘of Greece’,” adds Odell).Her parents’ connections came into play before she had even finished school. For her senior project, she covered a Bonnie Raitt song – accompanied by Steely Dan’s singer, Donald Fagen. Soon after, at 19, she landed a speaking part in Hook, directed by Steven Spielberg – her godfather, “Uncle Morty”. (He called her “Gwynnie the Pooh”.)Many years later, Paltrow would tell Vanity Fair that fame had felt to her “like a predestined thing” – that she had known her “whole life that this was going to happen”.View image in fullscreenBlythe Danner, Gwyneth, Bruce and Jake Paltrow in 1991.Photograph: Jim Smeal/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesHer parents tried to give her a normal childhood. Sort of …Blythe and Bruce weren’t as confident that acting would work out, Odell writes: they wanted their daughter to have “a backup plan”. After Paltrow was rejected from Vassar College, her parents asked their friend, two-time Academy Award-winner Michael Douglas, to put in a word at his alma mater. She was accepted by the University of California, Santa Barbara (Douglas gets it done!), but ended up dropping out. Studying film, she had been dismayed to find Uncle Morty on the syllabus. “I’m sitting here learning about people I know,” another aspiring actor recalls Paltrow complaining.Bruce cut her off financially, and she was forced to get a waitressing gig (though again, through her parents’ connections). “I remember she was so mad about it,” the actor told Odell. Years later – after she had won an Oscar forShakespeare in Love, broken off her engagement to Brad Pitt and gone, according to one account, “totally Hollywood” – Bruce sought again to keep his daughter humble, telling her she’d become “kind of an asshole”. Paltrow was “devastated”, she said, but eventually grateful for the course correction. Fame had gone to her head, she admitted: “There is nothing worse for the growth of a human being than not having obstacles and disappointments.”It pays to know your beluga from your oscietraPitt and Paltrow met in 1993, auditioning for Legends of the Fall. She was passed over for the part but made an impression on Pitt, who went on to suggest she play his character’s wife in David Fincher’s Se7en. Paltrow had also been offered Feeling Minnesota alongside Keanu Reeves. As she dithered, a helpful friend suggested: “Who do you want to date, Brad Pitt or Keanu Reeves?” Paltrow said yes to Se7en. Not long into filming, she and Pitt were together – delighting her father, who reportedly crowed to a friend: “Can you believe my daughter? It’s fucking Brad Pitt!”View image in fullscreenGolden couple … Paltrow and Pitt at the Ivy, London, in the early 1990s.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAccording to Odell, Paltrow was never so certain, finding Pitt – from a southern, conservative, religious background – a bit beneath her. “When we go to restaurants and order caviar, I have to say to Brad, ‘This is beluga and this is oscietra,’” she told an interviewer.After two years together, they broke off their engagement. She went on to date Ben Affleck, who she found to be more her intellectual match (not to mention – as she disclosedonly in 2023– a “technically excellent” lover). But Affleck’s addiction issues, penchant for video games and what one of Paltrow’s friends remembers as his “kind of miserable” vibe prevented the relationship from progressing.Before there was Brad, Ben or Chris, there were cigsCigarettes may have been Paltrow’s first love. She started smoking in her first year at Spence, much to Bruce’s displeasure. Seeking to get his teenage daughter to quit, he once again leaned on his connections, calling in a favour with his friend’s son’s new wife – AKA Madonna – asking her to “write a note to Gwyneth to discourage her”. According to Odell, Madonna happily played model, describing her average day: “I wake up, I don’t smoke … And I go home a happy healthy me. … PS: Good girls live longer.”View image in fullscreenOn a cigarette break while filming Great Expectations.Photograph: Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGwyneth showed the letter off at school, then displayed it, framed, in her bedroom – and continued to smoke “a pack a day, probably” until she was 25. She eventually quit in September 1997 after spending three days marooned on a deserted island in Belize. Paltrow had requested the experience as a condition of guest-editing an issue of Marie Claire. Magazine budgets were bigger back then.Paltrow was Weinstein’s ‘golden girl’ – before she helped bring him downOdell describes Paltrow as being ambivalent about fame – and scornful of “tacky, pointless, big, fluffy, unimportant movies”. She found her professional home in Miramax Films, Harvey Weinstein’s production company, after being cast in the 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma. Odell describes Weinstein working hard to make Paltrow a star, throwing his formidable weight and influence behind her Oscar bid for Shakespeare in Love. Her 1999 triumph over Cate Blanchett (nominated for Elizabeth) was later attributed to Weinstein’s intense campaign. Even Paltrow had her doubts, betting a pair of CAA agents $10,000 she wouldn’t win. (She made good, going to the bank the morning after the ceremony.)But being Weinstein’s “golden girl” didn’t come without costs, least of all pressure to do lacklustre parts or press. As Paltrow told the New York Times for their seismic #MeToo report, early in her working relationship with Weinstein, he made a pass at her at a Beverly Hills hotel. (Weinstein disputed her account.) In their book She Said, the journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey describe Paltrow’s pivotal role in their investigation. “When so many other actresses were reluctant to get on the phone and scared to tell the truth … Gwyneth was actually one of the first.”She was one of the first women we love to hateAs well as having been born rich, beautiful and well connected, Paltrow is described by Odell as possessing some “exceptional, if hard to define” X-factor, registering as far back as her school days. This worked against her as much as it did in her favour. Even before becoming an Oscar winner aged 26, Paltrow feared overexposure in the press. Hertearful acceptance speech, coupled with news that her father bought her the diamond necklace she’d been loaned for the ceremony, turned the public against her.Building women up before tearing them down is now a well-worn cycle, Odell notes, pointing to Anne Hathaway and Blake Lively (you might also add Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Swift). Paltrow was one of the first victims, if not the blueprint. In 2013, she was named Star magazine’s most hated celebrity, 19 spots above Chris Brown, who had been arrested for assaulting Rihanna four years earlier. “Gwyneth would never manage to outrun” the contempt, Odell writes – perhaps influencing her subsequent decision to make it work for her with Goop.It is interesting how different people’s bodies areView image in fullscreenWith Jack Black in Shallow Hal.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxPaltrow was ahead of the curve with many modern movements and trends; body positivity was emphatically not one of them. Schoolmates recall her evident “disdain for fat people”. One remembered changing into swimsuits next to the “naturally skinny” Gwyneth, and her comment: “Isn’t it interesting how different people’s bodies are?” In her senior yearbook, alongside Gwyneth’s chosen quote from Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, editors specified her nightmare: “Obesity”. Later, when she was famous, she allegedly paid for a school friend to undergo an abdominoplasty (or “tummy tuck”).Paltrow’s defining interest in healthy eating, alternative medicine and “wellness” began after her father was diagnosed with throat cancer. While caring for Bruce, she began researching preservatives, pesticides and environmental toxins; she started following a macrobiotic diet and doing nearly two hours of yoga before dawn, six days a week. Meanwhile, she was also shooting Shallow Hal, “spending her working hours in a fat suit”, Odell observes. Doing press, Paltrow described the film as a “love letter”, and the experience of making it as edifying. “I got a real sense of what it would be like to be that overweight, and every pretty girl should be forced to do that.”Paltrowinvented wellness – for Goop and badAlong with her passion for “alternative” ideas of health, the seeds for Goop had been sown years earlier, on the sets of Jefferson in Paris and The Talented Mr Ripley. In Paris and Ischia, Paltrow tapped local crew for their recommendations for the best hotels, restaurants and shopping on location – insider info around which she would later build a lifestyle brand. In 2007, she shot a public television show about Spanish cuisine – “a novel premise” at the time, Odell notes (and one that riled the late Anthony Bourdain,who said of the series: “Why would you go to Spain with the one bitch who refuses to eat ham?”).Paltrow was married to Coldplay’s Chris Martin by then, with two young children, and she was beginning to tire of acting. After the success of Iron Man in 2008, she turned to her side project: an online newsletter. Goop sought to “nourish the inner aspect”, but timing was not on its side. The website launched the week after the stock market crash; Jezebel declared Paltrow “about as publicly savvy as Marie Antoinette”. Yet she was proved right in her instinct to let them eat banana-nut muffins (her inaugural recipe). In 2008, the wellness industry “was barely even measured”, Odell writes; today it is valued in the trillions.There’s no controversy you can’t style out. Even an ‘eccentric stone sex egg’Paltrow was probably one of the first celebrities to conceive of herself as a brand, paving the way for today’s saturation of product lines and endorsement deals – and shaping consumer culture. Among the trends and treatments she helped to popularise were Spanx, cupping, gluten-free diets and, more recently,mouth-taping.View image in fullscreenThe infamous Yoni Egg.Photograph: GoopEven the bonkers ones took off with Goop’s endorsement. After a “vaginal steaming” treatment featured in its 2015 Santa Monica city guide, bookings doubled. Odell describes Paltrow being unfazed by controversy, and even relishing it as good for business. In 2017, Goop went viral for featuring an egg-shaped stone, designed to be inserted vaginally and worn (?) overnight (!) so as to “balance the cycle” and “invigorate our life force”.In a staff meeting, Paltrow was reportedly staunch in the face of ridicule: “Goop defined the concept of modern wellness … Let’s own it.” Once again, she was right. The company had ordered 600 “Yoni” eggs; after the backlash, the waiting list to buy them, for about $60 each, was 2,000 names long. When Goop was sued the next year by regulators for making allegedly unlawful health claims,Paltrow chose to pay $145,000 to settle, without admitting wrongdoing; the claims about the eggs disappeared from Goop’s website, but they were still on sale earlier this year.Dubious claims pay – and Paltrow always winsOdell notes the irony: for all Paltrow’s enthusiasm to factcheck her biography, she was not so exacting or hands-on with the articles published on Goop. Among the famously dubious claims platformed by the site were the healing powers of celery juice and raw (unpasteurised) goat milk, a possible link between bras and breast cancer, and every word uttered by Anthony William, the so-called “medical medium”. (“We used him when we needed page views,” one former Goop employee admitted to Odell.)Gwyneth: The Biography by Amy Odell review – Gwyn and bear itRead moreOdell makes a valiant effort to factcheck every claim she references in her book, quoting medical experts and Paltrow’s many critics to counterbalance all the Goop. But, at a certain point in the narrative, you sense it become futile: wellness is no longer a celebrity foible, a trapping of “Gwyneth’s extravagant and eccentric life”, but the water we are all drowning in. On social media, influencers – many in Paltrow’s image – spread advice with little oversight or regulation, while trends have had to become more extreme to cut through the noise. After 20 years of Goop, the world has become harder to shock, more receptive to “alternative” ideas of health and medicine, and even sceptical of science. Today the wellness industry is as big as the US pharmaceutical and agricultural industries combined.By stoking fear about “toxins”, encouraging people to “do their own research” and seeding distrust in the medical establishment, Paltrow – Odell suggests – paved the way for the conspiratorial, anti-expert, post-truth thinking now embedded in Donald Trump’s White House. Both Paltrow and Robert F Kennedy Jr – Trump’s vaccine sceptic secretary for health and human services – are avowed fans of raw milk; the real harbinger of end-times will be if she starts eating red meat.Meanwhile, Paltrow continues to sail through with the seemingly untouchable self-belief that has made her such a compelling celebrity to adore, abhor and emulate. “She is fucking borderline brilliant,” Odell quotes a former Goop executive as saying. “GP knows exactly what she’s doing.”Explore more on these topicsGwyneth PaltrowBiography booksShakespeare in LovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Although the possible connection is still being untangled, study co-author and audiologistNicholas Reedadvises prioritizing hearing health regardless.“There are already more than enough established benefits related to hearing care,” says Reed, a faculty member of the NYU LangoneHealthOptimal Aging Institute.What’s especially important about supporting hearing health is the effect it has on keeping people engaged in the world, Reed explains. Here’s what experts recommend in order to support your hearing as you age.How does hearing loss occur?Hearing loss can result from awide rangeof genetic and environmental factors, such as chronic diseases andsmoking. Some also experience age-related hearing loss, calledpresbycusis.Hearing loss is “not about volume”, Reed explains. Instead, it’s a clarity issue. We lose our hearing at different frequencies at different rates, which can make sounds garbled.I thought I was a bad listener. Turns out, I couldn’t hearRead moreThere is a tendency to “normalize hearing loss as we age to some extent”, says Reed. Other conditions can seem more pressing, and hearing loss becomes a low priority. There can be “downstream effects” in a healthcare context because hearing loss can hinder patient-provider communication, says Reed.What is the relationship between hearing loss and dementia?Early research suggests that hearing loss is associated withincreased cognitive declineandan increased risk of new cases of dementia, although further studies are needed to understand this connection. Researchers have not, however, found a cause-and-effect relationship between hearing loss and dementia.Reed and his colleagues wanted tocalculate the number of cases of dementiathere could be in a population if a potential risk factor, in this case hearing loss, was eliminated. They used a sample of nearly 3,000 adults aged 66 to 90 and found 32% of the dementia risk in the sample group was potentially associated with audiometric hearing loss (hearing loss measured through testing).According to the authors, these results suggest that treating hearing loss may delay the onset of dementia in some older adults. However, this research cannot establish whether hearing loss causes dementia, explains co-author Jason Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina.One potential reason hearing loss is associated with cognitive changes is that it can lead to more social isolation, which may strain the brain and affect memory, says Reed. Another theory is that because auditory signals stimulate the brain, the lack of stimulation caused by hearing loss can lead to acceleratedbrain atrophy.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’If hearing problems are linked to an increased risk of dementia, are there ways toreduce that risk?An influential 2020 Lancetreportrecommended the use of hearing aids and protecting ears from excessive noise exposure. A 2023analysisfound a connection between the use of devices like hearing aids and a decreased risk of cognitive decline. However,further research is needed.What can you do to prevent hearing loss?Hearing loss is not an inevitable part of ageing. But certainfactors, such as age-related changes to the inner ear and auditory nerve, as well as genetics, are beyond our control.We can still mitigate the likelihood of damage from other causes. For example, we can manage conditions associated with hearing loss, such ashigh blood pressureanddiabetes. We can also limit exposure to sources ofdamaging noise, like construction equipment, lawn mowers, motorcycles and loud music. Small actions, like protecting your hearing at a loud concert with over-ear headphones, which Reed prefers to earplugs, can have a big impact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Establishing a baseline can help you identify changes over time, and indicate if and when new habits might be useful. The longer you live with impaired hearing, the harder it is to adjust to tools like hearing aids.Is it possible to reverse hearing loss?Several treatments and devices can help alleviate hearing loss, but their effectiveness depends on the individual. If you suspect you have hearing issues, it’s best to have your hearing checked and discuss options with your healthcare provider.Hearing aids can be purchasedover-the-counteror with a prescription. Reed says learning how to wear them takestime and practice. There’s a critical public health need toexpand coveragefor these tools, says Smith, because it’s well-established that hearing aids can improve quality of life.While studies haven’t proven that hearing aids will delay dementia, scientists are intrigued by their potential to support brain health.“The idea is that, in theory, if a person uses hearing aids, communication becomes easier and you lower the burden of cognitive load,” says Reed. “You’re stimulating the brain with more auditory signals.”Staying engaged in social networks is key to maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, says Reed. In a 2025study,Reed and colleagues found that, among people with hearing loss, participants who received hearing aids and were counseled on their use experienced less loneliness and social isolation. They also had more varied types of connections, such as friends, family and acquaintances.Similarly, assistivetechnologiesmay help. These range widely in function and design, but generally amplify sound, reduce background noise, and improve communication. For example,appsthat convert speech to text can assist with phone calls, and personal amplifiers can enhance hearing in conversations. People with mild to moderate hearing loss may find some relief in settings like crowded restaurants through items like the Apple AirPods Pro 2, whichfeature a built-in hearing aid, says Reed.In some instances, what can help a person manage hearing loss best is how they are supported by their community. There’s a need for more equitable environments that support people with sensory health needs, says Smith.“Some communication tips can go really far,” says Reed. “Good communication is looking someone in the face. It’s speaking slowly. It’s about rephrasing and adding context.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe joys of ageingHealthAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is 8.53am at the La Finca resort on the Costa Blanca, about 30C and the warm-up has very much been and gone. This a six-minute all-out run. “They call it Mas because at the end you’re just praying for it to finish,” says a smiling Keith Hill, one of the referee coaches observing the session with Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer.Part of Webb wishes he had a time machine, so he could teleport here a minibus of referees at their peak in 2003, when he joined thePremier Leaguelist, to witness the evolution of training. Now they run approximately 12km a game and use technology such as Playermaker, straps that attach to boots and can read running gaits, track how quickly officials change direction and identify injuries. Scott Ledger, who has been an assistant referee on more than 500 Premier League games, is wearing boots fit for the occasion, Adidas Copa Mundials decorated with the Spanish flag. This is day three of a five-day pre-season camp but the Mas is the main event from a physical perspective.Premier League holds talks with Ifab over plans to introduce Ref Cams next seasonRead moreFor 63 officials, including 19 Premier League referees, all in identical navy kit, the exercise runs simultaneously in two waves on the upper and lower pitches. Two others are doing rehab on Wattbikes and a handful are missing owing to Club World Cup and Women’s Euro 2025 duty. Some officials here are on the PGMO’s development programme, including Elliot Bell, son of the former Accrington assistant manager Jimmy. At a glance it looks like an elite club at work, the giveaway the absence of balls or nets. “Players want to be in the starting XI, officials want to be in the starting 10 on the Premier League team sheet for that first match round,” Webb says.The aim? To run as far as possible and earn a place on the top-10 leaderboards on display. Those tables also show maximum velocity, with some officials hitting about 33km/h; last season Micky van de Ven was clocked as the fastest player in the Premier League at 37.12km/h, with Anthony Elanga and Bryan Mbeumo joint-second at 36.65km/h. Last season top-flight officials recorded almost 350km of runs of at least 20km/h.Bunce believes the gap between players and officials is shrinking. “You don’t want to be near the bottom of the list,” says Peter Bankes, the coming season his seventh as a top-flight referee. “We’re a team, in the trenches together at times, we can have good weekends and bad weekends. But we’re also striving for the big games, the big appointments, to go to tournaments, to do cup finals. There has to be that competitive edge. These weeks are perfect for that.”Bankes officiated about 75 matches last season. He refereed 30 games, 23 in the Premier League, and also had fourth official and VAR appointments, the latter at home and abroad. Building robustness is crucial. “We don’t want to just cope in games but perform,” says Matt Willmott, the PGMO’s lead performance coach. Hill, affiliated with PGMO for more than 30 years, says the aim is to establish unconscious competence regarding physical demands. “If you’re not worrying about those, you can focus purely on decision-making and it puts you in a better position,” says Wade Smith, who is heading into his fifth season as a Premier League assistant referee. “It goes hand in hand with being more accurate.”View image in fullscreenOfficials take part in weight training during pre-season training in Spain.Photograph: Phil GreigIs fixture congestion a problem for officials, too? “If you feel you’re tired and you need a bit of rest and recovery there are conversations to be had: ‘We can take you off the field, rest you altogether,’” says Bankes. “That probably didn’t happen years ago. Now I think people are much more professional to say: ‘Next week’s the one where I probably just need a little bit of a breather.’”Arne Slot introduced the Mas test at Liverpool last summer and Premier League players target at least 1,800m, a figure eclipsed by some referees. The officials did the test twice before flying to Spain but this one provides support staff with up-to-date metrics. “Twenty seconds [to go], let’s get every last metre out of you,” says Simon Breivik, the head of physical performance. “And hold it there,” says Elliot Fletcher, a sports scientist, triggering a kind of musical statues as the GPS numbers, from PlayerData, feed into his iPad. Officials make a beeline for Fletcher in pursuit of their scores, which, Bunce says, they can access via an app whether in Carlisle or Kazakhstan.“I really scrutinise my data,” says Bankes, grabbing a water bottle from the ice bucket. Lewis Smith, one of six officials on the supplementary list, which straddles the Premier League and EnglishFootball League, uses and hands out cold flannels and Andy Madley and Tony Harrington exchange high-fives. Those who have just finished, including Thomas Bramall and John Busby, turn supporters as the next batch begin. “Go on Akil [Howson], get to that next pole, final few metres,” says Willmott, the end near.Smoothies packed with fruit, spinach, whey protein and almond butter aid recovery. Is there a superfood? Cacao, says Vicky Smith, a senior sports scientist, because it is rich in magnesium: “We want to put premium fuel in premium engines.” Times have changed, body fats have plummeted. Not so long ago clubs offered referees Budweiser and pizza after matches. Steve Martin, whose father, Andy, and grandfather Geoff were top-flight officials, is happy after hitting 31km/h in a drill, a personal best. “I was up against one of the newer guys so I was thinking: ‘I need to beat him,’” says Martin, who predominantly referees in the Championship. “I haven’t been injured since I went professional [in 2016] – the right nutrition helps.”View image in fullscreenSenior sports scientists Vicky Smith leads the officials in stretching exercises.Photograph: Phil GreigSo, how is the Mas test known among officials? “We call it hell,” says Howson, grinning. It is approaching two years since Howson became the top flight’s first black official since Uriah Rennie, whose funeral Webb and several others attended on the Monday after their return. “We want to push each other to the end. It can be lonely out there as an official but we know how hard we work to get to those top standards. Now it is out of the way, there are a lot more smiles.”The Premier League, with a following of almost 2 billion, is the most-watched sports league in the world, and so many eyes mean an avalanche of opinion. The noise around decisions can be ceaseless. Officiating, Webb says, has never been so challenging. David Coote,the referee sacked by PGMOlast year after being found in “serious breach” of his contract, said he took cocaine as an “escape route … from the stresses, the relentlessness of the job”. Coote said struggles with his sexuality also contributed to“really poor choices”.“We had a difficult situation last year with one of our officials, part of the refereeing family and somebody we care about as a human being,” Webb says. “We know the job they do is done under a brighter spotlight than ever. There is undoubtedly a lower level of forgiveness … if someone doesn’t agree with a decision, then they’re not slow or shy to comment upon that. They have a vehicle now to do so and the way some people do that is pretty inappropriate. Because of the extra scrutiny, we have to ensure that officials are supported.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pelling explains how referees have scheduled one-on-one chats – “there isn’t an option to completely opt out because we want to normalise it” – but some naturally lean on professional help more frequently than others. Martin tells how he used it to “mentally park” a tough game last season. Visibility is important. “Rather than being boxed-off in a room that no one else can see and it’s this secret support service,” Pelling says, adding how “corridor conversations” help build rapport. “Asking someone a question as simple as: ‘How are you?’ You’re very aware that someone might go: ‘Actually, things aren’t going very well.’”Webb is clear. “Reaching out for help – because confidence is low or because of an issue at home or because you’ve made a decision that has created a lot of negative attention, which can be really quite tense – is not a sign of weakness or going to affect your appointments. We don’t want guys to suffer in silence and just think: ‘I’ll get through it.’”Refereesare higher-profile than ever. The officials are permitted to use social media but must adhere to guidelines. “We don’t want to celebritise referees, we want to humanise them,” Webb says.Criticism is commonplace. “If I had £1 for every time someone shouted: ‘You’re not in line, lino,’ I’d be a millionaire,” says Wade Smith. “You become hyper-focused on the game and it’s amazing how many people say: ‘Do you not hear all the people shouting behind you?’ A lot of the time, you don’t.” Madley, whose younger brother, Bobby, is also on camp, describes the job as a “peak and trough industry”, saying: “I’ve made decisions on a Saturday and I’ve had to question if I’m in the right shape and state of mind to referee again seven days later … There are times you feel low, you might have had a decision, game or games not going so well. You need that professional advice: ‘This is how we can get you back on the bike,’ whether it is after an injury or a decision you can’t shake off, because we do carry them quite heavily.”There is also something of a myth to bust. “It’s not necessarily just the bad times; you need them in the good times as well because you have to keep your feet on the floor,” says Bankes. “You are emotionally drained if a high-profile incident has not gone your way and that is where the psychological support is invaluable … you can really delve into your game and look into how you felt at the time afterwards and think: ‘How can I learn from that?’ When I was coming through the system, if I had a rough moment you were pretty much on your own and had to confide in your family. Now there is so much support in place.”It is 11am in a conference room and the PGMO’s technical director, Adam Gale-Watts, plays a music video of the rock band Toto, pausing just before Hold the Line hits the chorus. By that point most had cottoned on to the song choice. It is in these kinds of one-and-a-half-hour sessions where officials get to grips with new regulations. Hugh Dallas, a former referee and now coach, and Webb, take it in turns to stimulate debate and pose questions. Gale-Watts, a former assistant referee, runs through the eight-second rule for goalkeepers to release the ball, a further clampdown on time-wasting. “We’re looking for a sensible application,” says Dallas. Madley says they are training to make the countdown clear for teams and fans. Then there is the “captains-only” approach to major decisions, to prevent referees being swamped by players. “We’re not going to cut off all dialogue with other players,” Bankes says.The officials are shown contrasting examples of referees trying to defuse a confrontation and reminded of the importance of strong body language. Dallas reiterates the need to shut out the noise that comes with the territory. “In the penalty area, you need to hear silence,” he says. Webb, after a clip of a decision that divides the room, uses another analogy. “Look for the smoking gun,” he says.View image in fullscreenGPS numbers, from PlayerData, measures performance and can be accessed via an app.Photograph: Phil GreigLast season brought thepilot of stadium announcementsfor VAR decisions and semi-automated offside technology. VAR, introduced in the Premier League in 2019-20, continues to make a splash. Last season, an independent panel recorded 18 VAR errors, down from 31 in 2023-24. “I know it’s almost like a bellwether for how successful we are officiating,” Webb says.Webb highlights how other, subtler rule changes have increased demands. “Playing a goal-kick or defensive free-kick within your own penalty area,” he says, alluding to how the “high-risk, high-reward” of playing out from the back can quickly spark big decisions at both ends. “I could stand on the halfway line, wait for the aerial ball to land, watch for a [No] 9 on [No] 5 challenge ... is there an elbow, a push in the back? The game is wholly different now.”Matt Donohue is an EFL referee and Premier League VAR who progressed through a dedicated programme designed to widen the pool of VARs. “I understand how it can be seen as a moth to the flame,” he says of the VAR’s job. Is it hard to replicate the pressures of match-day, like a penalty shootout? “England have probably proven when they have taken practice seriously and purposefully … how much they improved in the Southgate era and we have replicated that. We’re having a positive impact – VAR errors are at an all-time low.”What is it like to be a Premier League official in this era? “On the school run on a Monday morning people know you as the referee,” Donohue says. Referees are rarely praised compared with those with whom they share a pitch. “People might think the prime minister should get a little bit of love for what he’s doing but I don’t think he sits there at night thinking he should,” Donohue says. “We’re doing the job we love.”Explore more on these topicsRefereesPremier LeagueFootball LeagueLaws of footballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To be fair, Neeson has more career capital to lose than Nielsen did. He deadpans it impeccably, but perhaps doesn’t quite have Nielsen’s eerie innocence. In any case, it doesn’t stop this reboot of the Naked Gun franchise from being a lot of fun: amiably ridiculous, refreshingly shallow, entirely pointless and guilelessly crass. It is a life-support system for some outrageous gags, including sensational riffs on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sex and the City, and one showstopping are-they-really-gonna-do-it reference to OJ Simpson, who featured in the original films.David Zucker, co-creator of those and the Airplane! films, isreportedly dissatisfied with this new versionfrom the team of director Akiva Schaffer and co-writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand. A spoof of a spoof is always going to be a potential problem, but Schaffer et al canter entertainingly through their succession of absurdist scenarios – and at one stage contrive a classic Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker homage: a moment of mayhem followed by a wide-shot of people queueing up obediently for violence, like Airplane!’s line of (hitherto unseen) passengers.Neeson plays Det Lt Frank Drebin Jr, who is the son of the LA cop once played by Nielsen, and haunted in a rather Freudian way by his late father’s reputation. He is given to making yearning monologues addressed to Drebin Sr’s presence, begging him to send a sign “like an owl or something”. Paul Walter Hauser plays his stolid partner Capt Ed Hocken Jr, son of Drebin Sr’s partner who was once played by George Kennedy. The next-gen Drebin investigates the possible murder of a man found dead at the wheel of a hi-tech electric car, and must confront the sinister Muskalike plutocrat who invented this vehicle; this is Richard Cane, played byDanny Huston.Drebin then falls in love with the dead man’s sister Beth, a true-crime novelist played byPamela Anderson. When Drebin first sees Beth, he has an ecstatic voiceover about what I can only describe as her person; it finishes with a quite extraordinarily bizarre and offensive tribute which caused the audience I was in to go into gibbering shock. The memory of this amusing line recurred like PTSD throughout the film’s running time.The new Naked Gun has the look and feel of an 80s LA action movie, with sense-memories of Beverly Hills Cop and Terminator. The first rush of Frank and Beth’s romance is represented by an uproariously extended winter-sports-themed pop video of the sort beloved by Wham! fans. There is no reason for this new Naked Gun to exist other than the reason for the old ones: it’s a laugh, disposable, forgettable, enjoyable.The Naked Gun is out on 1 August in the UK and US, and on 21 August in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCrime filmsLiam NeesonPamela AndersonDanny HustonComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The past couple of years have looked pretty deadly for the once-ubiquitous American superhero movie, with just two such films placing on the list of 2024’s top-grossing movies in the US, and three in 2023. (2022 had as many as both of those years combined on its own list, and the top four of 2021 were all superhero-led.) More than the lack of hits – Deadpool & Wolverine certainly made enough on its own to encourage another decade of team-ups – the genre has been threatened by a growing number of flops. Sequels to blockbusters like Joker and Aquaman nosedived from their predecessors. Would-be franchise starters like The Flash, Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter failed to spark any interest. Even aMarvelmovie literally called The Marvels underperformed.The Fantastic Four: First Steps – the best origins movie Marvel has made in years? Discuss with spoilersRead more2025 seemed to follow this trend line, with Marvel’s Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts both underwhelming at the box office. Even reviews, so often prone to giving MCU entries a pass and conferring upon them a sense of unearned prestige, didn’t seem to move the needle much: Thunderbolts got much better notices, and that plus a plum summer-kickoff release date were good for … well, slightly less money than the terrible Captain America sequel. But this July, things have been looking up. Specifically, up in the sky: DC kicked off their new cinematic universe with aSupermanmovie, just as it did in 2013 with Man of Steel, only this time, audiences and critics seem to actually like it as their signature hero flies past $500m worldwide in less than 20 days. Meanwhile, another reboot of the cursed-seeming Fantastic Four didn’t seem like a sure thing. But Marvel’s The Fantastic Four: First Steps is hitting numbers similar to Superman. It will probably pass both of its corporate siblings within a couple of weeks.So what did the two biggest superhero brands do so right this summer? “Make good movies” is always an easy answer, but an unhelpfully subjective one. For example, Thunderbolts seemed to have audiences and critics in its favor, too. As it happens, these newest incarnations of Superman and The Fantastic Four have something more concrete in common. They’re both rooted in the Silver Age of comics, which lasted from 1956 to 1970 and featured more superheroes, more outlandish foes, and a lot of fantastical sci-fi, monsters and genre-bending. Most of Marvel’s most beloved characters were introduced during this period, ushered in by the debut of the Fantastic Four in 1961, and a world where Superman casually interacts with a litany of other heroes (and/or fights giant monsters) is more visible in Silver Age comics.View image in fullscreenDavid Corenswet in Superman.Photograph: © 2025 Warner Bros. Entertainment. All Rights Reserved. TM & © DCGeneral audiences wouldn’t know the Silver Age from the Silver Surfer (or even, necessarily, that the latter is the name of a CG character played by Julia Garner in the new Fantastic Four movie). But they may nonetheless pick up on some of its stylistic advantages. First, there’s an assumption that audiences don’t need a grand retelling of an origin story – and that somewhat counterintuitively, it will be easy for newcomers to jump into these stories without much background knowledge. Superman and Fantastic Four explain their heroes’ origins in passing, but don’t make it the subject of the movie, and assume, seemingly correctly, that audiences don’t need to be reoriented in their worlds just because they have robots, flying cars and/or superdogs. As wild as some of the Silver Age stories were (and as serialized as some of its biggest characters eventually became), early on there was little expectation that a kid would absolutely need to read 20 or 30 previous issues before picking up the latest adventure from the drugstore.“Kid” is the other key element here: Superman and Fantastic Four both look like bright, zippy adventures with kid appeal, and they mostly are, give or take some baby peril and one nasty execution. That appeal isn’t always enough on its own. (No one seemed to notice or care that The Marvels made for a fine kids’ movie.) But both Fantastic Four and especially Superman seem to accept a variation on the old Pauline Kael quote about movies being so rarely great art that you must appreciate great trash: Superhero pictures are so rarely multifaceted and nuanced movies for grownups that they ought to at least be movies that are actually fun for kids. Can you picture a child watching Captain America: Brave New World?That also ties back into the relatively stand-alone nature of Superman and The Fantastic Four: an 11-year-old in 2025 isn’t necessarily going to go to the movies having looked over a whole syllabus of lore. Decent as it is, Thunderbolts is partially a sequel to Black Widow, and features characters whose previous adventures were chronicled in two different TV shows and an unrelated Ant-Man sequel. It’s legible without seeing all of those predecessors first, but does it make sense without any of them? Fantastic Four does! Well, at least until a mid-credits teaser scene whose portent has no in-movie, in-world context for people unfamiliar with comic books or, at minimum, industry press releases.In those few minutes, the Fantastic Four movie also teases how easily DC and Marvel could unlearn these lessons. Marvel doesn’t exactly have a reformed lineup of newly stand-alone adventures in the pipeline. Quite the opposite: the next MCU film, due out in a year, is a fourth Spider-Man movie starring Tom Holland. To be clear, no one has to worry about it hitting; Spider-Man and Batman are about as immune to superhero ills as possible. But Spidey co-parent Sony keeps those movies coming out at a steady clip, while Disney-owned Marvel remains in hot pursuit of something bigger than merely mixing new heroes, sequels, and occasional team-ups. They want another Avengers: Endgame.View image in fullscreenTom Holland in Spider-Man: No Way Home.Photograph: Matt Kennedy/APThe seeming superhero fatigue of the past few years has been, in part, a victim of the MCU’s massive success. That series barreled toward a quasi-finale event with Endgame in 2019, and has been laboring to convince fans that something equally massive is coming their way, rather than retraining them not to expect vast 30-character crossover events every few years. The most recent individual films featuring Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Thor were all big hits, as was an introduction to the character Shang-Chi. But only Spider-Man has a definite sequel on the horizon, the rest a victim of the baffling strategy to forgo normal sequels, instead running in a half-dozen directions at once before calling everyone back into the pool for another diptych of mega-crossovers: Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, coming Christmas 2026 and 2027. Obviously people will see these movies, especially with Robert Downey Jr returning to play Doctor Doom. But in their relentless pursuit of Endgame II: Endgamier, Marvel could be backing themselves into another corner. The Fantastic Four invites audiences to jump right into their alternate universe of retro-futuristic 1960s style. Doomsday and Secret Wars promise a huge event, a possible reset, and, what? Some fun superhero movies again in a few years, once the dust clears?DC, meanwhile, will revive some of the Superman supporting characters for a second season of Peacemaker (which, in a hilarious and unprecedented bit of confusion, follows up a first season that originated in a completely different DC Universe – the previous one, with the big Aquaman and Wonder Woman movies). Its next movie is Supergirl, featuring Superman’s cousin, who makes a brief preview appearance in the current film. The June 2026 project is based on Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, a comics miniseries that should, theoretically, stand alone; if anything, it’s a riff on the book and film True Grit more than any other DC lore. (Superman does not appear in its pages, though that could change for the movie.) That the Supergirl film is supposedly a direct adaptation is the most encouraging thing about it. Not because audiences particularly crave close adaptations of comic books they probably haven’t read and may be hard to translate to the screen, but because superhero movies have become so often inspired by each other, rather than the more stylistically diverse art that inspired them. Superhero origin stories may be passé, but returning to their origins as a century’s worth of comics may inspire some more life yet.Explore more on these topicsSuperhero moviesSuperman (Culture)Superman (Film)MarvelDC ComicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This effect can properly be regarded as an indirect consequence of the proscription order.”He continued: “I consider it reasonably arguable that the proscription order amounts to a disproportionate interference with the article 10 and article 11 (European convention of human rights) rights (freedom of expression and assembly, respectively) of the claimant and others.”The group’s co-founder, Huda Ammori, called it a “landmark decision … especially at a time when protesters – mostly elderly citizens – are being dragged off in police vans,held in detention for more than 24 hours, having their homes raided and face criminal prosecution, simply for holding signs that they oppose genocide and expressing their support for Palestine Action”.More than 200 people are believed to have been arrested since the 5 Julyban on Palestine Action, the first on a direct action group, placing it alongside the likes of Islamic State and Boko Haram.The three-day hearing in November will increase scrutiny on the decision-making of the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, and casts uncertainty over the fate of those recently arrested under the Terrorism Act in relation to Palestine Action – or who might be arrested in future.The Home Office had argued that the proper forum for Palestine Action to challenge the ban was the POAC (Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission), which parliament had designated precisely for that purpose, rather than judicial review.But Chamberlain said POAC would be unlikely to be able to hear the case before the middle of next year whereas a judicial review could be heard this autumn and there was a strong public interest for it to be determined authoritatively as soon as possible.Otherwise, people charged with criminal offences under the Terrorism Act might seek to challenge the legality of the proscription order in courts that might reach different decisions, creating “a recipe for chaos”, he said.The second ground on which Chamberlain granted permission for judicial review, in addition to concerns about freedom of speech and protest, was that Cooper had not consulted Palestine Action before proscribing it, finding it reasonably arguable that there was a duty to consult.The judge refused Ammori permission to challenge the government on six other grounds, including a claim that the home secretary had failed to gather sufficient information on Palestine Action’s activities or the impact of the proscription on people associated with the group.Chamberlain referred in his judgment to the “deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza”. He quoted froma joint statementlast week by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the foreign ministers of 27 other countries in which they said “the suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It concluded that the majority of Palestine Action’s activities would not be classified as terrorism on the grounds that the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added.Nonetheless JTAC concluded that Palestine Action should be banned, arguing that its protests had been escalating, citing three protests it said constituted acts of terrorism.Whitehall officials supported a ban too, but conceded that proscribing the group would be “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving series damage to property”.From late March officials recommended on a series of occasions that the group be banned, but Cooper made no firm decision, often requesting more information. On 14 May she backed the ban but two days later delayed implementing it as she wanted more details on Palestine Action’s recent activities.A Whitehall minute recorded that by 2.15pm on 20 June, Cooper had decided that Palestine Action was to be banned “at pace”.An application by Ammori’s lawyers to suspend the effect of the proscription order until the trial has taken place in November was rejected by Chamberlain. The judge also refused a request by the Home Office to bring an appeal over his decision about POAC.At last week’s hearing, lawyers for Ammori also highlighted the arrest of a man in Leeds for carryinga placard reproducing a graphic from Private Eyemagazine, which said: “Unacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes. Acceptable Palestine Action: shooting Palestinians queueing for food.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

While this could be enough to double the world’s renewable energy capacity from 2022, to reach 7.4 terawatts (TW) by 2030, governments would fall well below the 11TW needed to meet the UN goal of tripling renewables, according to the analysts.“Tripling global renewables capacity by 2030 is the single biggest action this decade to stay on track for the 1.5C climate pathway,” the report said. “Yet, despite the landmark Cop28 agreement to reach 11,000GW of renewables by 2030, national targets remain largely unchanged and fall short of what is needed.”The report found that beyond the EU only seven countries have updated their renewable energy goals since the pact was signed, including Mexico and Indonesia, which have watered down their targets.Countries that have failed to act include the US, China andRussia, which are some of the world’s largest energy users and together are responsible for almost half of the world’s annual carbon emissions.The fate of the world’s renewable energy deal may depend on the actions of Beijing, which is expected to finalise its 15th five-year plan for energy later this year, covering the period 2026-30. Washington and Moscow do not have renewable energy targets for 2030, and according to Ember their political leadersare not expected to set any.In India, clean energy targets have also remained unchanged, but the country’s ambition to build 500GW of renewables by 2030 is already aligned with the global goal to triple renewable energy capacity, the thinktank added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The problems raised fears of arepeat of chaos at airportsin August 2023 when hundreds of thousands of passengers’ flights were delayed or cancelled.British Airways said it was forced to restrict the number of its inbound and outbound flights at Heathrow to 32 an hour until 7.15pm. It said the flow rate would then return to the usual level of 45 an hour.It is understood that the UK National Cyber Security Centre does not view it as a hacking incident.Ryanair called for the Nats chief executive, Martin Rolfe, to resign or be fired. The airline’s chief operating officer, Neal McMahon, said: “It is outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats.“Yet another ATC system failure has resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of passengers’ travel plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have been learned since the August 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence.”He said if Rolfe failed to resign then the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, “must act without delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of Nats’ shambolic ATC service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to endure these preventable delays caused by persistent Nats failures”.At about 5pm Nats said its engineers had “restored the system that was affected” and it was “in the process of resuming normal operations”.The technical issue affected flights across the UK as the number of aircraft that could fly in England and Wales was restricted, the company said.The problem left many aircraft and flight crew out of position. Airports advised passengers to check with airlines for updates. Liverpool’s John Lennon airport said that Wednesday’s remaining flights could face delays.Several flights scheduled to arrive at UK airports were required to fly in holding patterns or divert elsewhere. Nats said the technical issue was at its control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire.Alexander said: “I am aware of a technical issue which impacted Nats’ operations causing travel disruption this afternoon. I have been informed systems have now been restored but continued disruption is expected, and passengers should check with individual airports for advice.”More than 700,000 passengers suffered disruption when flights were grounded at UK airports on 28 August 2023 after Nats experienced a technical glitch while processing a flight plan.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Established in 2016 to tackle late payments, the watchdog will also be able to carry out spot checks, verify claims and impose deadlines to clear a backlog of disputes.As part of a widerLabourdrive to provide more support for small businesses, Reynolds will also announce startup loans for 69,000 companies worth £4bn “to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners”.The move is backed by the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is keen to focus on rebooting the economy after two consecutive months of negative growth andmounting speculation about tax rises.According to the Office for National Statistics, the economy contracted by 0.1% in May after a 0.3% monthly fall in April.Sir Keir said it was important for the government to support small- and medium-sized firms, which employ 60% of the workforce and generate £2.8tn in turnover.“From builders and electricians to freelance designers and manufacturers, too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best, growing their businesses.“It’s unfair, it’s exhausting and it’s holding Britain back. So, our message is clear: it’s time to pay up.”Reynolds is expected to say legislation will include maximum payment terms of 60 days before a reduction after an introductory period to 45 days, “giving firms certainty they’ll be paid on time”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, we’ve announced measures as part of our plan for change to tackle all of those issues and beyond.”Explore more on these topicsSmall businessJonathan ReynoldsRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourEntrepreneursnewsShareReuse this content"

They also include Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Slovenia and Spain, which have. Emmanuel Macron last week said thatFrance would recognise Palestinianstatehood in the near future.The statement, which was published before the conclusion of a three-day UN conference set on reviving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said the states would “reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders”.It stressed the “importance of unifying theGazaStrip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”.On Wednesday evening, Carney saidCanadawould recognise the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly in September if certain conditions were met. He held a virtual cabinet meeting on the Middle East earlier on Wednesday.Carney said Canada would recognise Palestine if the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied West Bank, held an election in 2026 in which Palestinian militant group Hamas could play no part, and agreed to other democratic reforms.He called on Hamas to release all hostages it is holding, disarm, and play no role in the future governance of Palestine.In response, Iddo Moed, Israel’s ambassador to Canada, said Israel “will not bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it”.“We will not sacrifice our very existence by permitting the imposition of a jihadist state on our ancestral homeland that seeks our annihilation,” he said in a statement referring to Hamas, which seized power in Gaza in 2007.Carney’s remarks come amid growing pressure on Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza, which began in October 2023 in response to a Hamas raid that led to the deaths of 1,200 people, mainly Israelis, and the taking of more than 250 prisoners. More than 60,000 people have died in Gaza in the ensuing conflict, according to the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza.Keir Starmer on Tuesday said thatthe UK would recognise the state of in September“unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution”.Why is UK preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood?Read moreDonald Trump had initially said he didn’t “mind [Starmer] taking a position. I’m looking for getting people fed right now.”But later he condemned the decision to recognise a Palestinian state, saying onboard Air Force One that “you could make the case that you’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded. So I’m not in that camp, to be honest … because if you do that you are really rewarding Hamas. And I’m not about to do that.”The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this week he wanted to time a recognition of Palestinian statehood to help achieve a breakthrough in negotiations.“What we’re looking at is the circumstances where recognition will advance the objective of the creation of two states,” Albanese said on Wednesday.“My entire political life, I’ve said I support two states, the right of Israel to exist within secure borders and the right of Palestinians to have their legitimate aspirations for their own state realised. That’s my objective.”Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Damon, condemned the declaration.“While our hostages are languishing in Hamas terror tunnels in Gaza, these countries choose to engage in hollow statements instead of investing their efforts in their release,” said Damon. “This is hypocrisy and a waste of time that legitimises terrorism and distances any chance of regional progress. Those who truly want to make progress should start with an unequivocal demand for the immediate return of all the hostages and the disarmament of Hamas.”Explore more on these topicsWorld newsCanadaNew ZealandIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s very responsibly used, and that’s why most of the public support it.”Part of the Met’s overhaul will see officers moved to bulk up the force’s public order crime team, as the force said it has faced increased demand linked to protest-related crimes in the past two years.The squad will go from 48 to 63 officers due to a rise in the number of protests, particularly related to Israel and Palestine, as well as environmental issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The PND contains custody mugshots, millions of which have been found to bestored unlawfully, of people who have never been charged with or convicted of an offence.The Home Office has been working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionMetropolitan policePoliceSurveillanceUK civil libertiesCrimeNotting Hill carnivalnewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday evening video emerged of him saying “he come at me”, an apparent claim of self-defence, at the scene of the alleged assault in St Pancras station in London as a 64-year-old man lay motionless on the ground.The injured man was still in hospital on Wednesday in a stable condition. Police are understood to be treating him as a victim, not a suspect, at this stage. Police have said he was admitted to hospital “with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening”.CCTV from the busy central London station has been recovered and is being studied by detectives.View image in fullscreenA screengrab from the video showing Robinson near the man on the ground.Photograph: X | @CrimeLdnBritish Transport Police (BTP) say they were called to St Pancras at about 8.40pm on Monday to reports of an assault. A source said detectives were confident they had identified the suspect for the alleged assault and were not seeking anyone else.Police are understood to have several lines of inquiry, one of which is locating Robinson. While he is known to have arrived in Tenerife, in the past he has travelled around Spain and into Portugal and Cyprus, sometimes relying on the hospitality of wealthy friends.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is a former leader of the extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.Police believe Robinson, 42, originally from Bedfordshire, took a flight out of Britain shortly after a video was put online showing him near the injured man.The video shows Robinson claiming the man had attacked him first, and was filmed at St Pancras station, where he had been leafleting earlier in the day.BTP said on Tuesday: “Following a report of an assault at St Pancras station last night (28 July), officers have confirmed that the suspect, a 42-year-old man from Bedfordshire, boarded a flight out of the country in the early hours of this morning. Detectives are continuing to work closely to progress the investigation and bring him into custody for questioning.”In the video, a man can be seen lying face down and motionless, with Robinson pacing nearby. Robinson can be heard saying: “He come at me bruv.” Shortly afterwards, Robinson tells an onlooker: “He come at me, you saw that.”The video seen on social media does not show how the injured man came to be lying motionless on the floor.Nothing known publicly at this stage proves or disproves any version of the alleged assault, nor who may have been at fault.The Conservatives’ home affairs spokesperson, Chris Philp, a policing minister in the last government, told the Guardian that the case raised questions about border security.Philp said: “The fact that a wanted fugitive was able to pass through our international border should not be allowed to happen and it is further evidence of this government’s complete lack of border control, inbound or outbound.”A government spokesperson said: “This is an operational matter for the police.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They include:Jon Farley, 67Retired teacherView image in fullscreenJon Farley back home in Leeds after he was arrested for carrying a photocopied Private Eye cartoon at a rally.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFarley was picked up by police at a silent demonstration in Leeds for holding a sign that made a joke about the government’s proscription of Palestine Action taken from an issue of the fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye. He was arrested under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which he described as a “pretty terrifying and upsetting experience”. Farley, who had never been arrested before,told the Guardian: “I clearly wasn’t any kind of physical threat.” The Private Eye editor, Ian Hislop, said the arrest was “mind-boggling”.Marianne Sorrell, 80Retired teacherSorrell, from Wells, Somerset, was arrested for holding a placard at a pro-Palestine rally in Cardiff, and she was held by police for almost 27 hours, during which officers forced their way into her house and searched it. She said officers removed 19 items from her home, including iPads, a Palestinian flag, books on Palestine, material related to Extinction Rebellion and the climate crisis, as well as drumsticks for – and a belt that holds – her samba drum. “At 80, to be treated like a dangerous terrorist is deeply shocking.

This is about freedom of speech,” hetold Cornwall Live. He added: “We’re not advocating for Palestine Action. We’re resisting the proscription of Palestine Action. We’re resisting the politicised use of terror laws to suppress a non-violent campaign of sabotage. We’re resisting the criminalisation of peaceful protest because it’s already being used to intimidate and threaten people just for having Palestine flags.”Explore more on these topicsCounter-terrorism policyProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re all dying off. It’s heartbreaking. I can’t believe he’s gone.”He said he missed Osbourne’s final concert as he was abroad. “It was one of those times when you think there’ll probably be another time. We didn’t expect him to pass away. He’s had more comebacks than a boomerang,” he said.View image in fullscreen‘If there’s something after death, then Ozzy is with Rhoads looking down’: Will Taylor.Photograph: Yassin El-Moudden/The GuardianWill Taylor, a musician from Chesterfield, said it was a “no-brainer” to come to the city to watch the funeral procession with his wife and dog. He is a massive fan of Black Sabbath and of Osbourne’s collaborations with the American guitarist Randy Rhoads, who died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in 1982.“A bit of me thinks if there’s something after death then Ozzy is with Rhoads looking down wherever they are,” he said.Osbourne was the lead singer of Black Sabbath, who formed in Birmingham in 1968 and were widely credited with defining and popularising heavy metal music.Earlier this year Osbourne and his bandmates – Terence “Geezer” Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward – weregiven the freedom of the city of Birminghamto recognise their “exceptional service to the city”.Osbourne’s health had declined in recent years and he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019.He appeared for a surprise performance at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Birmingham in 2022 and performed hislast gig on 5 July, a farewell concert at Villa Park featuring global metal stars such as Anthrax, Metallica and Guns N’ Roses.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBirminghamBlack SabbathMetalEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But do not head straight to a posh restaurant or five-star hotel. The CAA says: “If you end up paying for things yourself, keep every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable. Airlines are unlikely to refund you for things like luxury hotels or alcohol.” Some airlines will provide guidance on reasonable costs.If your flight has been cancelled and is covered by UK law (that means one departing from an airport in the UK on any airline, or arriving at an airport in the UK on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline), your airline must offer you the choice of an alternative flight or a refund.If you select an alternative flight, it is up to you whether to fly as soon as possible or at a later date.In terms of a refund, you can get your money back for all parts of the ticket you have not used. So if you have booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket back from your airline.Once you decide to take a refund, or to travel later than the first available flight, your airline has no obligation to provide you with food, drink or accommodation.I am due to fly tonight/tomorrow – should I still go to the airport?Naomi Leach, the deputy editor of Which? Travel, advises: “If you are due to travel today or tomorrow, check the advice from your airport or tour operator, or airline apps and airport social media feeds, for the most up-to-date advice.”Will I be entitled to compensation?While airlines have a duty to look after their passengers when flights are disrupted, they do not have to put their hand in their pocket when the disruption is caused by “extraordinary circumstances”.Leach says that if your flight is cancelled or delayed as a result of these latest problems, you are unlikely to be owed compensation by the airline. This is because the technical issue affecting flights will be considered an extraordinary circumstance and out of the airline’s control.The CAA says that “if it wasn’t the airline’s fault, don’t expect to receive any compensation”.My flight is part of a package deal – can I still go away?If your flight is delayed or cancelled and it is part of a package holiday, you have some additional protections,says Abta.If your holiday ends up being cancelled, or new arrangements are made that result in a significant change to your holiday, then your travel company must offer an alternative holiday if it can, or a refund for the full price of your package holiday. Generally, a change of more than 12 hours on a fortnight’s holiday is considered a significant change, it says.Can I claim on my travel insurance?Your first point of contact should probably always be the airline. However, in situations where the disruption is beyond the airline’s control and – for example – you are unable to travel or are stranded at your destination, you may be able to claim on your travel insurance, depending on the level of cover.“Beyond the flight itself, certain costs like non-refundable hotel stays, hire car expenses or even pre-booked activity fees may be recoverable under specific circumstances,” says Alex Cross, the chief customer officer at Tesco Insurance.However, he adds that it is crucial to understand your policy’s coverage. If in any doubt, contact your insurer for more details.Explore more on these topicsAir transportTransport policyTransportAirline industryConsumer rightsConsumer affairsexplainersShareReuse this content"

He’s set himself the goal of becoming a five-time Olympic gold medallist’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 30 Jul 2025 10.17 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareWhen I was about 16, I went to Bradgate Park in Leicestershire with a couple of friends. We were there as sunset approached and the landscape became illuminated by beautiful golden-hour light. There were deer and stags all around and I asked one of my friends if I could borrow his camera. It must have been quite annoying for him because I remember wandering off, trying to capture this feeling of mystery and magic.That was the moment I first really felt a sense of excitement for photography and image-making. Before then, I’d visited many museums and art galleries with my mum and was inspired by some of the art we saw. I was particularly drawn to portraits by Vermeer and Rembrandt. I’ve never been good at drawing or painting, but having a camera gave me a tool to express that creative energy.While studying photography at university, I was introduced to mind-blowing work, like Alec Soth’s bookSleeping by the Mississippi. I was struck by hisportrait of a man holding a pair of model aeroplanes. There’s a simplicity to the image, but it’s also powerful and visually striking. I felt drawn to narrative-based documentary portraiture.For my final-year project, I spent time in monastic communities around Britain, making portraits of nuns, monks and other people I encountered within them. That branched out into one of the three long-term projects I’m currently working on,Rivers of Living Water, a wider-ranging series about the Christian faith in Britain, and the diverse nature of its cultures, denominations and perspectives.Fabian is determined to help increase inclusivity in the equestrian communityFabian, who you see in this photograph, is someone I found on Instagram. I was inspired by his story of growing up in inner-city east London, where it was hard for him to pursue his love of horses. He persevered and now competes in eventing competitions, determined to help increase inclusivity in the equestrian community. He’s set himself the goal of becoming a five-time Olympic gold medallist.This was taken in Hertfordshire, near the stables Fabian was using, on a January morning last year. Initially, I went to photograph him a few months before and while we had got some good images the light wasn’t great and we agreed to try again later. On this occasion, just before sunrise, we got this soft pink sky and the field was still covered with beautiful morning frost. Fabian looks incredible in that outfit and the horse, Morgan, also looks amazing.My preferred approach is to take things slowly and spend time with my subject, create a calm energy and capture a sense of who they are. I rarely use film now, but my technique is informed by having used it – I don’t take lots of photographs, but instead wait until there’s a moment of stillness and peace.I love natural light: a lot of my work makes use of evening or morning light or mist. There’sanother shotof Fabian taken about an hour after this one that I’m equally happy with. By then, the frost had mostly gone but the rising winter sun created strong shadows and a warmer tone. In both cases, I didn’t want the photographs to appear staged, I wanted something simple and genuine.I chose to photograph Fabian because I found his story interesting and inspiring. These portraits are about him and his equestrian journey. They are also included in the Rivers of Living Water series. The project encompasses spirituality, peace and serenity, but not every image is obviously religious. There are many that show people going about their everyday lives. My approach is always to try to be respectful and to honour the people I photograph. It’s a way of exploring my own personal faith, too.View image in fullscreenJohn Boaz.Photograph: Brad ManiscalcoJohn Boaz’s CVBorn:Northamptonshire, England.Trained:Visual communication degree at Birmingham City University.Influences:“Paintings are a major inspiration for my work and music, too, helps me develop ideas.

You just grab your latte and go.Is thecoffee any better?If you really cared about coffee, you wouldn’t go to either of these places.But Starbucks is home of the caramel macchiato, the pumpkin spice latte …Luckin is known for bestsellers like the coconut latte, the velvet latte andapple fizzy americano.Apple what?That’s apple juice, fizzy water and coffee, over ice.What is Starbucks doing to fend off the Luckin threat?It is closing a bunch of stores.A bold strategy, if a little counterintuitive.The companyplans to phase outits 90 or so “mobile-order-only” locations in the US, to concentrate on “community coffee houses” and a more personal customer experience.Soit’s going in the exact opposite direction to Luckin.It seems so. It has plans to refurbish existing locations, and it is going back to writing your name on the cup.A warm, friendly, welcoming atmosphere versus zero human interaction? I’mtorn.If it helps you make up your mind, Luckin is also engaging in furious promotional discounting, selling $1.99 coffees in a city where a $6 cappuccino is not uncommon.Starbucks is doomed.That’s a little premature. Luckin reported$4.7bn in sales last year, compared with$36.2bn net revenue for Starbucks.Still, a remarkable rise for the Chinese upstart.All the more remarkable after a 2020 false accounting scandal caused its stock price to collapse, driving the company into bankruptcy in the US. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2022, having replaced its top brass and received huge cash injections from a private equity firm.Do say:“Good morning, young barista.

They are only hurting patients and themselvesWes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careWed 30 Jul 2025 13.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 13.33 EDTShareAs five days of strike action by resident doctorscome to an end, the BMA has written asking me to return to the negotiating table. I’ve responded, with the irony of their letter being that I never left the table. We are back to where we were two weeks ago, when I sat down in good faith and offered to work intensively with them over a few weeks to negotiate a package of measures that would make a real difference in meeting the costs of doctors’ training, the costs associated with being a doctor and the lack of promotion opportunities.The only difference between now and a fortnight ago is the damage that the BMA has done to theNHSthrough its reckless strike action.Thanks to the hard work of NHS leaders and the heroic efforts of frontline staff who stepped up, including many resident doctors who showed up for work, the disruption was not as bad as it might have been. We managed to protect more operations and procedures than in previous years, and our accident and emergency response times improved during the period of strike action.But I do not want for a moment to play down the real impact of strike action on patients. The BMA has made no bones about the fact that it wanted to do damage to the progress we are making on cutting waiting lists and waiting times, and use the suffering of patients as leverage against the government. It cannot duck the consequences of its actions now.On Saturday, I spoke to a patient whose kidney cancer surgery has been postponed by a month until the end of August. I rang him personally to apologise because, having been through kidney cancer myself, I know exactly how it feels to wait, and the impact the fear and anxiety has on our families and close friends. It was just one of countless examples of cancer care that was affected, not to mention many other operations, appointments and procedures.We are still counting the costs of strike action on patients and stretched NHS budgets – budgets that doctors are relying on to deliver real improvements to their working conditions, as well as to patient care.Doctors are not the only staff I am responsible for in the NHS. The Royal College of Nursing will shortly publish a survey of its members and, without having seen the results, I have spent enough time with our nurses to know that they have not felt valued by the previous government and they are looking to Labour to deliver meaningful change to their profession. The GMB union has made similar representations on behalf of paramedics.Unite returned a negative ballot this week. Unison, the largest trade union in the country, knows better than anyone that staff right across the NHS are looking for material improvements to their pay and conditions. Many of them will never earn as much as the lowest-paid doctor. I have committed to work with them through the NHS staff council to make sure that we drive real change for their members, too.View image in fullscreenA striking resident doctor holds a placard during a picket outside the Royal Liverpool university hospital in Liverpool, 25 July 2025.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPANone of them have hada pay rise of 28.9%. Only resident doctors can claim to have received the highest pay rise in the public sector two years in a row. No wonder other NHS staff have looked on aghast at the action of the BMA. The BMA’s demands, and the speed with which it launched a strike – and a five-day strike at that – have left many other NHS staff, most of them paid far less than doctors, dismayed and appalled.The BMA is now adding jobs to its pay dispute, presumably because its members agree that picking a fight on pay after a 28.9% pay increase is unprecedented and unreasonable, and they are more worried about whether they have jobs to go into. They are right to be concerned, but working with the BMA to address doctor unemployment and career bottlenecks are among a number of things we are able and willing to do to improve the lives of doctors.Wes Streeting’s divide and rule tactics may have won against the doctors – but more strikes are coming | Polly SmytheRead moreAll I ask of the BMA is two things. The first is to drop this unnecessary and unreasonable rush to strike action. It harms doctors, it harms patients and it is fundamentally self-defeating, because it leaves the NHS with less money to address the issues that doctors care about. The second is to recognise that this government has a responsibility to all NHS staff and, above all, to patients. We can’t fix everything for everyone everywhere all at once.Labour didn’t break the NHS, nor did the doctors. Patients are looking to us to work together, as a team, to get their NHS back on its feet and build an NHS fit for the future. The past 12 months has shown what this government and the NHS can achieve when we pull together. Waiting lists are at theirlowest levels in two yearsand it feels like the NHS is finally moving in the right direction.It should be clear to the BMA by now that it will lose a war with this government. It’s not too late for us both to win the peace.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How long have you got?Adrian ChilesThe first drop of rain and out they come, getting in your way and threatening your eyes. We need a law to control the nasty, pointy, dangerous thingsWed 30 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 12.59 EDTShareUmbrellas, I don’t like them. Don’t get on with them, never have. When my aunt in Zagreb was absorbed in some crime drama on the television, she would say it was “as tense as an umbrella”. The English translation doesn’t work, but if I may turn it around, I would like to explain why umbrellas make me tense.There are so many reasons. If I need an umbrella, I rarely have one. If I do have one, I then leave it somewhere. If it’s windy, that humiliating inside-out thing might happen. All in all, it is very much not worth the bother. My hairdo isn’t changed by rain anyway. Yet so many people don’t seem to leave home without an umbrella, and they are only one raindrop away from calling on it. I marvel at this level of organisation, even envy it, but there should be a law against putting up a brolly if significant rain isn’t coming down.Late for a hospital appointment last week, I was hurrying along a city street when I felt the merest sprinkle of rain tickle my cheek. In an instant, the umbrella ultras sprang into action. It was as if this was the moment for which they had been waiting, yearning. Their internal rainometers, being set to ultrasensitive, were triggered. And with astonishing speed and economy of movement, umbrellas were retrieved and unfurled. Their reaction times were something to behold. They were like sprinters hearing the B in bang, or Clint Eastwood in one of those spaghetti westerns – so quick on the draw that the journey of the brolly from handbag to hand to unfurling is barely observable to the naked eye. “Unfurl” isn’t quite the right word, implying as it does a more leisurely movement. This is more like a snapping open, as violent as the snapping shut of a Venus flytrap.One moment there are no umbrellas, then there are dozens. I would say a third of pedestrians on this particular street, on the approach to Guy’s hospital in London, were now brollied up. This changed everything. I gave in to despair. I was already late, and this was going to hold me up still further. We were now split into two groups: the brolly-holders and the brolly-dodgers. The former move faster than the latter. Shielded from rain and harm by their lethal weapons they can hold a straight line, armed with this contraption featuring at least eight metal ribs, the tips of which can cause untold harm to those they prod. The potential for ripping, tearing and the poking out of eyes is very real. I’m 6ft 1in tall and, I now realise, particularly vulnerable to eye injury. I’ve just measured my neighbour, Dawn, who comes in at 5ft 4in – roughly the average height of a British woman. I gave her a standard eight-rib weapon to hold and, sure enough, the tips are precisely at my eye-height.Out there, on the pavement, in brolly-battle conditions, you have a choice: pull in behind a brolly-holder and work their slipstream, proceeding at a pace dictated by them. Or, if you are brave, foolish or late enough, the brolly-dodging must commence. There are two key manoeuvres, both tricky. Overtaking a slow-mover ought to be easier than dealing with oncoming traffic, but often they don’t know you are there, so could catch you inadvertently. Those striding towards you will see you coming but they will generally hold their line anyway, as they are armed and you’re not. On occasion you will be swaying to avoid a sudden deviation from someone you are overtaking, and momentarily lose sight of an oncomer hard upon you. At this point you need to be able to duck and weave like Muhammad Ali in his prime. To develop your technique I would also recommend watching YouTube videos of legendary rugby centres such as Brian O’Driscoll, Sonny Bill Williams or Ma’a Nonu dancing their way through defensive lines. Yes, it is this kind of fleetness of foot you need to develop if you wish to move at speed in even a light drizzle on a busy British pavement.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Still, public sector workers are struggling, and they have public sympathyWed 30 Jul 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 13.14 EDTShareWhenthousands of ambulance workerswent on strike on 21 December 2022 to demand better pay and conditions, the then shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, wasn’t shy in pointing out who was responsible. In their refusal to negotiate,he tweeted, Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay had driven NHS staff to strike, leaving patients “in no doubt who is to blame for this chaos”.Three years and one general election later, the surgical slipper is firmly on the other foot. Resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – have just finished a five-day strike, demanding a 29% pay rise over the next few years. Among placards on picket lines calling for “pay restoration” andan end to“cuts so deep that even a surgeon couldn’t fix it” wereprinted copiesof Streeting’s tweet.Gone is the relaxed attitude displayed by the health secretary towards the British Medical Association (BMA) in 2024, when he agreeda deal with doctorsthat set them on a “journey to pay restoration”. He has called this latest strike a “gift to Nigel Farage” andurgedresident doctorsto cross picket lines and join their colleagues still “turning up to work”. He has described the strike not only as “reckless”, but as an action that “enormously undermines the entire trade union movement”.Union general secretaries have been quick to shoot back, with Dave Ward of the Communication Workers Union calling Streeting’s comments “shameful”, and the Public and Commercial Services Union’s Fran Heathcote accusing the health secretary of “carping in the Murdoch press” instead of negotiating a settlement. For a government whose relationship with organised labour has so far been largely harmonious – apart from Unite’ssuspension of Angela Raynerover the Birmingham bin strikes – Streeting’s denouncement of the BMA is the closest Labour has come to picking a fight with the unions. Is this the government’s industrial shot across the bows?While on the face of it, the row might seem like the first real sign of confrontation between Labour and the unions, it’s worth taking a closer look at what is happening. Underlying Streeting’s intervention are a number of factors that make the BMA an easy target for a government that’s keen to display that it can be tough on unions and not in the pocket of its “union paymasters”.The BMA isnot affiliated to Labour, nor is it part of theTrades Union Congress, making Labour’s institutional link to it much weaker. There’s also the fact that resistance to the strike isn’t coming only from the government’s side: other healthcare unions have expressed unease over existing discrepancies in NHS pay offers. Last month, the Royal College of Nursing called the government’s decision to award resident doctors a 5.4% pay increase while offering nursing staff 3.6% “grotesque”.In a videoposted on Xabout the strike, Streeting plays into those divisions within the movement, stoking tension between resident doctors and other NHS workers. He talks about “working hard with … staff that aren’t paid as much as doctors to make sure that your pay and your career progression and the conditions that you work in are also good for you”.Add to that the older consultants and medical professionals who have been having their say: that a strike would “further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver”, that “it is too soon to go again”, or simply that resident doctors are being “very greedy”.Then there’s the drastic lurch by the Tories – both in government and opposition – to the right on industrial matters, with Kemi Badenoch proposing this week toban doctors from taking strike action, putting them under the same rules that apply to police, prison officers and soldiers. This approach gives Streeting more room to present himself as tough but reasonable.This isn’t to defend Streeting, who is probably more than happy to use strike actionto justifyfurther NHS privatisation. Nor is it to undermine how galling his comments are for those standing out on the picket lines. One doctor has called them a “slap in the face”, while anotheraskedwhere the Streeting of 2022 had gone: “He was making some good points.”But government condemnation of the strike does not necessarily reflect a wider shift in its strategy towards unions. Amid frenzied attacks by Tories and their media allies on Labour’s link with the unions, the reality of the relationship is all too often drowned out. That makes it harder to understand key dynamics: it’s likely to be transport unions that the government hopes to take on, not only industrially but politically.It also makes it harder to spot how unions’ different industrial priorities inform their relationship with the government. With so much of Labour’s employment rights bill left to secondary legislation, general secretaries still have eyes on the prize of getting their sectoral needs met, whether that’s Unison pushing for fair pay agreements or the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers forzero-hours contract reform. Then there’s the fact that there are those in Labour who are itching to embrace the spirit of the 1980s and launch a full-frontal attack on the movement.The country is once again facing the prospect of widespread public sector industrial action, with nurses and teachers potentially set to join the strike action. A decade of suppressed public sector pay, inflation and increases in the cost of living has challenged the idea that certain professions’ wages are always guarantees of a good life. On a basicstarting salary of £38,831and saddled with as much as£100,000 of student debt, it’s no longer enough for new resident doctor recruits to simply wait to earn more at some distant point in the future.While there are grievances specific to the resident doctors’ strikes – ashortage of speciality training postsand having to spend thousands of pounds on exam fees, courses and equipment such as stethoscopes – many of their concerns are felt deeply across the movement. Stubborn mountains of student debt, housing costs that utterly eclipse wages and crumbling public services that drive down working conditions are not unique to the BMA.For this dispute, Labour has used inter-union tensions overNHSpay – as well as the outdated idea that all resident doctors are middle-class professionals – as a political opportunity to dodge blame for the strike. But that strategy won’t work for all strikes. As public sector unrest continues to unfold, the government’s battle with the unions might well begin in earnest.Polly Smythe is labour movement correspondent at Novara MediaExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionIndustrial actionWes StreetingLabourHealthNHScommentShareReuse this content"

Our country is committing genocideYuli NovakMy generation was raised wondering how ordinary people could countenance an atrocity. In a grotesque twist, the question has circled back to usWed 30 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 16.12 EDTShareThe question keeps gnawing at me: Could this really be it? Could we be living through a genocide?OutsideIsrael, millions already know the answer. But many of us here can’t – or won’t – say it aloud. Perhaps because the truth threatens to unmake everything we believed about who we are, and who we wanted to be. To name it is to admit that the future will require reckoning – not just with our leaders, but with ourselves. But the cost of refusing to see is even higher.For Israelis of my generation, the word “genocide” was supposed to remain a nightmare from another planet. A word tethered to our grandparents’ photographs and the ghosts of European ghettoes, not to our own neighborhoods. We were the ones who asked, from a distance,about others: how could ordinary people go on with their lives while something like this happened? How could they let it happen? What would I have done in their place?In a grotesque twist of history, that question now circles back to us.For nearly two years, we’ve heard Israeli officials – politicians and generals alike – say out loud what they intend to do: to starve, flatten and eraseGaza. “We will eliminate them.” “We will make it uninhabitable.” “We will cut off food, water, electricity.” These weren’t slips of the tongue; they were the plan. And then, the Israeli military carried it out. By the textbook definition, this is genocide: the deliberate targeting of a population not for who they are as individuals, but because they belong to a group – an attack designed to destroy the group itself.We told ourselves other stories to survive the horror, stories that kept guilt and grief at bay. We convinced ourselves that every child in Gaza was Hamas, every apartment a terrorist cell. We became, without noticing, those “ordinary people” who keep living their lives while “it” is happening.I can still recall the first time reality cracked open for me. Two months into what I was still calling a “war”, three of my B’Tselem colleagues – Palestinian human rights workers we’d worked alongside for years – were trapped in Gaza with their families. They told me about relatives buried under rubble, about not being able to shield their children, about the paralyzing fear.In the frantic efforts to extract them from Gaza, I learned something that has seared itself into my mind: at that moment, a living Palestinian in Gaza could be “ransomed” for roughly 20,000 shekels. Children cost less. Life priced in cash, per head. These were not abstract statistics; these were people I knew. And that was when I understood: the rules had changed.Since then, the surreal has become routine. Cities reduced to ash. Entire neighborhoods flattened. Families displaced, then displaced again. Tens of thousands killed. Mass starvation engineered, with aid trucks turned away or bombed. Parents feeding animal fodder to their children, some of whom die waiting for flour. Others are shot – unarmed civilians, gunned down for approaching food convoys.Genocide does not happen without mass participation: a population that supports it, enables it or looks away. That is part of its tragedy. Almost no nation that has committed genocide understood, in real time, what it was doing. The story is always the same: self-defense, inevitability, the targets brought it on themselves.In Israel, the prevailing narrative insists this all began on 7 October, with Hamas’s massacre of civilians in southern Israel. That day was a true horror, a grotesque burst of human cruelty: civilians slaughtered, raped, taken hostage. A concentrated national trauma that summoned, for many Israelis, a profound sense of existential threat.But 7 October, while catalytic, was not enough on its own. Genocide requires conditions – decades of apartheid and occupation, of separation and dehumanization, of policies designed to sever our capacity for empathy. Gaza, sealed off from the world, became the apex of this architecture. Its people became abstractions, perpetual hostages in our imagination, subjects to bomb every few years, to kill by the hundreds or thousands, with no accountability. We knew more than 2 million people were living under siege. We knew about Hamas. We knew about the tunnels. In hindsight, we knew everything. Yet somehow we were incapable of understanding that some of them might find a way to break out.What happened on 7 October was not only a military failure. It was a collapse of our social imagination: the delusion that we could corral all the violence and despair behind a fence and live peacefully on our side. That rupture arrived under the most extreme rightwing government in Israel’s history, a coalition whose ministers openly fantasize about Gaza’s erasure. And so, in October 2023, every star in our darkest nightmare aligned.This week, B’Tselem released a report, Our Genocide, compiled by Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli researchers together. It is divided into two parts. The first documents how this genocide is being carried out: mass killings, destruction of living conditions, social collapse and engineered starvation, all fueled by incitement from Israeli leaders and amplified through media. The second part of the report traces the path that led here: decades of systemic inequality, military rule and policies of separation that normalized Palestinian disposability.Israel committing genocide in Gaza, say Israel-based human rights groupsRead moreTo confront genocide, we must first understand it. And in order to do so, we – Jewish-Israelis and Palestinians – had to look at reality together, through the perspective of the human beings living on this land. Our moral and human obligation is to amplify the voices of the victims. Our political and historical responsibility is also to turn our gaze to the perpetrators, and to testify, in real time, to how a society transforms into one capable of committing genocide.Recognizing this truth is not easy. Even for us, people who have spent years documenting state violence against Palestinians, the mind resists it. It rejects the facts like poison, tries to spit them out. But the poison is here. It floods the bodies of those who live between the river and the sea – Palestinians and Israelis alike – with fear and unfathomable loss.The Israeli state is committing genocide.And once you accept that, the question we have asked ourselves all our lives rematerializes with urgency: what would I have done, back then, on that other planet?Except the answer is not rhetorical. It is now. It is us. And there is only one right answer:We must do everything in our power to stop it.Yuli Novak is the executive director of B’Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied TerritoriesExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

She’d been worried about them – her mum had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and her dad had been having frequent falls. For years she’d been trying to get them to talk about whether they needed to move to aged care, to assess their financial situation and face what was coming next, but they’d dismissed her, saying they were fine.On the first day of their visit, Anna’s dad fell and broke his leg, badly. “He went into hospital and Mum came and stayed with me. I realised what they’d been covering up. Mum was so confused she was walking around the house without any pants on, which was confronting for my teenage boys. She didn’t know what day it was and she couldn’t read a clock. Then the hospital told me Dad was withdrawing from alcohol and had some dementia.”I thought when my mother went into aged care my daily work would be over. I was wrong | Caroline BaumRead moreAnna moved her parents to a nearby aged care centre while her sister packed up the family home. The sisters had always had some issues in their relationship but the stress of seeing their parents so vulnerable, of selling the house and working through the financial situation, led to harsh words and hurtful accusations. Anna’s sister told their parents they were arguing. “They were distraught. It was awful. I had to set some boundaries, and I just stopped all communication.”Read moreCaregiving can expose cracks in families and widen them to caverns. Since I’ve been working in this area, I’ve heard many stories like Anna’s and spoken to experts about how families can fall apart just when they need to come together. There’s often resentment about the burden of care on one child, conflict around the pressure of making huge decisions and the horror of the “sad-min” of form filling. Issues around money are particularly messy. And families who have had past conflict and trauma are particularly at risk.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsResearch released on Thursday by online care platform Violet reveals the depth of anxiety surrounding Australia’s ageing population and gives insights into families who love deeply but plan poorly. Its poll of a thousand people found more than three-quarters of Australians are concerned that caregiving will damage their relationships with family members and 70% worry about managing past family conflicts and unresolved trauma when caregiving.Previous studieshave shown 45% of caregivers experience relatively serious conflict with another family member, usually because one sibling tends to carry the heaviest load.One sibling will often demand life support because they want to believe in hope or a miracleProfessor Ken HillmanEach statistic tells a unique and personal story of relationship breakdown, resentment and real anguish. But the consequences affect us all, because the conflict often plays out in publicly funded late-stage hospital care.A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2019found patients whose families are in conflict were nearly 10 times more likely to receive unbeneficial treatment towards the end of their life.Ken Hillman, professor of intensive care at the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales, has been warning about the cost of misaligned care in the last moments of life since the 1980s. His most recent research in the Internal Medicine Journal cited overtreatment as a major contributor to decreased capacity of hospitals, reduced ability to conduct elective surgery, increased attendances at emergency departments and ambulance ramping. Hillman says family conflict is the biggest cause of non-beneficial treatment at the end of life. “I’m not too sure if it’s guilt or existing conflict or just not facing the problem, but one sibling will often demand life support because they want to believe in hope or a miracle.”Why do we age in dramatic bursts, and what can we do about it? - podcastRead moreProf Imogen Mitchell also sees the cost of conflict in her job as an intensive care specialist at Canberra hospital. She says most families haven’t even thought about whether they’d want their loved one going to intensive care and this can lead to panic.“Often sons are more wedded to keeping them alive, saying, ‘She’s a fighter’, whereas it’s often a daughter who does more of the care who will say ‘I’m not sure Mum would want all this’. Often, a new wife and the children of the patient will be in conflict – the wife wants all treatment that is possible and the children will be more pragmatic. Meanwhile, we hold a patient in suspension while family members get on the same page.”Often this can take time because all sorts of family issues can play out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Families need guidance to navigate complex medical decisions and care coordination. Different states have different recommendations for health directives, but clearly we need better guidance and fundamental planning tools. Parents hate it when their children fight – setting the rules around ageing with clear direction and communication may be the best gift they can give their children and themselves.Not all conflict can be avoided but some plain old appreciation for those who do the hard work in caring is a good place to start. Sharon* in Sydney spends half her week driving her father to appointments, cooking his meals and cleaning his flat. She does it with love but concedes the lack of the slightest bit of interest from her two siblings has lessened her love for them. “Just an acknowledgment and a pat on the back would go a long way. There are times I even feel I hate them.”Often healing old wounds in families is too difficult.

They knew what was happening all alongWed 30 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 04.17 EDTShareWhat have we done?As theUN-backed monitordeclares that “the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip”, this should have been the question ricocheting between the walls as Keir Starmer met Donald Trump this week. Israel’s deliberate starvation of Gaza is, after all, a crime confessed to, designed and implemented in plain sight. Starmer has said the UK willrecognise Palestinian statehoodif Israel doesn’t agree to a ceasefire and a two-state solution, but don’t be beguiled: Palestinian national self-determination is an inalienable right, not a bargaining chip, and it’s the most symbolic action he could take rather than, say, imposing sweeping sanctions and ending all arms sales.The hand-wringing of western politicians and media outlets will not feed Gaza’s emaciated children, any more than it will absolve them of guilt.Israel’s leaders have said, explicitly, repeatedly, from the very beginning, that they are deliberately starving Gaza’s people. “Man-made famine is not something that I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Martin Griffiths, the UN’s former humanitarian chief, tells me. On 9 October 2023, Israel’s then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, announced “a complete siege on [Gaza]:no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel”, justified on the grounds: “We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly”. The next day, the Israeli general charged with humanitarian affairs in Gaza and the West Bank –Ghassan Alian– declared that the “citizens of Gaza” were “human beasts” who would suffer “a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”The following week, the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, promised“we will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip”. These statements were not reported at all by many western media outlets – or, if they were, it was in passing and with no explanation given about their objectively illegal intent. It’s as though these statements were being uttered in a parallel universe, because if they were accurately covered with due prominence, then our media would have been forced to cover Israel’s onslaught as a criminal enterprise, rather than a war of self-defence.Israel’s western allies knew exactly what it was up to. In March 2024, our then foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, wrote a lettersetting out many rusesused by Israel to block aid from entering Gaza, yet Britain took no action. In April 2024, two US government departments concluded that Israel wasdeliberately blockingaid, which legally required the administration to stop supplying weapons. This was overruled by Joe Biden’s team.Later that year, that same administration sent a public letter detailing Israeli aid obstructions, but Tel Aviv correctly calculated this was political posturing during the presidential election, largely ignored the demands and sufferedno consequences for doing so.Israel has perpetrated the biggest slaughter of aid workers in history,killing more than 400by the spring. It waged a relentless war against Gaza’s main humanitarian agency – Unrwa, the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency – andbanned itfrom the occupied territories last October. Its militarykilled police officerscharged with escorting aid and preventing looting. It’s not just the blocking of aid from entering. Israel’s onslaught has leftnearly all agricultural land unusable, as well as damaging 80% of cropland.Nearly all livestockand mostplant lifeis dead.Gaza’s portand fishing vehicles have been destroyed, and Palestinians defying Israel’s ban on fishingface slaughter.The massacre of starving Palestinians looking for aid has been a consistent theme. In February 2024,more than a hundred civilianswaiting for flour were butchered by the Israeli military, yet – as been the case throughout the genocide –media outletstreated its denials, deflections and lies as credible claims. A detailed investigation by CNN weeks later concluded what should always have been obvious – the Israeli military was to blame – but by then attention had moved elsewhere. In March this year, Israel imposed a total siege, and replaced the UN’s effective aid system with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose “distribution sites” are dystopian killing fields. As the UN-backedIPC notes, that aid is not only far too little, but it is often unusable because Israel has left Palestinians without cooking gas and clean water to prepare it.More than a thousandcivilians have been butchered trying to access this aid. As aid agencieshave noted, the GHF is designed to coax a starved population to the south, so they can be confined in what the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert described as a “concentration camp”, before being deported.Despite Israel’s obvious, transparent, shameless guilt, its lies are indulged by western politicians and media outlets. On Monday, Donald Trump repeated that “a lot of the food is stolen” by Hamas. This lie has been contradicted byCindy McCain, director of the World Food Programme, and widow to the hawkishly pro-Israel late Republican senator John McCain. An internal US government analysisfound no proof, and Israeli officials have briefed thattheir militaryreached the same conclusion. Perversely, it iscriminal gangsbacked by Israel – which Netanyahu’s own former deputy noted arelinked to Islamic State– that are stealing aid.The international criminal court’s arrest warrants, issued eight months ago, centred on Israel’s deliberate starvation for a reason: the evidence is overwhelming. Yet even if Gaza were suddenly flooded with aid, many Palestinians would die because their bodies have been irreversibly ravaged by hunger. And that is not even on the agenda.The 73 trucksallowed in on Monday were forced to take an unsafe route, and then looted.Our own prime minister has been promoting airdrops of aid. These are pinpricks, badly targeted and have killed Palestinians when they’ve fallen on their heads. All they really achieve is cover forIsrael, to pretend it is doing something, deflecting from its deliberate mass starvation. But what else should we expect from Starmer, who backed Israel’s right to impose a siege on Gaza at the beginning of the genocide, then tried to gaslight us into believing he hadn’t?What have we done?If western elites had any shame, this question would be robbing them of sleep. And the answer would be straightforward. You facilitated the mass starvation of an entire people. You knew what was happening, because of a deluge of evidence for 21 months, and because the perpetrator – your friend – repeatedly boasted to the world about its crime. Alas, the architects of this abomination will not hold themselves to account. That will be left to history – and the courts.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now we’re being punished for speaking out against the killing of medics and patients in GazaWed 30 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 11.03 EDTShareMedicine is a humanistic profession, grounded in ethical values of justice, beneficence and the commitment to do no harm. It is a vocation of healing, of saving lives and of easing physical and emotional suffering. Being a doctor requires inner strength – the ability to see another’s pain, to feel it and to respond with empathy and compassion, alongside the knowledge and professionalism the role demands. I believe a physician also bears a critical responsibility in advocating for their patients’ right to health and in upholding the principle of justice. In that sense, every doctor is, to me, a leader.I explored these ideas in a new Guardian documentary,The Oath.I tell my story as a Palestinian doctor living in Israel and working within its healthcare system. Made over the past year, the film portrays the struggles and challenges I have faced in that time. However, since I was first filmed in March 2024, the situation in Gaza, and the position we are in as doctors, has only worsened – day by day, hour by hour.As a Palestinian doctorliving and working in Israel, in the midst of a longstanding conflict, I learned during my studies and work that injustice has been done to many populations living here. The occupation and coercion that Israel exercises over the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and the policy of discrimination against the Palestinian minority living within Israel cause serious harm to the right to health of these populations. Control over territories, expulsion, dispossession, violence, restriction of movement, establishment of settlements and apartheid cause great suffering to the population, prevent access to medical care and directly affect their health. Already as a medical student, I decided that I could not sit on the sidelines in the face of all that. I joinedPhysicians for Human Rights – Israelin order to fight for the health of the populations under Israeli control, together with many partners.When we began filming the documentary, five months had already passed since Israel’s assault on Gaza began. At that point, thousands had been killed and widespread destruction had taken place. Still, I could not have dreamed that for the next year and a half we would continue to witness daily bombings, mass death – including thousands of children – millions displaced, starvation and the unprecedenteddecimation of Gaza’s health system. Hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, universities and entire neighbourhoods have been wiped off the map. The scale of devastation is unlike anything I have seen elsewhere. This is not merely a humanitarian crisis, it is what many international legal scholars and human rights organisations have begun to describe as agenocide in progress.My personal story is inseparable from this struggle. Marwan, the brother of my sister-in-law, a paramedic, was killed in the line of duty on 7 October 2023. These past two weeks were even more tragic for his family: their tents in a camp inGazawere bombed, killing 10 relatives, among them Abdullah, an eight-year-old boy full of life and dreams of becoming a doctor, murdered in his sleep. Little Marwan, seven years old, lay unconscious in a hospital for a week due to a severe head injury, but was denied proper treatment due to the severe shortage of medical staff and resources.Since that tragic day, more than1,500 Palestinian medical personnelhave been killed. Many have been detained, subjected to ongoing persecution and humiliation. Some have died by torture and neglect in Israeli detention facilities. All this takes place under deafening silence from the Israeli healthcare establishment and many of my fellow physicians, who too often choose silence over basic ethics and morality. Only very few voices were heard among some in the Israeli healthcare system against targeting their colleagues in Gazan hospitals.Amid all this, I try to speak with restraint, to choose my words carefully, out of fear and understanding that my voice might be seen as dangerous. Since 7 October, Palestinian staff in the Israeli healthcare system have faced persecution, slander and paralysis. Anti-Palestinian sentiment is surging, even among patients and colleagues. Slogans such as “there are no innocents in Gaza” or “burn Gaza to the ground” are neither rejected nor punished by the system. Any expression of sympathy for victims – women, children, innocent civilians – is seen as support for terror, and puts the speaker at risk of dismissal or disciplinary action.A fellow physician, a partner in our struggle, was recently fired for delivering a brief speech in which he criticised the crimes committed in Gaza. The silencing and persecution are only intensifying.Medicine, once assumed to be a neutral profession, has become politically and morally fraught. To treat an injured child in Gaza is no longer merely a medical duty – it is a profound moral declaration. The oath to provide equal care to all shatters against the brutal reality in which doctors and children are killed, patients are arrested, voices are suppressed and dreams – like Abdullah’s – collapse.And still, I continue to fight. Because as long as we remain silent, our oath is hollowed out, and the right to health becomes a fantasy too far to reach. Yet, as long as I have a voice, I will use it: for my patients, for justice, for the oath we all swore.Lina Qasem Hassan is a Palestinian doctor working in the Israeli healthcare system and is chairwoman ofPhysicians for Human Rights - Israel.

As a clinical psychologist who works with professional athletes and sports teams, I know that discipline and aggression will have played an important role in their victory – but that habits and hobbies off the pitch might have been just as vital.In the training camp, away from the spotlight and competition of the tournament, the Lionesses would come together in the evenings to engage inwholesome activitiesincluding building Lego, doing jigsaws and playing Monopoly.Michelle Agyemangplayed a piano in her room.DefenderLotte Wubben-Moybrought a sourdough starter from home for the team chef to feed. They were also encouraged to spend time with their families and to talk and journal about “how they had made it to the Euros, their footballing journeys and the personal battles they had faced”.Mastering professional sport requires resilience, composure and an ability to navigate the highs and lows inherent in competition. Highs – such as when an important match is won and the stadiumroars with approval– kick players’ sympathetic nervous systems into overdrive as the neurotransmitters adrenaline and dopamine are released. In this state, returning to a hotel room to sleep and recover ahead of upcoming fixtures can feel virtually impossible. It’s not uncommon for athletes to continue to seek out dopamine hits in the form of intense physical exercise, alcohol, social-media feedback, gaming or gambling – all of which can have negative outcomes.View image in fullscreenLauren Hemp with her Beauty and the Beast Lego castle during Euro 2025.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASimilarly, when athletes experience a low – a day off, the off-season, an injury or retirement – their mood can plummet. Not only is there now ample time to ruminate on negative thoughts, but their brain chemistry is suddenly deprived of all that lovely pleasure-inducing dopamine as the highs of winning subside and social-media feedback wanes. All too often, the instinct is to pursue dopamine through other, potentially harmful stimuli because it feels too uncomfortable to tolerate the sense of lacking something. Little sympathy is often felt by the public towards football stars who appear seemingly reckless in their behaviours off the pitch, but in reality they are sliding down a slippery slope of addiction and are desperately fighting to get off.Managing the cognitive, emotional and neurotransmitter-fuelled rollercoaster inherent in sport is crucial for athletes if they want to avoid emotional dysregulation, depression, addiction and burnout.Here’s where the Lionesses played a blinder with their choice of downtime occupations. Low-tech, slower activities such as Lego, puzzles and journalling, as well as being engaging and satisfying, provide an off-ramp for dopamine chasing. They allow players to build emotional and psychological resilience. If you’ve ever attempted a complex Lego build – like the forward Lauren Hemp, who reportedlybuilt a Beauty and the Beast castleduring the Euros – you’ll know all too well the level of patience required. Tolerating the discomfort of a fiddly project can help build emotional regulation and resilience – vital for managing uncomfortable pressure points on the pitch.Many of the Lionesses’ purported pastimes were also low- or no-tech. In choosing to play an instrument or give each other beauty treatments (defender Esme Morgan was reportedly the woman to see about lash lifts), the Lionesses were giving their sympathetic nervous systems an opportunity to switch off, allowing for faster recovery. Moreover, in doing non-football related activities together during their leisure time, the players opened up space for social and emotional connectedness – a key component of a cohesive and connected team.The type of calm, low-tech, collaborative activities practised by the Lionesses during the Euros provided balance between the rush of fast-paced highs and the discomfort of tolerating uncomfortable, slower-paced moments. It’s this balance that our minds and bodies need to sustain the physical fitness and mental stamina required to meet the demands of a major tournament – and it’s this balance that has been a key ingredient of England’s success.We can’t all be Lionesses, but we can learn from them. When the going gets tough, the tough … do jigsaws.Dr Amy Izycky is a clinical psychologist specialising in professional sport and neuropsychology working throughout the UK and internationally.

But more pressure is needed if a humanitarian catastrophe is to be avertedWed 30 Jul 2025 13.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 14.25 EDTShareThe symbolism of Palestinian statehood matters. For months, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his far-right coalition allies have cruelly laboured to make Gaza an uninhabitable hellscape. In the West Bank, the relentlessexpansionof Israeli settlements is likewise intended to foreclose, for ever, the possibility of a viable, independent Palestinian state. Mr Netanyahu’s approach to calls for a two-state solution in the Middle East has been to systematically work to ensure it never happens.Sir Keir Starmer has thus sent a welcome signal bydeclaringthat, in the absence of a ceasefire and a revived peace process, Britain will move to formally recognise Palestine. Against a backdrop of images of starvation in Gaza that recall the 20th-century horror of Biafra orEthiopia, Sir Keir’s intervention (andthat of the French president, Emmanuel Macron) gestures to the necessity of creating a different future to the one envisioned by Israel’s extremist government.But the urgent imperative is not to build a state; it is to save a population on the brink of social and physical collapse. On Tuesday, the United Nations food security agencyconfirmedthat “the worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding in the Gaza Strip”. The four Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution sites, touted by Israel as an alternative to blocked UN aid, are both hideously inadequate andlethallydangerous to access. Close to 100,000 women and children are inurgent needof treatment for malnutrition, while one in three Palestinians in Gaza are going for days without eating.Seeking to massage international opinion, Israel has resumed its past tactic of introducing partial mitigations and temporarily easing barriers to the delivery of aid. But in a ravaged landscape, where social cohesion and order has broken down, Gaza’s starvation crisis is much too advanced to be resolved by “humanitarian pauses” to the military onslaught. Similarly, airdropping aid may salve the consciences of western countries, but it will provide minimal food and has proveddangerousas well as inefficient in the past.The existential reality is plain. Unless Israel agrees to end the war, and stands back to allow a vast and sustained injection of UN aid, thousands of Palestinians will die either directly or indirectly as a result of a human-made famine. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (Unrwa), scandalously banned from operating on spurious grounds by Israel, has the equivalent of6,000 trucksof food and medicine ready to cross into Gaza. Along with other aid organisations, it must be empowered to use its experience and expertise to bring the territory back from the brink.Diplomatic gestures towards Palestinian statehood will do little to force that outcome, as Mr Netanyahu’s dismissiveresponseto Sir Keir’s declaration swiftly underlined. Sanctions might, though, by potentially ratcheting up pressure on Mr Netanyahu as more tangible effects of Israel’s moral isolation hit home. The European Union, which isIsrael’s largest export destination, has cards to play. Britain could move to pause preferential trade access, and expand current restrictions on arms sales.As Israel’s response to the horrific massacre of 7 October 2023 has become shockingly disproportionate, its allies in the west have done far too little to influence the course of events. This week, in Europe at least, the mood has begun to shift. But if Gaza is to be saved, decisive action is required.Explore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelKeir StarmerBenjamin NetanyahuUnited NationseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Rights of way shouldn’t depend on the goodwill of landownersWed 30 Jul 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn a country often said to be racked by division, criticising the condition of rivers is one of England’s few unifying pastimes. Sewage dumping, which occurred fornearly 4m hoursin English rivers and coastal waters last year, has become a potent source of anger, inspiring campaigners to push for cleaner water. Despite the concern that people show for England’s rivers, however, it is remarkably difficult to stroll along their banks, let alone take a dip.The Guardian’srecent reportingon the River Dart in Devon has shown that large stretches of its bank are privately owned, and many of these are difficult to access. The researcher Lewis Winks, who used Land Registry data to map the Dart’s ownership, found the 47-mile long river has no fewer than 108 separate owners. The Duchy of Cornwall owns 28 miles of riverbank; two aristocratic estates own a further 13; 11.6 miles are owned via offshore companies.Wilks’smapgives a snapshot of a national problem. Only4% of English riversare open to the public. As the demand for swimming spots has surged, many paddlers and kayakers have been reprimanded for trespassing. Paths alongside rivers often meander far from their banks to avoid privately owned land; one can “walk” along theRiver Testin Hampshire, for example, yet much of its bank is inaccessible. In 2020, visitors to one of itsfew access pointsfound it blocked by a barbed wire gate.The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs told the Guardian thatEnglandis a “nation of nature lovers”. But the nation’s feudal patterns of land ownership put much of nature off limits. Forming a deeper connection with the environment can inspire people to care for it. Campaigns for bathing water status, which compel the Environment Agency to improve water quality in rivers designated for swimming, are testimony to this. They are driven by people who directly experience these landscapes, and so want to protect them.Labour pledged to improve access to nature and protect wildlife in its 2024 manifesto, but its ministers have since diluted both promises. The government’s new planning bill willweaken environmental protectionsby allowing developers to offset their destruction of natural habitats, rather than avoiding such destruction to begin with. In opposition, Labour vowed to introduce a right to roam. In government, itU-turned on this promise, bending to pressure fromlandowner groups.Its plan to create nine new“river walks”is a paltry compensation. The government has given no detail on where these walks will be located or how it will create them, and its plan will probably be thwarted by the same “permissive” model of access that campaigners object to, where rights of way depend on the goodwill of individual landowners. To create a walk along the length of the Dart, each of its 108 landowners would have to voluntarily allow the public to use their land. The Dart is small: longer rivers will pose even greater challenges.Landowners have long attempted to shield their estates from public view. “Concealing wealth,” writes the land campaigner Guy Shrubsole, “is part and parcel of preserving it.” A plan by the housing minister Matthew Pennycookto open up the Land Registrywill make it easier to see who owns England’s riverbanks. But this doesn’t go far enough, since there is no guarantee that landowners will allow the public to enjoy these landscapes. This, surely, has to change.Explore more on these topicsRiversOpinionLand ownershipAccess to green spaceLabourWalkingEnglandInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

There has been enthusiasm for spoken English in schools for much longer than that.In 1989, the government published the report English for Ages 5 to 16. In it, Brian Cox argued for the greater inclusion of oracy by asserting that “talk is now widely recognised as promoting and embodying a range of skills and competence – both transactional and social – that are central to children’s overall language development”.Much effort had already gone into legitimising spoken English opportunities in the classroom, including by its appearance in examinations for CSE English. This was not only for formal oral presentations (debates, rehearsed readings etc) but more for the dynamic use of language arising from the multiplicity of environments with effective communication at their heart.Jenkins is right when he argues that the narrow focus on the three Rs is archaic and irrelevant to the real world. What we need is a learning environment in which children can experience and explore talk in all its forms, as the backbone of language and its development.Dr Mike DavisBlackpool, LancashireAs a teacher of mathematics and computer science, I cannot let Simon Jenkins’ assertion that maths “is not needed by 95% of jobseekers” pass without comment. I accept that a lot of the maths taught for GCSE (eg trigonometry, quadratic functions, laws of indices) is irrelevant in daily life, but I imagine the same is true of all subjects, since most of us do not need, for example, to recall shapes of molecules or understand chromatography (science), or be familiar with medieval or early modern Britain (history).In her delightful book Is Maths Real?, Eugenia Cheng likens the study of maths to exercising core muscles. “There is no activity in life that involves only core muscles, but it’s helpful to have a strong core because it enables us to use the rest of our muscles to greater effect,” she writes. “It gives us better access to the rest of our strength, as well as protecting us against things like balance issues, tripping over and hurting our back.”All study for GCSE qualifications strengthens our brains – different subjects in slightly different ways. Hence studying a variety of subjects, including maths, is vital. Moreover, if we strip several of these subjects down to the core useful bits, what will be left for students to talk about in oracy practice sessions?Chris WillisOxfordI couldn’t agree more with Simon Jenkins. When I was a child my parents had no money for books and, as I had a twin, an ideal playmate, the idea of sitting and quietly reading was a non-starter. My parents talked a lot. To each other and to us. Opinions, family jokes, quickfire wit, stories and a lot of questions and most important, how to listen as well as talk. All this was, of course, informal.My English teacher assumed I read all of the time at home, such was my ability to communicate. Sadly, with so many distractions in the home these days, the teaching of oracy in the curriculum seems more essential than ever for a child’s development and ability to communicate and to take their place in the increasingly complex world.Debbie CameronFormby, MerseysideHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Migrant workers are indispensable in filling roles that have been undervalued, underpaid and unwanted for too long.With thousands more care professionals needed to look after our ageing population, the government needs a joined-up approach if the crisis-ridden sector is to be transformed.While the government’s fair pay agreement is the first step in turning care around, ministers must think again on their approach to foreign help – and, closer to home, announce the funding to make the fair pay agreement a reality.Decent wages and sufficient staff are essential elements of the promised national care service the country needs so desperately.Christina McAneaGeneral secretary, UnisonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Four changes, including the loss of Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope’s return to the captaincy, took a few moments to process.“I don’t want to eat my words but the likelihood I won’t play is very unlikely,” said Stokes afterthe stalemate at Old Trafford. While that quote needed scanning a few times, so did the gnarly right shoulder he was seen prodding and poking during what was a chastening failure to claim an unassailable 3-1 series lead. A grade-three tear to “a muscle I can’t pronounce” was the upshot, Stokes confirmed on Wednesday, and his summer is now frustratingly over.Ben Stokes ruled out of crunch fifth Test with India: ‘The risk was way too high’Read moreNot that some changes were not expected here. A series played on heartbreaking surfaces has left the quicks on both sides walking like a gaggle of C-3POs, although Chris Woakes, among those to play four, will go again. It would have been cruel to deny him in some ways, with the Oval pitch –battleground for the spatbetween Gautam Gambhir, India’s head coach, and Lee Fortis, Surrey’s head groundkeeper, who have missed out may end up cursing their misfortune.They are Brydon Carse, tapped out after bowling 155 overs across four Tests, and Jofra Archer, wisely stood down after 88.3 across two on his comeback from major injury. And there is also no Liam Dawson, which Stokes insisted was more about the need for a fourth seamer rather than his Test return being more tight than triumphant. Spin will instead come from the returning Jacob Bethell and Joe Root – the less said about Harry Brook’s lollipop off-breaks the better – with Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue and Jamie Overton the seamers joining Woakes.Quick GuideEngland v India: teams for fifth TestShowEngland (confirmed):Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope (c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue.India  (possible):Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shardul Thakur, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.While the broken foot that Rishabh Pant suffered in Manchester was a freak occurrence, India are still undecided about whether to risk Jasprit Bumrah. Flagged up at the start of the tour, his three-Test limit was reached in Manchester and, having broken down midway through the Sydney Test in January – which India might otherwise have won – any decision not to breach it would be understandable, if not still a bit of a Jasprit bummer for spectators. Mohammed Siraj (139 overs) is second only to Woakes (167) on the over-o-meters.The question here, using a word administrators understand, is whether a mere four-day turnaround for such a blockbuster finale is good for the “product”. In one sense it will mercifully move things on from thehandshakes-at-drawnchat that followed India’s great escape. But no Stokes, no Archer and possibly no Bumrah? The quality can only be reduced by the loss of three headliners and the weariness of those pushing through. Given what is on the line – England looking to win the first Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, with India still able to share the spoils – it is suboptimal.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Harry Brook (left) and Joe Root (right) with head coach Brendon McCullum during a practice session at the Oval on Wednesday.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersPeople will blame the Hundred, starting as it does next week and for which all decks must be apparently cleared. But while that tournament is one factor, inbound tours rattling along at a rate of knots has long been par for the course. Gone are the days of the 1993 Ashes – to pluck one example – when Australia arrived in April, flew home at the end of August and the shortest gap between Tests was nine days. But international sides have far more commitments in the current sardine-tin era and India’s players also came into this series straight after the epic that is the Indian Premier League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And in fairness, the schedulers were also not to know that a dry summer would create the featherbeds which have in turn pushed so many cast members into the red zone. (Contrary to popular belief, England have not asked for these: they just want pace and bounce). Nevertheless, as both captains stated before the match – albeit Stokes now England captain by proxy – just three days of rest does no one any favours.The Oval will still be full and new faces do bring some fresh intrigue at least. India may hand a debut to Arshdeep Singh – Anshul Kamboj may struggle to claim he is among those “rested” – while Atkinson’s return on his home ground is important for England in their final Test before the Ashes. And Bethell in for Stokes will inevitably be a talking point, given how accomplished he looked in New Zealand. Unlikely, admittedly, but if the last hour scenario at Old Trafford arises again in reverse, one wonders whether Pope will allow him to complete a first century in senior cricket.While India would love to end Shubman Gill’s first outing as captain with a creditable 2-2 draw, there is also the broader picture for England. As has long been said, the so-called Bazball project will be defined by this series and the Ashes that follows. The hope now is the finale of the first leg, box office in theory, will not be defined by the loss of Stokes and others who fell apart en route.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamBen StokesIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not a great day when you’re second in these races but we’re lucky to be part of them.”Mundane words like “shock” and “upset” do not come close to describing the result of this Group One contest, one of the most prestigious and prized events in the global racing calendar, which was won by a horse that finished 27th of 30 runners in the Royal Hunt Cup Handicap on his previous trip to the track. Qirat, as the stewards drily noted afterwards, “appeared to show improved form compared with its previous run”.Ralph Beckett’s ­gelding was widely assumed to be in the race simply to ensure an even pace before Field Of Gold, the 1-3 favourite and, like Qirat, in the colours of the Juddmonte operation, swept through the field to victory. It was, as it transpired, a rash assumption.The first part of the script played out much as expected, as Serengeti, the pacemaker for Aidan O’Brien’s Henri Matisse, worked his way to the front after a slow start and then went clear with Qirat and Richard Kingscote in close attendance.At the point around two ­furlongs out, Field Of Gold was expected to start closing them down. ­However, it soon became clear that the ­favourite was struggling to make ground. Instead, it was Sean Levy, on ­Rosallion, who set off in pursuit of the leaders, but as Serengeti dropped away, Qirat stayed on well and he was still two lengths in front at the ­furlong pole.Rosallion closed all the way to the winning post but Kingscote – who called the result “a bit surreal” – and Qirat still had a neck to spare at the line.Qirat was the longest-priced winner of a Group One race in Britain since the grading system was introduced in the early 1970s.Field Of Gold was clearly a long way below his best on his first visit to this tricky downland track, but Kingscote also deserves great credit for a no-nonsense ride at a frontrunners’ track, in a race where his rivals left themselves with too much to do.Beckett, Qirat’s trainer, was certainly surprised to find himself in the winner’s enclosure afterwards, but not entirely astonished. “We set out to go 12-second furlongs,” he said. “That was the plan and what he did. It is as simple as that.They didn’t sit close to him and that is the end result. When he went past Serengeti, I could see they were not coming and I was fairly confident he would not stop.”Kingscote described the outcome as “not what I expected this morning” but the race was also a fine advertisement for his talent for judging the fractions in front, a gift that should find plenty of new fans when Kingscote sets off for a four-month stint in Hong Kong from the start of September.“Towards the cut-away [around two furlongs out] I was thinking he was going well,” Kingscote said, “but you always expect the horses rated 20lb higher to be coming through.View image in fullscreenQirat and Richard Kingscote return to the winner’s enclosure after winning the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“It is better to be going off [to Hong Kong] on a positive note. I’m looking forward to the opportunity but I have not burned bridges so I can always come back if need be.”John Gosden, the trainer of Field Of Gold, said that the favourite “didn’t seem too well-balanced on the track”, adding: “He got a little unbalanced coming out of the dip into the bend, but I am not making any excuses. They ignored the pacemaker and paid the price.”Fire can blaze a trail in NassauThe five-runner field for Thursday’s Nassau Stakes is the joint-smallest this century for the Group One feature on the third day ofGlorious Goodwood, but while Minding was a prohibitive 1-5 favourite to beat four opponents in 2016, this year’s renewal is a fascinating and open contest with four closely matched fillies at single-figure odds.Whirl, the Oaks runner-up and a Group One winner in Ireland last time out, heads the three-year-old challenge alongside Cercene, last month’s Coronation Stakes winner, and Bedtime Story, who is looking to recapture the form of her impressive juvenile success at Royal Ascot last summer.It is an impressive squad for the Classic generation, in a Group One where three-year-olds have enjoyed plenty of success in recent seasons. They face a stern four-year-old opponent inSee The Fire (3.05), however, and Andrew Balding’s filly is a solid 2-1 shot to improve on her narrow defeat in this race 12 months ago.See The Fire produced one of the most visually impressive performances of the season to finish a dozen lengths clear of her field in the Middleton Stakes at York in May in a fast time, and raced closer to the pace than the two that beat her in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.That run in open company confirmed that she is an improved performer this season and Ombudsman, the winner, went down only narrowly in the Eclipse next time out.Goodwood 1.20Best Secretwas a big-money buy to join the Wathnan Racing operation before Royal Ascot last month and repaid at least a little of the outlay when finishing third in a strong renewal of the Golden Gates Handicap, despite finding plenty of traffic problems in the home straight.

Her stage win and bonus seconds took her back into the race lead, at the expense of Marianne Vos.Tour de France Femmes: Wiebes strikes again as Vollering admits post-crash anxietiesRead more“The big goal was to take the bonus sprint,” Le Court said of her success in the Tour Femmes’ longest stage “which I managed to do. It was a bit tricky at the end. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching, but in the sprint when you lift your hands you should double-check. Close or not close, I still crossed the line first.”Le Court, riding for AG Insurance-Soudal, admitted that her success in the bonus sprints could be pivotal. “We have seen a few tours that have been lost by a few seconds, so we are fighting for every second possible. Seconds are super-important and you just never know.”Le Court and Vollering were part of a select group of race favourites, also including defending champion Kasia Niewiadoma, Olympic mountain biking champion, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and former world road race champion, Anna van der Breggen, that moved ahead on the final climb into Guéret.Three climbs in the final 35km shattered the peloton. On the first, the Cote de Chabannes, the trio of breakaway riders split apart, with Brodie Chapman, riding for UAE Team ADQ, the last to be caught.The ferocious pace to the final climb, Le Maupuy, reduced the lead group even further, with Niewiadoma’s Canyon-Sram ZondaCrypto team leading the way, and finally getting some distance on the overnight leader, Vos.The war of words between the Visma-Lease a Bike team of Vos and Ferrand-Prévot and that of FDJ-Suez race favourite Vollering had looked to be over after the team managers Jos van Emden and Stephen Delcourt shook hands in the team bus parking area before the stage start in Futuroscope.After Vollering’s crash on Monday evening, Delcourt had rounded on her rivals saying: “The mentality of some teams is insane. Absolutely disrespectful. How is it possible that everyone wants to gamble with their lives?”Van Emden’s reaction to Delcourt’s criticisms only fanned the flames. “I have absolutely no respect for those comments,” he said of Delcourt. “He apparently wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.”In Futuroscope, the pair came face to face, with Visma’s Jacco Verhaeren, the team’s sporting director, acting as moderator, for a 20-minute discussion. “It was really good, really constructive,” Delcourt said. “We share the same idea. We want safety for everybody.” The Frenchman added that he did not regret his original comments. “No, I don’t. We agreed to disagree.”View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering and Kim Le Court at the end of stage five.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesAny truce, however, might be short-lived. Only a few minutes prior to the conciliatory meeting, Delcourt, speaking to French media, had described Van Emden as “stupid, he only thinks of himself and has an over-sized ego”.Vollering, meanwhile, appears focused on the race and is seemingly recovered from a crash which only 48 hours earlier had looked likely to force her to quit. Second place, in a ferocious finish, showed that her ambition and appetite remain intact.Thursday’s sixth stage, from Clermont-Ferrand to Ambert, further ramps up the pressure with four climbs, including the first category Col du Béal in the second half of the stage. The rolling roads of the opening stages are now behind them as the peloton braces itself for a long and gruelling weekend in the mountains.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Dahlmeier was climbing with her mountaineering partner when she was struck by a sudden rockfall in the Hushe Valley, part of the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region.“Laura Dahlmeier died on 28 July in a mountain accident on Laila Peak (6,069 metres) in Pakistan’s Karakoram range,” her representatives told Germany’s Die Welt newspaper. “A recovery operation was launched but ultimately called off on the evening of 29 July.”Dahlmeier’s representatives added that she most likely died instantly, while her mountaineering partner was unharmed and remained at the site. Poor weather conditions have prevented a rescue helicopter from reaching the location.“It was Laura Dahlmeier’s express and written will that in a case like this, no one should risk their life to recover her,” they said. “It was her wish to leave her body behind on the mountain in this case. This is also in line with the wishes of her relatives.”The 31-year-old Dahlmeier was an experienced mountaineer. She had been in the Gilgit-Baltistan region since the end of June and had already ascended the Great Trango Tower.View image in fullscreenLaura Dahlmeier at a World Cup biathlon event in Canada in 2019.Photograph: Jeff McIntosh/APDahlmeier, who was born in the Bavarian ski town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, was also honoured by the premier of her home state, Markus Söder. “Laura epitomised her native Bavaria in the best sense of the word: she was ambitious and successful, yet always remained humble and close to her homeland,” he said in a statement.“Even after her active career, she shared her love of sport as a winter sports expert, member of the mountain rescue service and ski guide,” Söder added.Dahlmeier retired from biathlon in 2019, at 25 years old, a year after becoming the first female biathlete to achieve a sprint and pursuit double at the same Olympics, winning two golds and individual bronze at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.“Laura made history at the Pyeongchang 2018Winter Olympicsas the first female biathlete to win sprint and pursuit gold at the same Games edition.

Michelle Wie won just a single major. Charley Hull has reached the age of 29 while scaling golfing heights, but it is fair to say wild excitement about her career when a teenage amateur has not been borne out by subsequent results. For a multitude of reasons, promise can outweigh reality.If it were at all her style – and it is not – Lottie Woad could claim to have already justified the hype. Winning last year’s Augusta National Women’s Amateur was a statement of intent. Recent weeks have been rocket-fuelled for the 21-year-old; Woad won the Irish Open and challenged for the Evian Championship while still an amateur. One professional start, at the Scottish Open, saw Woad lift the trophy on Sunday. She is the name on everyone’s lips as the Women’s Open lands at the glorious links of Royal Porthcawl,Thursday.“She’s playing great golf,” said Lydia Ko,the defending champion, of Woad. “I’ve seen her swing. My coach has sent me a video of her swing as well because there’s aspects that I’m kind of going for that she has.”Donald Trump increases his golf footprint in Scotland while world looks elsewhere | Ewan MurrayRead moreHigh praise. There was more, lots of it. “I think what Lottie Woad has done is absolutely unbelievable,” said Hull. “I played with her in the practice rounds in Ireland and in the first two rounds last week. At the minute I feel like she’s playing with such confidence she can’t miss a shot. I think it’s great to see. She’s a breath of fresh air for the game. I’m actually really proud of Lottie for what she’s done. That’s like goosebumps kind of stuff.”Hull’s own builduphas been beset by illnessand a back injury. “I’m not hitting it the best, which is very frustrating because it’s an event I’ve been looking forward to playing all year,” she said.Woad will have Ko and Lilia Vu for company in the marquee grouping for days one and two. “I don’t feel too different, to be honest,” Woad said. “I got a lot of confidence from the last month, really. I am just trying to continue to ride that. There’s always pressure. I don’t think there’s any more than there was, like from my perspective, before any of the last few weeks. I was still wanting to contend and that’s still the aim.”Like Scottie Scheffler, who isdominating the male game, Woad will not talk in headlines. Like the American, Woad’s swing can be unorthodox. She has something in common with another icon of this sport; Woad is managed by the same agency as Tiger Woods.She serves as the latest example of how the American college circuit prepares golfers for life as a professional. The Surrey athlete excelled at Florida State University amid a rise to the summit of the amateur world rankings. “She’s been in a lot of those kind of tougher moments,” Ko added. “Obviously it’s different than being an amateur and playing collegiate golf to as a pro, but I think she’s been there and done really well in those pressure conditions no matter what kind of environment she’s been in. So I think there’s a little bit more experience under her belt than what people probably give her credit for.View image in fullscreenLottie Woad won the Scottish Open by six shots on Sunday.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA“When I’ve seen the coverage or how she composes herself, she doesn’t seem like she rushes into things or gets like overly emotional. I’m sure that’s going to help her with that transition as well.”Ko’s analysis is valid. Woad’s greatest strength is appearing totally unflustered when placed in tricky golfing scenarios. Her display of front-running at Dundonald Links on Sunday made a mockery of supposed rookie status. In Ireland, she won by six shots.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it comes to her shot routine, especially under pressure and in the heat of the moment, sometimes people seem to fidget and kind of doubt themselves but she stuck to it, she stuck to her process every single time. I think one of the main things that I noticed is how mature she is for her age and how comfortable she was in the heat of the moment.“You can see that she’s put a ton of hours in. Her putting is very solid, her game’s solid, she hits it pretty far off the tee. She grew up in this kind of weather too, so I feel like she’s kind of comfortable.” It would seem a shock if Woad is not in Porthcawl contention.The R&A has increased the prize fund for this major, by $250,000 to $9.75m (£7.3m), with the winner collecting $1.4m. The male equivalent had its purse frozen for 2025. The scale of growth in the Women’s Open is shown by the fact golfers were competing for $3.25m as recently as 2018. It was confirmed on Wednesday that the 2027 edition of the tournament will take place at Royal St George’s, which has staged the men’s Open 15 times.A rare stop for elite golf in Wales has seen players assess the local culture. “When I drove from Scotland after I missed the cut last week, I saw all the road signs,” said Grace Kim. “It went from English to, not in a rude way, like gibberish.” Ouch.Explore more on these topicsWomen's OpenGolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

Filip Djuricic opened the scoring with a header in the 53rd minute but moments after coming off the bench, Gassama, who scored from a substitute’s role on his debut last week, levelled at 1-1 with a stunning drive.Carlisle to Bosnia: Tyler Burey on an unlikely path to the Champions LeagueRead moreA remarkable start to the 21-year-old’s Rangers career took the heat out of the home side’s fightback, although Russell Martin should not be fooled. His side rode their luck for the second time againstPanathinaikos, who will rue a series of missed opportunities over the two games. Rangers set up a third qualifying tie against the Czech side Viktoria Plzen, who knocked out Switzerland’s Servette.Martin told Rangers’ official YouTube channel: “I’m so proud of the team, the group and the fans were incredible. It was a big night for us, so early on in the process of trying to be the team we want to be.“I don’t think it can be underestimated how difficult this tie and this night was and, especially after the first half, it was so difficult. But I think the players have come through a really tough time and I’m really proud of them.“And then we have a setback by conceding the goal and then we took the sting out of the game by scoring and responding really quickly, that’s not easy.“The fans were amazing and they stuck with us throughout and it’s been a really good night and we will get better. It’s so early on. There’s loads of growing to do and nights like this will definitely help the players grow.”In what was Martin’s first away game as Rangers manager and only his second in Europe, he kept the same side which started last week at Ibrox. Rui Vitória’s side were without suspended right-back Georgios Vagiannidis, sent off in Glasgow for picking up two yellow cards, and his place was taken by Giannis Kotsiras.The home side bossed and battered Rangers in the first half, starting in the fifth minute when midfielder Anastasios Bakasetas drove just wide from the edge of the box following another corner. In the 14th minute, Rangers’ dithering defender Max Aarons was robbed by former Manchester United man Facundo Pellistri, which left the attacker one-on-one with Butland and the goalkeeper brilliantly blocked the shot.Butland then made another terrific save from a close-range header by captain Fotis Ioannidis, who had beaten defender John Souttar to a great cross from Pellistri. Panathinaikos defender Erik Palmer-Brown headed a Bakasetas free-kick over the bar from six yards before the unmarked Pellistri missed a sitter in the 28th minute, blasting high over from 12 yards after James Tavernier had conceded possession inside the box.View image in fullscreenPanathinaikos’s Filip Duricic (right) in action against Rangers’ Max Aarons.Photograph: Georgia Panagopoulou/EPARangers’ two real efforts came in rare attacks, Findlay Curtis missing the target and Nico Raskin heading over, both from corners.Waves of Panathinaikos pressure continued after the break but when Duricic wrong-footed Butland with a header from a Bakasetas cross, the flag went up for offside. However, after a long VAR check, the Italian referee, Simone Sozza, awarded the goal but more drama quickly ensued.Moments later, Gassama, the former Sheffield Wednesday forward who replaced Curtis after the goal, fired in off the post from 14 yards in a rare Rangers attack to restore their two-goal lead.Rangers’ substitute Cyriel Dessers missed a great chance in added time when he failed to beat Bartlomiej Dragowski following a counterattack but it mattered not. Rangers moved into the next qualifying round and guaranteed themselves group-stage European football of some sort this season.Shelbourne’s hopes of progressing in the Champions League were ended by a 4-0 aggregate defeat to Azerbaijani clubQarabagin the second qualifying round.Trailing 3-0 following last week’s first leg at Tolka Park, the League of Ireland champions were beaten 1-0 at Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium in Baku.

The visitors came close to a 56th-minute equaliser when mKerr McInroy was denied by home goalkeeper Mateusz Kochalski following fine work down the left from Liverpool loanee James Norris.

Palace are believed to have indicated that they are not willing to accept any bids below the 27-year-old’s release clause and want £35m in advance, with the rest of his initial £60m fee due in instalments.How to stop Viktor Gyökeres? ‘We’d have to foul him just to slow him down’Read moreThe clause includes up to £7.5m in add-ons and is thought to expire before the Premier League season kicks off on 16 August, although that is not understood to affect Palace’s valuation of the player they signed from Queens Park Rangers in 2020 for a fee worth up to £19.5m. QPR are believed to be due 15% of any profit Palace make on the sale. Arsenal officials are understood to have met with Eze’s representatives last month to discuss personal terms and he is thought to be keen to return to the club where he was released as a 13-year-old.Having committed more than £200m on six players during this window, Arsenal are hoping to move on several fringe players that could help fund a move for Eze. There is interest in Leandro Trossard from other Premier League clubs as well as Borussia Dortmund, with the Belgium forward yet to sign an extension on his deal that expires next summer, although Arsenal have an option to extend it by 12 months. Reiss Nelson is being targeted by Fulham, while Albert Sambi Lokonga, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fábio Vieira would also be allowed to depart for the right price.With the appeal against their demotion from the Europa League due to be heard at the court of arbitration for sport on or before 11 August, Palace are also facing uncertainty overthe future of captain Marc Guéhi. He is wanted by Liverpool but the Premier League champions have so far been reluctant to meet Palace’s valuation for the defender, whose contract expires next summer.Palace are believed to have lined up Ousmane Diomande from Sporting as a potential replacement for Guéhi, while they are also interested in Bilal El Khannouss of Leicester. But with goalkeeper Walter Benítez and defender Borna Sosa the only new additions to the squad so far, manager Oliver Glasner has admitted his disappointment at Palace’s lack of activity. “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far,” the manager told Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung during the club’s pre-season tour. “I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year.“As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible”.

Whittingham had claimed in a statement released the previous day to be working “with the consortium led by Jonny Cato” on a deal to acquire the majority shareholding in Morecambe. He also claimed Bond Group had been unable to contact Panjab Warriors, the London-based investment company who received clearance from the EFL to purchase Morecambe in June.Morecambe’s future thrown into doubt after suspension from National LeagueRead morePanjab Warriors have since declared they are willing to proceed with a takeover with immediate effect. But in a further demonstration of the mounting crisis at Morecambe, who were relegated from the Football League after 18 years last season, it was revealed on Wednesday that all first-team operations have come to a halt.A joint statement issued by Panjab Warriors, the Shrimps Trust, minority shareholders and the Morecambe and Lunesdale MP, Lizzi Collinge, said: “As each day passes, the debts of the club are mounting, with wages now outstanding at over £316,000, and further significant debts that need to be paid to ensure survival of the club, which Panjab Warriors have already committed to pay within hours of completion with Bond Group.“In further developments today, the first team have had to stop all football operations as the required insurance which was in place has now lapsed as payment has not been made. As a result of this escalating situation, more first-team players have left the club with further players set to leave by the end of this week.”The statement added: “We implore Bond Group to complete the sale of the club immediately so that this anguish can be ended and the club can look to a brighter future under Panjab Warriors.”Explore more on these topicsMorecambenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead of raging about cosy cartels, the unfairness of PSR and the fact their billionaire owner isn’t allowed to spend money on players that the football club he owns hasn’t earned, mackems have since looked on with increasing intrigue as their club’s hierarchy have unveiled a series of new signings that, while unlikely to prompt talk of a serious title tilt, may at least ensure that Sunderland do not feature in any conversational comparisons with Derby County and their record low Premier League points tally of 11 in the coming months.It’s a near-certainty that Enzo Le Fée, Habib Diarra, Simon Adingra, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki and Reinildo Mandava won’t all go on to achieve Hall of Fame status on Wearside. But, in signing the six players, the club have shown they at least intend to make a decent fist of trying to stay up, while also putting the Sunderland ‘Til I Die days of Jack Rodwell on £70,000-per-week in League One, paying £4m for Will Grigg in an ill-advised deadline-day panic buy and that Oxbridge fop in the red trousers sound checking Ibiza anthems over the Stadium of Light PA long behind them. Of course, this being Sunderland, the possibility of sky-high farce and a snake belly low league position can never be discounted and despite these signings, the club’s head coach, Régis Le Bris, looked at risk of embarking on his first ever Premier League campaign with a callow and whey-faced squad boasting little or no top-flight experience.A grizzled old hand was required. Ideally a handsome, tough-tackling midfield veteran with more than a century of caps. A man whose leadership skills were held in such high regard by his peers that he famously topped the players’ poll for the position of Arsenal captain in 2019 without recourse to a recount. A man so impervious to the slings and brickbats of his once-adoring public that he would go on to … er, lose that captaincy afterthrowing a strop in the face of fan derisionfor being substituted against Crystal Palace. A man who realised the Sisyphean futility of trying to win a title at the Emirates andwent to Germany to win one instead. And a man who realised he was unlikely to win another one because Leverkusen are now managed by Erik ten Hag. What Sunderland needed was the man, the warrior, the myth and the occasionally contrary red and yellow card-magnet that is Granit Xhaka.And hell’s bells,if they haven’t gone and got him, in the process landing the kind of transfer coup which suggests that if they are to eventually go down next season, they will at least do so swinging haymakers of both the metaphorical and literal variety. “I’m very proud to be here,” roared the man who finished 16th on last year’s Ballon d’Or list and has signed a three-year deal for a fee of around £20m. “When I spoke to the club, I was excited and I felt the energy and the mentality that all the people and players have. It’s exactly what I wanted and I have a very good feeling.” Having made it clear before his move that he was hell-bent on moving to Sunderland, Xhaka’s arrival has prompted several questions, the most pertinent of which seems to be why exactly he was so hell-bent on going to Sunderland. “We are back to where this club needs to be, and we want to stay here to write our own history,” yodelled the Swiss legend to his adoring public from the central tower of Durham Cathedral. “I feel that I’m ready to help the team with my experience but with quality as well.” And while history is famously written by the winners, there isn’t a mackem alive who won’t be delighted if next season it’s chronicled by the team finishing 17th.QUOTE OF THE DAY“We have done this immediately, following an assessment by engineering specialists who can no longer confirm that the North Stand is safe for spectator use” – afteryesterday’s Football Daily, Sheffield city councillor Joe Otten reveals the outlook is even more grim for Wednesday fans after they were beenbanned from opening Hillsborough’s North Standto spectators due to safety concerns, with the new season little more than a week away.FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSPerhaps the reason for Sheffield Wednesday’s 10-man, 16-0 defeat to Halliwell FC in 1887 (yesterday’s Football Daily) was that not all members of the 1896 FA Cup-winning squad were trusting of the Victorian time machine technology that the club were clearly using at that time?” – Garreth Cummins (and others).Althoughthe numberis the same as Football Daily’s pedants, my only knowledge of ‘Bonnie Blue’ is that I thought it was an affectionate name for Cowdenbeath’s home kit.

It will also be the Lionesses’ third Wembley fixture of 2025, following victories over Spain in February and Portugal in May.England’s autumn friendlies will help them prepare for their 2027 World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins in February. Wiegman’s side were World Cup finalists in 2023 and will be hoping to go one better in Brazil in two years’ time. England’s most recent meeting with China came during their run to the 2023 final. Theywon 6-1 in Adelaide.“After an incredible month and the celebrations this week, we are already planning ahead,” Wiegman said. “It will be special to have a final visit to Wembley this year and something for us all to look forward to once the new season starts.“There are not many opportunities for us to play non-European opposition in the calendar so I am happy we have been able to secure a top Asian side like China for this Fifa window.”The fixture with China, who are ranked 17th in the world, will be a 5.30pm kick-off and broadcast live on ITV.Meanwhile, the financial reward for winning the Women’s FA Cup has been frozen for another year after the FA confirmed the competition’s prize pot for the season on Wednesday, meaning it remains more than three times smaller than the men’s prize.There has been a slender increase in the overall women’s pot, owing to the introduction of a preliminary round for clubs in the seventh tier. Winning teams will each receive £600, before the first round of qualifying. However, the money awarded to teams winning fixtures in all of the subsequent rounds of the competition remains unchanged.The £430,000 reward winning the final is unchanged for a third straight year. By contrast, the winners of the men’s FA Cup final take home £2m. Taking into account their cumulative reward for a successful cup run from the fourth round, when Women’s Super League sides enter, a WSL team would receive £814,000 for winning the cup, whereas a cup-winning men’s Premier League would accumulate £3,910,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Including penalty shootouts, has anybody else scored the winner in two major international tournaments? And which women have dominated a whole competition?”asks Emma Pollard.For a player who has never started a knockout match at a major tournament, Chloe Kelly has had … a reasonable impact. She scored the winner against Germany in extra time in 2022, and the winning penalty in the shootout against Spain on Sunday. Kelly also set up Alessia Russo’s equaliser in the final, played a key role in both goals against Sweden in the quarter-finals, kept England in the tournament with a nerveless penalty in the subsequent shootout, and then scored a 119th-minute winner against Italy in the semi-finals.We’re not done. In 2023, Kellyscored the winning penalty in the shootoutagainst Nigeria in the World Cup last 16. If you include theFinalissima against Brazil earlier the same year, Kelly has scored the winning penalty in three shootouts for England. That’s more than every other man and woman in England combined. Eric Dier (Colombia, World Cup 2018) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (Switzerland, Euro 2024) are the only players to do it once.Kelly’s substitute role means she hasn’t dominated a World Cup or European Championship finals like Carli Lloyd in 2015 or, in the men’s game, Diego Maradona at Mexico ‘86. But she is the first player to score the decisive goal – shootouts included – in two World Cup or European Championship finals. Hers is a modern kind of glory: from the bench, often involving extra time and penalties.Some greats of the women’s game have stolen the show in different ways. Germany’sBirgit Prinzscored in – and you’ll like this –fivefinals between 1995 and 2009. Germany won them all, four in the Euros (1995, 1997, 2005, 2009) and one World Cup in 2007. Prinz was also part of the team that won Euro 2001, more of which below, but failed to score in the final.To find a recent example of a player grabbing the headlines at the business end of a tournament, you only need to go back a couple of years. The Spain left-backOlga Carmonafollowed an 89th-minute winner against Sweden in the World Cup semi-final byrifling in the only goal of the final against England.The most dominant performance across a whole knockout stage probably belongs to the aforementionedCarli Lloyd. In 2015, she was player of the match in all four of the USWNT’s knockout games. She scored in all four, too, including the only goal against China in the quarter-finals, the opener against Germany in the semis – and a hat-trick inside the first 16 minutes of thefinal against Japan.View image in fullscreenCarli Lloyd celebrates after scoring against Japan in the 2015 World Cup final.Photograph: Erich Schlegel/USA Today SportsFor overall impact, that’s very difficult to beat. A few other players are worthy of mention, though:Pia Sundhage (Sweden, Euro 1984)Semi-final first leg: scored Sweden’s second equaliser in 3-2 win away to ItalySemi-final second leg: scored both goals in 2-1 win (5-3 agg)Final: scored Sweden’s only goal across the two legs against England, which ended 1-1 on aggregate, then scored the winning penalty in the shootout(NB: The tournament began at the semi-final stage)Vivianne Miedema (Netherlands, Euro 2017)Quarter-final: second goal in 2-0 win over SwedenSemi-final: opening goal in 3-0 hammering of EnglandFinal: equalised in the 10th minute v Denmark, then scored in the 89th minute to seal a 4-2 winMegan Rapinoe (USA, World Cup 2019)Last 16: scored two penalties in 2-1 win against SpainQuarter-final: scored both goals in 2-1 win over hosts FranceSemi-final: didn’t play v England due to injuryFinal: opened the scoring from the spot in 2-0 win over the NetherlandsThose are the best examples we could find from the Women’s Euros and World Cup. But if you have any from other tournaments – or we’ve missed something obvious – please get in touch.View image in fullscreenPia Sundhage (bottom right) played a big part as Sweden won the 1984 European Championship.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyWon in 60 seconds“Excluding added time, England were ahead for one minute in the knockout rounds of Euro 2025,”notes Chris Williams.“Assuming this is a record, how does it compare to previous tournaments?”Kelly’s 119th-minute goal against Italy put England ahead for the only time in their three knockout games against Sweden, Italy and Spain. Including added time, they led for four minutes 52 seconds out of approximately six and a half hours. We’ll focus on here on how that compares to previous major women’s tournaments.We don’t have the added time for previous tournaments so, for purposes of comparison, we’ve counted each match as lasting 90 or 120 minutes. Before this tournament, the winners of the women’s Euros who spent the least time in front wereGermanyin 2001. They were ahead for a total of33 minutes, but the context was very different. While England played 360 minutes of knockout football in this tournament, Germany played only 188 in 2001. There are two reasons for that: there were no quarter-finals and the final was decided by a golden goal.Germany won both their knockout matches 1-0. Sandra Smisek scored after 57 minutes against Norway, giving Germany a lead that lasted 33 minutes. The final against Sweden was settled by an iconic golden goal from Claudia Müller in the eighth minute of extra time. The moment she put Germany ahead, the tournament was over.Quarter-finals were introduced to the Euros in 2009. Since then, and before this year, this year the team who spent the least time in front were …England in 2022. The total was107 minuteson that occasion: 24 in extra time v Spain, 56 v Sweden and 27 in the final against Germany.The briefest frontrunners among the World Cup winners areJapan’s class of 2011, who were ahead for a combined total of42 minutesout of a possible 330 across three knockout games. In the quarter-final against the holders Germany, Karina Maruyama scored the only goal after 108 minutes. Japan then came from behind to beat Sweden 3-1 in the semi-finals, a match in which they led for the last half-hour.View image in fullscreenJapan’s 2011 World Cup winners led for just 42 minutes across three knockout games.Photograph: Action Images/Action Images/ReutersIn the final against the United States, Japan twice came from behind to draw 2-2, with Homare Sawa scoring in the 117th minute to take the match to penalties. Japan won the shootout 3-1. When the music stopped, they were in the winning chair.Any suggestions from further afield?Mail uswith your answers.Michael and Michelle“At the age of 19, is Michelle Agyemang the youngest England player to win an individual award at a major tournament?”wonders Alex Smith.Agyemang’s impact on Euro 2025 had gone into English football folklore even before the tournament was over. The Arsenal forward still hasn’t started an international match but was a threat from the bench in every game and scored dramatic equalisers against Sweden and Italy in the quarter- and semi-finals.Her story resembles that ofMichael Owen, who was even younger when he took France ‘98 by storm at the age of 18. Owen won Fifa’s young player of the tournament award after scoring against Romania and Argentina. “In my mind, Owen was the only good thing to come out of France 98,” said Diego Maradona a few years later. “He had speed, cunning and balls.”View image in fullscreenSpeed, cunning and balls: Michael Owen takes on Argentina.Photograph: Star Images/Action Images/ReutersAs far as we’re aware, the other England players to receive official individual awards were all in their 20s and 30s:Golden BallBeth Mead (aged 27, Euro 2022)Silver BallLucy Bronze (27, World Cup 2019)Golden BootHarry Kane (24, World Cup 2018)Gary Lineker (25, World Cup 1986)Beth Mead (27, Euro 2022, shared with Germany’s Alexandra Popp)Jodie Taylor (31, Euro 2017)Bronze BootEllen White (30, World Cup 2019)Golden GloveMary Earps (29, World Cup 2023)Best young playerMichael Owen (18, World Cup 1998)Michelle Agyemang (19, Euro 2025)Knowledge archive“Are the Lionesses the first team to win a major international tournament after going behind in every knockout game?”asks Danielle Patterson.We had a similar question last year, when England’s men’s team beat Slovakia, Switzerland and the Netherlands after conceding the first goal.

I thought: ‘Today is our day.’ To do that? What a year. I can’t think about it too much or I’ll cry. If I reflect on the last couple years since that last win in 2022, I’m proud.”The Arsenal centre-back was superb in Switzerland, flying under the radar a little amid the hype around England’s supersubs, consistently delivering despite a conveyor belt of centre-pack partners during the tournament – first Alex Greenwood, then Jess Carter, then Esme Morgan, then Carter again.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson and Kim Little lift the Champions League with Arsenal in May.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersIn the final, no player dribbled past Williamson or Carter, they had the joint-most blocked shots and Williamson had more defensive actions and clearances than any other player on the pitch. Critically though, her range of passing was exceptional, her diagonal balls a vital component in England’s forward play. She made more line-breaking passes than any other defender at the tournament, a total bettered only by the Spain midfielder Patri Guijarro.Williamson is a big-game player. She was also part of an Arsenal backline that did not concede a foul in the Champions League final in as close to a perfect performance as you can get on the way to the Gunners’ second European title, but she is also a small-game player, consistent and stoic.Few who have followed Williamson’s career would have been surprised when she was named as Steph Houghton’s successor as captain of the Lionesses in 2022, despite the presence of more senior heads such as Lucy Bronze, Millie Bright and Ellen White and her having only 20 caps at the time. She has often been cited as being wise beyond her years, the former Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro describing her “maturity, understanding of the game and positional sense” to those of a 30-year-old, when she was 25.Chloe Kelly knew much earlier than that. “I remember stepping into Arsenal at 12 years old and saying to my parents: ‘Leah’s going to be England captain one day,’” she said. “She’s just an incredible girl, shows great leadership qualities and is so approachable, someone that I get on so well with. To captain England at major tournaments there is a lot of pressure but it doesn’t show in Leah’s personality at all. She’s just so consistent, highs, lows and everything in between. She’s a great England captain.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is a learned trait, balanced with the example set by the Arsenal captain, Kim Little, who leads with her feet more than her voice.“Leah’s great,” said Ella Toone during this summer’s tournament. “She rallies the team, gets everyone going, keeps everyone together, and leads by example in the way she plays. You want your captain to really step up in games and she definitely does that. She takes us all with her as well.”She plays and leads with an emotional intelligence, often seen deep in conversation with Sarina Wiegman whenever there is a pause in play, the mind constantly analysing, learning, recalculating. After Kelly’s penalty confirmed England’s title retention on Sunday, Williamson stepped quickly away from the initial celebrations to work her way around the distraught Spain players – leadership involves sacrifice.The party continues, an open-top bus parade down the Mall and celebration outside Buckingham Palace giving them the full hero treatment. And the work continues, with the government announcing it is aiming to double the pitch slots available to women and girls at grassroots level after the Lionesses headed straight to Downing Street when they landed back home on Monday.After that, it is time for Williamson to shake off the burden of responsibility, breathe, just soak it all in and get ready to go again. “You’ve won everything at Arsenal, how does that motivate you to do more?” I asked her after the Champions League win. “I haven’t won everything,” she said quickly. “I’ve got a World Cup to win.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamLeah WilliamsonWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Imports fromSouth Korea, a powerhouse exporter of computer chips, cars and steel, faced a 25% rate.“I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea,” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday.The South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, said on Thursday the deal would put South Korea on an equal or better footing compared with other countries.‘Terrible fuel efficiency, no right-hand drive’: why trade deal won’t warm up Japan to American carsRead moreLee also said the countries had agreed to set up a $350bn investment fund, out of which $150bn was aimed at a shipbuilding partnership.In a statement posted to Facebook, Lee called the deal “the first major trade challenge” since his administration took power in June, adding: “We have overcome a major hurdle.”“Through this deal, the government has eliminated uncertainty surrounding export conditions and ensured that US tariffs on our exports are either lower than or equal to those imposed on our major trade competitors,” Lee said.The 15% rate is equivalent to levies determined fromUS trade deals with Japanandthe European Union.Trump had said that as part of the arrangement, South Korea would invest $350bn in the US in projects selected by him and purchase $100bn of liquefied natural gas and other energy products.It was not immediately clear how the investment deals would be structured or over what time frame. Trump said additional investments would be announced later.Lee would visit the White House “within the next two weeks” for a meeting with Trump, the US president added.He also said South Korea would accept American products – including cars, trucks and agriculture – into its markets and impose no import duties on them.The South Korean presidential office said that under the deal, the US would lower tariffs on South Korean-made autos to 15%, from 25%. It also said computer chips and pharmaceutical tariffs imposed on the country’s US-bound exports would not be worse than other countries, and that South Korea’s rice and beef markets would not be open.South Korean finance minister Koo Yun-cheol, industry minister Kim Jung-kwan and minister for trade Yeo Han-koo had been in Washington for talks with senior US officials and were believed to have met with Trump shortly before the deal announcement.Pressure had been mounting on South Korea since Japan clinched a deal to cut Trump’s threatened tariffs to 15% earlier this month.Amid the last-minute push by government officials to reach a tariff deal, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics inked a $16.5bn chip deal with Tesla.South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution also signed a $4.3bn deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.In contrast with the 15% tariff for South Korea, Trump on Wednesday also placed25% tariffs on imports from Indiaand50% on those from Brazil.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSouth KoreaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In a newmemoposted on Wednesday ahead of the company’s quarterly earnings report, Mark Zuckerberg, describes his ambitions for developing what he calls “superintelligence”.“Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves,” Zuckerberg wrote. “The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.”Wall Street investors are happy with the expensive course Zuckerberg is charting. After the company reported better-than-expected financial results for yet another quarter, its stock soared by double digits.Though Zuckerberg did not provide any details of what would qualify as “superintelligence” versus standard artificial intelligence, he did say that it would pose “novel safety concerns”.“We’ll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source,” he wrote.Zuckerberg wrote that the company differs from other AI firms in that Meta aims to bring “personal superintelligence to everyone”. Other companies are focused on primarily using “superintelligence” for productivity and to automate “all valuable work”, he wrote.“The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society,” he wrote.Investors want to know: does AI mean cashflow?Investors are looking for signs that the parent company of WhatsApp,Instagramand Facebook is spending its billions efficiently. The social media company reported its second quarter earnings on Wednesday after the close of the New York stock exchange and beat investor expectations yet again sending stocks soaring 10%. Analysts expect Meta will have to answer questions about whether the revenue the company is bringing in will help offset the hundreds of billions the firm is spending on recruiting and infrastructure, collectively known as capital expenditure.“AI-driven investments into Meta’s advertising business continue to pay off, bolstering its revenue as the company pours billions of dollars into AI ambitions like superintelligence,” said Minda Smiley, a senior analyst at Emarketer. “But Meta’s exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns.”Meta reported $7.14 in earnings per share (EPS) on $47.52bn in revenue, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $5.92 in earnings per share on $44.8bn in revenue. This quarter is the latest in the company’s multiple-quarter streak of exceeding Wall Street’s financial expectations despite enormous spending on AI.The company also said it expects to bring in $47.5bn to 50.5bn in revenue in the third quarter of 2025.Zuckerberg provided few tangible updates in the memo, but one thing is clear: getting to this so-called higher level of intelligence will require a great deal of capital. Meta reported that the total costs and expenditures for the second quarter of 2025 came in at $27.07bn – up 12% year over year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.01bn.The company also provided updated guidance on how much the firm expects to spend in the next few months. Meta said it expected to spend between $114bn and $118bn in total expenses in 2025 – a slight adjustment from its previous projection of between $113bn and $118bn. Of that, Meta said it expected its capital expenditures to amount to somewhere in the range of $66bn and $72bn. The company previously predicted it would spend between $64bn and $72bn which was increased from an even earlier prediction of $60bn to $65bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meta first invested $14.3bn into Scale AI in exchange for a 49% stake in the company, and brought the startup’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, on as chief AI officer. Since then, several reports indicate Meta is attracting engineers and other employees away from firms like Apple, Github and several startups with huge compensation packages – including at least onethat came in over $200m, according to Bloomberg.“To win the superintelligence race requires the best of the best talent and Meta has been on a roll when it comes to recruiting top AI talent,” said Forrester’s research director,Mike Proulx. “Money talks and Meta has plenty of it – reaching into the company’s deep pockets to lure luminaries from its competition with lavish compensation packages, while spending hundreds of billions on datacenters to power and scale its AI initiatives.”While Reality Labs continues to be a small contributor to revenue, bringing in $370m in the second quarter, Zuckerberg remains bullish on the utility and longevity of its AI glasses. He compared wearing AI glasses with wearing contact lenses in that he would be at a cognitive disadvantage without them.“I personally think that if you don’t have glasses that have AI you will be at a cognitive disadvantage,” he said. “It is kind of what we have been maxing out with Reality Labs.”Advertising revenue, the company’s primary source of revenue, continues to grow. Meta brought in $46.6bn in advertising revenue in the second quarter, up from $38.3bn for the same quarter in 2024. Meta chief financial officer, Susan Li, said on the investor call that the company does not expectWhatsApp, one of its newer sources of advertising, to be a “meaningful contributor” to overall growth of ad revenue for the next few years.“We also expect WhatsApp ads and status to earn a lower average price thanFacebookor Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part to WhatsApp’s skew toward lower monetizing markets and more limited information that can be used for targeting,” Li said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMetaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsFacebookWhatsAppInstagramnewsShareReuse this content"

João Amoêdo, one of the founders of the rightwing Partido Novo, called the sanctions “an unacceptable attempt at foreign interference in the Brazilian justice system”.Eduardo Leite, a conservative presidential hopeful who governs Rio Grande do Sul state, said he could not accept “another country trying to interfere in our institutions”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Past targets have included Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Nicaraguan officials linked to a deadly crackdown designed to keep its dictator Daniel Ortega in power, Communist party leaders involved in the repression of members of the Uyghur ethnic group in west China and military chiefs in Myanmar involved in alleged acts of ethnic cleansing.Legal experts and human rights activists voiced astonishment and consternation that such sanctions had been used to target a judge in Latin America’s largest democracy.Thiago Amparo, an international law and human rights professor from Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation, said the sanctions exposed “Trump’s distorted view of what a human rights violation is”.Amparo said Trump appeared to think that one of his ideological allies being given a fair trial for allegedly trying to stage a coup was equivalent to “torture, genocide or other grave violations … to which laws such as Magnitsky are meant to apply”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpAmericasShareReuse this content"

Work with us–if you go to war with us, you’ll loseDenis CampbellHealth policy editorWed 30 Jul 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 18.56 EDTShareThe doctors union “will lose a war with this government”,Wes Streetinghas said, adding that the NHS is ready to tough out a prolonged series of strikes by the British Medical Association (BMA).In his most outspoken comments so far about the dispute involving resident doctors in England, the health secretary vowed that Labour would never give in to theirdemand for a 29% pay rise.However, in a plea to the BMA, he urged it to agree a deal based on tackling other frustrations those doctors have, separate to their salaries, in which both sides would “win the peace”.Fresh talks are planned next week. For these to have any chance of success, Streeting said, the BMA should agree it will not call any more strikes and accept that otherNHSstaff deserve decent pay increases too, not just medics, who are already paid more than many colleagues.“It should be clear to the BMA by now that they will lose a war with this government. It’s not too late for us both to win the peace,” Streeting saidin an opinion piece for the Guardian.It comes after the end of afive-day stoppageby thousands of resident doctors that disrupted NHS services including cancer care between last Friday and Wednesday morning.“All I ask of the BMA is two things. The first is to drop this unnecessary and unreasonable rush to strike action. It mars doctors, it harms patients and it is fundamentally self-defeating because it leaves the NHS with less money to address the issues that doctors care about,” Streeting said.“The second is to recognise that this government has a responsibility to all NHS staff and, above all, to patients. We can’t fix everything for everyone everywhere all at once.”The chances of the negotiations succeeding appear slim. Rejecting a potential deal based on non-pay issues such as doctors being able to access hot food at night and having part of their exam fees covered, a BMA spokesperson said: “This is still primarily a pay dispute and we don’t accept there is no room to budge on pay. We need a credible offer on a path to pay restoration.”The BMA says resident doctors deserve such a hefty pay rise, despite havingreceived an uplift of 22%over the last two years, because the real-terms value of their salaries since 2008 has been heavily eroded. The union has pledged to strike until it achieves “full pay restoration”.Dr Ross Nieuwoudt and Dr Melissa Ryan, the co-chairs of the BMA’s resident doctors committee, insisted that Streeting must find some way of upping their 5.4% pay award for 2025-26. The end of the five-day strike must be “a moment for the health secretary to reconsider his strategy,” they said.If he does make an undefined “credible offer” on pay then they said this week’s walkout – the 12th by resident and formerly junior doctors since 2023 – could be their last.In Streeting’s article, he also:Accused the BMA of causing “damage” to the NHS through its “reckless” long walkout.Claimed it deliberately sought to ruin through strikes the NHS’s effort to cut its7.4m-strong backlog of care, which Labour has pledged to eradicate by 2029.Said the BMA’s 29% demand and strike had left other NHS staff “dismayed and appalled”.Streeting,a kidney cancer survivor, related how he had spoken last weekend to a patient with the same disease whose operation was postponed until late next month because of the strike. Patients whose care had to be rescheduled ended up with “fear and anxiety” as a result, he stressed.Wes Streeting’s divide and rule tactics may have won against the doctors – but more strikes are coming | Polly SmytheRead moreIn remarks that may be interpreted as implying the BMA’s 29% demand is greedy, Streeting pointed out that other health unions such as the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unison were unhappy with their members’ pay award – of 3.6% – but were not seeking the same huge uplift as the BMA and were not engaged in the same “rush” to industrial action.The RCN will on Thursday publish the outcome of an indicative vote it has run among nurses inEngland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is already known to have resulted in a majority coming out against the 3.6% award.Hospital bosses have made clear to the BMA that it must accept what Streeting has repeatedly insisted and that resident doctors will not force him to give a bigger pay award for this year.Rory Deighton, the acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS hospital trusts, said: “After a week of disruption to services, health leaders will be pleased that the BMA wants to resume talks. But it has to recognise the red lines set by the government, as the NHS must live within its means.“We hope that this [exchange of letters] marks the beginning of a dialogue that can resolve this issue without further walkouts which would only see patients end up suffering the most.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In recent decades its nests have been accidentallydestroyed by agricultural intensification, such as mechanised harvesting and crop-spraying, as well as breeding birds struggling in wetter summers.In its remaining strongholds, such as France and Spain, many nests in cereal fields are protected from ground-nesting predators by installing temporary small metal fences around them.The pair were first spotted in May and closely monitored by a local volunteer and the RSPB, with a drone being used under licence to locate the nest. Once the youngsters hatched, the nest was protected with fencing earlier this month.Mark Thomas, the species lead for Montagu’s harriers at the RSPB andan expert in protecting vulnerable birds of prey, said: “We are overjoyed that a pair have returned, they managed to find each other and through the close protection of a dedicated farmer and the RSPB have managed to raise four youngsters.”The farmer, who is not named to protect the location, said: “It’s fantastic to have these amazing birds on the farm and a just reward for the extensive conservation work we have been undertaking for decades.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But on 26 and 27 July there were reports from western Ireland, Orkney in Scotland and the Netherlands of these whales being stranded, raising concerns that human actions could be implicated in the animals’ deaths.“When you see these divers in the shallow North Sea, you know that it’s going to be a grim end,” said Dr Jeroen Hoekendijk, a marine scientist and photographer who attended the scene of the Netherlands stranding on 26 July. A male and a female were beached between Heemskerk and Wijk aan Zee, north of The Hague, where the sloping shores of the southern North Sea are a notorious black spot for whale strandings.“WhenSOS Dolfijn[the Dutch cetacean rescue team] arrived on the scene the two whales were thrashing wildly in the surf,” said Hoekendijk. “They were obviously animals in distress.”Although the whales were kept cool and wet with hoses, the male died soon after being found, and the second animal, a female, was euthanised to save it from further stress.On 27 Julytwo True’s beaked whales, a mother and calf, were found stranded in North Mayo, Ireland, according to Dr Simon Berrow ofIrish Whale and Dolphin Group. The female died and the calf swam off, but is “unlikely to survive”, Berrow said. On the same weekend in Papa Westray, Orkney, fournorthern bottlenose whales, also a species of beaked whale, were found dead, said Dr Andrew Brownlow of the University of Glasgow.Brownlow and his colleagues from theScottish Marine Stranding Scheme (SMASS)also attendedlast year’s mass stranding of 77 pilot whaleson Sanday, Orkney. “July is a particularly bad month for strandings,” hetold BBC Scotland.View image in fullscreenAlthough the whales in the Netherlands stranding were kept cool and wet, one died soon after being found, and the second animal was euthanised.Photograph: Jeroen HoekendijkThere may be natural reasons for these incidents – there was a suggestion that the 2024 Sanday event was caused by the pilot whales being pursued by a pod of orcas. But the human-induced climate emergency is also causing warming waters that alter feeding habits throughout the marine food chain. And with seismic surveys for oil and naval sonar exercisesalso implicated in other beaked whale strandings(these types of underwater disturbance can cause diving whales to surface too quickly, thereby suffering decompression sickness)the impact of increased military activityis also a possible reason for these strandings.Whereas other cetaceans – whales, dolphins or porpoises – can sometimes be refloated, beaked whales, possibly 100 miles (160km) or more from their natural environment, are already too stressed. “They will not survive any attempt at a return since the animals won’t be able to feed,” said Hoekendijk.One wrong move could be fatal: the divers risking their lives to save whales from ‘ghost nets’Read moreReporting on initial findings from the weekend, Brownlow said: “We found extensive liver pathology in the bottlenoses, possibly consistent with acute starvation.” He added that there may have been “anthropogenic noise disturbance”.SMASS and theUniversity of Utrecht’s strandings investigation teamwere quickly on the scenes, and were able to remove the carcasses for immediate necropsy. Their prompt action is especially important because evidence of any sonic disturbance that may have led to the whales’ stranding can onlybe detected from swift examination of hair cellsin the animal’s inner ear. Once these have started to degrade, analysis becomes impossible.Despite being large animals – up to 13 metres long – beaked whales, so called for their prominent snouts or beaks, are among the least known of all cetaceans. Diving so deep in the dark ocean, theyrely on echo-location to navigate and to find their food. They live in a world of sound, which is why anthropogenic or human-created noise pollution has such a serious effect on them. They also hold the record for the deepest and the longest dives of any animal. Cuvier’s beaked whales, bearing satellite tags,have been tracked off the coast of Californiaat up to 3,000 metres in depth.Explore more on these topicsWhalesSeascape: the state of our oceansCetaceansMarine lifeEuropeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Developing countries have warned they cannot afford Belém’s accommodation prices, which have soared amid a shortage of rooms.In an emergency meeting of the UN’s “Cop bureau” on Tuesday, Brazil agreed to address countries’ concerns about accommodation and report back at another gathering on 11 August, said Richard Muyungi, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), who called the meeting.“We were assured that we will revisit that … to get assurances on whether the accommodation will be adequate for all delegates,” Muyungi said afterwards.He said African countries wanted to avoid reducing their participation because of the cost, adding: “We are not ready to cut down the numbers. Brazil has got a lot of options in terms of having a better Cop, a good Cop. So that is why we are pushing that Brazil has to provide better answers, rather than telling us to limit our delegation.”Brazil has faced criticism for its decision to host the conference in a small city in the rainforest rather than in a bigger urban centre that already has the necessary infrastructure and hotel rooms. The country is racing to expand the 18,000 hotel beds usually available in Belém, a coastal city of 1.3 million, to accommodate roughly 45,000 people who are expected to attend Cop30.This month, the Brazilian government said it had secured two cruise ships to provide 6,000 extra beds for delegates. It also opened bookings to developing countries at more affordable nightly rates of up to $220 (£165). That is still above the daily subsistence allowance (DSA) the UN offers some poorer nations to support their participation at Cops. For Belém, that DSA is $149.A diplomat familiar with Tuesday’s meeting said complaints about affordability came from both developed and developing countries. Wealthier countries have been told to expectnightly accommodation costs of up to $600– far higher than at previous Cop meetings.The Panamanian negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómezsaid in Junethat he feared the conference “might become the most inaccessible Cop in recent memory” and that developing countries, small island states, Indigenous voices and civil society would “not be adequately represented — if represented at all”.Media organisations, activists, NGOs and charities have also raised fears that they may not be able to participate in the conference if a solution on accommodation costs is not found.In February, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, told critics that if hotels were unavailable,they should “sleep under the stars”.An agenda for Tuesday’s meeting confirmed it was convened to address “operational and logistical preparations for the climate change conference in Belém” and the AGN’s concerns on the matter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Officials organising the Cop30 have made repeated assurances that poorer countries will have access to accommodation they can afford.A spokesperson for the UNFCCC, theUnited Nationsclimate body, declined to comment on the meeting.Two UN diplomats showed Reuters quotes they had received from hotels and property managers in Belém for nightly rates of about $700 a person during Cop30.Officials from six governments, including wealthier European countries, said they had not yet secured accommodation because of high prices, and some said they were preparing to reduce their participation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government said it might need to halve its delegation compared with recent Cops, when the Netherlands sent about 90 people during the two-week event including envoys, negotiators and youth representatives.This month, Poland’s deputy climate minister, Krzysztof Bolesta, said: “We don’t have accommodation. We’ll probably have to cut down the delegation to the bone.

It is not just sewage that endangers our rivers, there is the impact of road runoff, the impact of agriculture, the impact of planning and development. It is not just about pointing your fingers at the water company, it is all the factors that endanger our rivers.”There are only about200 chalk streamsin the world. The 39-mile Test is important for Atlantic salmon, while birds such as kingfishers, marsh harriers and little grebes live on and around it.Parts of the stream, which flows from chalk downs into Southampton Water, areideal for watercress growers. The Test featured in Richard Adams’ novel Watership Down, in which some of the rabbits flee down the stream on a punt.Cooper said biodiversity in and around the stream had declined dramatically over the last few decades. When he used to drive alongside the riverbanks a quarter of a century ago, his car windscreen would be covered by insects, he said. On the way to the meeting at which the rights of the Test were ratified there were hardly any, though it is high summer. He described this as a red flag.The motion was seconded by Janet Burnage, another Lib Dem, who said: “We live in one of the most beautiful areas of the English countryside. We should and must be proud of this. Without the River Test, its tributaries and all the other rivers that flow through Test Valley, we would not have the wonderful bounty of nature around us.”Other local authorities around the world have begun to afford rivers official rights and the supporters of the Test hope the new initiative will inspire even more.The Earth Law Center, a US charity,championed the ideaof giving nature a voice in the legal system, allowing it to defend its rights just as people can.In 2017, New Zealandgranted legal personhoodto the Whanganui River in the North Island. This year Lewes district council in East Sussex produced arights of river charterto help protect the River Ouse.Ali Morse, water policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, said rights of rivers motions could help ensure council decisions, particularly around planning, are made with the health of rivers in mind.Morse said: “They can protect them from the cumulative harms of additional water extraction, wastewater discharges, urban runoff and other pressures. Home to many significant species, this focus can also help to reverse the tide for declining wildlife in freshwaters.“For the River Test and other precious chalk streams across the country, for example, we hope the threat of Atlantic salmon extinction can be avoided once the right safeguards are in place. The rights of rivers work is seeing councils like Test Valley getting ahead of the curve.”TheTest motionsays the river should have “the right to flow – unimpeded, seasonal, and natural; the right to perform essential functions within the ecosystem; the right to be free from pollution and contamination.”Explore more on these topicsRiversWaterHampshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Her body was found in a burning caravan with multiple stab wounds, a knife and scissors sticking out of her neck. She had been throttled with an electrical flex.Plummer was a prolific burglar engaged in a robbing spree at the time and had clocked up 24 convictions in the four months leading up to the killing. But none of the convictions involved violence. There was no DNA linking Plummer to the crime, no stolen items were recovered, and no witnesses placed him at the scene.The original conviction relied almost entirely on footwear mark evidence – an imprint on Cartwright-Gilbert’s head alleged to match a size 6 Nike Air Screech trainer that Plummer wore. The case also partly hinged on the prosecution’s argument that Plummer’s brother, Adam, had discussed his sibling being a suspect with their mother before he was arrested and therefore Plummer must have been guilty.The expert witness who provided the trainer evidence, David Lewin, was a dentist unqualified in footwear forensics. At the original trial, the judge said in summing up Lewin’s evidence: “It was one of the clearest marks he had ever seen. No other shoe could have caused it.” But Lewin’s method, using imaging overlays, was later ruled “neither validated nor suitable … even by late 1990s standards”.In 2021, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred Plummer’s conviction back to the court of appeal on these grounds. In 2023, Plummer, who slept on the floor in prison to protest his innocence, had his conviction overturned. The court ruled that the expert evidence was unreliable and that the verdict was unsafe.But Plummer was never released. The appeal court’s ruling was immediately challenged by the Crown Prosecution Service and Plummer was convicted again in a retrial in June 2023. This time the prosecution relied on an alleged confession made by Plummer to a now deceased cellmate, Christopher Dunne. Dunne, who had schizophrenia, was a police informant and had not been cross-examined at the original trial. Plummer’s legal team argued that the hearsay evidence was inherently flawed and unreliable.On Wednesday, in less than 10 minutes, the court of appeal quashed the 2023 conviction. The three judges ruled: “We consider that this conviction is unsafe because the Dunne hearsay evidence should have been withdrawn from the jury even if, which we have not decided, it was properly admitted in the first place. For the reasons we have explained, the Adam Plummer evidence does not support the Dunne evidence but rather gives rise to further serious concerns.”Plummer’s solicitor, Annalisa Moscardini, said: “Justin Plummer is finally vindicated for his 28-year fight against this murder conviction. Due to his refusal to accept his guilt for a crime he has always been clear he did not commit, he has served far longer than his minimum term of 16 years. Justin’s determination and resilience has finally paid dividends and he will sleep tonight a free man, for the first time in 28 years.”His barrister, Katy Thorne KC, said: “Permitting a dead cell confession witness in a trial on an allegation of this age was simply unfair. Prisoners have all sorts of motives to give false cell confession evidence and law reform is needed to stop such evidence being part of criminal trials. Now Justin is being released with little support from the state. The system has to be reformed to give proper support to such victims of miscarriage of justice.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It was billed as being part of a submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for the rights watchdog’s inquiry into antisemitism within Labour, but it was never submitted.It was anonymously leaked and included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff detailinghostility towards Corbynand his allies. The report said factional hostility contributed to an ineffective handling of antisemitism complaints,and set out claims of anti-black racism, Islamophobia, sexism and bullying.The 20 people whose cases have been settled took action over alleged defamation or the unauthorised use of personal data, or both. Six opted to be named, including Heneghan, who hadpreviously labelled the ideathat he sabotaged the 2017 election a “stab-in-the-back” conspiracy theory. A statement by the named claimants’ legal team, read to the court, said this claim was among a series of false allegations against Heneghan.Also named was Labour’s former head of governance John Stolliday, who took action over the leak of private messages and what the statement called “false and damaging” allegations that he tried to obstruct action on antisemitism in order to undermine Corbyn. A staffer in the governance unit, Fraser Welsh, took action over similar claims.Another named party was Joe Goldberg, then a Labour councillor in Haringey, north London. The statement to the court said the leaked document made “wholly untrue” claims that Goldberg was Islamophobic and had tried to smear another party member with an unfounded allegation of antisemitism.Another payout went to Ben Santhouse, who had made a confidential complaint to the party about alleged antisemitism and was then named in the leaked report as “a vexatious complainant who made disproportionate and unfounded allegations of antisemitism against individuals”, claims that the document read to the court said were defamatory.According to the claimants, as well as not being told about the fact their private messages and emails were being leaked, the dossier in some cases used the messages to create misleading narratives.In the wake of the furore over the leaked dossier, Labour under Keir Starmer’s leadership commissioned a report by the senior lawyer Martin Forde KC.Published in 2022, it concluded that destructive infighting within the party under Corbyn’s tenure meant antisemitism was often used as a “factional weapon” by his critics, and then denied by his supporters.It also said it was “highly unlikely” that staff sought to sabotage the 2017 election, and that the leaked report was itself a factional document with an agenda to advance. The Forde report did not, however, agree with claims that derogatory messages in the leaked dossier were “cherrypicked and selectively edited”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Forde report said it had been unable to determine who leaked the document.Separate to the dossier, in 2020 theparty apologised toseven former employees and a BBC journalist after admitting it had defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism. The settlement to the ex-staff and the reporter John Ware was believed to have cost Labour about £600,000. It retracted claims by the party that the whistleblowers were motivated by opposition to Corbyn and that Ware had acted misleadingly.A Labour spokesperson said: “The party welcomes the resolution of this matter.”It is understood the latest claims were settled before last year’s general election, although the details have only been set out now.

Hacked Off, the campaign group, described his appointment as being a “dangerous misjudgment and insult to the public”.Three Liverpool MPs – Ian Byrne, Kim Johnson and Paula Barker – sent a letter to Starmer on Wednesday expressing their concern about Dinsmore’s appointment.Some seniorLabourwomen were also uncomfortable with his history of having defended publishing pictures of topless women on page 3 to sell newspapers, earning him an award for “sexist of the year” in a poll run by the End Violence Against Women campaign in 2014, before he finally oversaw the abolition of the practice at the end of his tenure. As Sun editor, he was also convicted of publishing a pixellated picture of a victim of sexual abuse that still accidentally allowed her to be identified, carrying a £1,000 fine.A staunch defender of the UK’s news media, Dinsmore told the Society of Editors in 2018 that he was “sick of our industry being done down” and once described the Leveson inquiry as having left “banana republic-style levels of secrecy” in the British state.Journalists who worked with him at News UK said he was a “tough operator”. But Giles Kenningham, the founder of the PR firm Trafalgar Strategy and a former Conservative communications chief, said Dinsmore was “straightforward, charming and likable” with a difficult job ahead of him to take more ownership of the government’s own media channels and “turn around the supertanker of the machine without letting the bureaucracy take over”.Those with knowledge of the decision said he had been picked to drive through change because of unhappiness within No 10 at the unwieldiness of government communications, a desire to modernise its operation and frustration.The government communications service has thousands of staff but some in Downing Street have been frustrated by the difficulty of getting it to convey core messages, with particular annoyance at “pointless” communications that cost at lot without reaching enough people.Despite coming from a traditional print background, starting as a reporter for the Sun in 1990 and rising to editor from 2013 to 2015, Dinsmore oversaw big digital changes at News UK from the launch of Times Radio and Talk TV to more video output at the Sun, including its own TV programme, Never Mind the Ballots.Government sources said Dinsmore had impressed Starmer and No 10 with his ideas on new media and reaching audiences more directly. As well as directing overarching communications, he will oversee the “new media unit” driven by a Cabinet Office official, Ed Bearryman, who has previously worked with Dinsmore as a senior marketing chief at News UK.One senior source said Downing Street wanted government communications to be “more directional and reactive” and the news executive was “politically savvy” and “long in the tooth enough” to provide the authority they needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Covering areas such as personal finance, health and food, all the influencers have worked with Labour either in opposition or in government, with the aim of reaching people who consume most of their news via social media.“This isn’t instead of our normal communications, it’s an expansion,” one official said. “We’re alive to the way people often consume media on their own terms according to their particular interests.”While up to 90 people are expected at the Thursday afternoon event, just four names were released in advance: the personal finance influencers Abigail Foster and Gabriel Nussbaum, the latter of whom posts under the moniker of That Money Guy; Georgia Harrison, who has campaigned about online imagery and so-called revenge porn, and Chetna Makan, a chef and writer who appeared on The Great British Bake Off.In a statement about his appointment, Dinsmore said it was an “honour to be asked to lead this important mission at such a pivotal moment”.“Clear and engaging communications are central to public trust, policy delivery and national resilience,” he said. “The media landscape is evolving at a rapid pace, supercharged by AI, and I look forward to helping the government leverage the exciting opportunities in front of us.”Explore more on these topicsMediaCivil serviceLabourThe SunNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Four of the top five free apps on the Apple download store in the UK are VPN apps, with Proton, the most popular, reporting a 1,800% increase in downloads.Last week the UK’s communications regulator and enforcer of the act,Ofcom, indicated that it could start formal investigations into inadequate age checking this week. Ofcom said it would be actively checking compliance with age-checking requirements and if necessary would launch investigations into individual services.The AVPA, the trade association for age-verification companies in Britain, surveyed members who were carrying out checks for UK pornography providers. These providers were required to introduce “highly effective” age verification on 25 July.The age-checking companies were asked to submit “the volume of checks you carried out today for highly effective age assurance”.The AVPA said it could not offer a baseline comparison but effective age assurance was new to dedicated pornography sites in the UK. Previously, many porn sites in the UK only required users to tick a box to verify their age.An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Until now, kids could easily stumble across porn and other online content that’s harmful to them without even looking for it. Age checks will help prevent that. We’re now assessing compliance to make sure platforms have them in place, and companies that fall short should expect to face enforcement action.”Ofcom has said service providers should not encourage users to deploy VPNs in order to circumvent age controls.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It requires tech platforms to suppress the spread of content that is abusive or incites hatred against people with protected characteristics under the Equality Act such as age, race and sex.Free speech campaigners have said the child-harm content restrictions have led to material on X being age-gated unnecessarily, along with some forums on Reddit including one dedicated to tackling alcohol abuse.Reddit and X have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyOfcomnewsShareReuse this content"

Within the framework of the United States’ own laws, what we seek is for them to return to our country immediately and not be detained in this manner.”The 39-acre (16 hectares) camp erected about 40 miles (64km) from Miami has comeunder heavy criticismfrom non-profit organizations who say detainees are held in overcrowded pods, along with sewage backups “resulting in cages flooded with feces”, and, in some cases, have been denied medical care.Advocates demand closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’, citing appalling conditionsRead moreYet, theTrump administrationand local Florida officials have flaunted the facility’s brutality since it opened earlier this month, emphasizing its isolated location in a swamp infested with pythons, alligators and crocodiles.Sheinbaum’s comments come after the Mexican consul in Miami, Rutilio Escandón, visited theFloridadetention center this week, becoming the first overseas consul to do so.“One of the complaints is that they bathe every three days, that they’re allowed to bathe every three days,” Escandón told theTelemundo TV station, referring to the 39 Mexicans he was able to interview. “Sometimes the air conditioning is very cold – they say sometimes it’s at 60 [degrees fahrenheit]. But it’s also very hot and there’s a lot of mosquitoes.”On Sunday, Roberto Velasco Álvarez, head of the North American unit at the Mexican foreign ministry,announcedthat two young brothers who had beenheld at Alligator Alcatraz, one of whom was visiting the US on a tourist visa, had been repatriated to Mexico without charges.The opening of the Alligator Alcatraz facility comes amid anationwide crackdownby the Trump administration on migrants and asylum seekers, with agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sweeping up tens of thousands of people in raids across the country.“The treatment of our fellow citizens there, particularly with these raids, is deeply painful,” Sheinbaum said. “We will always be there to support them.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The protesters, many of whom were teenagers, held handwritten signs with political jokes and memes. They sang the national anthem and chanted “Cancel the law!”.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the government hoped to fix the situation with the new law. “We anticipate the vote tomorrow. The relevant parliamentary committee has already given its approval. We are getting this fixed,” Sybiha said.The institutions in question are the national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo. Both work independently of other law enforcement bodies specifically to target high-level corruption.Oleksandr Klymenko, the head of Sapo, told a small group of journalists in a briefing at his office in Kyiv on Wednesday that his office received a tipoff that measures were being prepared against them two weeks ago, but he had not expected the “blitzkrieg” assault that followed, with the law being rushed through parliament with little discussion.He said he hoped parliament would now pass the new law and that it would be ratified and enacted immediately.Explaining the hastily passed law last week, Zelenskyy said he feared Nabu and Sapo had been infiltrated by Russian agents, and also said he wanted to ensure closer cooperation between different law enforcement bodies. But this has been brushed off by many Ukrainians as excuses.Klymenko declined to blame Zelenskyy personally for the move against the two institutions but suggested it was “revenge” for taking on certain sensitive cases, and he defended the track record of the two bodies.“To say in 2025 that these bodies are ineffective is just absurd. It’s a narrative that is being spread to discredit us, we have information that they are looking for information to dump it in the media and just such a narrative that is now being spread in the media in order to somehow discredit us,” he said.Klymenko said Nabu and Sapo had opened investigations into 31 sitting MPs, and that the prospect of being caught meant fewer top officials risked engaging in corrupt activities. “The main thing about our work is the enormous preventive effect it has,” he said.He said last week’s law, as well as the arrest of two Nabu detectives, had left the agencies “confused and frightened” and could cause “lasting damage” even if the bill was reversed. Already, he said, government whistleblowers who were in communication with the agencies had gone dark, fearing their identities could be compromised.Several European leaders spoke with Zelenskyy last week about the law, urging him to find a way out of the crisis. “It was important for him to hear it from his peers,” said the diplomat. European officials have cautiously criticised the bill in public.“The dismantling of key safeguards protecting [anti-corruption bureau] Nabu’s independence is a serious step back,” the European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos,wroteon social media. She added that the two bodies were “essential” to keep Ukraine on the path to EU accession.A protest is planned for Kyiv on Wednesday evening, with the goal of “reminding MPs to do the right thing”, said Dmytro Koziatynskyi, a former combat medic who was the first to call people to protest last week.“This is not something I went to war for … and others on the frontline are not there so the government can do crazy stuff like this,” he said, explaining the source of the frustration that led him to demand protests.He said there was no chance of the protest turning revolutionary, with everyone in attendance acutely aware of the dangers of political destabilisation in wartime. He praised the government for being “ready for dialogue” and backtracking on the moves, and said the protests showed Ukrainian democracy was still strong even though the war had made elections impossible.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His father, the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was a bachelor when he became prime minister. He dated the actors Barbra Streisand and Kim Cattrall and married a 22-year-old woman while in office at age 51.Born and raised in California, Perry is a 13-time Grammy award nominee. She helped usher in the sound of 2000s pop, quickly becoming one of the bestselling artists of all time for her anthems.She has released seven studio albums, most notably 2010’s Teenage Dream. The album produced five No 1s that tied a record set by Michael Jackson’s 1987 album Bad.Explore more on these topicsJustin TrudeauKaty PerryCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes I play along, tooKeith StuartWed 30 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 10.02 EDTShareWe’re a week into the school summer holidays here in England, and I wonder how many parents who started out determined to keep their children completely away from screens are now beginning to feel the strain. When my sons were much younger, I often had these idyllic images in my head of day trips to the seaside, back garden treasure hunts, paddling in the river, visiting relatives … an endless series of character forming experiences which I imagined in grainy Kodachrome colours. Then I’d be faced with the reality of having a job, and also the, let’s say, limited attention span of my sons. Those boys could rocket through a host of formative activities in a few hours leaving a trail of muddy boots, half-finished crafting projects and tired grandparents in their wake. Sheepishly, we’d end up allowing some Fortnite time to catch our breath.There is so much pressure and guilt around children and gaming, especially during long school breaks, and I think we need to seriously redress our outlook as a society. I harbour many lovely memories of gaming with my sons during hot August days; drowsily loafing about building ridiculous mansions in Minecraft or laughing ourselves stupid inGoat Simulator. We would always take the Switch on holiday with us, so that in the evenings, when we went out for meals, there would be an hour or so where my wife and I could linger over a glass of wine, while the boys silently played Super Mario together. We still managed to build sand castles, go swimming and explore unfamiliar towns, but games provided a way to wind down and enjoy something familiar.View image in fullscreenKeeping it in the family … Keith Stuart and his son Zac have long played video games together.Photograph: Morag Stuart/The GuardianWhen they stayed with their grandparents during holidays, they took games along too. My mum had a Nintendo Wii, which she claimed was exclusively for entertaining her grandchildren when she got tired; it was nice to watch my sons sit and patiently explainKirby’s Epic Yarnto her. I expect it reminds her of when I was young, playing Commodore 64 games on our computer desk in the kitchen – trying to recruit my dad into sessions of footie game Kick Off or the golf sim Leaderboard while he was supposed to be cooking a chicken. It’s good for children to be able to share their expertise and enthusiasm, whether that’s about playing a guitar (which my kids did, after learning about the instrument via Rock Band and Guitar Hero) or capturing a Jigglypuff in Pokémon Go.It’s a cliche to say “all things in moderation”, but it also happens to be true. There is too much talk of screen time as some sort of all-pervading, homogeneous evil, when really we should be thinking about the quality of that screen time. When children grow up playing video games and they’re comfortable in that world, over the summer is a good time to think about what they’re playing, what they get out of it and who they’re playing with. Is it bad that they spend an hour or two every night in Fortnite? Or are they meeting friends, having a laugh and even building stuff in the Creative mode?Gamesare also wonderfully adaptable to different situations. You might not want them playing video games on the beach, but in those interstitial moments – a long journey, a rainy afternoon – they can be invaluable – and parents shouldn’t feel bad about that. For a lot of gen Z and gen alpha, games are a part of the texture of their lives now – they fit in, like reading a comic or listening to an album on a Walkman did when I was their age.Earlier this week, I took one of my sons, now 17, to London. I met a friend while he went off and explored the city by himself. On the coach on the way home to Somerset, we were a bit too knackered to chat, but instead we played Mario Kart World together. We stood the console on the little seat tray in front of me, but it kept juddering and moving as the coach drove along, usually to my advantage. It was funny; we laughed and compared tactics and occasionally looked up as the evening sun made the fields outside glow. I think I will remember that hour and a half I spent with him on the bus longer than anything else I did that day. There may have been a screen between us, but we were together.What to playView image in fullscreenLoose and reckless fun … Fumes.Photograph: Fumes TeamCar battle games were wildly popular in the mid-1990s when titles such as Twisted Metal, Carmageddon and Destruction Derby encouraged players to smash their cars into other cars, repeatedly, often while also firing rocket launchers.NewcomerFumesis looking to bring those heady days back – it’s an open-world single-player vehicle blast-’em-up where you explore a vast Mad Max landscape in an upgradeable muscle car destroying enemies.

I feel he is oversimplifying gaming. Time spent on “good gaming” can be a good thing. I think about this a lot, and I’m very interested in how you think gamingmight actually be helping young people find and cultivate a healthy pride, identity and culture for themselves?”Although there are huge problems withtoxic communitieswithin gaming, thankfully there is also a multitude of positive examples. I’ve experienced a lot of kindness and acceptance in communities focused on particular games, especially space exploration simsDeep Rock GalacticandNo Man’s Sky, and in creative games such asMinecraft, where players praise each other’s construction skills. Minecraft has also fostered strong accessibility communities – for example the wonderfulAutcraft, which runs servers for neurodivergent players, allowing players to build friendships in a way that wouldn’t otherwise have been possible. Plenty of Twitch and YouTube streamers such as Aimsey, SpringSims and xChocoBars also create communities that give fans a sense of identity and belonging. And I love that certain games foster communities in which creativity and inclusivity expand beyond the games themselves – whether it’sLeague of Legends cosplay gatheringsorLife Is Strange fan-fiction groups. Video games, like music and movies, provide channels though which fandoms are able to express themselves and explore their identities. For many young people, I genuinely think the modern world would be almost impossible to navigate without these spaces.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterMinecraftSuper MariofeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new film is if anything more visceral, with waking-nightmare images captured in pin-sharp 4K digital clarity. It is a moment-by-moment account of his experience embedded with Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade in 2023 (one of them appears to be a Brit) during Zelenskyy’s highly anticipated counteroffensive, making a gruelling journey along what amounts to a two-kilometre corridor of “forest”.In fact, it is scrubland offering no real cover – but it is free of Russian mines, unlike the areas of farmland either side. The forces brutally fight every metre of the way, heading for the symbolic liberation of the largely ruined village of Andriivka in north-easternUkraine. They are carrying a precious Ukrainian flag, and it is their mission to fix this to any broken bit of wall they can find, to proclaim their national spirit is not dead. They are in a wasteland, as one says: “It’s like landing on a planet where everyone is trying to kill you. But it’s the middle of Europe.”Chernov is armed only with a camera, to the astonishment of many soldiers he encounters, and the film was constructed by editing his footage together with that of solders’ helmet cameras and drone material. Chernov shows us how drones are now utterly ubiquitous in war, delivering both the pictures and the assaults. That is the ultra-modern, even postmodern aspect of this film, but it coexists with an eerie resemblance to the eastern front of the first world war. Chernov, in one of his murmuringly subdued voiceovers, comments: “The smell of death, explosives and freshly cut trees.”‘The soldiers want you to see what they’re going through’: the heartbreaking follow-up to 20 Days in MariupolRead moreThe wrecked landscape does indeed look like 1916, and Chernov does not scruple to show us real dead bodies (but spares us the ultimate horror of the corpses’ faces). When the intertitles flash up the grim advances – 1,000 meters to go, 300 metres to go – it is like the cricket-style scoreboard for the Battle of the Somme in Richard Attenborough’s film ofOh! What a Lovely War: “Ground gained: nil.”The most heart-wrenching moments come when Chernov interviews soldiers in a quiet moment, their twentysomething faces alive with intelligence – and in a sombre voiceover tells us how they were killed four or five months later. It is a (repeated) flourish that might be considered on the verge of bad taste, but Chernov manages it with such unflinching conviction. Since the events of this film, Russia has counter-counterattacked and retaken Andriivka; though now we hear Trump has soured on Putin. A Ukrainian soldier surveys the wreck of Andriivka and says: “Everything will grow back.”2000 Meters to Andriivka is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a vibrant, funny, complicated allegory of a down-at-heel launderette in a dreary London parade of shops, which gets laundered and cleaned up by south Asians who are subjected to nothing but racist abuse. It was formerly called Churchill’s Laundrette and now cheekily renamed Powders, in homage to washing powder or to income from a different powder which this place is going to launder.It is a sharp, smart picture, with English eccentricity, sly quirk and political subversion, that represents a brilliant and almost unique engagement with contemporary history in 80s British cinema: a satire of Mrs Thatcher’s Britain which involved playing Toryism at its own game. This was the world in which the Conservative government brought inthe Enterprise Allowance Scheme to bring down the unemployment-claimant figures, but found that immigration stimulated enterprise. Kureishi’s writing was part of the new energy of postcolonial literature; it came from the same place as Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children and Timothy Mo’s Sour Sweet.There are terrific performances from those titans of British-Indian acting: Roshan Seth and Saeed Jaffrey as brothers Nasser and Hussein Ali; Nasser is a melancholy intellectual socialist with a drinking problem; Hussein is a rackety businessman, poignantly in love with his white lover Rachel (Shirley Anne Field). Hussein hires Nasser’s apparently gormless son Omar (Gordon Warnecke) to run his crumbling launderette – and Omar figures out that with a little imagination and by siphoning off drug profits belonging to his cousin Salim (Derrick Branche) he can turn this into the most beautiful and lucrative launderette in London. But Omar has a secret: he is gay and in love with Johnny, played byDaniel Day-Lewisin his first lead film role, a white punk tearaway who once marched in the streets with the racists but now feels something for Omar and remembers Nasser’s kindness to him as a child.My Beautiful Laundrette is a vivid time capsule for the gloomy London streets of that time; it’s also an essay in gentrification, like Mike Leigh’s High Hopes and John Mackenzie’s The Long Good Friday – and it’s a reminder of a time when videotapes and VCRs were almost unimaginably exciting consumer goods. Day-Lewis at this stage had not quite evolved into the mature screen actor that he was soon to be, and tough-guy fisticuffs were not exactly his forte, but he always sold it with conviction; this was a homophobic era when gay love, presented clearly and unapologetically, was a rarity. Warnecke’s line readings feel perhaps a little bit theatrical sometimes, but he has enormous charm and presence. Rita Wolf is excellent as Tania, the exasperated cousin to whom Omar is expected to marry but who wants and demands more.“How could anyone call this silly little island home?” asks one of Omar’s relatives. But they do, and that complex, love-hate relationship is the film’s fabric.My Beautiful Laundrette is in UK cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsStephen FrearsHanif KureishiDaniel Day-LewisSaeed JaffreyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a novel with no clever structural devices or burden of symbolism and a setting so limited geographically that the reader ends up knowing precisely where everything is.It is narrated by Bo, a former timbermill worker who has reached the age when people worry about him, and has a network of carers calling in three times a day. One of Ridzén’s inspirations was the team journal kept by the carers looking after her dying grandfather; very movingly, bulletins from the journal of Bo’s carers punctuate his narrative, the alternative perspective like a chill breeze through a briefly opened door.Bo lives in the Swedish far north, surrounded by the sort of woods, lakes and meadows that are a paradise for dogs but a constant worry for the adult children of old men who persist in living somewhere so remote. His adored wife, Frederika, no longer knows who he is and has been taken away to a dementia care home, imposing on Bo a kind of living bereavement. His one close friend, Ture, a man local gossips have down as a “confirmed bachelor”, has also reached the stage of being cared for around the clock, but the two old men enjoy regular catch-ups on their geriatric-friendly mobiles. His other great love is a dog, Sixten, an elkhound who needs far more exercise than Bo can now possibly give him, but is a constant presence at his side or on his bed. Bo also has a fiftysomething son called Hans, a divorced conservative and worrier, and a student granddaughter, Ellinor.The plot, such as it is, involves Bo becoming ever frailer and Hans threatening to have Sixten rehomed, now that walking a dog in rugged terrain has become too perilous for a man prone to falling over. However, almost from the first page, Bo’s first-person, present-tense narrative is enriched by repeated dreamlike digressions. These take us out of the grim present realities of adult nappies, phlegm cups and frozen ready meals into stories of a country boyhood overshadowed by a cruel and brutal father, the happy marriage into which young Bo escaped, the adorable little boy Hans was before he somehow turned into an overweight, fretful bully, and Bo’s long friendship and regular fishing trips with the ambiguous Ture.Bo faces the challenge of overcoming his masculine conditioning so as not to die with love unexpressedBo is haunted by a peculiarly male anger – the scarring, remembered rages of his father and his own bursts of rage at his increasing lack of independence that somehow stops him telling Hans what he really feels. As Bo’s end draws near, he faces the twin challenges of keeping his beloved Sixten at his side and overcoming his masculine conditioning so as not to die with love unexpressed.Another element, hinted at in the title, is the steady parade of seasonal changes all about his little house, as the year moves from the glories of May, through the pale nights of midsummer, to golden autumn and the arrival of bitter cold. The sense of place is conjured deftly – Ridzén is describing the landscape on her doorstep near Östersund – but just as evocative are the many mentions of Swedish food, from the tinned fishballs and microwaved stew served by the carers, which are evidently inferior to thefiskbullarand lingonberry-enhanced roasts once made by Frederika, to the superior almond tarts, ormazariner,served by Ture, all of which had me googling recipes to try at home.At a couple of slightly awkward points, translator Alice Menzies has the characters talk a northern English, presumably as an equivalent for northern Swedish dialect, but there was really no need. Anyone anywhere who has worried for a crumbling parent, or worried about the crumble in themselves, or simply worried that their dog understood them better than their family, will identify with Ridzén’s novel and take it to heart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Titles such as Thief and Dishonored drop players into clockwork worlds where there are emails or letters to be read, vents to wriggle through, and desperate situations to overcome with smarts and social engineering as much as sheer violence.You could argue that all that’s been missing from the genre until now is a colossal policeman whose lanky body rises hundreds of feet into the sky, and who can look down at you and see absolutely everything you’re doing. Luckily, the new game from the Russian developer Tallboys is here to fix that. In Militsioner, you have been arrested for some manner of nebulous crime and must now leave town as quickly as you can. Bribe the ticketmaster at the railway? Break a window to create a distraction? All classic immersive sim solutions. Sadly, there’s that policeman to deal with first, a melancholic but watchful giant who towers over the ravaged urban surroundings even when sat down with his hands resting on his knees.View image in fullscreen‘A new dimension to storytelling’ … Militsioner.Photograph: TallBoys GamesThis giant defines Militsioner. He’s both a mechanic to toy with, depending on whether you want to flatter him or distract him, and a stark piece of visual brilliance that means you’ll never mistake this particular game for anything other than a paranoid immersive adventure. Even so, Tallboy’s director and game designer Dmitry Shevchenko explains that the project had been in development for a good six months before the policeman even turned up.“I remember watching an interview about the development of Thief: The Dark Project,” Shevchenko says. “We were really struck by the idea of giving the player a clear role, almost like a profession. That resonated with us. Around the same time, we were also thinking about giants as a theme.”These ideas converged when Shevchenko remembered a painting by the Russian digital artist Andrey Surnov, depicting a giant traffic policeman sitting in a field. “It just clicked,” Shevchenko laughs. “That image perfectly captured both the player’s role and their antagonist: criminal and policeman.”View image in fullscreenCruel dystopia … MilitsionerPhotograph: TallBoys GamesThe rest of Militsioner fell into place quite quickly after that. The game explores a cruel, totalitarian world that pits the individual against an overwhelming system. Yet it also plucks at more personal, even intimate threads. Is it illegal to bribe a giant policeman by offering them an apple? Is it illegal to try to date them?To pull this stuff off, Militsioner employs a kind of Tamagotchi system to monitor the specific internal worlds of all the non-player characters, that giant policeman among them. “We play with the classic immersive sim design pillar, where encounters can be approached through talking, sneaking or shooting,” Shevchenko says, and suggests that the moods add what he refers to as an additional layer, inspired by The Sims. “It’s the emotional states of characters,” he says. “Their moods become a core part of the systemic gameplay.”Sneaking into another character’s house and getting caught might send them into a panic, for example, which will change their dialogue options and, by extension, how you can interact with them. “This creates a deeply interconnected system where every action feeds into a web of reactions,” Shevchenko says. “It adds a new dimension to problem-solving and storytelling.”All of this is being expanded on by a process of rigorous player testing, where the team at Tallboys not only asks players what they did in a game but what they wanted to do but could not. This is where the idea of trying to date the policeman came from. “Players wanted to explore that side of the relationship,” Shevchenko says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe product of a Russian development team that has spoken out about the invasion of Ukraine, Militsioner is deeply political. It’s also quietly literary. Alongside that other towering and melancholic figure Kafka, Shevchenko says the team has been influenced by the works of the Strugatsky brothers, who are most famous for the sci-fi dystopia Roadside Picnic. “I keep trying to capture the feeling [of their books],” Shevchenko says. “I love how they approach abstract settings and describe characters, particularly in The Snail on the Slope, with its surreal depiction of the directorate and the system around it.”Dig deeper and there’s also the hint of another giant of Russian literature, Nikolai Gogol, whose stories pick at hierarchy and the manifold perversities of power in a playful, strikingly game-like way. His antiheroes, including a man whose nose leaves his face and goes on to greater social status than him and another who wants to cheat his way to riches buying up the ownership of dead serfs, would probably be quite at home living in a town where a giant policeman sat in the town square, sadly taking everything in.Militsioner is being developed for PC, release date is TBCExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It feels befitting of Mackenzie’s rather madcap interwar story featuring a Bloomsbury-style group of lesbians on the fictional island of Sirene.Under the nifty direction of Paul Foster, we follow their romantic shenanigans, sparked by the seductive central figure of Rosalba (Amy Ellen Richardson, magnetic), a Swiss Italian aristocrat – and inveterate womaniser.There is the British writer, Aurora (Caroline Sheen), who is Rosalba’s longsuffering lover, alongside experimental French singer Cleo (Sophie Louise Dann, very funny), who is in a relationship with Russian Olga (Monique Young), but might secretly be seeing Rosalba.View image in fullscreenMore than a touch of Marlene Dietrich … Amy Ellen Richardson.Photograph: Steve GregsonShe, in turn, sends romantic signals to anyone within reach, including wealthy American composer Olimpia (Amira Matthews) and young Lulu (Jasmine Kerr), who has been banished to this island after falling for a man beneath her station.More love interests keep developing, it seems, and you slightly lose track, but that is the point: this group is so bohemian that it just likes to bed-hop.Overseeing the love-struck and lovelorn are ancient Greek goddess-like figures, including Sappho, who offer slightly laboured commentary on the mortal intrigues.But on the whole it is silly, entertaining and excellently performed. There is live music and songs which range from romantic whimsy to satirising the avant garde, while the art deco costumes by Carla Joy Evans bear a detailed fidelity to the era.An adaptation of Orlando was staged in this venue recently and this feels in keeping with that bohemian vibe. But it is a less serious work, tongue firmly in its cheek, with actors playing two parts and quick costume changes conjuring sense of chaotic mischief.What really makes it is the cast; Richardson has more than a touch of Marlene Dietrich in her swagger and rakishness. Dann is brilliantly OTT as Cleo while Jack Butterworth single-handedly plays all the male parts, from a Scottish waiter wounded in the Great War to a foppish friend and an errant fiance.None of it quite has a point, its radicalism no doubt more potent in 1928 when the book was published. Still, it is certainly worth a revival in this comic vein for the sheer fun of it.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 10 August.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreJermyn Street TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Even over the phone from upstate New York, the venerated graffiti artist is a force to be reckoned with, talking at a breakneck tempo punctuated by bursts of raucous laughter. There’s a sense that this energy might quickly combust too – she admits she “totally lost it” while preparing for her current solo show, Miss Subway NYC, at D’StassiArtin London.The exhibition sees her vividly recreate a New York City subway station. There are paintings in eye-popping colours depicting trains, train yards and playful portraits of the characters you typically see there: a busker in a cat costume, an elderly lady with a shopping cart and a chihuahua. With the help of her husband, fellow graffiti artist Smith, she has even meticulously reproduced layers of tags on the walls from her halcyon days, when she would risk arrest – and sometimes her life – to spray across the city at night. On the show’s opening night, more than 1,000 people showed up to pay their respects to the grande dame of graf.I invited Keith Haring to paint a train. Dude was not down – he didn’t want to break the lawLady Pink was born Sandra Fabara in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1964. Her story begins on her grandparents’ sugarcane plantation in the Amazon rainforest – a vast, wild terrain that, like the snake who met its fate at her feet, didn’t intimidate her. Her mother had returned after leaving Pink’s father, an agricultural engineer who was a “womaniser, gambler, cheater … ”. As soon as she had enough money, when Pink was seven, they left Ecuador for New York City. “When we came here, we had no papers, we didn’t speak the language.”View image in fullscreen‘I cried for a whole month’ … David and Sandra, First Love.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkPink was a self-assured, determined and talented kid who quickly learned how to channel her pain and grief into creativity. She first got into graffiti at 15, after her boyfriend was arrested for tagging and sent to live with relatives in Puerto Rico. “I cried for a whole month, then I started tagging his name everywhere.” A painting in her London show of the artist as a teen kissing a handsome boy pays tribute to this defining moment in her personal history.When she started high school in Queens, she met “kids who knew how to get into yards and tunnels. The more they said, ‘You can’t, you’re a girl,’ the more I had to prove them wrong. I was stubborn as a mule. I was crazy.” As one of the only women accepted by the notoriously macho graffiti scene in New York in the late 1970s, she quickly gained a reputation for tagging subway trains. “We are like a guild, a clannish, tribal group who go out at night and watch each other’s backs.”She later earned her official moniker “Pink” from a fellow member of TC5 crew, Seen. “I was the only female in the city painting, and I needed a female name so everyone would know our crew tolerated a female,” she explains. “I knew I was the token female and that got my foot in the door – but to keep up with the big bad boys, I had to back it up with real talent too. There was sexism of course, but I’m a little bit of a badass. I don’t appreciate being walked over and I stand up strongly for myself. Even if I’m petite, I’m loud. Don’t judge me by my size, judge me by how big and fast I paint!”She added the “Lady” title – at first inspired by the European nobility in the historical romance novels she was reading. “But I don’t write Lady – I’m terrible at the letter Y.” Later she used the Lady title to avoid confusion with the pop singer of the same name – who approached the artist to design her first album cover. “I said, ‘Hell no!’ Are you kidding me? But she’s a fan, I’m not going to say anything bad about her, she’s fine, she sings fine.”View image in fullscreenSubway Village Pink Train, 2022, acrylic on canvas.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkAs a young woman out at night in New York’s most insalubrious neighbourhoods in 1979, Pink was especially vulnerable. “I would dress like a boy and pretend to be a boy. The teens I ran with weren’t much bigger than me and I knew they weren’t there to protect me if shit went down. You’re in the worst neighbourhoods of New York City relying on the kindness of strangers to save your life – you’ve got to be prepared. What happens in the dark alleys of cities, you don’t want to know. You shake a spray can and hope they let you live.”“Bombing” subway trains is one of the most perilous activities of graffiti – “loads of kids have died doing it, getting run over by the trains or electrocuted. It still happens. It’s live electricity: if you touch the rail you will die.” How did she survive? “You don’t stumble in like you’re drunk, it’s like a military manoeuvre. You know the train schedules, where to walk, where to hide. You have all of that figured out ahead of time. You need to be sure where you’re going when you’re running like panicked rats in the dark maze.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She recalls she once sliced her finger open and “it was bleeding badly, it was a terrible cut and I probably should have had it stitched, but I just stuck it in my pocket and it quietly bled in there. I didn’t want people to say: ‘Oh you’re a girl you’re hurt and crying, you’re going to slow us down,’ – you’ve got to be a good soldier.”Another time, there was a near miss with an unforeseen moving train. “I had gone to pee and I thought I could just walk it,” she laughs. “Then there was a train coming and it was doing a weird curve, slanting into the wall. At the last minute I ducked, but if I had stayed standing the train would’ve taken my head off. After that, I just ran at top speed. I can’t believe I survived it.”The 1980s were a whirlwind. She rose to fame in 1983 after featuring in Wild Style, the cult film that launched American hip-hop culture globally. Her spray-painted canvases, horror vacui compositions with bold, attention-grabbing colours of scenes inspired by the street, began to be accepted in conventional, legal art spaces, and in 1984 she was included in MoMA PS1’s The New Portrait alongside Alice Neel, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. “No one was aware it was going to launch anything, we were just in it for the moment and the money. People told us the art market was fickle and eventually we’d have to get jobs.”View image in fullscreen‘It was wild out there’ … Miss Subway NYC 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkOnce she invited Haring to come to paint a train with her. “Just me and him, no machismo – but dude was not down, he didn’t want to cross the line of breaking laws. What he did was chalk on boards. He was a white dude; he wasn’t incurring any kind of arrests. They weren’t graffiti artists, but they were the original street artists. Graffiti artists work with spray, with fonts – and we hit stuff with wheels.”Pink also received an invitation fromJenny Holzer, who was wheatpasting her Truisms posters in Manhattan. “We were like the only women going out at night doing things. She was a tall lady, like two metres, she would wear a hoodie and a big coat so she could pass off as a man going around at night alone. I am very small and I couldn’t pass off like that, so I had to run with a crew. She reached out to me and suggested we collaborate.”Holzer had done up an entire building in the Lower East Side. “It was wild out there at that time, there were a lot of people doing drugs, there was a lot of crime. But she made this beautiful, safe building, and I loved going there and working with her.” Holzer would prep three-metre-square canvases for Lady Pink to spray paint her images on, and Holzer paired them with text. The works were later shown at MoMA and Tate Modern. In 1983, 19-year-old Pink was photographed by Lisa Kahane wearing a vest emblazoned with Holzer’s famous words: “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” – in 2017 the photo went viral as an emblem of the #MeToo movement.View image in fullscreenPlayful portraits … The Strap Hanger, 2025, from Pink’s London exhibition.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkThough artwork sales and interest did wane in the late 1980s, Pink pivoted. She set up a mural company with her husband, doing public commissions and working in communities. While many of her peers “couldn’t handle the business, they couldn’t leave the ghetto behind, they couldn’t show up on time or answer a phone call”, she says she was able to “adapt to polite society. Artists don’t know how to hustle, and you’ve gotta hustle, hustle, hustle. Some don’t have thecojones. But good grief, you’ve got to go knocking on doors!”She stopped illegally painting subway trains decades ago – “now I save my crazy for the galleries” – but the spirit of the subway lives on in the London show. And she says she’s still paying the price for her years of youthful rebellion. Twelve years ago, she and her husband moved upstate after “one too many” police raids on their home in NYC. “They took my stuff – including my husband – and messed with us. We had to spend money on an expensive attorney. They’ve told me to stick to the indoor stuff and not paint big old murals because they inspire people. I said yeah – community people, poets, artists, I should hope I inspire people!”One thing is for sure: she doesn’t have any regrets. “Street art is the biggest art movement, we are in every corner of the world. By whatever means possible, we are taking over this world, it’s our whole plan! I think it’s cool, man – you’ve got to take control of your environment. You don’t need an MA to be an artist, you just need a little paint plus a little courage. Just do it!”Lady Pink: Miss Subway NYC is at D’Stassi Art, London, until late September.Explore more on these topicsArt and designStreet artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Titled simply Casa Susanna, it reveals a treasure trove of photographs made by a community of self-identified “cross-dressers” in the 1960s, as they found ways to make precious time to dress as their feminine selves in two resorts offering safe spaces in the Catskill mountains.According to show curator Mia Fineman, these photos had sat dormant for decades until two antique dealers happened to discover them at a flea market in 2004. “What struck them was that they were men dressed in women’s clothing but not in drag,” said Fineman. “They were not wearing flamboyant clothing, it was a very conservative, midcentury style.”The photos were acquired by theArtGallery of Ontario, a book of the photographs was released, and subsequently trans scholars began to situate Casa Susanna into queer history. The original flea market collection of photos was also augmented by collections from artist Cindy Sherman and Betsy Wollheim, a daughter of one of the members of the original Casa Susanna community, and AGO launched a formal exhibition of the photos in the winter of 2024.Matthew Barney: ‘I’m not interested in participating in consensus culture’Read moreNow the Met shares its own version of this show, featuring some 160 photos as well as material from Transvestia, a zine made by the Casa Susanna community that published six issues per year. It is a tender and necessary look at trans identity from over half a century ago.View image in fullscreen‘Heartbreakingly, these photos show a stage of arrested development, a time when so many closeted trans women were unable to stop living a dual life as straight men.’Photograph: AGOCasa Susanna was the brainchild of two women: trans woman Susanna Valenti and her wife Marie Tornell. According to Fineman, the two came together over a meet-cute for the ages: one day a nervous Valenti – dressed as a man – came into Tornell’s Manhattan wig shop, supposedly to purchase a wig for her sister, but the astute shopowner was having none of it. “Marie clocked Susanna, said I know it’s for you, it’s ok, let me find something that will make you look beautiful. After that the two of them quickly fell in love.”The couple subsequently decided to create a dedicated place where others like Valenti could have the space to be their true selves. “The two of them as a couple were so extraordinary and unique for their time,” said Fineman. “I really wish I could have met them, they seem like such incredible people.”In the 60s, very few people who wished to author the story of their own gender were able to have Valenti’s freedom. McCarthyism was rampant, and most of the Casa Susanna community supported families as married men – if others found out that they liked to dress as women, they stood to lose everything.“Most of these people were married, were professionals, doctors, lawyers, mechanics,” said Fineman. “They were mostly white middle class men with wives and families. They had a lot to lose if their cross-dressing were to be exposed. They lived in isolation and shame.” Casa Susanna participants went so far as to learn to process and print color film on their own, in order to avoid having their photos seen by consumer labs.In spite of that intense pressure – or maybe because of it – those depicted in the Casa Susanna photos radiate intense levity and happiness. “There’s a real sense of joy, a feeling of being so comfortable in their skin,” said Fineman. “When they were in women’s clothing and in the safe space that these resorts provided them they had a sense of freedom there that they couldn’t have in their everyday lives.”These photos are striking for how closely they resemble photographs shared decades later by early stage trans women in Internet-based communities. There is a similar aspirational desire to embody an ideal of middle-class, white femininity, and a sense of playful, stolen moments, an all-too brief respite of freedom, self-expression, and community, against a smothering life of forced conformity to a gender that they know is wrong.Heartbreakingly, these photos show a stage of arrested development, a time when so many closeted trans women were unable to stop living a dual life as straight men. Behind all the smiles and casual poses one can sense individuals who yearn to be free but do not feel capable of pushing past the barriers imposed by society.View image in fullscreen‘Behind all the smiles and casual poses one can sense individuals who yearn to be free but do not feel capable of pushing past the barriers imposed by society.’Photograph: AGO“Seeing photos of themselves dressed en femme was profoundly important for these people,” said Fineman. “They talked about this in the magazine and in other places. It was seeing an image of themselves as a woman that reflected back their desired identity to them.”Importantly, Casa Susanna puts the lie to the frequent myth that there is something new about trans women, as well as the falsehood recently perpetrated by supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett that the US has no significant history of discrimination against trans people. “At the time there were masquerade laws, so these people could be arrested for cross-dressing in public,” said Fineman. “They had to be very careful, even going outside of their homes. There are accounts in the magazine of them being arrested, which involved horrible humiliation and mistreatment at the hands of the police. They could even be sent to mental institutions for what was essentially conversion therapy.”Many in the Casa Susanna community had supportive wives who would often join them in the Catskills, sometimes even penning columns in Transvestia from their perspective. In 1965, one wife named Avis wrote a heartfelt column on her struggles to understand her spouse’s identity, giving some sense of the depth of commitment of those who participated there.“Wives would come with them to these retreats and help them create their look,” said Fineman. “One picture that I really love that shows a couple wearing matching dresses that they obviously had had made. That was something really surprising.”Some members of the Casa Susanna community, such as Virginia Prince, founder and editor of Transvestia, eventually transitioned to a woman – she lived openly as herself from 1968 until her death in 2009. Some of these women still survive to this day, and several will be present at the Met for a panel in September. The museum will also host a screening of the 2022 PBS documentary Casa Susanna, directed by Sébastien Lifshitz.Fineman sees this exhibition as a gesture of inclusion to the trans community, as well as a way of making good the history that has been lost. Museums have a particular role to play, particularly now when so many other sectors of society are actively erasing trans lives. “I hope this offers trans people a larger sense of affirmation and understanding,” she said. “We have a role to make these pictures and history visible.”Casa Susanna is on display at the Met in New York until 25 January 2026Explore more on these topicsPhotographyTransgenderExhibitionsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the height of the musician’s fame, Mehdi’s cousin Myriam Essadi recalls in a new documentary, he had to jet straight from a nightclub in Ibiza to his grandfather’s funeral in Tunisia. “He was wearing red glasses, white jeans and a jacket with a cross. In Tunisia! For our grandfather’s funeral!” Essadi laughs. “We didn’t get it. And in Tunisia you don’t mess with religion.”DJ Mehdi: Made inFrance, a six-part documentary now available with English subtitles on Franco-German broadcaster Arte, revisits the life and tragic death of one of the most fascinating, influential and misunderstood French musicians of his generation.View image in fullscreenArtwork for DJ Mehdi: Made in FranceIllustration: Arte TVInternational audiences largely know Mehdi, who died in 2011 at the age of 34, for his work with Parisian label Ed Banger in the 2000s, spearheading a new wave of French dance music alongside artists such as Justice – they of the cross logo on Mehdi’s jacket – and SebastiAn. In France, however, his legacy is more complicated, opening up questions about the rift between hip-hop and dance music, as well as underlying divisions in French society.Born to a French-Tunisian family in the north-west suburbs of Paris in 1977, Mehdi Favéris-Essadi rose to prominence for his production work with rap group Ideal J and hip-hop collective Mafia K-1 Fry. His first big hits came with 113, a rap trio whose 1999 album Les Princes de la Ville is considered one of the most important albums of the decade in France.When Les Princes was released, dance music had already entered Mehdi’s life via Cassius duo Philippe Zdar and Boombass, whom he worked with on MC Solaar’s 1997 album Paradisiaque. Several of the leading producers of French house music had roots in hip-hop, including Pépé Bradock and Cassius themselves. But none were as well known within the rap world as Mehdi, and his pivot was not always warmly received. “You couldn’t switch from rap to electro or vice versa. In the other world, you weren’t legitimate,” Essadi explains in the documentary.View image in fullscreenDJ Mehdi, at The Zoo Club, Manchester, September, 2007.Photograph: PYMCA/Avalon/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn the US, hip-hop and dance music were initially closely linked, sharing roots in soul and funk music as well as production methods, a connection Mehdi appreciated when he heard Daft Punk’s 1997 album Homework. “I thought: ‘That’s funny, we use the same machines, the same samplers, they live just around the corner, they’re about my age, that could have been me,’” Mehdi says in an archival clip.By the late 90s hip-hop had risen to such prominence in the US that its leading artists tended to view dance music as a forgotten fad, if they thought about it at all. In the UK the opposite was true, with strength of British dance music eclipsing domestic hip-hop.In France, homegrown rap was extremely strong in the late 1990s. In the media, however, it was often vilified, while dance music was viewed as the next big thing, thanks to the rise of acts like Daft Punk, Étienne de Crécy and Cassius. The tension between two types of music and their various associations – Parisian elite v working class, city v suburbs – was palpable.“In 1997, if 47 guys and girls from [Paris suburb] Bobigny wanted to get into the Queen club [a Paris club known for house music] they couldn’t,” Boombass says in the documentary.“To them we were just guys who smoked weed, only good for a bank robbery or to deal drugs to them,” Essadi adds. “‘You’re from the suburbs.’ That meant many different things to people from central Paris who went to the Palace club or to Bains Douche to listen to dance music.”View image in fullscreenDJ Mehdi performs Electric Zoo festival on Randall’s Island, New York, September, 2010.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicWhen Mehdi tried to bridge this gap – for example, with the Kraftwerk-sampling beat for 113’s Ouais Gros – the response was often negative. “When people heard it they thought: ‘Who are these guys hardcore rapping to music like this? I don’t get it,’” 113’s AP says in the documentary.“I remember people stopping me in the streets, people from the rap world saying: ‘What’s Mehdi doing? Talk to him! What’s this new music, this crazy music,’” Essadi recounts.Mehdi would go on to have huge success in electronic music off the back of the release of Signatune in 2007. “Signatune was soon being played by the most well-known DJs all across the globe and promoters all wanted to book DJ Mehdi for their events,” former Daft Punk manager Pedro Winter explains in Made in France.The final part of the documentary shows footage of Mehdi’s international success, DJing at huge clubs and festivals alongside the Ed Banger crew to adoring, hedonistic crowds. It comes in sharp contrast to scenes of poverty and crime, burnt cars and drab suburban tower blocks, that mark the documentary’s first two episodes, examining Mehdi’s roots in hip-hop and the unfashionable outskirts of Paris.Mehdi died on 13 September 2011 at the height of his international fame, when the skylight on the roof of his Paris home collapsed as he was celebrating the birthday of British producer Riton. “Four of them were sat on this … glass, sort of, roof,” Riton says in the documentary. “They just got to stand up, that’s when it like … made the roof collapse through. Then the next thing, we were just looking through this hole at this horrific scene.”Tributes to Mehdi came in from the elite of the global dance music world, including US dubstep artist Skrillex and Ed Simons from the Chemical Brothers. And yet, for people in France in particular, this was only half the story.“Internationally [Mehdi’s] probably best known as one of the frontrunners of the Ed Banger crew that defined an entire era,” Canadian DJ A-trak says at the end of the documentary. “But, of course, he has a huge legacy as the king of French hip-hop production and even just someone who brought together these unlikely pairings of scenes.”“He helped us evolve our music over time,” 113’s Mokobé adds. “It’s thanks to him that there are no limits, no bars, no borders for us … This is what his music was all about; no bars, no barriers, no border.”DJ Mehdi: Made in Franceis available to watch on Arte from 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicHip-hopDance musicFranceEuropeMusic documentaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He embraced the skills of his bass predecessors Domenico Dragonetti, Giovanni Bottesini and Serge Koussevitzky, then raised the bar to a new level through his sheer joy in playing and communication of his love for the instrument, combined with an unrivalled technical skill.Hugo Colein the Guardian, recalling Karr’s visit to the UK in 1978, likened him to an ostrich suddenly becoming a nightingale and remarked that his “breathtaking solo bass playing is surely one of the wonders of 20th-century musical performance”.One of the elements of Karr’s playing that set him apart was the way he used the bow. “I’ve always considered myself a lyrical artist. My first desire was to be a singer, so I have always been determined to sing on the bass.” He drew his individual, intense sound with long slow bows, playing close to the bridge, and projecting differently from the traditional back-of-the-string-section sound familiar from his youth. He applied many of the techniques of the upper strings to the bass.Karr was strongly influenced by the mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel, who mentored him in the vocal skills of breathing and phrasing. In 1962 she enabled a private audition with Leonard Bernstein, who engaged Karrto perform Bloch’s Prayerand Paganini’s Moses Fantasy variations as part of the Young People’s Concert series with the New York Philharmonic.“I don’t know when I’ve heard anything like it since the great Koussevitzky,” said Bernstein in his introduction to the concert. Bernstein had asked Karr whether the Paganini had an orchestral part. It didn’t, so Karr arranged one, and it was this performance, televised to millions, that launched his career. As a soloist, he was to play with leading orchestras worldwide, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic and the Hong Kong Philharmonic.His first recording, entitled simply Gary Karr plays Double Bass, was issued later in 1962 by Golden Crest Records. That was the year in which Herman Reinshagen died, a teacher who greatly influenced Karr: “He exuded such enthusiasm, and although he might have held me back a bit by forcing the old traditions on me, in retrospect I only appreciate the positive things.”View image in fullscreenGary Karr playing in 1965.Photograph: Erich Auerbach/Getty ImagesThe same year, after the groundbreaking concert, Olga Koussevitzky, convinced the spirit of her husband lived on in Karr, gave him Serge’s 1611 Amati bass (now thought by experts to be French, about 1811, but still a significant instrument through its history). Later Karr donated it to theInternational Society of Bassists, an organisation he founded to create and nurture a network of bass players.Karr’s family came originally from Vilnius, in Lithuania, where generations had played the bass. Once in the US, they moved to Los Angeles to work in Hollywood movies. His father, Joe (who changed his surname from Kornbleit), a shoemaker, could not read music but played the bass in dance bands; his mother, Miriam Nadel, was an oboist. The 1939 film They Shall Have Music, with Jascha Heifetz playing himself, features an orchestra that included all but one of the Nadel-Karr family. Karr’s sister Arla Capps was a harpist, playing the instrument with a dark projected Russian sound that Karr said influenced his pizzicato.Karr started the bass with Uda Demenstein, who had taught his grandfather, uncles and cousin. As a child he began to adapt pieces such as Ravel’s Habanera and the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria, and arrange baroque repertoire (later studying, playing and recording his teacher Stuart Sankey’s many baroque transcriptions). Many of the celebrated players of the day (Heifetz,André Previn, Artur Rubinstein,Isaac Stern) were soloists with the California Junior Symphony, in which Karr played, and left lasting impressions, technically and musically.He took lessons from the Hungarian cellist Gábor Rejtő, and was inspired to use the technique of four fingers in his left hand, rather than the three promoted by the bass pedagogue Franz Simandl, and also benefited from tuition from the cellistZara Nelsova.An audition for the Curtis Institute, Philadelphia, run by the violinist Efrem Zimbalist (who had arrived from Vilnius at the same time as Karr’s grandfather) was successful – but only if Karr changed from an underhand German bowing technique to French overhand. Karr refused – though later in life he experimented more freely with his bowing technique.For his application to the Juilliard in New York, he was required to fulfil the same entrance requirements as brass players; the bass was not included in the string department and his bass teacher there, Sankey, was a member of the brass department.Gary Karr at a festival for the double bass on the Isle of Man, BBC, 1978Later he taught at Juilliard and Yale, and other top music departments and summer schools, but devoted much of his enthusiasm to teaching in schools, mixing psychology, parenting and humour. He kept his performance schedule alive in the summers. “I knew of no other concert artist who had interrupted his career to teach in public schools,” he recalled. “But I loved the controversy and hoped to make an impact, to change the music education system and reverse the worldwide trend of aging classical music audiences.”He met his long-term pianist and life partner, Harmon Lewis, in 1961. Together they created an engaging stage presence, Karr supplementing his almost magical technical facility with enthusiasm and a jokey manner.His discography shows his wide range of technical accomplishments in arrangements, and acknowledgement of his mentors such as Koussevitzky and Dragonetti. Carr was a master arranger and instigator of new repertoire in his commissions –Hans Werner HenzeandLalo Schifrinwere among many who wrote for him.He wanted to engage a younger audience in the bass.

At 19, I finally realised I had a terminal diseaseBorn with cystic fibrosis, Yvonne Hughes was lucky to survive her teens. She definitely didn’t expect to make it into her 50s. The comedian talks about the years she spent struggling to breathe – and the ‘miracle’ drug that turned her life aroundPaula CocozzaWed 30 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareYvonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapelin Glasgow. For three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown. That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to kill me.”Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t notice I wasn’t there.”It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to resist it. When she was growing up,cystic fibrosiswas considered “a childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally.Now 52, and enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later, Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her one-hour show,Absolutely Riddled, which she is performing at the Edinburgh fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when so many didn’t?View image in fullscreen‘My mum said: “We thought you were going to die, every day”’ … Hughes, far right, with her hospital friends on a day trip in 1984.Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The GuardianFor most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness; she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”.At school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person, but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something. I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.”Roughly one in every 2,500 people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself.Only as she grew older did Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me: ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became their new normal to keep me alive.”If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes around why those people died”.View image in fullscreen‘I thought there was no point telling people because everyone was dealing with something. I was nothing special.’Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The GuardianShe found solace in theCystic Fibrosis Trustmagazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s,scientists discoveredthat the camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal consequences.Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implementeda policy of segregation, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs thatmight lead to cross-infection.She has stayed in touch by phone with one old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought: ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.”Her 20s and 30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of philosophical things got me through.”Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now – “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout – at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going, pay my bills and mortgage.”Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital, there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers, things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness. Didn’t she feel aggrieved?“It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?”View image in fullscreen‘I just got on with it.’Photograph: Yvonne Hughes/PAWhile Hughes survived childhood by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”.“I couldn’t have a career because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist. “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.”In 2018, aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as public affairs officer at the CF Trust.Eating was difficult. Her weight hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point, there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed anend-of-life form, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung function was down to 26%.Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic.The Kaftrio turned Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects – insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long, she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.”Energised, she decided to enrol in an evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the University of Strathclyde’sCentre for Lifelong Learning, it was the flyer for comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs. Something clicked and I enrolled.”She performed a five-minute set for the course finale – and immediately wanted to do it again. “I started applying for clubs,Monkey Barrelandthe Stand Comedy Club[both in Edinburgh]. I got Red Raw [the Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there. I want to change my life,” she says, “and I am doing comedy to see if Icanchange my life.”View image in fullscreen‘Comedy was the one thing that was for me’ … Hughes performing at Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh.Photograph: Yvonne Hughes/PANearly four years ago, Hughes met her partner, Alan, online. Having spent a lifetime feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one – and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses. Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan, and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had to take a –haa!– sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across her, after fastening it.“Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll probably live to get my pension.”Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter” back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that was for me. And it still is. Just for me.”Yvonne Hughes: Absolutely Riddled is at Snugat Gilded Balloon Patter House, Edinburgh, until 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHow we surviveCystic fibrosisHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pretty much everything that is lovely about summer is incompatible with wearing heels. Being outside in the garden or the park, where the grass is soft underfoot! Delightful, but hopeless if you have to balance on tiptoes to stop your heels from sinking into the ground. Walking instead of getting the bus, because it’s so nice out! A seasonal treat, but only in comfy shoes. Summer weddings that start at 3pm and go on until the small hours! The absolute best, but murder with blisters. The beach! OK, we weren’t ever sufficiently insane to wear heels on sand or pebbles. Still, you get my drift.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I haven’t sworn off heels for good, by the way. I think there was a time when lockdown broke my habit, but in the end I missed them. So when autumn comes around, I will relish pulling on my heeled boots for the first time. Come party season, I will hold fast to my belief that a really good night out starts with a shoe that gives a rush of visual pleasure and makes no concessions to being remotely sensible. But for the next couple of months, I have a strict flats-only policy.Snazzy embellishments that might look gaudy on a high heel look brilliant on a flat, because a flat needs to show ambitionWhat’s that? What about wedges, you ask? For some people, these represent the perfect compromise: they are steady on uneven ground, and comfortable to wear because your weight is fairly evenly distributed. But, look, can I be honest? They are just not very elegant. They make your feet enormous, which knocks your whole silhouette off balance, like wearing a comedy hat. They are also a bit of a weird shape, because that’s what happens when you try to fit a square peg in a round hole.View image in fullscreenPrince sandal, £160,A.EmeryNo. There is a flat shoe for every summer occasion, and there is an art to matching the shoe to the look. Not all flats are created equal: some elevate, and some don’t. Because we are so accustomed to seeing heels as the glamorous option and flats as the practical alternative, we tend to lump all flats in together, and fail to notice that there is a world of difference between styles and shapes – both in the vibe they bring to an outfit and how they affect your silhouette.Bare and strappy looks casual, while enclosed is more formal – think of the contrast between a Birkenstock and a loafer. A minimal flat sandal can be fabulous for a summer party, but it needs to be elegant – good-quality leather with a nice pedicure reads very differently from plastic flip-flops and gnarly toes. If the toe is enclosed, the shape matters: a round toe is cute and girlish; an almond toe is more sophisticated. A flat shoe that has a sturdier construction and covers the top of your foot will read as masculine (a brogue, a loafer), while one that is flimsier and more cutaway gives femininity (a ballet pump).View image in fullscreenDelia ballet flats, £70,VagabondI like to think of myself as open-minded, but we all have our red lines, and one of mine is an ankle strap on a flat shoe. This cuts across your leg at the wrong place (visually, I mean; otherwise you’ve got it done up too tight, which is another matter entirely). This is not about your legs looking fat or short or whatever – we’re not having that conversation any more, remember – it is just about what looks pleasing to the eye. If there is a Mary Jane-style strap across the top of your foot, then this will look best if it’s closer to the toe than to the heel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that the choice is between dressing up nice – in heels – and “just” wearing flats. When, in fact, the only sensible way to do summer is no heel, but all glamour. This is the season to be flat-out fabulous.Model: Amaka at Milk.

Usually made from plastic-coated paper, the billions used each year burn through copious amounts of energy and water, while also contributingsignificantly to landfill.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The solution is simple: switch to a reusable coffee cup. These take various forms, such as cups, bottles and mugs, but are more eco-friendly options once used multiple times. There are leakproof travel mugs that can sit in a rucksack pocket; small ones ideally suited to car cup holders; and ones made from recycled post-consumer materials.Two different terms are used for this type of product: travel mugs and reusable coffee cups. Travel mugs are usually better suited for transporting coffee from place to place, whereas reusable coffee cups are often just something to sip from wherever you get a coffee. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and you should always check the product specifications to ensure you’re getting the right mug for your purposes. Some coffee chains now incentivise the use of these cups through discounts and reward schemes, too.It may seem obvious, but one of the best things about these travel mugs is that you can fill them at home before going out, so thecoffee machinecollecting dust on your counter might finally get some more use, too. To help you find your sip-friendly sidekick, I tested 10 cups from brands including KeepCup, Yeti, Ocean Bottle, Circular&Co and Chilly’s.A note of caution from a guy with a singed tongue: some of the cups and bottles featured are excellent at keeping your coffee or tea hot. That’s mostly beneficial, but you should check whether your drink has cooled before taking a hearty sip, which may require leaving the lid off for a few minutes.At a glanceBesttravel mug overall:KeepCup Commuter£31.95 at AmazonBestbudget travel mug:Yeti the RamblerFrom £20 at John LewisBest leakprooftravel mug:Stanley The AeroLight transit mug£33 at John LewisBesttravel mug for taste:Ocean Bottle stainless steel tumbler£27 at Ocean BottleBest sustainable travel mug:Circular&Co Reusable Cup£22 at Circular&CoWhy you should trust meAs a regular reviewer for the Filter, I’m well versed in testing products. You may have spotted my guide tothe best suitcases, which culminated in me throwing the unfortunate baggage off a stepladder, or my feature onsunrise alarm clocks, where I played the role of sleep-testing guinea pig. I’ve been writing about consumer products for the past decade, and I still take joy in getting to grips with interesting, useful things.I’m also into my coffee, and I care about how the material and form of a vessel affect a drink. I always carry a reusable cup on days out or while working on the go, so my thoughts on these products are rooted in the daily grind.How I testedA man in white overalls jumps on a mini trampoline. He’s holding a white reusable coffee cup and coffee is spraying from the top of itJumping beans: each cup was filled with coffee and subjected to a session on the mini trampoline to test how leakproof they really are. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianI used each model several times while travelling and working. I filled them with coffee at home for my first caffeine hit of the day, before having them refilled at various coffee shops, where I asked baristas for their feedback. Throughout testing, I considered how securely the cups held liquid, how pleasant they were to handle and drink from, and how well they maintained the temperature of hot and cold drinks.On the first point, for more rigorous assessment, I held the cups upside down and shook them over kitchen paper to see how much they dripped; I also bounced on a trampette with them (first with the lid closed, then with it open) to test the degree to which they were leakproof. Finally, I filled them with boiling water and measured the temperature over eight hours to gauge the effectiveness of the insulation.Not all reusable cups are intended to provide the same qualities (eg leak-proofing or insulation), and I kept this in mind while writing the reviews. During the process, I drank dozens of hot drinks, preventing the use of a stack of disposable cups and ensuring a pleasantly caffeinated state throughout.Mugs that were not requested back by the manufacturer were donated for fundraising tothe Leeds branch of Cat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats – two of whom are living in acatioon my drive.My favourite travel mugs and reusable coffee cupsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianBesttravel mug overall:KeepCup CommuterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£31.95 at AmazonWidely credited as the originator of the reusable coffee cup, KeepCup remains the best in the business. This Commuter model is advertised as “barista standard”, and it certainly proved a cut above during my tests.Why we love itI was impressed by its temperature regulation. It kept hot drinks hot for several hours, and cold water refreshingly cool while out and about. Removing the broad lid will quickly bring down the temperature of the cup’s contents, though, so your coffee will be sippable before you know it.The flip lid is a well-known KeepCup feature, providing a secure closure that couldn’t be simpler to suss out. Do take care to screw it on properly, though.“This mug will fit under the group head on an espresso machine, so saves us from using another vessel to prepare the coffee before pouring it into the reusable cup,” said Scarlet, barista at Holding Patterns listening bar in Leeds.Hand-washing is recommended to preserve the mug’s finish. Thankfully, reaching inside with a soapy sponge didn’t prove a chore. The Commuter is sold as “spill proof” rather than leakproof, but it performed well during my bounce and drip test.It’s a shame that …this mug may be too wide for some cup holders and backpack pockets.Capacity:340mlMaterial:silicone, electropolished steel, polypropyleneDimensions:8.6 x 12.7cmTemperature after one hour:74.4CTemperature after eight hours:34.1CWeight:218gDishwasher safe?Hand-washing recommended to preserve finishWarranty/guarantee:12 monthsThe best espresso machines to unleash your inner barista at home, testedRead moreBestbudgettravel mug:Yeti the RamblerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianFrom £20 at John Lewis£25 at TisoIsn’t this a fine little thing? I found the Rambler ideal for small drinks such as espressos, short blacks and cordials on the go – and while it’s not marketed as an insulated model, it proved effective at keeping drinks suitably hot or cold.Why we love itPerhaps the best trait of this cup is its portability. It’s small and narrows towards the base, which makes it handy for rucksack pockets or car cup holders. Thanks to the ridge about halfway up, it’s convenient to carry by hand, too.I was impressed with the Rambler’s chunky Magslider closure, which makes it easy to open or seal the aperture on the splashproof (note: notleakproof) lid. In my bounce test, it didn’t leak whatsoever when the lid was closed, but it did spray out coffee with the lid open. Just remember to close it before running to catch a bus. This mug’s vibrant colourways are just my cup of tea, too – especially the Rescue Red.“It’s a convenient size, but it would’ve been helpful to have a mark inside the cup to show the right fill level,” said Saeed Hussain, owner of Cravings By Sid in Calverley. “You might be best off handing it to the barista with the lid, so they can see how high to fill it.”It’s a shame that …rinsing suds out from under the lid is slightly tricky, as some of the dish water gets under the slider.Capacity:236mlMaterial:stainless steel and plasticDimensions:7.2 x 10.5cmTemperature after one hour:74.1CTemperature after eight hours:34.9CWeight:200gDishwasher safe?YesWarranty/guarantee:five yearsBest leakprooftravel mug:Stanley AeroLight transit mugView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£33 at Stanley£33 at John LewisThe aptly named AeroLight feels dainty. The lid seal is secure, barely allowing any steam through, even when opened for drinking. In normal use and temperature testing, it proved effective at keeping things hot. On opening, this bottle sometimes greeted me with a tiny spray of coffee, but that’s a small price to pay for its tight closure.Why we love itThis was the model I trusted most to stay sealed inside my bag – and, as expected, it didn’t leak. I bounced on the trampette with it, shook it upside down, threw it over my head – and not a drop was spilled. Note that Stanley advises that users fill the AeroLight no higher than 7mm from the threads of the lid.The narrow, fairly tall profile of the AeroLight is ideal for backpack side pockets and slimline cup holders, although it also means its capacity may be lower than you expect. The barista who served me at an excellent King’s Cross coffee kiosk was utterly bemused when I asked her what she thought of the bottle. I’ll take this as a sign that it’s easy to fill up.The AeroLight is dishwasher safe and comes with a lifetime guarantee.It’s a shame that …the insulation of this bottle may be too great, if anything. I had to leave the lid off for quite some time to bring coffee down to a drinkable temperature.Capacity:350mlMaterial:stainless steel and plasticDimensions:6.9 x 16.3cmTemperature after one hour:83.8CTemperature after eight hours:49.3CWeight:180gDishwasher safe?YesWarranty/guarantee:lifetimeBesttravel mug for taste:Ocean Bottle tumblerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£27 at Ocean Bottle£34.50 at TescoMade from 90% recycled stainless steel (as well as BPA-free plastic and silicone), this cup provided a brilliantly pure coffee-drinking experience.Why we love itPaper takeaway cups can often lend an unwanted flavour to a drink as their material begins to break down, but there’s no such issue here. Plus, its lip feels pleasantly thin and not at all sharp.Taking apart the tumbler for cleaning is simple enough, although the rubbery lid seal needed a little persuasion. Fully disassembled, the mug is easy to clean, with hardly any awkward areas that could harbour grime. While the tumbler isn’t intended as an insulating flask, it kept coffee hot for more than two-and-a-half hours. It also performed well during my trampette test, with just a little splashing when I opened the lid slider.According to the barista at a local coffee chain, it was perfectly easy to refill.It’s a shame that …as tends to be the case with tumblers, this model isn’t fully leakproof, nor is it designed to be held upside down.Capacity:350mlMaterial:recycled stainless steel, BPA-free plastic, siliconeDimensions:8.2 × 13.7cmTemperature after one hour:76.4CTemperature after eight hours:35.8CWeight:230gDishwasher safe?Yes (eco-wash)Warranty/guarantee:10 yearsBest sustainabletravel mug:Circular&Co reusable coffee cupView image in fullscreen£22 at Circular&CoThis remarkable reusable cup from Circular&Co is a true example of circular production, with an outer layer made from a polymer-recycled coffee blend. The material has a distinctive look and feel: smooth, shiny, Americano-brown and similar, but uncannily a little different, to plastic.Why we love itFrom a design perspective, the clever thing about this cup is its lid. It has two indents for your fingers, and you press these down to unlock and open the 360-degree aperture so that drink can flow through. It works brilliantly and, although I thought the lid might be fiddly to clean, it’s easy enough to do if you lever off the top part using a cutlery handle. I’d recommend reading the instruction booklet to avoid mishaps, however.The cup was pleasant to drink from, kept its contents very hot and had no adverse effects on the flavour. Seb Wilkey, head barista at Holding Patterns in Leeds, was enthusiastic about the cup.“It’s a little too tall to fit under the group head on our coffee machine, but we can work around that and it was easy to use in general,” he told me. “More people should be using reusable coffee cups. When I lived in Sydney, everyone had one.”It’s a shame that …although it didn’t leak during normal use (or bounce testing), a few drops spilled out when I held this cup upside down and shook it.Capacity:340mlMaterial:recycled coffee waste and plasticDimensions:8.4 x 16.6cmTemperature after one hour:61.8CTemperature after eight hours:26.9CWeight:200gDishwasher safe?YesWarranty/guarantee:two yearsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It has plenty of space for everyone’s tea, coffee or water on a group trip, and it serves equally well as a daylong sipping solution for the chronically hydrated.The rim of the bottle is pretty deep, and I found I had to drink from it carefully to avoid a drenching. Personally, I’m OK with that, but dainty sippers might prefer to decant their drink into a cup.This bottle’s lid felt very secure and I was confident enough to carry it, filled, in my bag. But given how good the Big Mouth looks, vibrant and pleasantly textured, proud owners might prefer to tote it by the handle instead.

If you’re looking for a large, leakproof option to fill at home and drink from throughout the day, this would be a fine choice.Drinking through the lid is very simple – you pop down the seal and then sip through the opening, which allows just the right flow for my taste. I often find Ninja’s products intuitive and well designed, and that’s certainly true of this bottle.I wouldn’t recommend drinking without the lid while on transport (especially with a driver who tends to slam on the brakes) as the metal is thin.Baristas Ivy and Theo at FlamingosCoffeeHouse in Leeds were happy to use the Sip Perfect, but they had some reservations. “It’s too tall for our machine, so I had to pour the coffee into a mug first,” said Ivy.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not quite a match for our top picks in terms of portability.

It’s wide enough to reach inside effortlessly with a sponge, and the lid has a simple design that should minimise grime buildup.Whereas most reusable cups probably won’t get used much at home, this one’s so pleasant to drink from with or without the lid that you might reach for it when in need of a homely cuppa.Pete Wise holds a red Klean Kanteen coffee cup over a small black iron table with a piece of kitchen paper on it to check if any drips come from the cup.

You won’t always get a discount, but savings of about 10% are not uncommon.Several of the big chains offer incentives to use a reusable cup, including:Starbucks: 25p discountPret a Manger: 50p discountCaffè Nero: double loyalty card stamps (so the fifth coffee is free)Costa: double loyalty card stamps (so the fifth coffee is free)Black Sheep Coffee: 45p offGreggs: 25p offSupermarkets are also getting in on the trend.Waitrose now provides free hot drinks to its members only when they bring a reusable cup; Marks & Spencer cafes offer a 50p discount.Are travel mugs actually eco-friendly?A travel mug comes with environmental costs. Manufacturing and selling one requires energy and materials, and it will be cleaned with soap and water by the eventual owner.Thankfully, the environmental toll of a reusable cup tends to be lower than that of habitually drinking from single-use cups, which are typically made from paper modified with plastic. A study by Ciraig (a sustainability research organisation based in Canada) found that a reusable cup becomes less harmful than using single-use cups after 20 to 100 drinks, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions generated. This varies depending on the material of the reusable cup.You would hope to use your cup or bottle at least that many times – and perhaps even for a lifetime. Some models are built to last with decades-long guarantees.Reusable cups are sometimes made largely from recycled materials, which reduces their embodied carbon (the sum of emissions created by making the cup and getting it into the customer’s hands). The maker’s business model might also seek to offset or outweigh environmental costs. For example, Ocean Bottle funds the collection of plastic waste through the sale of each product.In short, reusable coffee cups are the most eco-friendly solution we’ve come up with for carrying hot drinks on the go. To minimise the environmental downsides, use yours for as long as you can, apply minimal (eco-friendly) washing-up liquid and hot water during routine washes, and choose a sustainability-focused brand.Pete Wise is ajournalist with more than a decade’s experience covering everything from global development and social causes to technology and music.

Are we getting value for money?Sammy GecsoylerWed 30 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 12.42 EDTShareIhave a problem. It has spanned many years, cost me hundreds of pounds and earned the derision – and concern – of friends and family. Don’t worry: it isn’t anything sordid but it does give me an absurd number of ways to cook chicken or use up a bag of potatoes.My poison is Ninja appliances. Anyone who walks into my tiny kitchen is taken aback by my extensive collection. My prized trio are the Foodi, the Foodi Max Health Grill and Air Fryer and the Creami, which collectively give me the ability to air-fry, grill, sear, roast, pressure-cook, slow-cook, steam or even dehydrate my dinner, and transform a frozen mishmash of protein powder, yoghurt and sweeteners into an ice-cream-like dessert.It doesn’t stop there. I also own a Ninja blender, food processor and hand blender. While less flashy, they have survived my unwise attempts to mince a fully intact topside of beef and turn avocado stones into “detox dust” for an ill-fated “glow-up” smoothie.I am far from the only person who has been taken in by Ninja fever. Global sales of its products reached almost $2.9bn in 2024, a 38% jump from nearly $2.1bn the year before. With more than 50 Ninja kitchen products available in Britain, the UK is now the second largest market for their maker, the US-based appliance company SharkNinja. It is a remarkable feat considering that a decade ago the brand was nearly unknown in the UK.It was the air fryer that changed that, particularly the two-drawer food crisper, which hit the shops in 2020. Launching at £179.99 in the UK ($179.99 in the US), it was swiftly stocked in high-street big hitters including Argos and John Lewis. It soon took the UK, and the world, by storm.View image in fullscreenDavid Beckham is a brand ambassador.Photograph: YouTube/Ninja KitchenIn 2023, John Lewisnamedthe Ninja air fryer as one of its “products of the decade”.On Amazon, Ninja’s products dominate the air-fryer bestsellers charts, holding four of the top five spots in the UK and theUS.Ninja’s next mega-success was the Creami, which promises to turn a tub filled with ingredients of your choosing into a creamy, cold dessert. It launched in 2021 in the US at $179.99 and soon became a viral hit on social media. By 2022, Ninjaclaimedit was America’s “No 1 ice-cream maker”, based on sales data from market research firm NPD Group. On TikTok, the hashtag “#ninjacreami” has 244m views as people have flocked to the platform to show off their recipes. Strained yoghurt and fruits are common options, but others have opted for more off-piste creations, including abaked bean “ice-cream”.The Ninja Slushi (£349.99 in the UK, $349.99 in the US), which allows you to make slushies and cocktails at home, is the brand’s latest success, selling out 15 times on its release in the US. On the back of that hit, SharkNinja was this yearnamedas one of Time Magazine’s top 100 companies, joining the likes of Netflix and Amazon.View image in fullscreenAn Instagram post from Kris Jenner with her Creami.Photograph: Instagram/krisjennerThe brand has also done a remarkable job of getting A-listers to plug its products.Kris Jenner’s Instagram featured a sponsored post of her singing the device’s praises. David Beckham is a global brand ambassador for Ninja and in oneadvertshowed off some of his own culinary quirks – which included using his Ninja Double Stack air fryer (£229.99) to cook carrots whole, including the green tops, and using the Woodfire outdoor oven (£349.99), which triples up as an oven, pizza oven and BBQ smoker, inside his kitchen. Viewers of the filmF1: The Movie, starring Brad Pitt, will see SharkNinja’s product placement throughout – from its logo stamped on race cars to Ninja gadgets on show in swanky kitchens.In aninterviewwith Ad Week in March, SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas said the company spends much of its $700m advertising budget on social media. Influencers play such a strong role in promoting the Creami, he said: “We virtually don’t invest any more advertising on [it].” The company has also worked hard to get its products in the hands of so-called “microinfluencers” who have “great, authentic followings with smaller niche groups”. It is, simply, word of mouth for the social media age.But this kind of business relies on innovation. SharkNinja pours money into research and development, with a budget that rose to $341.3m in 2024, up 37% from 2023. It has a team of more than 1,100 engineers and designers in the UK, US and China, is typically working on 60 products at any one time and launches about 25 new products a year.Some of these are better value than others, according to Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which? “Ninja continues to be a popular brand with customers, and when it comes to air fryers, blenders and multicookers, our testing has found that this is mostly well deserved,” she says. “However, prices can reach more than £300 so it certainly isn’t the cheapest. And if you’re looking for an ice-cream maker or mini-oven, we’ve found that there are other brands that perform better and cost less, so it’s worth looking elsewhere.”We’ve found that there are other brands that perform better and cost lessLike me, Rhianne Crozier has a kitchen full of Ninja appliances. Her love of the brand started six years ago. After she moved into her new home with her husband, her parents gave her a Ninja air fryer as housewarming gift.Now she owns more than 10 Ninja gadgets. They include the Creami, Slushi, the Luxe Café coffee machine (£549.99) – a high-end brewer that allows you to make espressos, cold brews and cafe staples such as lattes and cappuccinos – and the Ninja Speedi multicooker (£229.99), a combined steamer and air fryer designed for one-pot meals. In total, she has spent about £2,000 on Ninja products.The 28-year-old content creator, who shows off her dishes on TikTok under the nameHome With Rhianne, has two children. “I’ve cooked meals in about 15 minutes. It’s great when you’ve got hungry kids,” she says. “Before I would stay in the kitchen for hours.”She hasn’t touched her pans or oven in months. “It’s more convenient to just put it in, close it, take it out. They’re easy to clean afterwards too,” she says.The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and tested, from Ninja to NutribulletRead moreBut does the success of Ninja tell us something more uncomfortable about how we live today? Pen Vogler, author of Scoff: A History ofFoodand Class in Britain, says “these very speedy innovations” are part of a consumer culture where “there has to be something new constantly”.My personal journey into Ninja-obsession did start with need. When I moved into my small flat, it was unfurnished. After buying something to sleep on (my bed) and something to watch (my TV), money was too tight to deck out my kitchen with pots, pans and baking trays. Instead, I opted for a Ninja Foodi, which set me back just over £100. It allowed me to sear, pressure-cook and air-fry my food without having to buy loads of extra equipment, and it was much quicker than using the oven. I’m not the only person who struggles for space – one study by the University of Reading found that the living space of the average private renter in Britainshrankfrom 31 sq metres in 1996 to 25 sq metres in 2017; and families arerenting increasingly smaller homesas the cost of living soars.Vogler says that in the Victorian era, living space was also very tight, and cooking gadgets were also enormously popular. She points to Charles Dickens, who in his 1841 novel The Old Curiosity Shopdescribed a silver “temple” with four chambers. In one, an egg was placed and in another, some coffee was poured. Raw steak and water were put in and, after the machine worked its magic, “breakfast was ready”. It is, says Vogler, “like a kind of Victorian air fryer”. A lack of living space means people will “try to use what technology they have available to answer the problems of how to cook. What Ninja is doing now is just a continuation of something that has been happening for centuries. Technology comes along and it finds a solution to our domestic problems.”What started for me as a solution to a space problem soon became something else. I became obsessed with the Ninja brand, eagerly following its social media to see what device it could bring out to tempt me with next. Recently, however, the shine has worn off. While the Slushi has been a sensation, it lacks many things that have previously sold me on the brand. Yes, it allows you to make slushie drinks and cocktails, but there are major setbacks. It takes at least half an hour to produce a drink, lacks that “I can see myself using this every day” factor and, most importantly, doesn’t seem to have many health advantages, as sugar must be used for most drinks to work in the machine.View image in fullscreenSammy Gecsoyler … ‘I am far from the only person who has caught the fever.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“Health is becoming a really important part of our cooking technology,” says Vogler. And Ninja’s success has certainly played on our worries about ultra-processed foods. “There’s a large element of anxiety around industrial food that is sending people back to try to make it for themselves,” says Vogler, which “air fryers and kitchen gadgets will do well from. If people are moving back to cooking, they will always want a fast and easy way to do it.”Ninja has adapted to 2020s living, but how have the gadgets changed us? Before the air fryer, there was the microwave. Both have been accused of tarnishing the culinary arts, but Vogler says some of our most beloved dishes were born out of new kitchen technology.For her, the air fryer has an unlikely relative. “Cast iron ovens first came in about 300 years ago. It was a massive new technology and is also when our era of home-baking took off,” she says. It ushered in some of our favourite dishes, including eccles cakes and baked tarts.Judy Joo, TV chef and owner of the London-based Korean restaurant Seoul Bird, says kitchen gadgets can be “great”, but they have limits. “Sometimes you just want to cook something the way it was intended,” she says.The best air fryers, tried and tested for crisp and crunchRead moreThat includes being able to watch what’s going on. With Ninja appliances, particularly the air fryers and multi-cookers, you end up shoving something in a draw or sealing a lid. For Joo, visibility is key. “You should be able to see food cooking and changing versus something that you say goodbye to and open up the door once it’s ready,” she says. “You lose control of the cooking process.”And, she says, air fryers will never fully replicate something deep-fried, like chicken. “It’s a compromise,” she says. “You don’t get things as crispy. It’s crispy-ish, but it’s definitely not the same. You could tell the difference 100%.”For her, nothing quite beats the kitchen classics, particularly the satisfaction of “getting out a regular pot or pan, drizzling oil, hearing the sizzle and cracking an egg”. The humble frying pan is much more versatile than it’s given credit for, considering you can “glaze, simmer and saute” in it, she says. “You can’t deglaze in an air fryer.”Explore more on these topicsFoodGadgetsChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Crisp up the leftover potato skins in a pan with sea salt to enjoy as a snack, or freeze them for making loaded potato skins (recipe coming next week).Baked potato gnocchi with broad beans, pecorino and mintA great way to make extra-flavourful fluffy pillows of gnocchi is to make them with leftover baked potato. Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them reduces their moisture content, meaning less flour is required, which in turn results in a lighter, less pasty gnocchi. Leftover baked potato also saves about an hour of prep time.This recipe serves two, using just one leftover baked potato, which I’ve turned into a one-pot wonder with seasonal broad beans, feta and mint. I wouldn’t recommend baking a single potato just for this, not least because the recipe is designed to make use of leftovers. If you’d like to make it from scratch, plan a baked potato meal earlier in the week and make one extra. Otherwise, steaming is a good, efficient alternative.If you want to get ahead, gnocchi freeze well. Lay them flat on a tray to freeze, then transfer to a sealed bag or container and store for up to three months. Cook straight from frozen, and give them a few extra minutes to rise to the surface.As a wholefood chef, I use wholemeal spelt flour, which adds flavour and nutrition, and also helps reduce waste by retaining the bran and wheat germ. To save money and potential waste, instead of using an egg yolk to bind the mix, I add a pinch of baking powder to lighten the dough.Serves2For the baked potato gnocchi1 medium-large cooked baked potato, flesh scooped out to yield 200-250g50-60gwholemeal flour(I used spelt), plus extra for dusting½ tsp baking powderSalt and black pepperFor the broad bean, feta and mint toppingJuice of½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if organic and unwaxed2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 large sprigs mint150g broad beans(from roughly 450g pods), or frozen broad beans100g feta, crumbledPut the potato flesh in a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, then mix and knead into a ball; if it’s a little sticky, add a little more flour. Split into 16 similar-sized pieces, then, using your hands, roll each one into the shape of a rugby ball and arrange in a single layer on a floured tray. Cook the gnocchi either by frying them in a little oil until golden brown all over, or by dropping them into boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, or until they float to the surface. Lift out, drain and serve with your favourite topping.At this time of year, I like to serve gnocchi with broad beans, feta and mint. In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice (and, if it’s organic and unwaxed, the grated zest, too) with the oil. Pick the leaves off the mint sprigs, then finely chop the stalks, add these to the dressing bowl and season generously.Blanch the broad beans in boiling salted water for five minutes, then lift out and drain. Meanwhile, cook the gnocchi either by frying them in a little oil until golden brown all over or by dropping them into boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, until they float to the surface, then lift out and drain. Stir in the blanched beans and dressing, garnish with the crumbled feta and the reserved mint leaves, and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wastePotatoesSummer food and drinkVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its more traditional form is broody and stewy, designed to burble away on a winter stove a bit like ratatouille, but with more fresh herbs. In summer, while the barbecue’s on and veg dishes of this kind are va-va-voom, it makes sense to just chuck them on the barbie instead and perhaps team with a spicy shortcutadjikapaste using a jar of roast peppers. And, second, a very adaptable carpaccio for any firm fruit in your fridge or fruit bowl: melons, stone fruit – heck, even pineapple! The key is to use a sharp knife and slice against the grain for the best mouthfeel, much as you might sashimi.Barbecued adjapsandal with adjika yoghurt dressing (pictured top)Piquillo peppers work best here, if you can find them, but you can use the ones from the deli counter, too, though maybe add a splash more red-wine vinegar to balance the acidity, tasting as you go. If it’s not barbecue weather, you could also cook this indoors on a griddle – just make sure to get it smoking hot and open a window.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4-61 large or 2 mediumaubergine(about 500g), cut into 1cm-thick discs2 largecourgettes(about 400g), cut into 1cm-thick discs1 large red onion(about 250g), peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rings4 largetomatoes(about 400g), quartered vertically60mlextra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushingFor the adjika4 garlic cloves40gsun-dried tomatoes, drained250g drained piquillo peppers¼tsp mild chilli flakes15g coriander sprigs, leaves picked and reserved to garnish15gparsley, stems and leaves15gholybasil, or Thai or young regular basil leaves, plus extra to garnish30mlneutral oil– I use sunflower or grapeseed1tsp ground fenugreek1tsp ground coriander1tsp salt flakes½tsp sugar¼tsp ground black pepperTo finish230gnatural yoghurtHeat a barbecue or grill plate until smoking. Pop the sliced aubergine and courgette on a baking tray and put the onion and tomato on another. Brush the aubergine generously with olive oil (or use an oil spray); the courgette doesn’t need as much oil, because the residual oil left on the grill by the aubergines will be plenty.Lay the aubergines on the open grill side of the barbecue for 10–15 minutes, turning halfway, until cooked through and with defined char marks (more is more with aubergine, really). Transfer the cooked slices to the upper rack to keep warm (if you don’t have an upper rack, pop them back on the tray and cover loosely with foil).Next, grill the courgette slices for six to eight minutes, flipping them over halfway. Repeat with the tomatoes and onion, until they are slightly blackened and blistered and seeping out juice. As each vegetable is cooked, introduce them to the aubergines on the upper rack (or in the loosely covered tray) to keep warm.For the adjika, put everything in a small blender and whizz smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.When you’re ready to serve, dot blobs of the adjika and the yoghurt all over a large platter, then use a flexible spatula or the back of a spoon to smear them into a marbled pattern. Arrange all the warm grilled vegetables on top, then finish with extra olive oil, the reserved coriander leaves and extra basil leaves.Honeydew carpaccio with coriander pestoView image in fullscreenSome people don’t like coriander (they’re wrong), but you could use basil to make the pesto instead; if need be, it could easily be made days in advance and loosened with extra oil.

Now, I was getting another chance to shine – in a rural community choirCamilla BalshawWed 30 Jul 2025 01.55 EDTShareIt was 1996 and I was in a nightclub in Tokyo. I was 26 and had been living and working in Japan for three years. I was dancing, along with my friends, to the thump of hypnotic house music. Next to me, an older Japanese man wearing glasses moved closer. Dressed in a dark blue suit, the attire of a “salaryman”, he looked out of place. He puffed on a cigarette as he tapped me on the shoulder. “You look like you can sing,” he shouted over the music. Why would he think that, I wondered. Because I am Black, something of a rarity in Japan? Did he also presume I had natural rhythm and could run a speedy 100-metre dash? I told him I taught English in a language school, but he pressed a crispmeishi(business card) into my hand and said: “I’m a talent scout for a music label and you look like you can sing. Call me.”I wasn’t sure that I could sing. Like most people, I was partial to belting out a show tune in the shower and, given that I lived in Japan, I sang at karaoke. I could hold a tune, but I was no Whitney. Still, I was curious, so I decided to call.View image in fullscreen‘I spent a rainy afternoon marvelling at the expressive freedom in my voice’ … Camilla Balshaw in March.Photograph: Courtesy of Camilla BalshawA few months later, I was in a recording studio in Tokyo, clutching a microphone. Although I wrote the lyrics to the music, which was composed by a Canadian producer, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was out of my depth. My trip-hop debut landed in Tower Records’ flagship store in Shibuya in the summer of 1997. Despite the glamour of being able to secure a table in the city’s hottest restaurants, performing the odd gig and signing autographs (I recorded my CD under my Yoruba Nigerian middle name, Adebisi, rather than my first name), the adrenaline rush soon wore off and doubt crept in.My album wasn’t exactly lighting up the charts and the royalties were not flowing. I started to feel like an impostor. I met other singers in Tokyo who had slogged for years on the circuit hoping to catch a break. How could I call myself a singer? I had got there by luck: I was in the right place at the right time, but I wasn’t exceptionally talented.Little wonder my “singing career” was over before it started. In 1998, I returned to my day job teaching English and my producer found another singer, a woman with a voice like an angel.View image in fullscreen‘I was no longer a lone voice singing in a stuffy recording studio’ … rehearsing with the Big Heart and Soul choir.Photograph: Courtesy of Camilla BalshawAfter five years of living in Tokyo, I felt it was time to return to the UK. I left for London in the winter of 1999, a couple of months before I hit 30. By 2011, I was living in rural Norfolk and, apart from my family and a few friends, no one knew about my moment in the spotlight. I held on to a cardboard box of Japanese memorabilia – the sole reminder of my previous life – but I was never tempted to listen to the album I had made; I felt embarrassed by it.Then, in the spring of 2022, I started writing my memoir, reflecting on aspects of my life that I had forgotten – or buried. For the first time in more than 25 years, I listened to my album, not once, but several times. I spent a rainy afternoon marvelling at the expressive freedom in my voice and began to wonder if I could find joy in singing again.I joined the Big Heart and Soul choir in Norfolk on a cold, drizzly night in January 2025. I slipped quietly into the hall, keeping on my hat and coat, and sat with a gaggle of women clutching song sheets. “Welcome to the sopranos,” one of them said, with a wry smile. “Join in when you feel ready,” said the person next to me.The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join inI didn’t open my mouth. If I wanted to sing again, was it really as part of a ruralcommunity choir? I gripped my lyric sheet, biting my lip. Then, as I listened, the choir’s harmonies soared and the hairs on my forearms stood up. The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join in, my voice tentative at first, then louder. I was no longer a lone voice singing into a microphone in a stuffy recording studio in Tokyo; I was part of a larger, collaborative sound. In that moment, decades of feeling like a fraud lifted. The harmonies we created were so jubilant and full of life that I sang with a permanent grin.When the class ended, one of the choir members asked if I had sung before. I paused before telling her the truth – about the stranger in the nightclub, the album in Tokyo and how I had lost confidence in my voice. “So, you were big in Japan,” she deadpanned. I smiled.After that, there was no stopping me. My singing voice was no longer hidden in a box of memorabilia; I sang whenever possible, belting out cheesy show tunes in the shower and singing along to my own record in the car. Now, if I hear a song I like, it doesn’t matter if I only vaguely know the words; I sing along anyway. Joining my local choir made me feel unbound, like a baby learning to walk, stumbling into a playground of endless vocal adventures. I may not be Whitney, but, really, who is?Named: A Story of Names and Reclaiming Who We Are by Camilla Balshaw is out now (Bedford Square, £18.99).

It has been on her mind for four years. “I’ve tried to do it twice, but because I got married and changed my name I had to do a change-of-name certificate. That delayed it further. It was like a whole other hurdle,” she says.The task is combining her two superannuation (pension) accounts, so that she only pays one admin fee. “It’s too annoying. There’s incentive as I’d save money, but finding time for it is another thing.”Mia Northrop, co-author of Life Admin Hacks, has encountered countless situations like this. She says people can get “stuck” in different stages of completing a task. “You might be really good at starting and really bad at finishing,” she says, or vice versa. “So you need to know this about yourself so that you can overcome the challenge.”Drowning in admin? 14 productivity hacks to regain control of your diary, inbox – and lifeRead moreWhen people struggle with admin, such as tax returns or creating a will, it can stem from fear of failure, Northrop says. “It’s tedious. It’s repetitive. It is often asking us to work on things that we are not particularly good at or confident about. That’s where a lot of procrastination can come into it because we aren’t particularly proficient, or we’re not passionate about it.”“Everyone procrastinates to some extent,” says clinical psychologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, from the University of the Sunshine Coast. “There’s a bit of stigma around it, because many people say it’s laziness or poor time management, and none of those things are true. It is actually a symptom of perfectionism.“When people have very high standards for themselves, and they worry about doing things perfectly … then, due to the standard not being met, guilt and shame and self-detrimental talk can come in.”Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThere’s another reason Maher has put off her task – it seems harder than it needs to be. “I feel frustrated because I think [the companies] could make my life easier,” she says. “Part of me wonders if they make it deliberately awkward so we don’t do it.”Certain life admin tasks are irritating because you may only encounter them once. Associate Prof Micah Goldwater, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sydney, says we have to invest a lot of mental effort in learning new tasks. Then when we’re done, it “feels like there is very little use for it”.“With online forms there’s an initial block because … you’re having to learn how to use the specific form,” he says. “The functionality of all these forms is slightly different, and you have to be very detail-oriented and focused to work it out. Sometimes it seems like the trade-off isn’t worth it.”So what can a life-admin avoider do to tick off tedious tasks?Break it down into easier stepsNorthrop says she can’t get passionate about doing her tax return, so she created a checklist for herself – she ticks off sub-tasks throughout the year. “I have a folder where I save everything as I go so that when it comes to tax time, it’s not overwhelming.”Bribe yourselfHoulihan suggests incorporating rewards as you complete each stage. “Do one thing first and then pause and do something more enjoyable, have a break and go back to it,” she says. When Houlihan tackles an unpleasant task, she will break for “a pastry at a cafe, spending time in nature or watching the TV show I wanted to watch … a reward can help motivate us”.Find a buddyTelling other people what you plan to do can be helpful, says Northrop, but Houlihan says it can be controversial too. “You don’t want people to nag you,” Houlihan says. “That might give the tasks even more negative connotations” – which reinforces procrastination. “But if you say to someone that loves and cares about you ‘I want to do this by Friday’, it can help you hold yourself accountable.”The worse you feel about your ability to do a task, the less likely you’ll be to attempt it, and then the worse you’ll feel for not doing it. So choose your people wisely: “Not someone who is going to be on your back, or going to make you feel bad if you don’t do it.”View image in fullscreenGet rid of distractions, or bribe yourself with orange slices – anything it takes to make the task more pleasant.Photograph: Keep It 100/Getty ImagesBlock out time“If there’s a task I have to do, rather than being on a vague to-do list, I put it into my calendar,” Goldwater says. Blocking off time in your day means it’s more likely to happen, he says. “Everything is in my calendar now. If it’s not on the calendar, I will most likely forget about it. Life admin tasks are one of those things.”Host a ‘forcing party’Combining accountability buddies with blocking out time, writer and educator Tyler Alterman found a novel way to beat procrastination. On X, he posted that throwing a“forcing party”, where he and his friends got together to do life admin they’d been avoiding, was a huge success. “A passport has been filed for, an inbox has been zero’d, a personal website has been created, & more,” he wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s often a mixture of the physical environment and our own personality … I’ve had clients who have multiple children or health issues they’re having to accommodate, and there are only so many hours in the day.”Do the worst part first“If boring tasks sit at the end of your day or the end of your week, they’re probably looming in the back of your mind,” Houlihan says. “The anticipation of how unpleasant it will be grows and grows.“One quick tip is to flip your calendar upside down – start with the most boring things first and to get them out of the way.”‘I feel bombarded with to-dos’: the hell of life admin – and how to get on topRead moreCall in an expertSome life admin is incredibly convoluted and taxing. At this point, it’s worth considering engaging someone to help you navigate it, such as a social worker or solicitor.Ines Jusufspahic is an immigration lawyer in Sydney who works with individuals and companies to complete working visas and partner visas. “We take the angst out of it as much as possible,” the principal solicitor at Rocket & Ash Immigration Law says.Jusufspahic has had clients return to Brazil, Argentina and the UK: they had avoided the paperwork for so long, there wasn’t enough time to process their visas. “This is often the biggest problem in their life, and there’s often a time pressure,” she says. “It’s a process that people really dislike, and it’s really confusing for some people.”Houlihan says some people are chronic procrastinators, and the first step is recognising any patterns in your behaviour. “If you’ve still got that piece of paper on your table, then is that the only thing that’s still lying around?” she says. If it’s a widespread issue, and causing negative thoughts, a therapist can help you identify and work through the possible emotional triggers and understand why. “That’s really the key to what to do about it.”Do it later“I think we are often just being too hard on ourselves,” Houlihan says. “We can become trapped in a cycle of heightened stimulation and being on the go, especially if you have young children, and we can have this sense of urgency that we just apply to all tasks.“Actually take stock and think ‘Do I need to do this now?’”Houlihan has put off renewing her passport, as it’s not due for months. So she simply took it off her to-do list for now. “Because I could just do with one less thing at the moment.”Opting to take time for yourself instead can be an act of self-care, she says. Maher agrees: “If my choice is to go for a run, read a book, see a friend or do life admin, I’m gonna choose the other three things every single day of the week.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleSelf and wellbeingPersonal financefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Galaxy Z Flip 7 joins thebook-style Z Fold 7as Samsung’s two flagship folding phones for 2025. Like its predecessors, the Flip’s biggest selling point is that it takes one of the largest screens on a Samsung and folds it in half for a more pocket-friendly size.Costing from £1,049 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799) it is similar in price to the regular S25+ and super-thinS25 Edge, but with a slightly larger screen.View image in fullscreenUnfolded the Flip 7 handles like a regular Android phone with a really big 6.9in flexible OLED screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 is slightly taller and wider than its predecessor accommodating the larger 6.9in inner display. It is also thinner thanthe Flip 6by 1.2mm when folded, but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference, unlike the transformational change given to theFold 7 this year.The new larger cover display on the outside fills the top half of the Flip 7 encircling the cameras and LED flash. It is able to fit more text from notifications and widgets on display, but it also looks far better than predecessors. Choose a good wallpaper and it looks stunning, particularly in the dark metallic blue colour.View image in fullscreenThe hinge feels sturdy shutting with a reassuring clunk, but it is hard to open the Flip 7 with one hand.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 has hardened glass on the outside, but the internal screen is still covered by a necessarily softer layer that picks up fingerprints, suffers from glare and can be easily marked. It requires more care than a regular slab phone. The Flip is water resistant but not dust resistant, so must be kept away from fine particles that might gum up its hinge.SpecificationsMain screen:6.9in FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display (397ppi)Cover screen:4.1in AMOLED 120Hz (345ppi)Processor:Samsung Exynos 2500RAM:12GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:One UI 8 based onAndroid16Camera:50 +12MP rear, 10MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, nano sim + esim, wifi7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP48 (1.5-metre depths for 30 minutes)Folded dimensions:85.5 x 75.2 x 13.7mmUnfolded dimensions:166.7 x 75.2 x 6.5mmWeight:188gFast and snappy, but a little short on battery lifeView image in fullscreenThe Flip 7 fully charges in about 90 minutes and hits 50% in half an hour using a 25W or greater power adaptor (not included). It also supports 15W wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 has a Samsung Exynos 2500 chip, which is a high-end processor similar to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite used in the rest of Samsung’s flagship phone line. It won’t win any raw performance awards, but day to day it made the Flip 7 feel rapid with a solid gaming experience, even if the phone got quite warm during prolonged sessions.The battery life is falls slightly short of the Flip’s predecessors lasting about 36 hours between charges while on a mix of 5G and wifi and actively using the screen for about six hours. That roughly matches thesmallest S25 modeland means the Flip 7 will see out a heavy-use day with most people needing to charge it nightly. Note that prolonged use on 5G had a greater drain on the battery than Qualcomm-equipped Samsung phones.One UI 8View image in fullscreenFlex mode reveals tools such as a trackpad and scroll wheel, playback or camera controls on one half of the screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 is one of the first Samsung phones, alongside the Z Fold 7, to runOne UI 8(Android 16) out of the box. It is one of the best versions of Android available offering deep customisation and solid performance.It looks and behaves very much like the software on the standard S25 line, including various AI tools across writing, image editing and generation, transcription and translation, and so on. It also has Google’s AI services including Gemini and Circle to Search.The Now bar is great, showing currently ongoing activities such as sport scores, music playback, timers, alarms and other bits.The Flip 7 has some additional tools to make use of the folding form. The useful flex mode moves the content, site or app to the top half of the screen and puts controls on the bottom half when you fold the Flip into an L-shape.View image in fullscreenAlbum art from your currently-playing music looks fantastic on the external cover display of the Flip 7.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt also has multiple tools to use the outside screen. You can view notifications, answer texts, control music or system settings, access various widgets including a voice recorder and calculator, plus talk to Gemini without opening the phone. A handful of apps including Google Maps, messages, WhatsApp, Netflix and YouTube can be opened on the outside screen too. But to use other apps on the cover screen requires downloading Samsung’s MultiStar plugin from the Galaxy Store, which is simple enough but should be a default feature.Samsung will provide Android and security updates until 31 July 2032.CameraView image in fullscreenFlex mode lets you get creative with your photography, propping the phone up in various ways for interesting angles.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe camera is one of the weaker areas of the Flip 7. It has a 50-megapixel main and 12MP ultra wide camera on the cover screen and a 10MP selfie camera on the inside.The selfie camera is OK but not great, suffering in low light though perfectly fine for video calls. Instead you get much better results using the main camera for selfies with the cover screen as the viewfinder.The main camera does shoot great photos outdoors and in good light, with plenty of detail and solid colours, but can be a bit dark, grey and grainy indoors or in difficult lighting conditions. The ultra-wide camera is decent for landscapes but struggles in lower light settings.The camera has plenty of fun modes, including the ability to shoot photos and video partially folded like anold-school handycamor propped up for hands-free selfies.Overall the Flip 7 shoots decent photos but its cameras aren’t quite on par with what you get on standard flagship phones.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThere is still a tiny gap near the hinge, but the rest of the phone is sealed when shut to stop debris and pocket fluff from entering it.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery has an expected lifespan of at least 2,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Inside screenrepairs cost about £294. Samsung offers aself-repair programme, as well as Care+accidental damage insurancethat reduces the cost of repairs to £119.The Flip 7 is made from recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements and steel, accounting for 18.2% of the weight. Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices, and breaks down thephone’s environmental impact in its report (pdf).PriceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 costs from£1,049(€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799).For comparison, theZ Fold 7costs£1,799, theS25 Edgecosts£1,099, the S25+ costs£999, the Z Flip 7 FE costs£849, the Motorola Raze 60 Ultra costs£1,099and the Xiaomi Mix Flip costs£640.VerdictThe Flip 7 is Samsung’s most attractive flip phone yet, but the biggest upgrade is the larger cover display on the outside.The rest of the phone is pretty similar to its predecessors. The internal folding display is great, but soft and needs care. The fingerprint scanner in the power button is fantastic, but is placed a bit too high up the side of the phone. The cameras are decent but not up to the same standards of regular flagship phones, while the battery life is a bit on the short side. The software is great and comes with seven years of updates. But it all feels very iterative.The Flip 7 is the still the best way to fit a large screen in a small pocket, but it’s crying out for the kind of transformational redesign given to itslarger Fold 7 siblingthis year.Pros:bigger outside screen, great large screen that folds in half, IP48 water-resistant, great software with seven years of updates, plenty of AI features, attractive design, fun.Cons:expensive, less durable than a regular phone and costly to fix, no dust resistance, camera lacks telephoto zoom and not up to par with regular flagship phones, not a major update.View image in fullscreenThe Flip 7 looks stunning and can do more when closed, but most tasks are better handled on the main internal screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

RSA announced its withdrawal from the home insurance market early last year after selling its personal lines to Admiral Group.It is very poor that Saga did not write to you with ample warning and seek another underwriter for your policy instead of leaving you in the lurch. This is especially the case since while most insurers will continue to offer cover after a subsidence claim, albeit for a higher rate, it is notoriously difficult to find a new provider.In desperation, you eventually found cover with a specialist company at a cost of £3,300 a year plus a £5,000 excess. Your Saga premiums were £450 (and the excess was £1,000).Saga tells me, uselessly, that it will offer an alternative if needed.

Known as the Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean earthquake, the largest ever recorded temblor resulted in more than 1,600 deaths in the country and beyond, most of which were caused by the resulting large tsunami. Thousands of people were injured.2. AlaskaIn 1964, a 9.2-magnitude earthquake jolted the Alaska’s Prince William Sound, lasting for almost five minutes. More than 130 people were killed in the largest recorded earthquake in the US and subsequent tsunami. There were huge landslides and towering waves that caused severe flooding. The event was followed by thousands of aftershocks for weeks after the initial quake.3. Sumatra, IndonesiaView image in fullscreenDebris in Banda Aceh, Aceh province, Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami.Photograph: Achmad Ibrahim/APA 9.1-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunamidevastated south-east and south Asia and east Africain 2004, killing 230,000 people. Indonesia alone recorded more than 167,000 deaths as entire communities were wiped out.4.Tohoku, JapanA 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of north-east Japan in 2011, triggering a towering tsunami that smashed into the Fukushima nuclear plant. It knocked out power and cooling systems and triggered meltdowns in three reactors. More than 18,000 people were killed in thequake and tsunami, some of whom have never been recovered.5.Kamchatka, RussiaIn 1952, a 9.0-magnitude quake caused significant damage but no reported deaths despite a tsunami that hit Hawaii with 9.1-metre (30ft) waves.6. Biobío, ChileAn 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit central Chile in 2010, shaking the capital for a minute and half and setting off a tsunami. More than 500 people were killed in the disaster.Timeline graph7.Esmeraldas, EcuadorIn 1906, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami killed 500 to 1,500 people. Its effects were felt for miles along the Central American coast and as far away as San Francisco and Japan.8. AlaskaIn 1965, an 8.7-magnitudequake struck Alaska’s Rat Islands, causing a tsunami with waves 11 metres (35ft) high. There was some relatively minor damage, including cracks in buildings and in an asphalt runway.9. TibetAt least 780 people were killed when an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck in 1950. Dozens of villages were destroyed, including at least one that slid into a river. There were also major landslides that jammed the Subansiri River in India. When the water eventually broke through, it resulted in a deadly 7-metre (23ft) wave.10. Sumatra, IndonesiaIn 2012, an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of northern Sumatra, in Indonesia. Though the quake caused little damage, it increased pressure on a fault that was the source of the devastating 2004 tsunami.Explore more on these topicsEarthquakesTsunamisexplainersShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, depending on which hemisphere you live in, you are likely to have seen or heard about a squad of supremely talented women pulling off a remarkable comeback to bring home silverware to a proud country. Congrats to England’s triumphant Lionesses, who retained the Euros trophy.But here, it’s all about Nigeria’s Super Falcons. I checked in with Eromo Egbejule, our west Africa correspondent, to talk about last weekend’s electric Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final, whichNigeria won for the 10th time.A nail-biting finaleView image in fullscreenFalcons rising … Nigeria’s Deborah Abiodun tackles Sanaâ Mssoudy of Morocco.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesLike all great matches, the final had the burden of heavy expectation bearing down on it. The stakes were greater than just claiming the trophy: forMorocco, it was about winning on home turf, in front of families and thousands of supporters. The squad, which seemed on the brink of another global tournament watershed after the men’s team reached the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time, were in pole position for most of the match. The Atlas Lionesses were winning 2-0 until the 64th minute before conceding three goals, the last one a devastating two minutes before the final whistle.Despite the sense that Morocco’s moment had finally come,Nigeria’s Super Falcons raised the trophy again. It was their 10th from a total of 14 tournaments – a dominance, which had been interrupted three years ago by South Africa, providing ample motivation this time out. So intense is the rivalry between Nigeria and South Africa that Eromo says the Super Falcons’ victory over Banyana Banyana in the semi-final had “felt like the final”.The reception in Nigeria was, of course, celebratory. People are “definitely, definitely happy”, Eromo says. “The Falcons have always been popular because they are very very dominant.” But a new element of this tournament has widened their appeal: social media. “A couple of players have been posting on Snapchat,” Eromo says, which has brought the team closer to a new generation of supporters. Of those players, Michelle Alozie, right back and also, remarkably, a cancer research technician, is such a prolific poster that she came under fire for her “unserious” habit. After Nigeria won, she uploaded astory from the pitchwith the caption “now let me post in peace”. It was the first African tournament outing for Alozie and the MVP of the final, Esther Okoronkwo, both of whom have large social media followings.What makes the Super Falcons so super?View image in fullscreenWafcon warmup … the Super Falcons prepare for kick-off against Morocco.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesEromo ascribes Nigeria’s success to two factors. The first is simply a head start – Nigerian women’s football developed at an international level earlier than other African countries. And Nigeria, in general, was one of the early African movers. (I am of the generation that still remembers, with cinematic detail, theheartbreaking Italian goalthat denied Nigeria a historic spot in the men’s World Cup quarter-finals in 1994.) The other factor is one that Eromo describes as a mental edge. “Nigerians thrive in chaos,” he suggests, half in jest and half with a sort of national pride, in reference to a playing style that bewilders and scatters the strategic plans of their opponents. The rest, he says, can be attributed to living in the diaspora: Nigerian players have acquired valuable experience while playing for teams in Europe and the US. Some of the Super Falcons form part, or have been part, of teams such as Paris FC, Barcelona and Houston Dash.Winners – but not without challengeskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could tell that other teams were stepping up.” Indeed, Equatorial Guinea have won the trophy previously, as have South Africa, and then Morocco flew to the final, buoyed up by their home crowd. Now Nigeria’s dominance is no longer a sure thing and other African countries are making big investments in their teams and in women’s football in general. Eromo says Morocco, in particular, are developing quickly, thanks in part to a sports sector that pays players well at a local league level. And so it is among a trio of strong challengers to Nigeria.Where there is football, there is politicsView image in fullscreenPolitical football … President Bola Tinubu (centre) has raised eyebrows after conferring national honours on all 24 Super Falcons and their 11-member technical team.Photograph: XEromo suggests the one factor curdling that “definite, definite” happiness is how some in Nigeria are a bit hesitant about the country’s presidentappropriating the winas good PR for his unpopular leadership. Bola Tinubu asked the Super Falcons to bring the trophy to Abuja so he could welcome them home – all of which seems “natural to do”, Eromo says. But it is seen as “the president trying to whitewash his performance”, which includes economic policies that have not trickled down. “More people are hungrier than ever, and the security situation is still in chaos. There’s a lot of state propaganda floating around. This is seen as another example of Tinubu trying to gain goodwill ahead of the next election.”This is a moment that should belong to the Super Falcons and, in a wider sense, African women’s football. Every tournament introduces a new crop of talented players to the continent, and overshadows what are usually more dominant western competitions. I mention to Eromo that the Wafcon final took place within the same 24 hours as the Women’s Euro competition. “To be honest, I didn’t know the Euros final was even on until I started hearing about another Michelle,” he says. Not Alozie but Michelle Agyemang, the England forward of Ghanaian descent who was named young player of the tournament.

As the sounds of explosions reverberated close to their two-storey home, Mark’s mother rushed him downstairs, along with his grandparents.Later it would emerge that overnight,Russia had launched one of the largest attackson Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, withreports of more than 270 drones and missilesentering the country’s airspace.Mark and his family hid in a room they believed was the safest, removed by at least two walls from the exterior of the house – a rule Ukrainians have learned to stay alive. Meanwhile, his father, Sergey, rushed to the kitchen to turn off the gas main. As he did so a Shahed drone – the size of a small car – hit their house.I saw I was standing over my wife’s body … Even in death, she was curled protectively around MarkSergey Ifiemenko“There was smoke and dust everywhere, I couldn’t even breathe. I started calling out to them [his family] and ran to the room they were in,” says Sergey, 31, who had returned from service on the frontline the previous week.“I first saw my father and mother, they were injured. I asked my mother where Anna [his wife] and Mark were to which she replied Anna was no longer with us. I was holding a flashlight and when I pointed it down, I saw I was standing over my wife’s body … a fragment of the drone had pierced her head. Still, even in death, she was curled protectively around Mark, who was crying,” he says.Soon after rescuing him from his mother’s dying embrace, Sergey rushed Mark, amid ongoing attacks, to the house of a nearby relative and returned to help his parents. The next morning Mark was transported to Ohmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv where he spent 10 days in the intensive care unit, most of it in a coma.View image in fullscreenFour-year-old Mark Ifiemenko suffered a fractured skull, crushed nose and was blinded in one eye in a drone attack that also killed his mother.Photograph: Courtesy of Sergey IfiemenkoMark survived the attack, says Sergey, thanks to his mother’s quick thinking and protection, but he has endured injuries and a trauma that will take many years to heal. He suffered from fractures to his skull, a crushed nose and injuries that have left him blind in one eye.There has been a significant rise in child casualties in Ukraine in recent months as Russia indiscriminately targets heavily populated civilian areas, with222 children killed or injuredbetween March and May this year and 2,889 in total since the start of the invasion. Given the delay in verifying deaths, the UN says the true number is likely to be much higher.Ukrainian rights group say Russia’s attacks are not accidental and should be more strongly condemned by international leaders. “Under international humanitarian law, deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure – especially schools, hospitals, and places where children gather – is considered a war crime,” says Daria Kasyanova, chair of the Ukrainian Child Rights Network.Amnestysays it hasdocumented “numerous instances of Russian forces conducting indiscriminate attacks in Ukraine, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties” and that “indiscriminate strikes that kill or injure civilians constitute war crimes”.Even if the conflict ends, Ukraine now has one of the highest prevalence of explosive remnants of war and landmines globally,says the UN, which are likely to cause continuing casualties among children in particular far into the future.For children such as Mark who have survived, the injuries – physical and emotional – that have been inflicted are life-changing. A Unicef survey earlier this year,estimated at least one in five childrenin Ukraine have experienced a personal loss to the war, whether a sibling, parent or friend.Sergey says: “He asks about Mamusya [a Ukrainian term of endearment for mother] and misses her very much. I told him the truth about what happened to her. How much she loved him and how she did everything for him to be happy. I say that she has become his guardian angel.”As well as regular visits to the hospital to treat his injuries, and more recently to fit a prosthetic eye, Sergey says his son has trouble sleeping, and with his learning and development.“It is very hard sometimes for him because he’s just a child. He reacts to loud sounds, even flinching at anything that might sound like a drone.”View image in fullscreenTo mark International Chilren’s Day in Lviv in 2022, stuffed toys were placed on seats in empty yellow school buses to symbolise Ukrainian children killed in the war with Russia.Photograph: Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/Getty ImagesKasyanova, who also works with a shelter for children without parental care or a guardian, says the war is having a multidimensional impact on children inUkraine.“Beyond the tragic increase in casualties, children are being deprived of safety, stability and a sense of normalcy. Their childhoods are marked by fear, separation and instability,” she says.‘Basically impossible to get them back’: Russia’s mass abduction of Ukrainian children is a war crime, say expertsRead moreBoth home and school life have been severely disrupted for millions of children in the country. For those aged three and younger, their entire lives have been marked by bombardments, violence and displacement.“Ukrainian children have been learning online for the third or even fourth year in a row because schools are either destroyed, damaged, or simply unsafe due to the constant threat of shelling. This is a deeply traumatising reality,” says Kasyanova.For some children, the war in Ukraine has been going on even longer – it is more than 11 years since Russia’s first invasion into the eastern regions of Ukraine.“There are children and teenagers who have never known a peaceful life – who were born into conflict or have lived most of their lives in war. Their understanding of childhood is shaped by loss, displacement, deportation, fear, and instability,” says Kasyanova.“If this trauma is not addressed properly, it can have long-term consequences on their ability to learn, build relationships, trust others. In some cases, this trauma can even be passed on to future generations,” she says.Sergey, now permanently back from the frontline to take care of his son, says he just wants to do everything he can to make Mark’s life a happy one, despite his injuries and trauma.“I don’t want another Ukrainian child raised to experience war. They have done nothing wrong to be killed or hurt like this. They didn’t deserve this,” he says.View image in fullscreenAntonina, 9, looks through a shrapnel-shattered window after an online lesson on the first day of the new school year in 2022.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsUkraineRights and freedomEuropeRussiaChild rightsChildrenWar crimesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within the framework of the United States’ own laws, what we seek is for them to return to our country immediately and not be detained in this manner.”The 39-acre (16 hectares) camp erected about 40 miles (64km) from Miami has comeunder heavy criticismfrom non-profit organizations who say detainees are held in overcrowded pods, along with sewage backups “resulting in cages flooded with feces”, and, in some cases, have been denied medical care.Advocates demand closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’, citing appalling conditionsRead moreYet, theTrump administrationand local Florida officials have flaunted the facility’s brutality since it opened earlier this month, emphasizing its isolated location in a swamp infested with pythons, alligators and crocodiles.Sheinbaum’s comments come after the Mexican consul in Miami, Rutilio Escandón, visited theFloridadetention center this week, becoming the first overseas consul to do so.“One of the complaints is that they bathe every three days, that they’re allowed to bathe every three days,” Escandón told theTelemundo TV station, referring to the 39 Mexicans he was able to interview. “Sometimes the air conditioning is very cold – they say sometimes it’s at 60 [degrees fahrenheit]. But it’s also very hot and there’s a lot of mosquitoes.”On Sunday, Roberto Velasco Álvarez, head of the North American unit at the Mexican foreign ministry,announcedthat two young brothers who had beenheld at Alligator Alcatraz, one of whom was visiting the US on a tourist visa, had been repatriated to Mexico without charges.The opening of the Alligator Alcatraz facility comes amid anationwide crackdownby the Trump administration on migrants and asylum seekers, with agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sweeping up tens of thousands of people in raids across the country.“The treatment of our fellow citizens there, particularly with these raids, is deeply painful,” Sheinbaum said. “We will always be there to support them.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

His father, the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was a bachelor when he became prime minister. He dated the actors Barbra Streisand and Kim Cattrall and married a 22-year-old woman while in office at age 51.Born and raised in California, Perry is a 13-time Grammy award nominee. She helped usher in the sound of 2000s pop, quickly becoming one of the bestselling artists of all time for her anthems.She has released seven studio albums, most notably 2010’s Teenage Dream.

The former Brazilian president faces decades in jail for allegedly plotting a military coup to stop Lula from taking office after the former lost the 2022 presidential election.On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order confirming that the US would impose 50% tariffs onBrazil. The order did not mention the previously-cited 1 August deadline, but indicated that the new duty would be enforced from next week.Ina rare interviewwith the New York Times, clearly designed to send a message to the White House on the eve of a potential trade war, Lula urged the US president to avoid creating a “lose-lose” relationship between two of the largest economies in the Americas and said he did not fear publicly criticizing Trump, whom he recently called an “emperor”.“There’s no reason to be afraid. I am worried, obviously, because we have economic interests, political interests, technological interests. But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country. Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country,” said Lula, who has enjoyed a bounce in the polls after Trump’s threat.Lula indicated his officials were willing to negotiate economic issues with the US: “In politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail. We always need to find the middle ground. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest and shouting about things you can’t deliver, nor by bowing your head and simply saying ‘amen’ to whatever the United States wants.”But Brazil’s president indicated that the political future of Bolsonaro – whose plotallegedly included plans to assassinate Lula– was a judicial matter and therefore non-negotiable. “Brazil has a constitution, and the former president is being tried with a full right to a defense,” Lula insisted.The 79-year-old leftist said his message for Trump was “that Brazilians and Americans do not deserve to be victims of politics, if the reason President Trump is imposing this tax on Brazil is because of the case against former President Bolsonaro”.Trump’s decision to cite Bolsonaro’s plight as one of the main justifications for his move against Brazil has left many observers doubting that the “Trump always chickens out” (Taco) maxim will apply to the Friday deadline facing Lula’s government. The US president has likened Bolsonaro’s “disgraceful” treatment to attempts to prosecute him after he unsuccessfully tried to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. Bolsonaro has denied plotting a coup but has admitted seeking“alternative ways”of stopping Lula from taking power.“I’d be very surprised if Trump pulled back in this case, not just because of his friendship with the Bolsonaro family … but above all because in Trump’s mind it reflects his own trauma,” the American Brazil specialist Brian Wintertoldthe Estado de São Paulo newspaper this week.Lula hinted he believed a retreat might be possible, comparing the current situation to unfounded fears over the millennium bug.“Do you remember when we were about to turn from 1999 to 2000, and there was worldwide panic that the computer systems were going to crash? Nothing happened,” said Lula, although he admitted he could not be certain “nothing will happen”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilTrump tariffsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpJair BolsonaroTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Developing countries have warned they cannot afford Belém’s accommodation prices, which have soared amid a shortage of rooms.In an emergency meeting of the UN’s “Cop bureau” on Tuesday, Brazil agreed to address countries’ concerns about accommodation and report back at another gathering on 11 August, said Richard Muyungi, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), who called the meeting.“We were assured that we will revisit that … to get assurances on whether the accommodation will be adequate for all delegates,” Muyungi said afterwards.He said African countries wanted to avoid reducing their participation because of the cost, adding: “We are not ready to cut down the numbers. Brazil has got a lot of options in terms of having a better Cop, a good Cop. So that is why we are pushing that Brazil has to provide better answers, rather than telling us to limit our delegation.”Brazil has faced criticism for its decision to host the conference in a small city in the rainforest rather than in a bigger urban centre that already has the necessary infrastructure and hotel rooms. The country is racing to expand the 18,000 hotel beds usually available in Belém, a coastal city of 1.3 million, to accommodate roughly 45,000 people who are expected to attend Cop30.This month, the Brazilian government said it had secured two cruise ships to provide 6,000 extra beds for delegates. It also opened bookings to developing countries at more affordable nightly rates of up to $220 (£165). That is still above the daily subsistence allowance (DSA) the UN offers some poorer nations to support their participation at Cops. For Belém, that DSA is $149.A diplomat familiar with Tuesday’s meeting said complaints about affordability came from both developed and developing countries. Wealthier countries have been told to expectnightly accommodation costs of up to $600– far higher than at previous Cop meetings.The Panamanian negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómezsaid in Junethat he feared the conference “might become the most inaccessible Cop in recent memory” and that developing countries, small island states, Indigenous voices and civil society would “not be adequately represented — if represented at all”.Media organisations, activists, NGOs and charities have also raised fears that they may not be able to participate in the conference if a solution on accommodation costs is not found.In February, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, told critics that if hotels were unavailable,they should “sleep under the stars”.An agenda for Tuesday’s meeting confirmed it was convened to address “operational and logistical preparations for the climate change conference in Belém” and the AGN’s concerns on the matter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Officials organising the Cop30 have made repeated assurances that poorer countries will have access to accommodation they can afford.A spokesperson for the UNFCCC, theUnited Nationsclimate body, declined to comment on the meeting.Two UN diplomats showed Reuters quotes they had received from hotels and property managers in Belém for nightly rates of about $700 a person during Cop30.Officials from six governments, including wealthier European countries, said they had not yet secured accommodation because of high prices, and some said they were preparing to reduce their participation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government said it might need to halve its delegation compared with recent Cops, when the Netherlands sent about 90 people during the two-week event including envoys, negotiators and youth representatives.This month, Poland’s deputy climate minister, Krzysztof Bolesta, said: “We don’t have accommodation. We’ll probably have to cut down the delegation to the bone. In an extreme event, maybe we will have to not show up.”Explore more on these topicsCop30United NationsBrazilClimate crisisAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Later on Wednesday, the Russian Geophysical Survey said the quake had also led to a violent eruption of the Klyuchevskoy volcano, which is near the epicentre.The8.8-magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 12 miles (19.3km) and was centred 78 miles (126km) south-east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city in Russia’s Avacha Bay, the US Geological Survey said.One death has been reported so far related to the tsunami. The Asahi Shimbun news outlet inJapansaid a 58-year-old woman died after her car veered off a cliff as she tried to reach the safety of higher ground.Many reports suggested damage was most significant in Russia, where a tsunami with a height of 3 to 4 metres was recorded along parts of the shore. Video footage showed a flooded port and a building being swept away. The government in Moscow claimed there were no fatalities.With the earthquake creating huge ripples that gradually made their way across the ocean, waves of up to 1.3 metres were recorded along shores in Japan, while smaller surges later hit Hawaii. However, a major, destructive tsunamiwas not expectedand no damage was recorded.1:38Tsunami alerts from Japan to the US after earthquake sparks warnings across Pacific – video reportHours later, parts of the US west coast were being hit by waves. Many were reported to be less than a foot above the normal sea level. Officials still warned residents to stay away from the water, advising that the first waves were not necessarily the most powerful.Authorities in French Polynesia warned several of the Marquesas Islands, home to about 9,500 people in the southern Pacific and more than 5,000 miles from the earthquake epicentre, to expect tsunami waves up to 4 metres high. Later, officials updated the forecast to say the highest waves would be 2.5 metres.As sets of waves moved south and east, Chile raised its tsunami warning to the highest level for most of its lengthy Pacific coast and said it was evacuating hundreds of people.In Russia, Sergei Lebedev, a regional minister for emergency situations, said several people were injured during the initial earthquake in parts of Kamchatka, a Pacific peninsula off the country’s east coast.Oleg Melnikov, a regional health minister, told Russia’s state news agency Tass: “[People] were hurt while running outside and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal.”He added: “All patients are currently in satisfactory condition and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”Kamchatka’s governor, Vladimir Solodov, described the quake in a post on Telegram as “serious and the strongest in decades of tremors”. He said a kindergarten in the area had been damaged.In Severo-Kurilsk, a Russian town of about 2,000 people approximately 215 miles south-west of the earthquake’s epicentre, tsunami waves submerged the fishing plant, according to authorities.The waves reached as far as the town’s second world war monument about 400 metres from the shoreline, according to the mayor, Alexander Ovsyannikov. “Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” he said at a crisis meeting.After 11 hours of warnings, Russian authorities lifted their tsunami alerts late on Wednesday evening.video of sea lions jumping into sea during earthquakeA tsunami watch was in effect for the US island territory of Guam and Micronesia. The US National Tsunami Warning Center said waves as high as 3 metres could hit Ecuador.In Japan, much of the country’s eastern seaboard – devastated by apowerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011– was ordered to evacuate. Officials said more than 900,000 residents in 133 municipalities along Japan’s Pacific coast were under evacuation orders.“Those near the coast should evacuate immediately to higher ground or safe buildings in the areas covered by the tsunami warning from Hokkaido to Wakayama prefecture [hundreds of miles to the south],” said Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi. “Please be aware that after the initial wave, second and third waves of tsunamis can be even higher.”The Japan Meteorological Agency said a tsunami as high as 40cm had been detected in 16 locations as the waves moved south along the Pacific coast from Hokkaido to just north-east of Tokyo.The Fukushima nuclear plant, whichwent into meltdownafter being hit by the 2011 tsunami, was evacuated, although no abnormalities have been observed at the site.MapWednesday’s quake struck about 160 miles from Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost of the country’s four big islands, and was felt there only slightly, according to Japan’s NHK television channel.Factory workers and residents in Hokkaido evacuated to a hill overlooking the ocean, footage from the broadcaster TBS showed. A newscaster on the Japanese public broadcaster NHK said: “Please evacuate quickly. If you can move quickly to higher ground and away from the coast.”By late on Wednesday, Japan had downgraded its tsunami alert but left an advisory in place along the Pacific coast.The US National Tsunami Warning Center, based in Alaska, issued a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska Aleutian Islands and an alert for portions of the US west coast, including California, Oregon and Washington. The alert also included a vast swath of Alaska’s coastline, including parts of the panhandle. As waves started to hit the shores, those warnings were later cancelled.Kamchatka and Russia’s far east sit on the Pacific “ring of fire”, a geologically active region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Japan, also part of the active seismic zone, is one of the world’s most quake-prone countries.Earlier in July, five powerful quakes – the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 – struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest quake was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 90 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000.On 4 November 1952, a magnitude-9.0 quake in Kamchatka caused damage but no reported deaths and set off 9.1-metre waves inHawaii.Explore more on these topicsEarthquakesTsunamisRussiaJapanPacific islandsHawaiiAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A tsunami warning had been issued after an8.8-magnitude quakestruck a remote part of the Russian coast. Authorities had put out the alert over concerns that destructive waves could slam the shoreline in the coming hours, and urged people to move away from the coast. Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action.“I went to higher ground just in case,” she said. Her family lives in the lower area of Tamuning and they moved to a more elevated part of the village. She joined other residents who evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of Hagåtña, the capital of the US island in the western Pacific Ocean.In villages, towns and cities across the world’s largest ocean, from Russian and Chinese ports to Japanese fishing communities and coastal cities across the US west coast and farther south in Latin America, warnings and evacuation orders rang out after the quake, one of the strongest ever recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead.Over the course of Wednesday, governments in many countries including the US and Japan downgraded their initial tsunami alerts, but not until after countless people across multiple time zones had fled as a precaution, many in the middle of the night.In parts of Russia, waves of up to 4 metres were recorded and authorities urged people to move away from the shoreline.Video from RussiaIn Japan, footage by the public broadcaster NHK showed many people on the roof of a building on the northern island of Hokkaido, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, while fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.About 200 people evacuated to a Buddhist temple that sits on high ground overlooking Kamaishi, in Iwate prefecture, a city that lost about 1,250 residents in the devastating March 2011 tsunami. The Senjuin temple is a designated municipal tsunami evacuation area.The chief priest, Keio Shibasaki, told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper: “Considering that more than 1,000 people took refuge here after the [2011] earthquake, the number of evacuees is relatively small, but we have started preparing lunch with stored food in case of unforeseen circumstances such as power outages. We are prepared for a long stay.”Evacuees included staff from the city hall, the post office, and children and teachers from the nearby Kamaishi kindergarten.“We evacuated when the tsunami warning was issued,” the kindergarten head, Keito Fujiwara, told the Mainichi Shimbun.“We stored emergency food supplies at the temple and have been preparing accordingly. During the 2011 earthquake, there were cases where parents went to pick up their children and became victims, so we communicated via group LINE [a popular Japanese messaging app] that under no circumstances should anyone go to pick up their children.”MapIn 2011, the tsunami waves swept over the Kamaishi tsunami protection breakwater, a decades-long $1.5bn project that had been completed two years previously, inundating the city in scenes that were captured on video and seen around the world.The only death related to Wednesday’s tsunami appeared to be in Japan, where a 58-year-old woman was reported to have died after her car fell from a cliff as sheevacuated to higher ground, according to local media.InHawaii, tsunami warning sirens blared twice on Tuesday afternoon on multiple islands including Oahu, where the capital, Honolulu, is located, and Kauai. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned: “Take action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.”GraphicAs residents raced to get out, traffic backed up in some Honolulu neighbourhoods. Even though it is summer break for pupils, some schools issued alerts cancelling sports and other activities.On Kauai shortly after the tsunami warning was issued, staff at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its south shore and moved all visitors and employees out of the inundation zone to higher ground.Still, blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed as many in Hawaii left work early heading for home or for designated safe areas away from the islands’ heavily populated coastline. Residents have become particularly sensitive to phone warnings and civil defence sirens after Hawaii’s emergency management agency issued a false alert warning of an inbound “ballistic missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic.View image in fullscreenPeople leave the beach for safety in Oahu, Hawaii.Photograph: Eugene Tanner/AFP/Getty ImagesAll islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters began opening, and people in coastal areas were advised to head to higher ground immediately.Kauai policeasked the public to stay off the road unless absolutely necessary. When the waves arrived, they were not as destructive as feared, and Hawaii’s emergency management agencysaidevacuation orders had been lifted and there were no reports of major damage.InGuam, residents were urged to remain out of the water and told to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100ft (30 metres) inland and 50ft above sea level. The port authority and other government agencies suspended operations, while marina users and local residents were told to evacuate to higher ground. Workers in some businesses and in the Guam visitors bureau in the coastal district of Tumon were sent home.But some were not worried by the warnings. Tessa Borja, a policy analyst from Tumon, did not feel evacuating was necessary and stayed in her second-floor flat. “We are protected by the reef,” she said.In nearby Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, similar warnings were issued. Government offices were closed and businesses in low-lying areas shut their doors. Petrol stations had long queues of vehicles wanting to fill up.Some residents living near the shoreline in Saipan, an island of about 43,000 people, fled to higher ground as they waited for the all clear from authorities. Tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been held regularly in on the island.As the ripples of the earthquake spread across the Pacific, Latin America was one of the last places to be hit. Peruvians received beeping alerts and text messages on their phones from the National Civil Defence Institute, warning them to stay away from the beach and telling authorities to close coastal access points along the country’s 1,864-mile (3,000km) Pacific-facing coastline.In the capital Lima, the coastal road was closed, though La Punta, a low-lying peninsula in the nearby port district Callao, was not evacuated. R Adm Jorge Vizcarra, a spokesperson for the Peruvian navy, said: “The train of waves will be noticeable, but it will not be high enough to have a significant impact on the population.”Explore more on these topicsAsia PacificTsunamisPacific islandsJapanHawaiiGuamEarthquakesnewsShareReuse this content"

He said placing further financial pressures on lenders could spell trouble for the UK economy.“Additional taxation on banks does run the risk of eroding our continued investment capacity in the business and in supporting our customers, and ultimately in delivering growth for the UK,” he said on Wednesday, as the bank revealed a 29% drop in second-quarter profits.The intervention comes amid growing speculation that Reeves could use her autumn budget to announce a fresh round of tax rises, asforecasts for public finances worsen.While UK banks have so far dodged an increase in sector-specific levies, a leaked memo by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, in May urged the chancellor to consider a series of wealth taxes, includingincreasing the corporation tax rate on banks.Banks currently face the 25% headline rate of corporate tax, as well as a 3% bank surcharge and a further bank levy, which is a charge on a portion of balance sheet assets. Estimates by the lobby groupUK Finance and the accountancy firm PwCsuggest that, when also accounting for employment taxes and VAT, banks in the UK are paying a total tax rate of about 45.8%. That compares with 38.6% in Frankfurt and 27.9% in New York.Elhedery’s comments come days after the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, Charlie Nunn, warned that higher taxes on the banking sectorcould damage Labour’s plan to see the City drive an economic recovery, and “wouldn’t be consistent” with the chancellor’s messaging to date, as the government pushes to reboot growth.Financial services were among the eight sectors that received government banking in the Labour government’s industrial strategy, with the chancellor subsequently announcing anumber of changesto slash regulation and increase growth across the sector.However, Elhedery saidHSBCwas “positive about the outlook” for the UK, which had “demonstrated strong resilience over the last few years”.He said: “We continue to see strong resilience across credit outlook indicators and obviously across matters such as employment, the reduction of inflation, all of which give us significant room to be more optimistic about the outlook.”Elhedery also highlighted the “pace” at which the UK had struck a number of free trade agreements, including with the US, EU and India. “Frankly, UK-India is one of our most vibrant corridors, and we’re really looking forward to supporting our clients [to] realise the full benefits of this FTA.”However, his comments came as HSBC revealed a worse-than-expected drop in profits between April and June as its exposure to a struggling Chinese bank and Hong Kong’s troubled commercial real estate sector took its toll.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the second charge the bank has taken over BoCom, with the ripple effects of China’s property downturnresulting in a $3.1bn hit last year.HSBC also took a $400m charge related to “challenging market conditions” in Hong Kong’s commercial real estate sector, as the bank tried to cushion the blow of potential defaults across the industry, with “the oversupply of nonresidential properties putting continued downward pressure on rental and capital values”.Together, the impairment charges pushed down HSBC’s pre-tax profits 29% to $6.3bn in the three months to the end of June, compared with £8.9bn during the same quarter last year.However, the bank still announced further payouts to shareholders, as it focused on the strength of the bank outside the one-off hits that dragged down earnings. That includes a dividend of 10 cents a share and a share buyback of up to $3bn, which is expected to take place before the time it announces third-quarter results at the end of October.Explore more on these topicsHSBCBankingRachel ReevesChinaHong KongAsia PacificTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

They also include Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Slovenia and Spain, which have. Emmanuel Macron last week said thatFrance would recognise Palestinianstatehood in the near future.The statement, which was published before the conclusion of a three-day UN conference set on reviving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said the states would “reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders”.It stressed the “importance of unifying theGazaStrip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”.On Wednesday evening, Carney saidCanadawould recognise the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly in September if certain conditions were met. He held a virtual cabinet meeting on the Middle East earlier on Wednesday.Carney said Canada would recognise Palestine if the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied West Bank, held an election in 2026 in which Palestinian militant group Hamas could play no part, and agreed to other democratic reforms.He called on Hamas to release all hostages it is holding, disarm, and play no role in the future governance of Palestine.In response, Iddo Moed, Israel’s ambassador to Canada, said Israel “will not bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it”.“We will not sacrifice our very existence by permitting the imposition of a jihadist state on our ancestral homeland that seeks our annihilation,” he said in a statement referring to Hamas, which seized power in Gaza in 2007.Carney’s remarks come amid growing pressure on Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza, which began in October 2023 in response to a Hamas raid that led to the deaths of 1,200 people, mainly Israelis, and the taking of more than 250 prisoners. More than 60,000 people have died in Gaza in the ensuing conflict, according to the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza.Keir Starmer on Tuesday said thatthe UK would recognise the state of in September“unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution”.Why is UK preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood?Read moreDonald Trump had initially said he didn’t “mind [Starmer] taking a position. I’m looking for getting people fed right now.”But later he condemned the decision to recognise a Palestinian state, saying onboard Air Force One that “you could make the case that you’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded. So I’m not in that camp, to be honest … because if you do that you are really rewarding Hamas. And I’m not about to do that.”The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this week he wanted to time a recognition of Palestinian statehood to help achieve a breakthrough in negotiations.“What we’re looking at is the circumstances where recognition will advance the objective of the creation of two states,” Albanese said on Wednesday.“My entire political life, I’ve said I support two states, the right of Israel to exist within secure borders and the right of Palestinians to have their legitimate aspirations for their own state realised. That’s my objective.”Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Damon, condemned the declaration.“While our hostages are languishing in Hamas terror tunnels in Gaza, these countries choose to engage in hollow statements instead of investing their efforts in their release,” said Damon. “This is hypocrisy and a waste of time that legitimises terrorism and distances any chance of regional progress. Those who truly want to make progress should start with an unequivocal demand for the immediate return of all the hostages and the disarmament of Hamas.”Explore more on these topicsWorld newsCanadaNew ZealandIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The protesters, many of whom were teenagers, held handwritten signs with political jokes and memes. They sang the national anthem and chanted “Cancel the law!”.The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the government hoped to fix the situation with the new law. “We anticipate the vote tomorrow. The relevant parliamentary committee has already given its approval. We are getting this fixed,” Sybiha said.The institutions in question are the national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo. Both work independently of other law enforcement bodies specifically to target high-level corruption.Oleksandr Klymenko, the head of Sapo, told a small group of journalists in a briefing at his office in Kyiv on Wednesday that his office received a tipoff that measures were being prepared against them two weeks ago, but he had not expected the “blitzkrieg” assault that followed, with the law being rushed through parliament with little discussion.He said he hoped parliament would now pass the new law and that it would be ratified and enacted immediately.Explaining the hastily passed law last week, Zelenskyy said he feared Nabu and Sapo had been infiltrated by Russian agents, and also said he wanted to ensure closer cooperation between different law enforcement bodies. But this has been brushed off by many Ukrainians as excuses.Klymenko declined to blame Zelenskyy personally for the move against the two institutions but suggested it was “revenge” for taking on certain sensitive cases, and he defended the track record of the two bodies.“To say in 2025 that these bodies are ineffective is just absurd. It’s a narrative that is being spread to discredit us, we have information that they are looking for information to dump it in the media and just such a narrative that is now being spread in the media in order to somehow discredit us,” he said.Klymenko said Nabu and Sapo had opened investigations into 31 sitting MPs, and that the prospect of being caught meant fewer top officials risked engaging in corrupt activities. “The main thing about our work is the enormous preventive effect it has,” he said.He said last week’s law, as well as the arrest of two Nabu detectives, had left the agencies “confused and frightened” and could cause “lasting damage” even if the bill was reversed. Already, he said, government whistleblowers who were in communication with the agencies had gone dark, fearing their identities could be compromised.Several European leaders spoke with Zelenskyy last week about the law, urging him to find a way out of the crisis. “It was important for him to hear it from his peers,” said the diplomat. European officials have cautiously criticised the bill in public.“The dismantling of key safeguards protecting [anti-corruption bureau] Nabu’s independence is a serious step back,” the European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos,wroteon social media. She added that the two bodies were “essential” to keep Ukraine on the path to EU accession.A protest is planned for Kyiv on Wednesday evening, with the goal of “reminding MPs to do the right thing”, said Dmytro Koziatynskyi, a former combat medic who was the first to call people to protest last week.“This is not something I went to war for … and others on the frontline are not there so the government can do crazy stuff like this,” he said, explaining the source of the frustration that led him to demand protests.He said there was no chance of the protest turning revolutionary, with everyone in attendance acutely aware of the dangers of political destabilisation in wartime. He praised the government for being “ready for dialogue” and backtracking on the moves, and said the protests showed Ukrainian democracy was still strong even though the war had made elections impossible.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Abdulmohsen, a consultant psychiatrist, is being held on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm.It was not immediately clear how he acquired the names and addresses of the victims. Media reports speculated that they may have been included in prosecution files from the investigation made available to defence lawyers.“We need to check whether the letters could have been held back,” said the regional MP Kerstin Godenrath, who is leading the state parliamentary inquiry into the attack, arguing that the correspondence amounted to a “retraumatising” of the victims.The national victims’ assistance organisation Weißer Ring criticised the authorities’ approach, with its managing director, Bianca Biwer, telling the news outlet Der Spiegel that it showed “no sympathy for the victims”.Biwer described the letters as a violation by arriving at their homes. “It puts the victims at the mercy of the perpetrator,” she said, noting that many criminal suspects hoped through such contact to reduce their sentences by demonstrating regret.Spiegel said the prosecutor’s office had been monitoring Abdulmohsen’s mail but that it had wanted the addressees to be able to decide for themselves whether to read the letters, which it said were enclosed in a separate sealed envelope with an advisory about its content.However, a prosecutor’s office spokesperson said it had since changed its policy and that if Abdulmohsen intended to send further correspondence “we will hold back these letters and inform victims (by telephone) that he has written”. If the addressees did not want to receive the letters, their wishes would be respected.The German government’s ombudsman for victims’ rights, Roland Weber, said the law should be changed to restrict the sharing of such contact information, telling the news agency DPA that the current policy “completely disregards protection of victims”.Abdulmohsen had inrepeated online posts before the attackvoiced strongly anti-Islam views, anger at German authorities and support for far-right conspiracy theory narratives on the “Islamisation” of Europe.The attack two months beforeGermany’s general electionfuelled an already bitter debate on immigration and security with thefar-right AfD party gaining in support.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

No one was injured and the falling debris came to a stop higher up the mountain.0:32Aerial footage shows aftermath of rockfalls in Italy’s Brenta Dolomites – video“Multiple rockfalls have occurred on both the western and eastern slopes of Cima Falkner in the Brenta Group,” read a statement by authorities in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige. “As a result, all climbing routes and hiking trails directly affected by the area have been immediately closed.“All hikers in the area have been evacuated. We urge everyone to pay maximum attention and strictly follow the ordinances to ensure their own safety.”Following reports of rockfalls, a technical inspection was conducted on Tuesday by the geological service with the support of a helicopter unit, which confirmed that “the entire summit is affected by an ongoing geomorphological process, likely linked to permafrost degradation”.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the rockfall.Photograph: PAT Press OfficeRockfalls have always occurred in the Dolomites, but experts this year warned of a striking rise in the number of collapses, driven by extreme heat and weather events intensified by the climate crisis.“Never before have we seen such an incredible increase in rockfalls,” Piero Carlesi, president of the scientific committee of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), told la Repubblica. “Landslides are on the rise, and the main cause is the climate crisis. There’s no doubt about it.”He added: “Mountains, by definition, are destined to collapse – they won’t remain as we know them for ever. What’s different now is that we’re seeing a clear acceleration of these processes, driven by heat and extreme weather events intensified by the climate crisis.”Cold temperatures, causing water seeping into rock fractures to freeze, acted as a kind of glue, holding the rocks together. But now, Carlesi said, with rising temperatures, that glue was disappearing and fractured rock was increasingly breaking off and tumbling down gullies. “It’s happening more and more often,” he said.View image in fullscreenExperts say the area around Cima Falkner is undergoing a process of erosion linked to rising temperatures.Photograph: PAT Press OfficeLast year, Italian scientists who took part in a campaign launched by the environmentalist group Legambiente said the Marmolada glacier – the largest and most symbolic in the Dolomites –could melt completely by 2040.Their report said Marmolada was losing between 7cm and 10cm of depth a day and that over the past five years, 70 hectares (173 acres) of its surface had disappeared.Since the beginning of scientific measurements in 1888, the Marmolada glacier has withdrawn by 1,200 metres in an “irreversible coma”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In late June 2025, Mont Blanc experienced a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures remaining above zero for an extended period at high altitudes, including the summit.Bernard Vion, a 66-year-old mountain guide, has been walking and climbing in the French Alps around Pralognan-la-Vanoise since he was a child and accompanies visitors on climbs. He said rockfalls and other dangers caused by climate change had complicated work for him and his colleagues.“We have never seen rock falls of such intensity and regularity before. The permafrost, which is like a kind of cement holding the rocks together, is melting, meaning they have no cohesion and they collapse,” he said.Vion opened his phone to show a message from another guide with pictures of a large rockfall near a mountain refuge at about 2,800 metres above Pralognan-la-Vanoise on Monday. “He was really shocked. He said he never expected it to happen there,” Vion said.“For several years now we have had to develop the ability to observe these phenomenon and spot the warning signs. In some cases we’ve had to totally modify our itineraries to reduce the risk to our clients. Even for us guides this is difficult and I worry about amateur climbers who don’t have the same mountain culture.”He said “of course” this was due to climate breakdown. “You’d have to be blind not to see it.

(The Scottish Green party is a separate entitity.) It is due to start at 6.15pm.There have been quite a few hustings already, andfour more are scheduled, but we have not covered the contest much on the Politics Live blog, and we certainly have not reported from a hustings. So tonight it is going to get full attention for two hours.The Greens are a smallish party, they normally hold leadership contests every two years, often it ends up as a co-leader job share and, because members have much more control over policy and other matters then they do in other parties, the leader or leaders have surprisingly little power. “The primary purpose of the Green party leader is to provide visionary leadership and direction for the party,” ishow the party explains it.But this contest is attracting more interest than most previous Green party leadership elections have. That is partly because the party is stronger than it has ever been before. It has four MPs at Westminster, more than 800 council seats and it is regularly picking up about 10% support in opinion polls.Where do they go next? That is the other reason why the contest deserves more attention, because the choice facing members is sharper, and spikier, than it normally is in a party with collegiate, herbivore instincts.On the one side,Adrian RamsayandEllie Chownsare running on a ‘more of the same [success]’ platform.

According to the health ministry in Gaza, 154 people have died of hunger since the start of the war, including 89 children.The Guardian view on famine in Gaza: the time for the west to act decisively is now | EditorialRead moreComplicating the issue, say other experts, is the fact that children weakened by malnourishment are vulnerable to other potentially fatal diseases, especially if they are living in the open and in unsanitary conditions.Underlying the risk for the young and those with other health complications, Marina Adrianopoli, a technical expert in the field of undernutrition at the World Health Organization, warned of the risk to “vulnerable children [who] do not have access to services for the prevention and management of acute malnutrition” a situation she said that can lead “to widespread diseases, malnutrition and starvation”.“Acute malnutrition is a life-threatening condition in its most severe form, which requires urgent treatment,” she said. “When a child suffers from severe acute malnutrition, especially when associated with medical complications, this child is at high risk of mortality.”Adrianopoli said: “Children with acute malnutrition need to be immediately identified and referred for the appropriate treatment which is needed for their survival. Childrenwith wastingare extremely vulnerable, their immune system is compromised, their susceptibility to infections increases rapidly. Saving their lives and averting avoidable mortality can only happen by providing adequate treatment.”Earlier this month, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported an alarming rise in malnutrition at its clinics, warning that 25% of the children and pregnant and breastfeeding women that it screened were malnourished, adding that cases of severe malnutrition in children under five hadtripled in just two weeks.Speaking on Wednesday from Deir al-Balah in Gaza, the MSF doctor Mohammed Fadlalla “categorically rejected the cynical and cruel narrative” that there is no hunger in Gaza.“Malnutrition is affecting everyone, the sick, the healthy and the old because no one is eating enough. But the people who are most affected tend to be the most vulnerable: children from zero-five, the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions like diabetes,” he said.The findings and testimony from MSF were amplified this week by the latest alert from the IPC, the UN food security monitor whose data collection and cautious deliberations on determining whether famine exists are regarded as the gold standard on the issue.AnIPC alert on Mondaywarned that two out of the three famine thresholds have now been breached in parts of Gaza, with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and Unicef warning that time is running out to mount a full-scale humanitarian response.The WFP said: “Food consumption – the first core famine indicator – has plummeted in Gaza since the last IPC Update in May 2025, with data showing that more than one in three people (39%) are now going days at a time without eating, meaning more than 500,000 people – nearly a quarter of Gaza’s population – are enduring famine-like conditions, while the remaining population is facing emergency levels of hunger.”It continued: “Acute malnutrition – the second core famine indicator – inside Gaza has risen at an unprecedented rate. In Gaza City, malnutrition levels among children under five have quadrupled in two months, reaching 16.5%. This signals a critical deterioration in nutritional status and a sharp rise in the risk of death from hunger and malnutrition.”The sense of urgency is driven by the fact that the impact of famine on the body proceeds slowly at first, then very rapidly as the body uses available fat before beginning to break down muscle cells, which release chemicals, including potassium, chloride and sodium, and cellular debris into the bloodstream, rapidly triggering more serious health issues, including severe malnutrition in young children.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has tried to suggest untruthfully there is “no starvation in Gaza”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaFamineIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This effect can properly be regarded as an indirect consequence of the proscription order.”He continued: “I consider it reasonably arguable that the proscription order amounts to a disproportionate interference with the article 10 and article 11 (European convention of human rights) rights (freedom of expression and assembly, respectively) of the claimant and others.”The group’s co-founder, Huda Ammori, called it a “landmark decision … especially at a time when protesters – mostly elderly citizens – are being dragged off in police vans,held in detention for more than 24 hours, having their homes raided and face criminal prosecution, simply for holding signs that they oppose genocide and expressing their support for Palestine Action”.More than 200 people are believed to have been arrested since the 5 Julyban on Palestine Action, the first on a direct action group, placing it alongside the likes of Islamic State and Boko Haram.The three-day hearing in November will increase scrutiny on the decision-making of the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, and casts uncertainty over the fate of those recently arrested under the Terrorism Act in relation to Palestine Action – or who might be arrested in future.The Home Office had argued that the proper forum for Palestine Action to challenge the ban was the POAC (Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission), which parliament had designated precisely for that purpose, rather than judicial review.But Chamberlain said POAC would be unlikely to be able to hear the case before the middle of next year whereas a judicial review could be heard this autumn and there was a strong public interest for it to be determined authoritatively as soon as possible.Otherwise, people charged with criminal offences under the Terrorism Act might seek to challenge the legality of the proscription order in courts that might reach different decisions, creating “a recipe for chaos”, he said.The second ground on which Chamberlain granted permission for judicial review, in addition to concerns about freedom of speech and protest, was that Cooper had not consulted Palestine Action before proscribing it, finding it reasonably arguable that there was a duty to consult.The judge refused Ammori permission to challenge the government on six other grounds, including a claim that the home secretary had failed to gather sufficient information on Palestine Action’s activities or the impact of the proscription on people associated with the group.Chamberlain referred in his judgment to the “deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza”. He quoted froma joint statementlast week by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the foreign ministers of 27 other countries in which they said “the suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On one occasion, she decided to ban the group but reversed course two days later.She finally decided to ban the group on 20 June, hours after Palestine Action said its membershad broken into the RAF’s Brize Norton airbaseand defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.On 7 March, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), agovernment body based within MI5, produced a secret report. It concluded that the majority of Palestine Action’s activities would not be classified as terrorism on the grounds that the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added.Nonetheless JTAC concluded that Palestine Action should be banned, arguing that its protests had been escalating, citing three protests it said constituted acts of terrorism.Whitehall officials supported a ban too, but conceded that proscribing the group would be “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving series damage to property”.From late March officials recommended on a series of occasions that the group be banned, but Cooper made no firm decision, often requesting more information. On 14 May she backed the ban but two days later delayed implementing it as she wanted more details on Palestine Action’s recent activities.A Whitehall minute recorded that by 2.15pm on 20 June, Cooper had decided that Palestine Action was to be banned “at pace”.An application by Ammori’s lawyers to suspend the effect of the proscription order until the trial has taken place in November was rejected by Chamberlain. The judge also refused a request by the Home Office to bring an appeal over his decision about POAC.At last week’s hearing, lawyers for Ammori also highlighted the arrest of a man in Leeds for carryinga placard reproducing a graphic from Private Eyemagazine, which said: “Unacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes.

While the crisis has deepened, Israel’s military has continued its attacks, killing at least 48 people seeking aid in Gaza on Wednesday, according to the territory’s ministry of health.Children and elderly people most vulnerable as Gaza famine deepens, warn expertsRead more“Twenty-one months in, these are token gestures. They’re theatrics, they’re designed from my perspective to deflect scrutiny. We’re being blocked and delayed at every turn,” said Bushra Khalidi, the policy lead at Oxfam, commenting on the new Israeli aid measures.Most of the crossings into Gaza are still not in use. The UN has called for a full ceasefire and for Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the territory to urgently address the hunger crisis.The number of aid trucks that have been entering Gaza since the new measures were announced has increased, with more than 200 trucks entering on Tuesday, according to Israeli customs authority (COGAT). This equates to about 70 trucks entering daily on average since May.However, the number of aid trucks still falls far below the 500-600 trucks the UN has said is necessary to sustain the 2 million residents of Gaza. Some aid agencies have suggested the true scale of need is now far greater than 600 trucks, given that Gaza is now facing famine.“The needs are exponentially greater than they were prewar. But the access is actually worse. Starvation cannot be solved by 10 or even 300 trucks. What’s needed isn’t piecemeal fixes, but actual systemic changes,” Khalidi said.Residents and medical professionals said they have yet to feel a change to their daily conditions, with malnutrition continuing to grip the territory.Ariel view of convoy“We are hearing a lot of news that more aid will come, but this is just in the media. The situation on the ground has not changed since Sunday. The food supply has not reached the target population,” said Dr Nouraldin Alamassi of theProject Hope NGOmedical team in Gaza.He added that malnourished children continue to come to his clinic for food each day while his patient load is at double capacity, and that he has no remaining “high energy biscuits” used to treat malnutrition to give them.Despite the announcement of increased aid measures, humanitarians working at international organisations have said that behind the scenes, new bureaucratic obstacles continue to be thrown up that prevent them from importing aid into Gaza.These include the new registration process for international NGOs, which requires non-UN aid organisations to register with the newly established Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.As part of the registration process, INGOs have been asked to submit identification details of their Palestinian staff, which most are refusing to do as they fear it will have implications for the staff’s safety in Gaza and the West Bank.They point to the high number of humanitarians killed by Israel in Gaza as an indicator of the risk involved in providing information about their staff to Israel. It is unclear if Israel will allow them to register without providing that information.Some INGOs that have yet to receive their registration from the new Israeli ministry have had their imports into Gaza delayed indefinitely by Israeli customs, according to humanitarians familiar with supply chain logistics in Gaza and have had their own imports delayed.They fear customs officials will not allow them to import goods into Gaza without being registered in Israel, jeopardising their ability to send aid into the besieged territory.“While the clear violations on the ground in Gaza has a major impact on public opinion, the violations of access via bureaucracy don’t have the same impact on people because it’s boring and complicated. But this is what is stopping aid from getting in,” a humanitarian who works in Gaza aid supply chain management said anonymously as they were not allowed to talk to media.Asking for clarification from the customs body has not yielded any answers, something the humanitarians said was part of a “deliberate policy” to make bringing aid into Gaza as complicated as possible. Explanations from customs officials for rejected or delayed aid imports into Gaza was rare, they said, leaving humanitarians to try to guess what was allowed in.The humanitarian said dates and olives were consistently thrown out by Israeli customs official without explanation. After pooling their experiences with other aid groups, they realised the common denominator was fruits or vegetables with pits or seeds that could be planted.Later shipments that contained date paste and pitted olives were let in the territory successfully.Neither COGAT nor the Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism responded to a request for comment.While the new aid measures announced by Israel were a start, some UN officials said that if viewed holistically, aid access was still nowhere near what is needed.“It’s always give with one hand, take away with the other,” said Sam Rose, the acting director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesAidUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Had he been in power during World War II, would he have advocated recognition for Nazi control of occupied countries like Holland, France or Poland?“This is not diplomacy – it is a moral failure. Shame on you, prime minister.“As a dual British-Israeli citizen who survived 471 days in Hamas captivity, I am deeply saddened by Prime Minister Starmer’s decision to recognise Palestinian statehood. This move does not advance peace – it risks rewarding terror. It sends a dangerous message: that violence earns legitimacy.”Damari was shot in the leg and hand when she was dragged from her home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October 2023. She was taken from the safe room of her house with her friends Ziv and Gali Berman, twin brothers who are still being held in Gaza.Since her release as part of a ceasefire deal, Damari has campaigned for the release of about 20 hostages believed to be still alive and for the bodies of about 30 dead hostages to be returned to their families.In a separate statement, Adam Rose and Adam Wagner, who have represented relatives of hostages who are either British or have close British ties since7 October 2023, said the UK had made the hostages a “bargaining chip”. They said: “The risk is that Hamas will continue to refuse a ceasefire because if it agrees to one this would make UK recognition less likely.”The families they represented had asked Starmer to “confirm, unambiguously, that Hamas will not be rewarded and that the UK will not take any substantive steps until all the hostages are free”.Starmer hopes ‘pathway to peace’ will end Gaza war. History is not on his sideRead moreThey added: “For almost two years, the British hostage families have encouraged the UK to use any leverage it has to help secure the release of their loved ones. They have sat in 10 Downing Street with successive prime ministers and foreign secretaries who have looked them in the eyes and promised the UK will do everything in its power to secure the immediate and unconditional release of their loved ones, whose detention is unambiguously a war crime.“We are concerned that the UK’s proposal risks delaying the release of the hostages. This is because the UK has said that it will recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees a ceasefire. But the risk is that Hamas will continue to refuse a ceasefire because if it agrees to one this would make UK recognition less likely.“The families are therefore deeply concerned that the UK’s approach risks disincentivising Hamas from releasing the hostages. This risks doing exactly what the prime minister’s statement says the UK will not do: reward Hamas for its heinous and illegal acts.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmerForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s very responsibly used, and that’s why most of the public support it.”Part of the Met’s overhaul will see officers moved to bulk up the force’s public order crime team, as the force said it has faced increased demand linked to protest-related crimes in the past two years.The squad will go from 48 to 63 officers due to a rise in the number of protests, particularly related to Israel and Palestine, as well as environmental issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Established in 2016 to tackle late payments, the watchdog will also be able to carry out spot checks, verify claims and impose deadlines to clear a backlog of disputes.As part of a widerLabourdrive to provide more support for small businesses, Reynolds will also announce startup loans for 69,000 companies worth £4bn “to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners”.The move is backed by the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is keen to focus on rebooting the economy after two consecutive months of negative growth andmounting speculation about tax rises.According to the Office for National Statistics, the economy contracted by 0.1% in May after a 0.3% monthly fall in April.Sir Keir said it was important for the government to support small- and medium-sized firms, which employ 60% of the workforce and generate £2.8tn in turnover.“From builders and electricians to freelance designers and manufacturers, too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best, growing their businesses.“It’s unfair, it’s exhausting and it’s holding Britain back. So, our message is clear: it’s time to pay up.”Reynolds is expected to say legislation will include maximum payment terms of 60 days before a reduction after an introductory period to 45 days, “giving firms certainty they’ll be paid on time”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, we’ve announced measures as part of our plan for change to tackle all of those issues and beyond.”Explore more on these topicsSmall businessJonathan ReynoldsRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourEntrepreneursnewsShareReuse this content"

The problems raised fears of arepeat of chaos at airportsin August 2023 when hundreds of thousands of passengers’ flights were delayed or cancelled.British Airways said it was forced to restrict the number of its inbound and outbound flights at Heathrow to 32 an hour until 7.15pm. It said the flow rate would then return to the usual level of 45 an hour.It is understood that the UK National Cyber Security Centre does not view it as a hacking incident.Ryanair called for the Nats chief executive, Martin Rolfe, to resign or be fired. The airline’s chief operating officer, Neal McMahon, said: “It is outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats.“Yet another ATC system failure has resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of passengers’ travel plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have been learned since the August 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence.”He said if Rolfe failed to resign then the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, “must act without delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of Nats’ shambolic ATC service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to endure these preventable delays caused by persistent Nats failures”.At about 5pm Nats said its engineers had “restored the system that was affected” and it was “in the process of resuming normal operations”.The technical issue affected flights across the UK as the number of aircraft that could fly in England and Wales was restricted, the company said.The problem left many aircraft and flight crew out of position. Airports advised passengers to check with airlines for updates. Liverpool’s John Lennon airport said that Wednesday’s remaining flights could face delays.Several flights scheduled to arrive at UK airports were required to fly in holding patterns or divert elsewhere. Nats said the technical issue was at its control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire.Alexander said: “I am aware of a technical issue which impacted Nats’ operations causing travel disruption this afternoon. I have been informed systems have now been restored but continued disruption is expected, and passengers should check with individual airports for advice.”More than 700,000 passengers suffered disruption when flights were grounded at UK airports on 28 August 2023 after Nats experienced a technical glitch while processing a flight plan.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They include:Jon Farley, 67Retired teacherView image in fullscreenJon Farley back home in Leeds after he was arrested for carrying a photocopied Private Eye cartoon at a rally.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFarley was picked up by police at a silent demonstration in Leeds for holding a sign that made a joke about the government’s proscription of Palestine Action taken from an issue of the fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye. He was arrested under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which he described as a “pretty terrifying and upsetting experience”. Farley, who had never been arrested before,told the Guardian: “I clearly wasn’t any kind of physical threat.” The Private Eye editor, Ian Hislop, said the arrest was “mind-boggling”.Marianne Sorrell, 80Retired teacherSorrell, from Wells, Somerset, was arrested for holding a placard at a pro-Palestine rally in Cardiff, and she was held by police for almost 27 hours, during which officers forced their way into her house and searched it. She said officers removed 19 items from her home, including iPads, a Palestinian flag, books on Palestine, material related to Extinction Rebellion and the climate crisis, as well as drumsticks for – and a belt that holds – her samba drum. “At 80, to be treated like a dangerous terrorist is deeply shocking.

This is about freedom of speech,” hetold Cornwall Live. He added: “We’re not advocating for Palestine Action. We’re resisting the proscription of Palestine Action. We’re resisting the politicised use of terror laws to suppress a non-violent campaign of sabotage. We’re resisting the criminalisation of peaceful protest because it’s already being used to intimidate and threaten people just for having Palestine flags.”Explore more on these topicsCounter-terrorism policyProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Imports fromSouth Korea, a powerhouse exporter of computer chips, cars and steel, faced a 25% rate.“I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea,” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday.The South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, said on Thursday the deal would put South Korea on an equal or better footing compared with other countries.‘Terrible fuel efficiency, no right-hand drive’: why trade deal won’t warm up Japan to American carsRead moreLee also said the countries had agreed to set up a $350bn investment fund, out of which $150bn was aimed at a shipbuilding partnership.In a statement posted to Facebook, Lee called the deal “the first major trade challenge” since his administration took power in June, adding: “We have overcome a major hurdle.”“Through this deal, the government has eliminated uncertainty surrounding export conditions and ensured that US tariffs on our exports are either lower than or equal to those imposed on our major trade competitors,” Lee said.The 15% rate is equivalent to levies determined fromUS trade deals with Japanandthe European Union.Trump had said that as part of the arrangement, South Korea would invest $350bn in the US in projects selected by him and purchase $100bn of liquefied natural gas and other energy products.It was not immediately clear how the investment deals would be structured or over what time frame. Trump said additional investments would be announced later.Lee would visit the White House “within the next two weeks” for a meeting with Trump, the US president added.He also said South Korea would accept American products – including cars, trucks and agriculture – into its markets and impose no import duties on them.The South Korean presidential office said that under the deal, the US would lower tariffs on South Korean-made autos to 15%, from 25%. It also said computer chips and pharmaceutical tariffs imposed on the country’s US-bound exports would not be worse than other countries, and that South Korea’s rice and beef markets would not be open.South Korean finance minister Koo Yun-cheol, industry minister Kim Jung-kwan and minister for trade Yeo Han-koo had been in Washington for talks with senior US officials and were believed to have met with Trump shortly before the deal announcement.Pressure had been mounting on South Korea since Japan clinched a deal to cut Trump’s threatened tariffs to 15% earlier this month.Amid the last-minute push by government officials to reach a tariff deal, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics inked a $16.5bn chip deal with Tesla.South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution also signed a $4.3bn deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.In contrast with the 15% tariff for South Korea, Trump on Wednesday also placed25% tariffs on imports from Indiaand50% on those from Brazil.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSouth KoreaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The icing on the cake: a promise of up to $50,000 in signing bonuses.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement campaign, which rolled out late Tuesday, recalls recruiting posters from the second world war with images of Uncle Sam and the words “AMERICA NEEDS YOU.” There also are photos of the US president and top homeland security officials with the words “DEFEND THE HOMELAND” across the images.“Your country is calling you to serve at ICE,” said homeland security secretaryKristi Noemin a news release. “This is a defining moment in our nation’s history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.”In addition to appealing to prospective applicants’ patriotic fervor, homeland security is making a pocketbook pitch. The agency is promising up to $50,000 in signing bonuses, the potential for lots of overtime for deportation officers and other benefits such as loan repayment or forgiveness options.All of this is made possible by a big infusion of money to Ice.The package of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law this month includes about $170bn for border security and immigration enforcement, spread out over five years.Ice is set to get $76.5bn, nearly 10 times its current annual budget. About $45bn will go toward increasing detention capacity. Nearly $30bn is for hiring 10,000 more staff so the agency can meet its goal of 1m annual deportations.New hires include deportation officers responsible for tracking down, arresting and removing people who the administration determines no longer have the right to remain in the United States.Under the Republican president, those officers are high-profile roles – making arrests at immigration courts, in the streets and at businesses. They often are criticized by immigration activists and Democratic lawmakers forwearing maskswhile carrying out their duties.On the recruitment webpage, the link to learn more about applying to be a deportation officer shows a photo of an armored vehicle rolling down a street with officers in military gear hanging onto the sides of the vehicle.The government is also seeking criminal investigators and lawyers who will prosecute immigration cases.The agency said it will advertise at college campuses, job fairs and law enforcement networks starting this week. But the recruiting drive has raised concerns about what happens if the agency grows too fast.Ice staffing has long been an issue, said Jason Houser, a former agency chief of staff during the Biden administration.At the beginning of theTrump administrationthere were roughly 6,000 officers within Ice tasked with monitoring noncitizens in the country, then finding and removing those not eligible to stay.Those staffing numbers remained largely static over the years even as the caseload ballooned. During the Biden administration, when the number of people arriving at theUS-Mexico borderskyrocketed, Ice workers were often pulled from their regular duties to go to the border.“Ice does need more employees to handle the volume of what they’re handling,” Houser said.But he is concerned about whether the rush to increase staffing could mean lower standards for recruits and training.The border patrol’s rapid expansion during the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. To meet hiring goals, training and hiring standards were changed. Arrests for employee misconduct rose.“If they start waiving requirements there like they did for border patrol, you’re going have an exponential increase in officers that are shown the door after three years because there’s some issue,” he said. At the same time, Houser noted the Department of Homeland Security has dismantled some of the key agencies that have provided some level of oversight over Ice and other DHS arms.Ice is about to become the biggest police force in the US | Judith LevineRead moreHouser estimated it would take three to four years to actually hire and train that number of new Ice staffers. In the meantime, he worries that Ice will rely on private contractors, national guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 arrests a day.Chuck Wexler is the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which studies policing issues. He said police departments across the country have struggled to maintain staffing since the pandemic and the fallout from the death ofGeorge Floyd, and are often offering hiring bonuses as a result. He’s seen bonus offers ranging from $10,000 to as much as $60,000 or $70,000 for departments on the west coast.But he said the $50,000 topline bonus that DHS is offering is definitely on the high end, and homeland security’s hiring spree could end up having repercussions on police departments across the country if their officers try to get hired by Ice.“The environment for hiring law enforcement has never been more competitive,” he said. “This could conceivably impact state and local agencies. You could have someone leaving a police department to get a $50,000 signing bonus with DHS.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemRepublicansUS-Mexico bordernewsShareReuse this content"

While this could be enough to double the world’s renewable energy capacity from 2022, to reach 7.4 terawatts (TW) by 2030, governments would fall well below the 11TW needed to meet the UN goal of tripling renewables, according to the analysts.“Tripling global renewables capacity by 2030 is the single biggest action this decade to stay on track for the 1.5C climate pathway,” the report said. “Yet, despite the landmark Cop28 agreement to reach 11,000GW of renewables by 2030, national targets remain largely unchanged and fall short of what is needed.”The report found that beyond the EU only seven countries have updated their renewable energy goals since the pact was signed, including Mexico and Indonesia, which have watered down their targets.Countries that have failed to act include the US, China andRussia, which are some of the world’s largest energy users and together are responsible for almost half of the world’s annual carbon emissions.The fate of the world’s renewable energy deal may depend on the actions of Beijing, which is expected to finalise its 15th five-year plan for energy later this year, covering the period 2026-30. Washington and Moscow do not have renewable energy targets for 2030, and according to Ember their political leadersare not expected to set any.In India, clean energy targets have also remained unchanged, but the country’s ambition to build 500GW of renewables by 2030 is already aligned with the global goal to triple renewable energy capacity, the thinktank added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes Brown thethird Ivy League schoolto reach a resolution with the federal government this month.Under the terms of the agreement, Brown will commit to nondiscrimination in both admissions and campus programs, and will grant federal officials access to its admissions data. The arrangement brings to an end investigations led by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Justice.Astatementfrom the institution said that the “voluntary agreement will reinstate payments for active research grants and restore Brown’s ability to compete for new federal grants and contracts, while also meeting the core imperative of preserving the ability for our students and scholars – both domestic and international – to teach and learn without government intrusion”.The agreement between Brown and Trump does not require the university to admit any wrongdoing. And unlike Columbia University, whichagreed to paya $200m settlement, Brown’s deal does not involve any financial penalty. The email stated that “the government does not have the authority to dictate teaching, learning and academic speech”.The education secretary, Linda McMahon, had previously described the Columbia settlement as a “roadmap”, predicting it would “ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come”.In addition to a pledge to “reaffirm compliance with nondiscrimination laws” in admissions and programs, the deal also prevents Brown from administering gender-affirming surgeries to minors or prescribing puberty blockers.The university has also agreed to implement the Trump administration’s definitions of male and female (as outlined in a January executive order) for women’s athletics, student programs, campus facilities and housing.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS educationHigher educationUS politicsRhode IslandnewsShareReuse this content"

Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed by Trump, wanted rates to be lowered. Both have been floated as potential replacements for Fed chairJerome Powell.Data released on Wednesday underlined the resilience of theUS economy, which bounced back faster than expected in the second quarter. USgross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to the latest official data, ahead of the average 2.5% forecast from economists.This marked a significant acceleration from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which was dragged down by a surge of imports as companies tried to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs. But the rebound was boosted by a 30% slump in imports.Trump used the news to once again call for a rate cut and again insulted Powell, whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”. “2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED! ‘Too Late’ MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!” he wrote onTruth Social.Speaking after the rate decision, Powell said that it was still unclear how tariffs would affect prices.Chart of quarterly GDP“Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,” Powell said.It’s possible, he added, that tariffs cause just a one-time price increase. But he warned that inflation could be more persistent.“What we see now is, basically, the very beginnings of whatever the effects turn out to be on goods inflation,” said Powell. “They may be less than people estimate or more than people estimate. They are not going to be zero. Consumers will pay some of this. Businesses will pay some of this. Retailers will pay some of this.”The Fed’s federal open market committee (FOMC) has eight opportunities a year to change interest rates during its scheduled two-day meetings. While the FOMC decreased rates three times in the fall, bringing them down a full percentage point, it left rates unchanged after its last five meetings. Interest rates currently sit at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.Trump is partly to blame for the pause in rate cuts. Fed officials say that the economy has become too unstable to change rates. The Fed has to strike a delicate balance between its “dual mandate”, keeping both unemployment and inflation low. Though the economy was strong at the beginning of the year, Trump’s long slate of tariffs have started to creep into prices, bringinginflationup from 2.3% in April to 2.7% in June.But that has not stopped the president from trying to bully Powell into lowering rates. Over the last few weeks, Trump and other members of his administration have zeroed in on building renovations taking place at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, which have ballooned in costs over the years.The Fedsayscosts have increased due to the nature of the renovations, which focus on two buildings that have not seen major renovations since the 1930s, but Trump has been trying to frame the renovations as extravagant waste.Last week, the president donned a hard hat and made a rare visit to the Fed to make a point about the renovations. During remarks to the press, the typically composed Powell appeared visibly irritated as Trump criticized the renovations. During the briefspat, Trump claimed that the renovations cost $3.1bn, though an annoyed Powell pointed out that Trump was including the renovation of a different Fed office building that was completed five years ago.When asked by reporters if he is still considering ousting Powell, Trump said he doesn’t “think it’s necessary”.“I believe he’s going to do the right thing,” he said.On Wednesday, Powell told reporters that it was overall “a good visit”.“I will say we had a nice visit with the president. It was an honor to host him,” he said. “It’s not something that happens very often at the Federal Reserve to have the president come over, let alone to visit a building.”Explore more on these topicsUS interest ratesFederal ReserveTrump tariffsDonald TrumpJerome PowellInflationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!”Figures compiled by Washington show the US trade in goods with India were an estimated $129.2bn (£97bn) in 2024, making it the US’s 10th largest trading partner. The US goods trade deficit was worth $45.7bn.Shortly after announcing the tariffs on New Delhi, Trump said he had struck a deal with India’s neighbour and rival Pakistan to jointly develop its oil reserves.“Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India some day!” he posted on Truth Social.Trump’s criticism of India comes as heramps up pressure on Moscowamid growing frustration with Putin’s war in Ukraine. Trump had claimed before his inauguration in January that he would be able to end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Brazilian president faces decades in jail for allegedly plotting a military coup to stop Lula from taking office after the former lost the 2022 presidential election.On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order confirming that the US would impose 50% tariffs onBrazil. The order did not mention the previously-cited 1 August deadline, but indicated that the new duty would be enforced from next week.Ina rare interviewwith the New York Times, clearly designed to send a message to the White House on the eve of a potential trade war, Lula urged the US president to avoid creating a “lose-lose” relationship between two of the largest economies in the Americas and said he did not fear publicly criticizing Trump, whom he recently called an “emperor”.“There’s no reason to be afraid. I am worried, obviously, because we have economic interests, political interests, technological interests. But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country. Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country,” said Lula, who has enjoyed a bounce in the polls after Trump’s threat.Lula indicated his officials were willing to negotiate economic issues with the US: “In politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail. We always need to find the middle ground. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest and shouting about things you can’t deliver, nor by bowing your head and simply saying ‘amen’ to whatever the United States wants.”But Brazil’s president indicated that the political future of Bolsonaro – whose plotallegedly included plans to assassinate Lula– was a judicial matter and therefore non-negotiable. “Brazil has a constitution, and the former president is being tried with a full right to a defense,” Lula insisted.The 79-year-old leftist said his message for Trump was “that Brazilians and Americans do not deserve to be victims of politics, if the reason President Trump is imposing this tax on Brazil is because of the case against former President Bolsonaro”.Trump’s decision to cite Bolsonaro’s plight as one of the main justifications for his move against Brazil has left many observers doubting that the “Trump always chickens out” (Taco) maxim will apply to the Friday deadline facing Lula’s government. The US president has likened Bolsonaro’s “disgraceful” treatment to attempts to prosecute him after he unsuccessfully tried to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. Bolsonaro has denied plotting a coup but has admitted seeking“alternative ways”of stopping Lula from taking power.“I’d be very surprised if Trump pulled back in this case, not just because of his friendship with the Bolsonaro family … but above all because in Trump’s mind it reflects his own trauma,” the American Brazil specialist Brian Wintertoldthe Estado de São Paulo newspaper this week.Lula hinted he believed a retreat might be possible, comparing the current situation to unfounded fears over the millennium bug.“Do you remember when we were about to turn from 1999 to 2000, and there was worldwide panic that the computer systems were going to crash? Nothing happened,” said Lula, although he admitted he could not be certain “nothing will happen”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilTrump tariffsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpJair BolsonaroTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Delta said in its statement that the airline has “zero tolerance for unlawful behavior of any kind but will decline to comment further on this pending litigation”.According to the Brewers’ lawsuit, on 19 July 2023, the couple and their children traveled on a Delta flight from Charleston to New York City’s John F Kennedy international airport. They took a connecting flight from there to London, where they realized one of the children had forgotten an Apple iPad stored in a case featuring the children’s cartoon characterPeppa Pigbecause Brooke Brewer began receiving random text messages about the tablet.Brooke Brewer used Apple’s Find My app to track the iPad’s location and determined it was in New York City. The person with the iPad had logged out of Brooke Brewer’s account but was taking photos that were still being uploaded to her Apple iCloud account.At first, the photos were relatively unremarkable: selfies of a man in his Delta uniform with his name badge visible. The Brewers filed a lost and found report with Delta by 20 July 2023, they recounted in their lawsuit.But a little more than a month later, pornographic videos of the same man from the prior images showed up in Brooke Brewer’s iCloud account. They depicted him masturbating in his Delta uniform while wearing his name badge, the Brewers’ lawsuit said.A second lewd video of the man in his Delta uniform – again wearing his name badge – appeared in Brooke Brewer’s iCloud account within days, the lawsuit continued. The Brewers also learned that the man had managed to access Brooke’s iTunes account and create his own personal profile.Furthermore, the man – who is not named in the lawsuit – had used the iPad to hack into the Brewers’ Amazon account and created a profile titled “Gay” that one of the couple’s children detected and alerted them about, the couple alleged.The Brewers said they filed a second report with Delta. The major airline – who did not acknowledge the first of the reports – responded with a generalized, “no reply” email saying it was searching for the iPad, the lawsuit asserted.“We would have hoped, if not publicly, at least personally they would have acknowledged their role and responsibility for what happened to this family,” Familoni said, referring to Delta, in an interview Tuesday.Familoni said the Brewers ultimately filed their lawsuit because Delta “unfortunately didn’t do that”.“We hope that Delta will step up and take responsibility, speak to the family, and acknowledge their wrongdoing,” Familoni said.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaUS justice systemLondonAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

That rate came into force at one minute past midnight on 30 June, the final day of the second financial quarter.Aston Martin Lagonda manufactures all its cars in factories in Gaydon, Warwickshire, and St Athan, south Wales. It shipped 328 cars to dealers in the Americas between April and June but the majority were sent on 30 June. It was a “mammoth task”, Hallmark said. “This left us with 24 hours to invoice the entire quarter’s-worth of vehicle sales in the US.”The one-day scramble illustrates the tariff turmoil causing headaches for goods exporters around the world. Aston Martin revealed that it had raised prices for US customers by 3% to absorb some of the hit from the border taxes.View image in fullscreenAston Martin’s Valhalla on display in Tokyo.Photograph: Jun Sato/WireImageGetting the cars to dealers early would have meant a big financial blow from absorbing the higher tariff rate, while late arrivals that missed the quarter-end would have meant reporting a big slump in sales.So Aston Martin decided to send hundreds of cars to bonded warehouses in the US – where goods can be stored without being subject to tariffs – before delivery firms raced to get them all to dealers before the end of day on 30 June. Those cars attracted the 10% rate, rather than 27.5%.Other carmakers face higher costs. The EU reached a deal with the US to cut tariffs on most goods including cars to 15%. Mercedes-Benz boss Ola Källenius said he did not expect any improvement on that for the car industry, despite lobbying for a lower rate from Germany’s carmakers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British companies exported just over 100,000 cars to the US last year, with the bulk being Range Rovers shipped by JLR.The quota could mean an end-of-year race between British carmakers to get their vehicles into the country, with “pressure on the number of slots available on the 100,000 quota”, Hallmark said.Explore more on these topicsAston MartinAutomotive industryManufacturing sectorTrump tariffsTariffsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The plan so far – levies on Mexican-made cars, steel, aluminum, metal parts and tomatoes. And they are pondering the push by the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, to overhaul the country’s judiciary in ways critics say undermine legal certainty and could roll back democratic gains.No wonder they are increasingly unsure how to proceed. Plans to launch new operations inMexico– or expand existing ones – are being reconsidered, postponed or quietly shelved.The economic effects increasingly rattle trade and investment decisions all along the US-Mexico border, gnawing at executives’ confidence and potential job growth. Long-term planning proves all but impossible, say business leaders and economic experts.Trump’s tariffs to face major court test brought by US small business ownersRead more“Foreign investment is probably lower than it otherwise would have been at this point in the year,” said Tom Fullerton, an economics and finance professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. “It is still not clear whether the Trump administration is going to allow the USA to remain in USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the free trade agreement negotiated under Trump’s first presidency].”“It is also not clear how the judicial landscape will change within Mexico.”With many US and Mexican businesses closely linked, the effects of the policy changes echo across the borderlands. US-Mexico bilateral trade reached an estimated $840bn in 2024.Already, about 65,000 jobs have been lost in Juárez alone, due to a myriad of factors, including increased factory automation, said Jerry Pacheco, president and CEO of the Border Industrial Association.“We’ve lost at least three deals since the steel and aluminum tariffs went up to 50% in Santa Teresa, so it creates an uncertain business environment,” Pacheco said. “The US and Mexico economies are so intertwined and depend on each other that if US companies are suffering because of steel and aluminum tariffs, Mexico is gonna suffer also.”The paralyzed decision-making threatens to weigh heavily on Mexico’s growth prospects – and on Sheinbaum’s legacy as the country’s first female president. The economy has already shown unmistakable signs of a sharp slowdown since late last year.No clear rebound is in sight here on the border or beyond.“Everything has been put on hold,” said Víctor González, owner of Solinda, a precision machine-manufacturing company based in the central Mexican state of Aguascalientes, referring to what he hears from colleagues and business associations. “One of the reasons is the reform of the judicial system. The other is tariffs.”Initially, Trump’s sweeping threats to slap tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports forced business owners to recalibrate their south-of-the-border investment strategies. The renewed economic boom Mexico was expected to enjoy – fueled by Trump’s hardline stance on Chinese imports – quickly fizzled.Rather than benefit from global supply chain shifts, both Mexico and Canada have found themselves caught in the trade-fueled crossfire. Rather than encouraging near-shoring, Trump decided to use tariffs as leverage to pressure both neighbors to crack down on the flow of migrants and drugs, particularly fentanyl.An indication of possible impacts could be General Motors’ June announcement of a $4bn investment in US factories in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee. That fits the company’s strategy to revive its US manufacturing footprint, which Trump has demanded.GM revealed that the Blazer and Equinox, sport utility vehicles that for years have been assembled in Mexico, will be built at plants in Tennessee and Kansas starting in 2027.GM has made vehicles in Mexico since the 1930s and its expanded production here was touted as an early victor for the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada in the early 1990s.The automaker’s move was hailed by the Trump administration as a major victory.“No president has taken a stronger interest in reviving America’s once-great auto industry than President Trump,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.The US administration’s message was clear to many observers – Mexico’s loss is the US’s gain, even if GM must shoulder higher production costs and it could lead to higher prices for consumers.Though threats eased as the year has proceeded – after Canada and Mexico announced border taskforces and deployed more security personnel – investor confidence has been shaken.Now, Sheinbaum has realized her predecessor’s dream of radically reshaping Mexico’s judiciary, to the benefit of their all but hegemonic Morena political party. A scarcely attended election in June – turnout was just 11% – replaced career judges, magistrates and supreme court justices with those chosen by popular vote.Many fear that consolidating control over the courts will erode institutional checks and balances. With judgeships and other judicial posts dominated by ruling party loyalists, arbitrary or ideologically driven rulings may flourish, critics fear. All nine newly elected supreme court justices have ties to Sheinbaum, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or their left-leaning party.“What investors are looking for is certainty and rule of law,” said Tony Garza, US ambassador to Mexico under the George W Bush administration who now works on trade and other issues at White and Case, a law firm. “What they’re getting with tariff threats and judicial elections is chaos and incompetence.”Many business leaders, economists and credit-rating agencies fear the country is veering back toward the one-party rule that dominated Mexican politics for most of the 20th century. Mexican politics have been stumbling along since democracy was introduced in 2000.The judicial reform could “negatively affect the investment appetite and business environment”, Fitch Ratings warned in a report last year. That echoed similar concerns voiced by S&P Global and Moody’s, the world’s other two largest credit-rating agencies.The economic headwinds are already building, with trouble signs on the border. Fullerton said unemployment rose from 2.2% in 2022 to 3.3% in 2024.Across Mexico, with an annualized 2.7% economic contraction in the final quarter of 2024 and tepid 0.8% growth in this past winter, labor and public sentiment indicators also paint a troubling picture.The private sector added little more than 85,000 new jobs between January and June – or more than two-thirds fewer than in the same period last year. That’s the lowest job creation since 2009, not counting the effects of the Covid pandemic, according to the Mexican social security institute.Consumer sentiment in June fell to a two-year low, while business confidence fell for the 14th month in a row said recently the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi).While overall foreign direct investment (FDI) remains positive, the inflow of new capital has all but stalled. Of the $21.3bn in FDI Mexico received in the first quarter of 2025, just $1.58bn – or 7.4% – represented fresh investment projects.“The truth is, the way things are going – and with recent events like the judicial reform – many are saying this isn’t going to be good,” added González, the factory owner. “That’s more or less the feeling everywhere. Right now, it’s a perception, not yet a reality.”That new foreign investment is well below the six-year average of 29% recorded during López Obrador’s administration, and it pales in comparison with the nearly 60% share of new capital the country registered at the beginning of this century.At a recent meeting with business and political leaders from the Texas Lyceum, a non-profit, non-partisan statewide leadership organization, the newly arrived US ambassador, Ron Johnson, was put on the spot with the following question: What is the “purpose” of Trump’s tariffs? After a long pause, Johnson responded, Trump “is a businessman”, he said.As Trump’s tariff regime becomes clear, Americans may start to foot the billRead moreJust in the state of Texas, Mexican trade totaled $540bn in 2024.“I sincerely believe … he just wants things to be fair, reciprocal,” said Johnson, who said he was a “good friend” of the president. “He wants competition to exist on a level playing field.”Amid an awkward silence the moderator stepped in to thank the ambassador. Polite applause followed.This story was co-published withPuente News Collaborative, a bilingual non-profit newsroom, convener and funder dedicated to high-quality, fact-based news and information from the US-Mexico border.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpGeneral MotorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The decision comes less than two weeks after Sharpe settled a lawsuit filed by a former girlfriend who accused him of rape, allegations he forcefully denied.The Athleticwas first to reportthe move on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. ESPN declined to comment publicly, and no formal announcement has been made.Indiana’s Sophie Cunningham inks podcast deal as off-court profile soarsRead moreSharpe, 57, had not appeared on ESPN since late April, shortly after the suit was filed in Nevada. At the time, he called the accusations “false and disruptive” and said he expected to return in time for the start ofNFLtraining camps. Instead, ESPN quietly opted to move on.The lawsuit, filed by a woman identified as Jane Doe, sought $50m in damages for what she described as “pain and suffering, psychological and emotional distress, mental anguish, embarrassment and humiliation”. Sharpe characterized the claims as a “shakedown”, maintaining that their sexual relationship had been consensual.The suit was dismissed with prejudice on 18 July following a private settlement. The woman’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, announced the resolutionin a post on X, writing, “All matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed.” A dismissal with prejudice means the same claim cannot be refiled in court. No criminal charges were filed against Sharpe.A three-time Super Bowl champion and four-time All-Pro, Sharpe retired in 2003 as the NFL’s all-time leader among tight ends in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. Since leaving football, he has become one of the most recognizable personalities in sports media, first as an analyst for CBS, then as co-host of Fox Sports 1’s Undisputed alongside Skip Bayless.After departing FS1 in 2023, Sharpe joined First Take as a twice-weekly sparring partner for Stephen A Smith. He also hosts two popular podcasts, Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Ocho, the latter alongside former NFL receiver Chad Ochocinco. Both shows are currently distributed by The Volume, though that agreement is set to expire at the end of August.According to Front Office Sports and the Athletic, Sharpe was in talks for a major podcasting deal – potentially worth up to $100m – before the lawsuit became public.

According to prosecutors, Arenas rented out the mansion for poker games and instructed an associate to stage the venue, recruit hosts and collect rent on his behalf.Those games, authorities said, were not ordinary house poker nights. The gatherings featured ‘Pot Limit Omaha’ and other formats with players charged a rake, either a cut of each pot or a flat fee per hand. Prosecutors allege the events were staffed with chefs, armed guards, valets and young women who served drinks, provided massages and offered companionship in exchange for tips. The women were reportedly required to pay a “tax” on their earnings to the organizers.The defendants arrested alongside Arenas were named as Yevgeni Gershman, 49, of Woodland Hills – described by prosecutors as an Israeli national linked to transnational organized crime – as well as Evgenni Tourevski, 48; Allan Austria, 52; Yarin Cohen, 27; and Ievgen Krachun, 43. All face charges of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and operating an illegal gambling business. Arenas is also charged with making false statements to federal investigators.Authorities say Gershman played a central role in managing the gambling operation, overseeing logistics and staff. Krachun is accused of working as a “chip runner”, tracking players’ wins and losses and paying employees.Gershman faces additional charges related to an alleged sham marriage designed to secure US residency. Prosecutors say he conspired with Valentina Cojocari, 35, of Woodland Hills, to submit fraudulent immigration documents and lied about his criminal background and gambling activity. Both face charges of marriage fraud, conspiracy and false statements on immigration forms. Cojocari was also arrested Tuesday.All eight defendants were scheduled to make their initial court appearances on Tuesday afternoon in downtown Los Angeles.If convicted, the defendants face up to five years in federal prison for each count. The case is being prosecuted by the US Attorney’s Office’s Transnational Organized Crime Section, with support from Homeland Security Investigations, the LAPD and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division.Arenas, who last played in the NBA in 2012, has remained a public figure through podcasting and commentary, often playing up his controversial persona. The indictment comes just months after the May release ofUntold: Shooting Guards, a Netflix documentary that spends considerable time recapping his tumultuous career. The film focuses on the infamous 2009 locker room incident involving Arenas and Washington Wizards teammate Javaris Crittenton, who brought guns into the team’s facility following a gambling dispute over a card game. Featuring interviews with both players, as well as former teammates and insiders, the documentary charts the fallout from the scandal, which led to suspensions, criminal charges and the eventual derailment of both men’s basketball careers.Near the end of the documentary, Arenas explains to the cameras how much he’s changed from his playing days. “Agent Zero, I’m no longer that dude,” Arenas said. “It’s scary, but as a parent, what I get to do now is instill everything I went through and say, ‘I fell into that hole, I did all these things, and I’ve learned from it so you can be better.’”Explore more on these topicsNBAWashington WizardsBasketballUS sportsLos AngelesShareReuse this content"

I’ve seen that pain and I know silence is deadlyRK RussellAs a former NFL player, I’ve seen up close what brain trauma can do. Shane Tamura’s final note echoed a familiar pain while showing how silence, access and neglect can killWed 30 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 05.21 EDTShareFour people lost their lives this week in a Manhattan office building, gunned down in a place I know well, by a man with a rifle and a three-page note blaming football and the brain diseases it allegedly left him with. One of the victims was an off-duty NYPD officer. Another was a Blackstone executive. All were innocent. All were just trying to make it home, and thanks to 27-year-old Shane Tamura, they never did.RK RussellI’ve walked through those NFL offices. I’ve sat in those rooms. I have friends who still work there, people I care about deeply. And on the other side, I’ve known people and lost people who havesuffered with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), not always to death, but to the isolation that comes with it and the slow unraveling of mind, body, and spirit. And I’ve lost people to gun violence. Too many of us have.So when I read that the shooter claimed to suffer from CTE, that he was trying to reach theNFLoffices and take revenge for what he believed the game did to his brain, though he never played on the professional level, I felt more than shock. I felt grief. I felt rage. I felt an urgency I can’t ignore, and neither should you.This tragedy isn’t just a story about one man. Even in the gunman’s three-page note found is his wallet, he referenced Terry Long, a former NFL player who died by suicide and was later confirmed to have CTE, it’s a warning about everything we still refuse to confront: how we treat brain trauma, how we ignore mental illness, how we arm the broken, and how silence, in football, politics, and culture, continues to kill.I know what it feels like to weaponize your own body.I played Division I football at Purdue and was later drafted to the Dallas Cowboys. I went on to play and start for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Buffalo Bills. I’ve lined up across Hall of Famers, driven my shoulder into men twice my size at ungodly speeds, and felt my own skull rattling in my helmet tackles after tackle and hit after hit. In football, that wasn’t cause for concern. That was cause for celebration. I often remember teammates from as young as high school to 12-year vets in the NFL often hiding their concussion symptoms to not lose time on the field, and too often, coaches and trainers encouraged, or at the very least, turned a blind eye to these circumstances. That’s not to say that for every indifferent coach or trainer, there weren’t a host of more diligent and careful ones to check in with them, but still, athletes slip through the cracks more often than not.We were conditioned to treat pain like performance fuel. If you could keep playing, you did. You’d tape it, ice it, pop a pill, and keep quiet. But there is no quick fix for the brain. We called it toughness. We called it loyalty. We called it team culture. But let’s be honest, it was silent, slow bleeding. And for some of us, it never stopped.I recall playing for the Buccaneers as a starter back in 2017, dislocating my shoulder, tearing my labrum and breaking part of my clavicle, only to take two weeks off, medicate, ice and rehabilitate, so that I could play the rest of the season, missing only one game. Each week, while my teammates were practicing for our next opponent and getting better at their craft, I was rehabbing my shoulder enough to be able to raise my arm on its own – never above my head, though – and play again that week, repeating my own self-torture. And I was thanked for it every week until it became expected of me by everyone in the organization. I was later cut in 2018 for that same injury, which had gotten substantially worse through playing.View image in fullscreenAt least six people were shot Monday and a police officer was killed when a suspected gunman unleashed gunfire inside a midtown Manhattan office building that houses the Blackstone investment firm and the headquarters of the NFL.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockCTE isn’t something you talk about in the locker room. It’s something you whisper about years later when a former teammate loses his marriage, disappears into depression, or dies by suicide, which I have personal accounts of. It’s something you fear will show up in your own life like a ghost or the boogeyman, in a burst of rage you can’t explain, in the way your memory blurs, in the quiet moment you wonder if your mind is slipping away.The man who opened fire in Manhattan didn’t play in the NFL. He played high school football over a decade ago. But the way he described his suffering in his final note, the way he named CTE, and the league, and begged for his brain to be studied: that language, that desperation, it’s familiar. I’ve heard it. I’ve lived adjacent to it. Some of my friends and former teammates’ lives have been ruined.What to know about the victims of the New York City skyscraper shootingRead moreNone of these are excuses for what he did. Let me be absolutely clear: the victims of this attack did not deserve what happened to them. Their families, their communities, and our country are left mourning yet another senseless act of violence. But if we don’t look at what led him there, the culture of silence around brain trauma, the lack of access to mental healthcare, the glorification of pain and masculinity in football, then we’re choosing ignorance. And ignorance has never saved a single life.For all its faults, the NFL at least has the awareness to ban finger guns and any gestures resembling violence from celebrations, yet our country remains hell-bent on not just refusing to ban real guns but actively loosening gun laws under the current administration.This wasn’t just about CTE. It was also about access. Shane Tamura drove across the country with a file in his car and pain in his chest. He crossed state lines, walked into a corporate building in Manhattan, and took four lives before taking his own. That kind of devastation doesn’t happen without a weapon in hand, and in this country, that weapon is far too easy to get.I’ve lost people to gun violence. People who looked like me. People whom I called uncle, brother, and friend. I could have been lost to the same fate, but I was lucky enough to have sports to escape into. Football, manhood and masculinity teach men to bottle up what hurts, and then America hands them a gun when they finally explode. There are more regulations on touchdown celebrations and social media content than on who gets to buy an AR-15.Grief and condolences are not enough. Not this time. Not anymore.The NFL has taken steps, but it’s time to double down at all levels. Mental performance and mental wellness can no longer be an afterthought in a sport built around pain. From the first padded practice in youth football to the final snap of a pro career, we need to talk openly about trauma, identity, support and care, as well as regular mental performance screenings. Not just for stars. For everyone.We also need to take along hard look at the laws that let people like Tamura move through this country with a weapon of war and no safety net. If CTE was the fuel, access to that rifle was the match. How many more lives have to be lost before our lawmakers act? Before mental health and gun access are treated as connected crises, not isolated talking points?I’m speaking up because silence has already cost us too much. I was lucky. I got out with my body and my voice. But I know players who didn’t. I know communities that didn’t.So remember the names of the victims. Officer Didarul Islam. Wesley LePatner. Aland Etienne. And one more soul whose name we will learn too late. Don’t reduce them to headlines. Don’t let the systems that failed them off the hook. And please, don’t look away.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew YorkUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

At one second to impact, Sisniega held out his hand and beckoned to his 20-year-old center back Manu Duah:come closer.A minute later, the newest – and riskiest – team inMLShad scored a winning goal.“Talk is cheap, I understand that,” San Diego’s head coach Mike Varas said when he was hired last year, before the expansion side had held a training session or even signed most of its squad, “but we’re going to be brave to play. When teams come to press us, we’re going to find solutions under the press.”True to his promise, Varas’s goalkeepers have refused to play it safe this season, launching just 8.6 percent of their open-play passes more than 40 yards. According to the stats site FBref, that’s not just an MLS record – it’s lower than Barcelona, Man City or any other team in Europe’s top five leagues going back at least as far as 2017-18.Like most leagues around the world, MLS is in the midst of a buildup boom. Phase of play data from the new live score appFuti, which I co-founded, shows the league taking 257 touches per game this season in the buildup, a phase defined approximately as controlled open-play possession in a team’s defensive half. That number has nearly doubled from 138 ten years ago.Still, no one in MLS comes close to San Diego’s 367 buildup touches per game in 2025. By some measures, they’re more committed to playing out of the back than any team on record.View image in fullscreenLine graph of buildup passes over time in MLS, with San Diego 2025 highlighted as an outlierIllustration: John Muller; FutiFrom a distance, San Diego’s style looks like a natural continuation of soccer’s decades-long arc toward more buildup play against increasingly disciplined high presses, a history written by the coaches Varas admires: Pep Guardiola, sure, but also Marcelo Bielsa, Maurizio Sarri, Roberto De Zerbi, Luis Enrique. “So many, so many,” he says. “I mean, I’m a football junkie.”But while those managers work with the best players in the world, San Diego started their very first preseason six months ago with a group of “30 strangers,” as Nashville’s head coach BJ Callaghan put it before last weekend’s game.For most MLS expansion teams, throwing together a team on a budget under byzantine roster rules means settling for a pragmatic playing style or none at all. At San Diego, the style came first. The club belongs to a network called Right to Dream, which began as a youth academy in Ghana, grew to include Denmark’s FC Nordsjaelland, and was bought by Egypt’s Mansour Group in 2021. The organization won an MLS expansion bid with San Diego to form a multi-club ownership group along with Egyptian women’s team FC Masar. As part of its focus on youth development, the group hasdeveloped a distinctive style of playthat emphasizes attracting pressure and playing quickly through tight spaces in the center of the pitch.“The idea is, how can we get the opponent to be attracted to the ball, to start to release and jump forward,” Varas said, “and then how do we recognize that moment and accelerate the play through them, around them or over them, depending on how they jump?”San Diego take specific risks to trigger the opponent’s high press, such as exchanging short “repeating passes” with a player facing away from goal or sending the ball back to the goalkeeper and then sideways or even backwards to a center back who drops all the way to the goalline. You can see both tactics in a plot of buildup pass types that the team attempts more than other MLS sides.View image in fullscreenEach color represents one of 60 possible pass types in the buildup phase that San Diego FC is more likely to attempt than league average. The plot shows a random sample of 20 of the teams passes of each type.Illustration: John Muller / Futi“Of course, the point is not to play passes back there. The point is to beat the opponent’s press, right?” Varas said. The payoff for these risky passes comes when San Diego can play out of pressure and find what they call a “breakthrough,” running downhill between the lines with the ball at the feet of their star wingers, Anders Dreyer and Hirving Lozano. Futi’s data shows that San Diego spend more time in the fast break phase of play than any team in the league, edging out Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The makeshift back four that beat Nashville averaged just 20 years old, almost certainly the youngest starting back line in MLS history. Even at full strength, San Diego rely on a rookie goalkeeper and two teenage fullbacks, a consequence of MLS rules that encourage teams to spend big on attackers and skimp at the back.“It was pretty interesting sitting in some of these Right to Dream meetings,” San Diego’s 33-year-old sporting director Tyler Heaps said, “explaining to them, ‘Look, we’re taking even more risk in MLS because we’re building up with our lowest-paid players against everybody’s highest-paid players, and we’re not giving the ball to our highest-paid players until it’s time to score goals.’”The key to finding bargains at the back was starting from Right to Dream’s style and role profiles. “We challenge our scouts not to watch exactly what the player is doing, but to try to find traits that exemplify what we want to do,” Heaps said. He used the example of the club’s just-turned 19-year-old left back, who joined from the developmental league MLS Next Pro. “Luca Bombino, in LAFC 2, was not playing the way that we played. But we saw a player that was very good in terms of solving situations under pressure.”Bombino has since thrived enough toreportedly attract a bid from West Brom, which was rejected.It helps that Heaps and Varas both worked for years at the US Soccer Federation, building a network of youth national team contacts who shared a love of buildup play. This summer San Diego have signed one teenage American after another, making up for the nascent club’s lack of academy players by collecting future USMNT prospects like Infinity Stones.“I’m not saying that I want the national team to play this exact way because I think in international football, it might be too risky,” Heaps said. “But I think a lot of the skills that we are teaching our players will help any team.”So far the risk-taking is paying off for San Diego, who sit top of the MLS Western Conference and are on pace to be the best expansion side in league history.“In our style of play, because we put the players in such uncomfortable positions, I think we develop quite brave players, right?” Varas said. “They have to solve a lot of tough situations. That helps develop players for the highest level.”Explore more on these topicsFootball tacticsMLSSan Diego FCUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is 8.53am at the La Finca resort on the Costa Blanca, about 30C and the warm-up has very much been and gone. This a six-minute all-out run. “They call it Mas because at the end you’re just praying for it to finish,” says a smiling Keith Hill, one of the referee coaches observing the session with Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer.Part of Webb wishes he had a time machine, so he could teleport here a minibus of referees at their peak in 2003, when he joined thePremier Leaguelist, to witness the evolution of training. Now they run approximately 12km a game and use technology such as Playermaker, straps that attach to boots and can read running gaits, track how quickly officials change direction and identify injuries. Scott Ledger, who has been an assistant referee on more than 500 Premier League games, is wearing boots fit for the occasion, Adidas Copa Mundials decorated with the Spanish flag. This is day three of a five-day pre-season camp but the Mas is the main event from a physical perspective.Premier League holds talks with Ifab over plans to introduce Ref Cams next seasonRead moreFor 63 officials, including 19 Premier League referees, all in identical navy kit, the exercise runs simultaneously in two waves on the upper and lower pitches. Two others are doing rehab on Wattbikes and a handful are missing owing to Club World Cup and Women’s Euro 2025 duty. Some officials here are on the PGMO’s development programme, including Elliot Bell, son of the former Accrington assistant manager Jimmy. At a glance it looks like an elite club at work, the giveaway the absence of balls or nets. “Players want to be in the starting XI, officials want to be in the starting 10 on the Premier League team sheet for that first match round,” Webb says.The aim? To run as far as possible and earn a place on the top-10 leaderboards on display. Those tables also show maximum velocity, with some officials hitting about 33km/h; last season Micky van de Ven was clocked as the fastest player in the Premier League at 37.12km/h, with Anthony Elanga and Bryan Mbeumo joint-second at 36.65km/h. Last season top-flight officials recorded almost 350km of runs of at least 20km/h.Bunce believes the gap between players and officials is shrinking. “You don’t want to be near the bottom of the list,” says Peter Bankes, the coming season his seventh as a top-flight referee. “We’re a team, in the trenches together at times, we can have good weekends and bad weekends. But we’re also striving for the big games, the big appointments, to go to tournaments, to do cup finals. There has to be that competitive edge. These weeks are perfect for that.”Bankes officiated about 75 matches last season. He refereed 30 games, 23 in the Premier League, and also had fourth official and VAR appointments, the latter at home and abroad. Building robustness is crucial. “We don’t want to just cope in games but perform,” says Matt Willmott, the PGMO’s lead performance coach. Hill, affiliated with PGMO for more than 30 years, says the aim is to establish unconscious competence regarding physical demands. “If you’re not worrying about those, you can focus purely on decision-making and it puts you in a better position,” says Wade Smith, who is heading into his fifth season as a Premier League assistant referee. “It goes hand in hand with being more accurate.”View image in fullscreenOfficials take part in weight training during pre-season training in Spain.Photograph: Phil GreigIs fixture congestion a problem for officials, too? “If you feel you’re tired and you need a bit of rest and recovery there are conversations to be had: ‘We can take you off the field, rest you altogether,’” says Bankes. “That probably didn’t happen years ago. Now I think people are much more professional to say: ‘Next week’s the one where I probably just need a little bit of a breather.’”Arne Slot introduced the Mas test at Liverpool last summer and Premier League players target at least 1,800m, a figure eclipsed by some referees. The officials did the test twice before flying to Spain but this one provides support staff with up-to-date metrics. “Twenty seconds [to go], let’s get every last metre out of you,” says Simon Breivik, the head of physical performance. “And hold it there,” says Elliot Fletcher, a sports scientist, triggering a kind of musical statues as the GPS numbers, from PlayerData, feed into his iPad. Officials make a beeline for Fletcher in pursuit of their scores, which, Bunce says, they can access via an app whether in Carlisle or Kazakhstan.“I really scrutinise my data,” says Bankes, grabbing a water bottle from the ice bucket. Lewis Smith, one of six officials on the supplementary list, which straddles the Premier League and EnglishFootball League, uses and hands out cold flannels and Andy Madley and Tony Harrington exchange high-fives. Those who have just finished, including Thomas Bramall and John Busby, turn supporters as the next batch begin. “Go on Akil [Howson], get to that next pole, final few metres,” says Willmott, the end near.Smoothies packed with fruit, spinach, whey protein and almond butter aid recovery. Is there a superfood? Cacao, says Vicky Smith, a senior sports scientist, because it is rich in magnesium: “We want to put premium fuel in premium engines.” Times have changed, body fats have plummeted. Not so long ago clubs offered referees Budweiser and pizza after matches. Steve Martin, whose father, Andy, and grandfather Geoff were top-flight officials, is happy after hitting 31km/h in a drill, a personal best. “I was up against one of the newer guys so I was thinking: ‘I need to beat him,’” says Martin, who predominantly referees in the Championship. “I haven’t been injured since I went professional [in 2016] – the right nutrition helps.”View image in fullscreenSenior sports scientists Vicky Smith leads the officials in stretching exercises.Photograph: Phil GreigSo, how is the Mas test known among officials? “We call it hell,” says Howson, grinning. It is approaching two years since Howson became the top flight’s first black official since Uriah Rennie, whose funeral Webb and several others attended on the Monday after their return. “We want to push each other to the end. It can be lonely out there as an official but we know how hard we work to get to those top standards. Now it is out of the way, there are a lot more smiles.”The Premier League, with a following of almost 2 billion, is the most-watched sports league in the world, and so many eyes mean an avalanche of opinion. The noise around decisions can be ceaseless. Officiating, Webb says, has never been so challenging. David Coote,the referee sacked by PGMOlast year after being found in “serious breach” of his contract, said he took cocaine as an “escape route … from the stresses, the relentlessness of the job”. Coote said struggles with his sexuality also contributed to“really poor choices”.“We had a difficult situation last year with one of our officials, part of the refereeing family and somebody we care about as a human being,” Webb says. “We know the job they do is done under a brighter spotlight than ever. There is undoubtedly a lower level of forgiveness … if someone doesn’t agree with a decision, then they’re not slow or shy to comment upon that. They have a vehicle now to do so and the way some people do that is pretty inappropriate. Because of the extra scrutiny, we have to ensure that officials are supported.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pelling explains how referees have scheduled one-on-one chats – “there isn’t an option to completely opt out because we want to normalise it” – but some naturally lean on professional help more frequently than others. Martin tells how he used it to “mentally park” a tough game last season. Visibility is important. “Rather than being boxed-off in a room that no one else can see and it’s this secret support service,” Pelling says, adding how “corridor conversations” help build rapport. “Asking someone a question as simple as: ‘How are you?’ You’re very aware that someone might go: ‘Actually, things aren’t going very well.’”Webb is clear. “Reaching out for help – because confidence is low or because of an issue at home or because you’ve made a decision that has created a lot of negative attention, which can be really quite tense – is not a sign of weakness or going to affect your appointments. We don’t want guys to suffer in silence and just think: ‘I’ll get through it.’”Refereesare higher-profile than ever. The officials are permitted to use social media but must adhere to guidelines. “We don’t want to celebritise referees, we want to humanise them,” Webb says.Criticism is commonplace. “If I had £1 for every time someone shouted: ‘You’re not in line, lino,’ I’d be a millionaire,” says Wade Smith. “You become hyper-focused on the game and it’s amazing how many people say: ‘Do you not hear all the people shouting behind you?’ A lot of the time, you don’t.” Madley, whose younger brother, Bobby, is also on camp, describes the job as a “peak and trough industry”, saying: “I’ve made decisions on a Saturday and I’ve had to question if I’m in the right shape and state of mind to referee again seven days later … There are times you feel low, you might have had a decision, game or games not going so well. You need that professional advice: ‘This is how we can get you back on the bike,’ whether it is after an injury or a decision you can’t shake off, because we do carry them quite heavily.”There is also something of a myth to bust. “It’s not necessarily just the bad times; you need them in the good times as well because you have to keep your feet on the floor,” says Bankes. “You are emotionally drained if a high-profile incident has not gone your way and that is where the psychological support is invaluable … you can really delve into your game and look into how you felt at the time afterwards and think: ‘How can I learn from that?’ When I was coming through the system, if I had a rough moment you were pretty much on your own and had to confide in your family. Now there is so much support in place.”It is 11am in a conference room and the PGMO’s technical director, Adam Gale-Watts, plays a music video of the rock band Toto, pausing just before Hold the Line hits the chorus. By that point most had cottoned on to the song choice. It is in these kinds of one-and-a-half-hour sessions where officials get to grips with new regulations. Hugh Dallas, a former referee and now coach, and Webb, take it in turns to stimulate debate and pose questions. Gale-Watts, a former assistant referee, runs through the eight-second rule for goalkeepers to release the ball, a further clampdown on time-wasting. “We’re looking for a sensible application,” says Dallas. Madley says they are training to make the countdown clear for teams and fans. Then there is the “captains-only” approach to major decisions, to prevent referees being swamped by players. “We’re not going to cut off all dialogue with other players,” Bankes says.The officials are shown contrasting examples of referees trying to defuse a confrontation and reminded of the importance of strong body language. Dallas reiterates the need to shut out the noise that comes with the territory. “In the penalty area, you need to hear silence,” he says. Webb, after a clip of a decision that divides the room, uses another analogy. “Look for the smoking gun,” he says.View image in fullscreenGPS numbers, from PlayerData, measures performance and can be accessed via an app.Photograph: Phil GreigLast season brought thepilot of stadium announcementsfor VAR decisions and semi-automated offside technology. VAR, introduced in the Premier League in 2019-20, continues to make a splash. Last season, an independent panel recorded 18 VAR errors, down from 31 in 2023-24. “I know it’s almost like a bellwether for how successful we are officiating,” Webb says.Webb highlights how other, subtler rule changes have increased demands. “Playing a goal-kick or defensive free-kick within your own penalty area,” he says, alluding to how the “high-risk, high-reward” of playing out from the back can quickly spark big decisions at both ends. “I could stand on the halfway line, wait for the aerial ball to land, watch for a [No] 9 on [No] 5 challenge ... is there an elbow, a push in the back? The game is wholly different now.”Matt Donohue is an EFL referee and Premier League VAR who progressed through a dedicated programme designed to widen the pool of VARs. “I understand how it can be seen as a moth to the flame,” he says of the VAR’s job. Is it hard to replicate the pressures of match-day, like a penalty shootout? “England have probably proven when they have taken practice seriously and purposefully … how much they improved in the Southgate era and we have replicated that. We’re having a positive impact – VAR errors are at an all-time low.”What is it like to be a Premier League official in this era? “On the school run on a Monday morning people know you as the referee,” Donohue says. Referees are rarely praised compared with those with whom they share a pitch. “People might think the prime minister should get a little bit of love for what he’s doing but I don’t think he sits there at night thinking he should,” Donohue says. “We’re doing the job we love.”Explore more on these topicsRefereesPremier LeagueFootball LeagueLaws of footballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Filip Djuricic opened the scoring with a header in the 53rd minute but moments after coming off the bench, Gassama, who scored from a substitute’s role on his debut last week, levelled at 1-1 with a stunning drive.Carlisle to Bosnia: Tyler Burey on an unlikely path to the Champions LeagueRead moreA remarkable start to the 21-year-old’s Rangers career took the heat out of the home side’s fightback, although Russell Martin should not be fooled. His side rode their luck for the second time againstPanathinaikos, who will rue a series of missed opportunities over the two games. Rangers set up a third qualifying tie against the Czech side Viktoria Plzen, who knocked out Switzerland’s Servette.Martin told Rangers’ official YouTube channel: “I’m so proud of the team, the group and the fans were incredible. It was a big night for us, so early on in the process of trying to be the team we want to be.“I don’t think it can be underestimated how difficult this tie and this night was and, especially after the first half, it was so difficult. But I think the players have come through a really tough time and I’m really proud of them.“And then we have a setback by conceding the goal and then we took the sting out of the game by scoring and responding really quickly, that’s not easy.“The fans were amazing and they stuck with us throughout and it’s been a really good night and we will get better. It’s so early on. There’s loads of growing to do and nights like this will definitely help the players grow.”In what was Martin’s first away game as Rangers manager and only his second in Europe, he kept the same side which started last week at Ibrox. Rui Vitória’s side were without suspended right-back Georgios Vagiannidis, sent off in Glasgow for picking up two yellow cards, and his place was taken by Giannis Kotsiras.The home side bossed and battered Rangers in the first half, starting in the fifth minute when midfielder Anastasios Bakasetas drove just wide from the edge of the box following another corner. In the 14th minute, Rangers’ dithering defender Max Aarons was robbed by former Manchester United man Facundo Pellistri, which left the attacker one-on-one with Butland and the goalkeeper brilliantly blocked the shot.Butland then made another terrific save from a close-range header by captain Fotis Ioannidis, who had beaten defender John Souttar to a great cross from Pellistri. Panathinaikos defender Erik Palmer-Brown headed a Bakasetas free-kick over the bar from six yards before the unmarked Pellistri missed a sitter in the 28th minute, blasting high over from 12 yards after James Tavernier had conceded possession inside the box.View image in fullscreenPanathinaikos’s Filip Duricic (right) in action against Rangers’ Max Aarons.Photograph: Georgia Panagopoulou/EPARangers’ two real efforts came in rare attacks, Findlay Curtis missing the target and Nico Raskin heading over, both from corners.Waves of Panathinaikos pressure continued after the break but when Duricic wrong-footed Butland with a header from a Bakasetas cross, the flag went up for offside. However, after a long VAR check, the Italian referee, Simone Sozza, awarded the goal but more drama quickly ensued.Moments later, Gassama, the former Sheffield Wednesday forward who replaced Curtis after the goal, fired in off the post from 14 yards in a rare Rangers attack to restore their two-goal lead.Rangers’ substitute Cyriel Dessers missed a great chance in added time when he failed to beat Bartlomiej Dragowski following a counterattack but it mattered not.

Wednesday’s first home game of the season is on Saturday 16 August, against Stoke.Sheffield councillor Joe Otten said the decision had been taken following an assessment “by engineering specialists who can no longer confirm that the North Stand is safe for spectator use”.Previous meetings of the local Safety Advisory Group, first reported by the BBC, had observed there was corrosion in trusses supporting the roof of the stand, as well as insecure electrical wiring and cracks in the terracing itself.The North Stand was built in the 1960-61 season and has a capacity of 9,255 spectators, many of whom are season-tickets holders. The stand also provides access for supporters with disabilities, with 54 wheelchair spaces and accessible seating for up to 360 people. Fans are now left waiting to know whether they will be able to watch their team during the upcoming campaign, which begins in a little over a week.Wednesday are under a transfer embargo and subject to EFL fee restrictions until the end of the summer window following a previous failure to pay transfer fees on time. Further sanctions could be forthcoming if the club fail to make payroll at the end of this month forwhat would be the fourth time in five months. Reports in the Sheffield Star have suggested the bill for repairs in the North Stand could reach seven figures.In a statement published on their website, the club said: “Sheffield Wednesday can confirm that, following a recent meeting with the local Safety Advisory Group, Sheffield City Council has today issued a Prohibition Notice preventing the use of the North Stand at Hillsborough.“The club are continuing to work with the Safety Advisory Group to satisfy their concerns such that the North Stand remains open. ­Additional information is currently being obtained, and we will provide further updates to our supporters at the earliest possible opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

The 19-year-old has made more than 100 appearances for Ajax’s first team and is capable of playing as a left-back or in central defence.

Palace are believed to have indicated that they are not willing to accept any bids below the 27-year-old’s release clause and want £35m in advance, with the rest of his initial £60m fee due in instalments.How to stop Viktor Gyökeres? ‘We’d have to foul him just to slow him down’Read moreThe clause includes up to £7.5m in add-ons and is thought to expire before the Premier League season kicks off on 16 August, although that is not understood to affect Palace’s valuation of the player they signed from Queens Park Rangers in 2020 for a fee worth up to £19.5m. QPR are believed to be due 15% of any profit Palace make on the sale. Arsenal officials are understood to have met with Eze’s representatives last month to discuss personal terms and he is thought to be keen to return to the club where he was released as a 13-year-old.Having committed more than £200m on six players during this window, Arsenal are hoping to move on several fringe players that could help fund a move for Eze. There is interest in Leandro Trossard from other Premier League clubs as well as Borussia Dortmund, with the Belgium forward yet to sign an extension on his deal that expires next summer, although Arsenal have an option to extend it by 12 months. Reiss Nelson is being targeted by Fulham, while Albert Sambi Lokonga, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fábio Vieira would also be allowed to depart for the right price.With the appeal against their demotion from the Europa League due to be heard at the court of arbitration for sport on or before 11 August, Palace are also facing uncertainty overthe future of captain Marc Guéhi. He is wanted by Liverpool but the Premier League champions have so far been reluctant to meet Palace’s valuation for the defender, whose contract expires next summer.Palace are believed to have lined up Ousmane Diomande from Sporting as a potential replacement for Guéhi, while they are also interested in Bilal El Khannouss of Leicester. But with goalkeeper Walter Benítez and defender Borna Sosa the only new additions to the squad so far, manager Oliver Glasner has admitted his disappointment at Palace’s lack of activity. “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far,” the manager told Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung during the club’s pre-season tour. “I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year.“As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible”. Glasner has yet to reopen talks about extending his contract, which expires at the end of next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal made numerous bids for the England international in January but were knocked back as Villa held out for £60m, a fee they would demand for any sale this summer.Ruben Amorim has been seeking a new striker given the struggles of both Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirzkee last season. Another option is RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson is no longer part of the thinking at Old Trafford.‘A new area’: why British clubs are increasingly turning to Asia to sign playersRead moreAston Villa insist Watkins is not for sale and are in a position of strength as his contract runs until 2028, meaning it would take an extremely high offer for them to consider parting ways. It would also be difficult for the club to find a replacement with the new season a little more than a fortnight away. United value Watkins at between £40m and £45m, which is similar to what Arsenal were offering in January.Sesko is seven years Watkins’ junior, arguably making him a better long-term prospect. But Leipzig are thought to want almost £80m for the Slovenian, who scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season. Sesko is thought to also be a target for Newcastle as they face uncertainty over Alexander Isak’s future.United have already spent in excess of £130mon signing Bryan Mbeumoand Matheus Cunha this summer and focus will turn to offloading some of their unwanted players. Marcus Rashford’s wages have been taken off the books after he joined Barcelona on loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia remain. If United want to acquire a new striker, bringing in fees from the sales of these four will be imperative.The club, meanwhile, have made a key appointment, hiring Mike Sansoni as head of data, replacing Dominic Jordan who left last year. Sansoni arrives from Mercedes Formula One team, of which Sir Jim Ratcliffe owns a third, where spent 11 years, mostly working as a senior performance engineer. He will be responsible for “transforming the club’s capabilities in data and artificial intelligence”. Furthermore, Kirstin Furber will arrive as director of people in the autumn from Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedAston VillaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Instead of raging about cosy cartels, the unfairness of PSR and the fact their billionaire owner isn’t allowed to spend money on players that the football club he owns hasn’t earned, mackems have since looked on with increasing intrigue as their club’s hierarchy have unveiled a series of new signings that, while unlikely to prompt talk of a serious title tilt, may at least ensure that Sunderland do not feature in any conversational comparisons with Derby County and their record low Premier League points tally of 11 in the coming months.It’s a near-certainty that Enzo Le Fée, Habib Diarra, Simon Adingra, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki and Reinildo Mandava won’t all go on to achieve Hall of Fame status on Wearside. But, in signing the six players, the club have shown they at least intend to make a decent fist of trying to stay up, while also putting the Sunderland ‘Til I Die days of Jack Rodwell on £70,000-per-week in League One, paying £4m for Will Grigg in an ill-advised deadline-day panic buy and that Oxbridge fop in the red trousers sound checking Ibiza anthems over the Stadium of Light PA long behind them. Of course, this being Sunderland, the possibility of sky-high farce and a snake belly low league position can never be discounted and despite these signings, the club’s head coach, Régis Le Bris, looked at risk of embarking on his first ever Premier League campaign with a callow and whey-faced squad boasting little or no top-flight experience.A grizzled old hand was required. Ideally a handsome, tough-tackling midfield veteran with more than a century of caps. A man whose leadership skills were held in such high regard by his peers that he famously topped the players’ poll for the position of Arsenal captain in 2019 without recourse to a recount. A man so impervious to the slings and brickbats of his once-adoring public that he would go on to … er, lose that captaincy afterthrowing a strop in the face of fan derisionfor being substituted against Crystal Palace. A man who realised the Sisyphean futility of trying to win a title at the Emirates andwent to Germany to win one instead. And a man who realised he was unlikely to win another one because Leverkusen are now managed by Erik ten Hag. What Sunderland needed was the man, the warrior, the myth and the occasionally contrary red and yellow card-magnet that is Granit Xhaka.And hell’s bells,if they haven’t gone and got him, in the process landing the kind of transfer coup which suggests that if they are to eventually go down next season, they will at least do so swinging haymakers of both the metaphorical and literal variety. “I’m very proud to be here,” roared the man who finished 16th on last year’s Ballon d’Or list and has signed a three-year deal for a fee of around £20m. “When I spoke to the club, I was excited and I felt the energy and the mentality that all the people and players have. It’s exactly what I wanted and I have a very good feeling.” Having made it clear before his move that he was hell-bent on moving to Sunderland, Xhaka’s arrival has prompted several questions, the most pertinent of which seems to be why exactly he was so hell-bent on going to Sunderland. “We are back to where this club needs to be, and we want to stay here to write our own history,” yodelled the Swiss legend to his adoring public from the central tower of Durham Cathedral. “I feel that I’m ready to help the team with my experience but with quality as well.” And while history is famously written by the winners, there isn’t a mackem alive who won’t be delighted if next season it’s chronicled by the team finishing 17th.QUOTE OF THE DAY“We have done this immediately, following an assessment by engineering specialists who can no longer confirm that the North Stand is safe for spectator use” – afteryesterday’s Football Daily, Sheffield city councillor Joe Otten reveals the outlook is even more grim for Wednesday fans after they were beenbanned from opening Hillsborough’s North Standto spectators due to safety concerns, with the new season little more than a week away.FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSPerhaps the reason for Sheffield Wednesday’s 10-man, 16-0 defeat to Halliwell FC in 1887 (yesterday’s Football Daily) was that not all members of the 1896 FA Cup-winning squad were trusting of the Victorian time machine technology that the club were clearly using at that time?” – Garreth Cummins (and others).Althoughthe numberis the same as Football Daily’s pedants, my only knowledge of ‘Bonnie Blue’ is that I thought it was an affectionate name for Cowdenbeath’s home kit.

It’s not a great day when you’re second in these races but we’re lucky to be part of them.”Mundane words like “shock” and “upset” do not come close to describing the result of this Group One contest, one of the most prestigious and prized events in the global racing calendar, which was won by a horse that finished 27th of 30 runners in the Royal Hunt Cup Handicap on his previous trip to the track. Qirat, as the stewards drily noted afterwards, “appeared to show improved form compared with its previous run”.Ralph Beckett’s ­gelding was widely assumed to be in the race simply to ensure an even pace before Field Of Gold, the 1-3 favourite and, like Qirat, in the colours of the Juddmonte operation, swept through the field to victory. It was, as it transpired, a rash assumption.The first part of the script played out much as expected, as Serengeti, the pacemaker for Aidan O’Brien’s Henri Matisse, worked his way to the front after a slow start and then went clear with Qirat and Richard Kingscote in close attendance.At the point around two ­furlongs out, Field Of Gold was expected to start closing them down. ­However, it soon became clear that the ­favourite was struggling to make ground. Instead, it was Sean Levy, on ­Rosallion, who set off in pursuit of the leaders, but as Serengeti dropped away, Qirat stayed on well and he was still two lengths in front at the ­furlong pole.Rosallion closed all the way to the winning post but Kingscote – who called the result “a bit surreal” – and Qirat still had a neck to spare at the line.Qirat was the longest-priced winner of a Group One race in Britain since the grading system was introduced in the early 1970s.Field Of Gold was clearly a long way below his best on his first visit to this tricky downland track, but Kingscote also deserves great credit for a no-nonsense ride at a frontrunners’ track, in a race where his rivals left themselves with too much to do.Beckett, Qirat’s trainer, was certainly surprised to find himself in the winner’s enclosure afterwards, but not entirely astonished. “We set out to go 12-second furlongs,” he said. “That was the plan and what he did. It is as simple as that.They didn’t sit close to him and that is the end result. When he went past Serengeti, I could see they were not coming and I was fairly confident he would not stop.”Kingscote described the outcome as “not what I expected this morning” but the race was also a fine advertisement for his talent for judging the fractions in front, a gift that should find plenty of new fans when Kingscote sets off for a four-month stint in Hong Kong from the start of September.“Towards the cut-away [around two furlongs out] I was thinking he was going well,” Kingscote said, “but you always expect the horses rated 20lb higher to be coming through.View image in fullscreenQirat and Richard Kingscote return to the winner’s enclosure after winning the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“It is better to be going off [to Hong Kong] on a positive note. I’m looking forward to the opportunity but I have not burned bridges so I can always come back if need be.”John Gosden, the trainer of Field Of Gold, said that the favourite “didn’t seem too well-balanced on the track”, adding: “He got a little unbalanced coming out of the dip into the bend, but I am not making any excuses. They ignored the pacemaker and paid the price.”Fire can blaze a trail in NassauThe five-runner field for Thursday’s Nassau Stakes is the joint-smallest this century for the Group One feature on the third day ofGlorious Goodwood, but while Minding was a prohibitive 1-5 favourite to beat four opponents in 2016, this year’s renewal is a fascinating and open contest with four closely matched fillies at single-figure odds.Whirl, the Oaks runner-up and a Group One winner in Ireland last time out, heads the three-year-old challenge alongside Cercene, last month’s Coronation Stakes winner, and Bedtime Story, who is looking to recapture the form of her impressive juvenile success at Royal Ascot last summer.It is an impressive squad for the Classic generation, in a Group One where three-year-olds have enjoyed plenty of success in recent seasons. They face a stern four-year-old opponent inSee The Fire (3.05), however, and Andrew Balding’s filly is a solid 2-1 shot to improve on her narrow defeat in this race 12 months ago.See The Fire produced one of the most visually impressive performances of the season to finish a dozen lengths clear of her field in the Middleton Stakes at York in May in a fast time, and raced closer to the pace than the two that beat her in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.That run in open company confirmed that she is an improved performer this season and Ombudsman, the winner, went down only narrowly in the Eclipse next time out.Goodwood 1.20Best Secretwas a big-money buy to join the Wathnan Racing operation before Royal Ascot last month and repaid at least a little of the outlay when finishing third in a strong renewal of the Golden Gates Handicap, despite finding plenty of traffic problems in the home straight. If James Doyle can keep him out of trouble from stall two, his proven turn of foot could well be decisive.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Thursday tipsShowGoodwood1.20 Best Secret (nb) 1.55 Coppull 2.30 Merchant 3.05 Sea The Fire 3.45 Ruby’s Profit (nap) 4.20 Steel Drum 4.55 Quiescent 5.30 KaleidoNottingham2.18 Nebrook Star 2.53 Moby Quick 3.30 Dancingintherain 4.05 Mini Mac 4.40 Blenheim Lad 5.15 DoggedWolverhampton5.45 Intervention 6.15 Loving Apprentice 6.45 Chutzpal 7.15 Change Sings 7.45 Love Is The Law 8.15 Mr Swivell 8.45 Bint Al DaarEpsom5.50 Etretat 6.25 Norfolk Blue 7.00 King’s Castle 7.30 Brielle 8.00 Uncle Simon 8.30 MuscikaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Goodwood 1.55Clive Cox’sCoppullwas a big outsider for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot but took a major stride forward to finish third, just a neck behind the runner-up, Do Or Do Not.

Her stage win and bonus seconds took her back into the race lead, at the expense of Marianne Vos.Tour de France Femmes: Wiebes strikes again as Vollering admits post-crash anxietiesRead more“The big goal was to take the bonus sprint,” Le Court said of her success in the Tour Femmes’ longest stage “which I managed to do. It was a bit tricky at the end. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching, but in the sprint when you lift your hands you should double-check. Close or not close, I still crossed the line first.”Le Court, riding for AG Insurance-Soudal, admitted that her success in the bonus sprints could be pivotal. “We have seen a few tours that have been lost by a few seconds, so we are fighting for every second possible. Seconds are super-important and you just never know.”Le Court and Vollering were part of a select group of race favourites, also including defending champion Kasia Niewiadoma, Olympic mountain biking champion, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and former world road race champion, Anna van der Breggen, that moved ahead on the final climb into Guéret.Three climbs in the final 35km shattered the peloton. On the first, the Cote de Chabannes, the trio of breakaway riders split apart, with Brodie Chapman, riding for UAE Team ADQ, the last to be caught.The ferocious pace to the final climb, Le Maupuy, reduced the lead group even further, with Niewiadoma’s Canyon-Sram ZondaCrypto team leading the way, and finally getting some distance on the overnight leader, Vos.The war of words between the Visma-Lease a Bike team of Vos and Ferrand-Prévot and that of FDJ-Suez race favourite Vollering had looked to be over after the team managers Jos van Emden and Stephen Delcourt shook hands in the team bus parking area before the stage start in Futuroscope.After Vollering’s crash on Monday evening, Delcourt had rounded on her rivals saying: “The mentality of some teams is insane. Absolutely disrespectful. How is it possible that everyone wants to gamble with their lives?”Van Emden’s reaction to Delcourt’s criticisms only fanned the flames. “I have absolutely no respect for those comments,” he said of Delcourt. “He apparently wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.”In Futuroscope, the pair came face to face, with Visma’s Jacco Verhaeren, the team’s sporting director, acting as moderator, for a 20-minute discussion. “It was really good, really constructive,” Delcourt said. “We share the same idea. We want safety for everybody.” The Frenchman added that he did not regret his original comments. “No, I don’t. We agreed to disagree.”View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering and Kim Le Court at the end of stage five.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesAny truce, however, might be short-lived. Only a few minutes prior to the conciliatory meeting, Delcourt, speaking to French media, had described Van Emden as “stupid, he only thinks of himself and has an over-sized ego”.Vollering, meanwhile, appears focused on the race and is seemingly recovered from a crash which only 48 hours earlier had looked likely to force her to quit. Second place, in a ferocious finish, showed that her ambition and appetite remain intact.Thursday’s sixth stage, from Clermont-Ferrand to Ambert, further ramps up the pressure with four climbs, including the first category Col du Béal in the second half of the stage. The rolling roads of the opening stages are now behind them as the peloton braces itself for a long and gruelling weekend in the mountains.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

World Athletics’ testing protocol will be overseen by member federations and the new regulations come into effect on 1 September, in time for that month’s world championships in Tokyo.“It is really important in a sport that is permanently trying to attract more women that they enter a sport believing there is no biological glass ceiling,” the World Athletics president,Sebastian Coe, said. “The test to confirm biological sex is a very important step in ensuring this is the case. We are saying, at elite level, for you to compete in the female category, you have to be biologically female.“It was always very clear to me and the WorldAthleticsCouncil that gender cannot trump biology. We particularly want to thank our member federations for their support and commitment in the implementation of these new regulations.”Athletics has spent years debating eligibility criteria to compete in women’s events, amid questions over biological advantages for transgender athletes and those with differences of sex development (DSD). World Athletics currently bans transgender women who have gone through male puberty from competing in women’s events, while it requires female DSD athletes whose bodies produce high testosterone levels to lower them in order to be eligible.This year, a working group found that those rules were not tight enough, with a pre-clearance test for the SRY gene beingone of several recommendationsthe group made for revised rules. The SRY gene reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex. The test was alsoapproved by World Boxing in Maywhen they introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Work has been ongoing to formalise the sales over the last five months, with the process described as being “in the final straight” as long ago as April, with signatures at that point expected “very, very soon”.Cricket Australia’s mooted BBL sell-off pits big risk against megabucks reward | Jack SnapeRead moreBut the complexity of the legal arrangements – one county executive said 73 different contracts had to be agreed and signed off before the sale of a minority stake in their one franchise could be completed – and the new investors’ desire to have as much control as possible over the competition’s future combined to delay the announcement.The completed deals involve the purchase of 49% stakes in Birmingham Phoenix, Southern Brave and the Lord’s-based London Spirit, a 50% stake in Welsh Fire, 70% in Manchester Originals and the complete takeover of Northern Superchargers by India’s Sun TV network.Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets remain in the process of finalising deals for 49% stakes, which are expected to conclude by the end of September. Proceeds are to be shared between professional counties and the grassroots game.“This investment will not only fuel the competition’s growth but also channel transformative levels of funding into our professional counties and grassroots game,” said Richard Thompson, the ECB chair. “This will ensure cricket continues to thrive at all levels across England and Wales for generations to come, supporting our broader ambitions to become the country’s most inclusive sport and driving cricket into harder to reach and under-served communities.”The ECB retains ownership of the competition itself, its regulations and the length and timing of the window in which it is played. But the investors will hold various vetos, including over its potential future expansion, and alongside the ECB and host counties will be represented on a new Hundred board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then came a question that changed everything. From childhood shame to Karl-Anthony Towns memes, this is how softness gets punishedLee EscobedoWed 30 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 04.35 EDTShareThe first time I danced was with my father. I plucked my bare feet onto his work boots, to my mother’s distress, and let his rubber soles guide me into a groove. Hand in hand, we spun through the kitchen as Al Green’s Love and Happiness christened my rhythm’s baptism.The second time I danced was with myself – and it would be my last. I wrapped my arms around the fleshy part of my waist as Seal’s Kiss from a Rose played from the Batman Forever CD in my stereo. Alone in my room, I was OK with the mirror seeing every part of me. I danced like Shirley Temple with Buddy Ebsen. Like my father guided me. The only thing that could have broken my rhythm did. My stepmother filled the doorway, barefoot except for a roach she had stepped on.“Why are you so damn gay?”That question didn’t land as curiosity. It landed as a sentence – as instruction. From that moment on, joy had to pass inspection before it could be expressed.A decade later, in a different home and a different neighborhood, I stood over a sink, washing someone else’s blood off my hands – still shaking from having fought my way out of being jumped. I wasn’t just cleaning up. I was trying to scrub away any lingering doubt about my masculinity.This essay is about what happens when boys who move freely are taught to fear their own rhythm – and what it means when grown men like Karl-Anthony Towns are mocked for keeping theirs.Confusion, softness and the urge to question societal norms are beaten out of all of us – but especially out of young boys of color in dangerous neighborhoods. It’s as if the praxis of masculinity demands violence as the antidote to vulnerability. Even laughter had rules. You couldn’t let it be too high-pitched. Too quick. You learned to clap shoulders, not hold hands. I didn’t immediately reconcile my behavior with its double, but I spent my adolescence trying to prove my stepmom wrong.Sincemoving from Minnesota to New York, expectations for former No 1 draft pick Karl-Anthony Towns have increased on all fronts. In New York, the world’s largest media market, scrutiny moves faster than any headline – amplified by the virality of social media.Towns is discovering what happens when softness is punished, when queerness is projected, and when public figures become unwilling avatars in culture wars over masculinity.The term “zesty”, a softened descendant of homophobic slang, became Towns’ shadow. It trailed him through every three-point play, podcast outtake and postgame moment. He became the target for people eager to mock what they couldn’t define.In Hilton Als’s The Women, he recalls being called an “auntie man” – a Barbadian phrase for a queer man, used with equal parts derision and familiarity. For Als, the term was both burden and lens – a way to understand how femininity in male bodies disturbs cultural norms. Towns, in his gestures and tones, touched that nerve – not by coming out, but by refusing to contort himself into the rigid, humorless frame of what a man in sports is supposed to be.Towns is far from alone. Figures like Tyler, the Creator, Russell Westbrook and Odell Beckham Jr have also been queer-coded and mocked online – not for coming out, but for expressing aesthetic freedom that unsettles traditional expectations of Black masculinity.Reading Als, I realized I wasn’t just haunted by my stepmother’s question. I was haunted by the idea that my joy, softness and rhythm might be interpreted the same way – that to some, my way of moving through the world would always be “off”.Homophobia today isn’t what it was in the 1990s, when the idea of a gayNBAplayer sparked outrage. American culture has shifted. Most people – not just millennials – know someone who is openly gay. Even baby boomers often count LGBTQ+ individuals among their friends or family.View image in fullscreenKarl-Anthony Towns, like Tyler, the Creator, Russell Westbrook and Odell Beckham Jr, has been queer-coded and mocked online.Photograph: Dustin Satloff/Getty ImagesThis broader familiarity has normalized queerness – but mostly white, heteronormative queerness. During his presidency, Donald Trump welcomed “Gays for Trump”, revealing how sexuality has become more complicated in modern politics, so long as it’s white and votes red.But in sports, John Amaechi and Jason Collins remain punchlines. Dwight Howard was the most recent NBA player to be publicly dissected for his queer preferences. His situation involved layers of moral, legal and consensual complexity, but the cultural judgment echoed the same old anxieties.Towns is ostensibly straight. He’s in a public relationship with Jordyn Woods. But his moments of effeminacy have gone viral on TikTok, trickling down through Twitter and into Facebook echo chambers. Many cite his Dominican heritage – not as a direct link to queerness, but to the flamboyance, rhythm and emotional expressiveness embedded in that culture. And if he were gay or bi or queer, what exactly would that change? KAT is still a dawg.It’s ironic that this ridicule came during the best season of his career. He averaged 24.7 points and a career-high 13.5 rebounds while leading the Knicks to their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years. He delivered signature performances, including back-to-back 40-point games and a playoff triple-double. His offensive dominance marked a personal and franchise turning point.But it wasn’t enough. The online ridicule intensified, crystallizing into what became known as “Zesty Karl-Anthony Towns”, or Zesty KAT – a meme that painted the Knicks star as flamboyant or queer-coded based on voice, gesture and posture. The term resurfaced in 2024 after viral TikTok compilations dissected clips from his postgame interviews and on-court expressions, reigniting during the 2025 playoffs.One of the most viral examples came from X user @Zazamyodor, who quote-tweeted a clip of Towns softly saying “for sure” with the caption, “That ‘for sure’ was nasty work.” The post earned over 46,000 likes and helped cement “zesty” as shorthand for mocking his style, despite his career peak.I still haven’t danced like I did that first time, or even the second. But I think about it often: what it meant to be light on my feet, unburdened, joyful without explanation. What Karl-Anthony Towns is enduring isn’t just a meme cycle. It’s the same sentence I heard in my doorway, repackaged for likes and algorithm reach: “Why are you so damn gay?” Not a question, an accusation. In this world, to be joyful in your body, to be expressive without apology, is still treated like defiance. Towns may not need to dance like I did. But every time he celebrates a three-pointer with flair, every time he speaks in a tone too tender for a seven-footer, he keeps the rhythm going for those of us who had ours interrupted.Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Four of the top five free apps on the Apple download store in the UK are VPN apps, with Proton, the most popular, reporting a 1,800% increase in downloads.Last week the UK’s communications regulator and enforcer of the act,Ofcom, indicated that it could start formal investigations into inadequate age checking this week. Ofcom said it would be actively checking compliance with age-checking requirements and if necessary would launch investigations into individual services.The AVPA, the trade association for age-verification companies in Britain, surveyed members who were carrying out checks for UK pornography providers. These providers were required to introduce “highly effective” age verification on 25 July.The age-checking companies were asked to submit “the volume of checks you carried out today for highly effective age assurance”.The AVPA said it could not offer a baseline comparison but effective age assurance was new to dedicated pornography sites in the UK. Previously, many porn sites in the UK only required users to tick a box to verify their age.An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Until now, kids could easily stumble across porn and other online content that’s harmful to them without even looking for it. Age checks will help prevent that. We’re now assessing compliance to make sure platforms have them in place, and companies that fall short should expect to face enforcement action.”Ofcom has said service providers should not encourage users to deploy VPNs in order to circumvent age controls.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It requires tech platforms to suppress the spread of content that is abusive or incites hatred against people with protected characteristics under the Equality Act such as age, race and sex.Free speech campaigners have said the child-harm content restrictions have led to material on X being age-gated unnecessarily, along with some forums on Reddit including one dedicated to tackling alcohol abuse.Reddit and X have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyOfcomnewsShareReuse this content"

The survey showed Netflix close behind. WhileBBC Onewas in the top five first destinations, children were just as likely to choose BBC iPlayer.YouTube’s increasing presence on televisions is not just down to the very young. In a gradual cultural shift, viewers aged 55 and over watched almost twice as muchYouTubecontent last year as they did in 2023, up from six minutes a day to 11 minutes a day. An increasing proportion of that – 42% – is viewed through a TV set.Overall, viewers spent an average of 39 minutes a day on YouTube in 2024. The platform is now the second most-watched service in the UK, behind theBBCbut ahead of ITV.Those aged 16 to 24 watched just 17 minutes of traditional, live television a day last year. Only 45% of them tuned into any broadcast TV in an average week, down from 48% in 2023.YouTube has evolved to become a closer competitor for traditional broadcasters. Half of the platform’s top-trending videos now resemble the content of mainstream broadcasters, including long-form interviews and gameshows.The rise of YouTube is presenting a major challenge for public service broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV andChannel 4, who have to decide how much of their content to place on the platform.While doing so helps them reach new and younger audiences, YouTube also takes a huge chunk of advertising revenue. There is also a risk that putting shows on YouTube ensures viewers spend less time on a broadcaster’s own platforms.View image in fullscreenA 12-year-old girl does a Joe Wicks YouTube morning workout session.Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian“Public service broadcasters are recognising this shift, moving to meet audiences in the online spaces where they increasingly spend their time,” said Ed Leighton, Ofcom’s interim group director for strategy and research. “But we need to see even more ambition in this respect to ensure that public service media that audiences value survives long into the future.”Ofcom has already told“endangered” broadcastersthey should work with YouTube to place more of their content on the platform, but it has also said this must be done “on fair commercial terms”.Michael Grade, Ofcom’s chair and a former head of Channel 4, said ministers should look at new laws forcing YouTube to give content from Britain’s public service broadcasters more prominence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Executives insist it is only helping them reach new viewers, rather than cannibalising its own platforms.ITValso announced a new deal with YouTube at the end of last year.While there is a live debate within the BBC over how much content to place on YouTube, more of its coverage is set to be featured on the site. Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News, told staff this week that the head of the corporation’s new AI department would also be responsible for “driving growth off platform with a focus on our YouTube strategy and younger audiences”.The amount of time people are watching video content every week is holding steady. Overall, the average person watched four hours, 30 minutes a day at home last year, just a minute less than the previous year.Content from traditional broadcasters still accounts for most viewing, making up 56% of the total. However, the proportion has fallen significantly, from 71% in 2018.YouTube is also the most popular online audio service, used by 47% of UK adults each week, followed by Spotify, used by 36%. Podcasts are now increasingly streamed on YouTube – a sign of its impact right across the media.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeTelevision industryChildrenNetflixITVBBCChannel 4newsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Galaxy Z Flip 7 joins thebook-style Z Fold 7as Samsung’s two flagship folding phones for 2025. Like its predecessors, the Flip’s biggest selling point is that it takes one of the largest screens on a Samsung and folds it in half for a more pocket-friendly size.Costing from £1,049 (€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799) it is similar in price to the regular S25+ and super-thinS25 Edge, but with a slightly larger screen.View image in fullscreenUnfolded the Flip 7 handles like a regular Android phone with a really big 6.9in flexible OLED screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 is slightly taller and wider than its predecessor accommodating the larger 6.9in inner display. It is also thinner thanthe Flip 6by 1.2mm when folded, but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference, unlike the transformational change given to theFold 7 this year.The new larger cover display on the outside fills the top half of the Flip 7 encircling the cameras and LED flash. It is able to fit more text from notifications and widgets on display, but it also looks far better than predecessors. Choose a good wallpaper and it looks stunning, particularly in the dark metallic blue colour.View image in fullscreenThe hinge feels sturdy shutting with a reassuring clunk, but it is hard to open the Flip 7 with one hand.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 has hardened glass on the outside, but the internal screen is still covered by a necessarily softer layer that picks up fingerprints, suffers from glare and can be easily marked. It requires more care than a regular slab phone. The Flip is water resistant but not dust resistant, so must be kept away from fine particles that might gum up its hinge.SpecificationsMain screen:6.9in FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display (397ppi)Cover screen:4.1in AMOLED 120Hz (345ppi)Processor:Samsung Exynos 2500RAM:12GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:One UI 8 based onAndroid16Camera:50 +12MP rear, 10MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, nano sim + esim, wifi7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSSWater resistance:IP48 (1.5-metre depths for 30 minutes)Folded dimensions:85.5 x 75.2 x 13.7mmUnfolded dimensions:166.7 x 75.2 x 6.5mmWeight:188gFast and snappy, but a little short on battery lifeView image in fullscreenThe Flip 7 fully charges in about 90 minutes and hits 50% in half an hour using a 25W or greater power adaptor (not included). It also supports 15W wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 has a Samsung Exynos 2500 chip, which is a high-end processor similar to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite used in the rest of Samsung’s flagship phone line. It won’t win any raw performance awards, but day to day it made the Flip 7 feel rapid with a solid gaming experience, even if the phone got quite warm during prolonged sessions.The battery life is falls slightly short of the Flip’s predecessors lasting about 36 hours between charges while on a mix of 5G and wifi and actively using the screen for about six hours. That roughly matches thesmallest S25 modeland means the Flip 7 will see out a heavy-use day with most people needing to charge it nightly. Note that prolonged use on 5G had a greater drain on the battery than Qualcomm-equipped Samsung phones.One UI 8View image in fullscreenFlex mode reveals tools such as a trackpad and scroll wheel, playback or camera controls on one half of the screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Flip 7 is one of the first Samsung phones, alongside the Z Fold 7, to runOne UI 8(Android 16) out of the box. It is one of the best versions of Android available offering deep customisation and solid performance.It looks and behaves very much like the software on the standard S25 line, including various AI tools across writing, image editing and generation, transcription and translation, and so on. It also has Google’s AI services including Gemini and Circle to Search.The Now bar is great, showing currently ongoing activities such as sport scores, music playback, timers, alarms and other bits.The Flip 7 has some additional tools to make use of the folding form. The useful flex mode moves the content, site or app to the top half of the screen and puts controls on the bottom half when you fold the Flip into an L-shape.View image in fullscreenAlbum art from your currently-playing music looks fantastic on the external cover display of the Flip 7.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt also has multiple tools to use the outside screen. You can view notifications, answer texts, control music or system settings, access various widgets including a voice recorder and calculator, plus talk to Gemini without opening the phone. A handful of apps including Google Maps, messages, WhatsApp, Netflix and YouTube can be opened on the outside screen too. But to use other apps on the cover screen requires downloading Samsung’s MultiStar plugin from the Galaxy Store, which is simple enough but should be a default feature.Samsung will provide Android and security updates until 31 July 2032.CameraView image in fullscreenFlex mode lets you get creative with your photography, propping the phone up in various ways for interesting angles.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe camera is one of the weaker areas of the Flip 7. It has a 50-megapixel main and 12MP ultra wide camera on the cover screen and a 10MP selfie camera on the inside.The selfie camera is OK but not great, suffering in low light though perfectly fine for video calls. Instead you get much better results using the main camera for selfies with the cover screen as the viewfinder.The main camera does shoot great photos outdoors and in good light, with plenty of detail and solid colours, but can be a bit dark, grey and grainy indoors or in difficult lighting conditions. The ultra-wide camera is decent for landscapes but struggles in lower light settings.The camera has plenty of fun modes, including the ability to shoot photos and video partially folded like anold-school handycamor propped up for hands-free selfies.Overall the Flip 7 shoots decent photos but its cameras aren’t quite on par with what you get on standard flagship phones.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThere is still a tiny gap near the hinge, but the rest of the phone is sealed when shut to stop debris and pocket fluff from entering it.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery has an expected lifespan of at least 2,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable. Inside screenrepairs cost about £294. Samsung offers aself-repair programme, as well as Care+accidental damage insurancethat reduces the cost of repairs to £119.The Flip 7 is made from recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements and steel, accounting for 18.2% of the weight. Samsung offerstrade-inandrecycling schemesfor old devices, and breaks down thephone’s environmental impact in its report (pdf).PriceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 costs from£1,049(€1,199/$1,099/A$1,799).For comparison, theZ Fold 7costs£1,799, theS25 Edgecosts£1,099, the S25+ costs£999, the Z Flip 7 FE costs£849, the Motorola Raze 60 Ultra costs£1,099and the Xiaomi Mix Flip costs£640.VerdictThe Flip 7 is Samsung’s most attractive flip phone yet, but the biggest upgrade is the larger cover display on the outside.The rest of the phone is pretty similar to its predecessors. The internal folding display is great, but soft and needs care. The fingerprint scanner in the power button is fantastic, but is placed a bit too high up the side of the phone. The cameras are decent but not up to the same standards of regular flagship phones, while the battery life is a bit on the short side. The software is great and comes with seven years of updates. But it all feels very iterative.The Flip 7 is the still the best way to fit a large screen in a small pocket, but it’s crying out for the kind of transformational redesign given to itslarger Fold 7 siblingthis year.Pros:bigger outside screen, great large screen that folds in half, IP48 water-resistant, great software with seven years of updates, plenty of AI features, attractive design, fun.Cons:expensive, less durable than a regular phone and costly to fix, no dust resistance, camera lacks telephoto zoom and not up to par with regular flagship phones, not a major update.View image in fullscreenThe Flip 7 looks stunning and can do more when closed, but most tasks are better handled on the main internal screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes I play along, tooKeith StuartWed 30 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 10.02 EDTShareWe’re a week into the school summer holidays here in England, and I wonder how many parents who started out determined to keep their children completely away from screens are now beginning to feel the strain. When my sons were much younger, I often had these idyllic images in my head of day trips to the seaside, back garden treasure hunts, paddling in the river, visiting relatives … an endless series of character forming experiences which I imagined in grainy Kodachrome colours. Then I’d be faced with the reality of having a job, and also the, let’s say, limited attention span of my sons. Those boys could rocket through a host of formative activities in a few hours leaving a trail of muddy boots, half-finished crafting projects and tired grandparents in their wake. Sheepishly, we’d end up allowing some Fortnite time to catch our breath.There is so much pressure and guilt around children and gaming, especially during long school breaks, and I think we need to seriously redress our outlook as a society. I harbour many lovely memories of gaming with my sons during hot August days; drowsily loafing about building ridiculous mansions in Minecraft or laughing ourselves stupid inGoat Simulator. We would always take the Switch on holiday with us, so that in the evenings, when we went out for meals, there would be an hour or so where my wife and I could linger over a glass of wine, while the boys silently played Super Mario together. We still managed to build sand castles, go swimming and explore unfamiliar towns, but games provided a way to wind down and enjoy something familiar.View image in fullscreenKeeping it in the family … Keith Stuart and his son Zac have long played video games together.Photograph: Morag Stuart/The GuardianWhen they stayed with their grandparents during holidays, they took games along too. My mum had a Nintendo Wii, which she claimed was exclusively for entertaining her grandchildren when she got tired; it was nice to watch my sons sit and patiently explainKirby’s Epic Yarnto her. I expect it reminds her of when I was young, playing Commodore 64 games on our computer desk in the kitchen – trying to recruit my dad into sessions of footie game Kick Off or the golf sim Leaderboard while he was supposed to be cooking a chicken. It’s good for children to be able to share their expertise and enthusiasm, whether that’s about playing a guitar (which my kids did, after learning about the instrument via Rock Band and Guitar Hero) or capturing a Jigglypuff in Pokémon Go.It’s a cliche to say “all things in moderation”, but it also happens to be true. There is too much talk of screen time as some sort of all-pervading, homogeneous evil, when really we should be thinking about the quality of that screen time. When children grow up playing video games and they’re comfortable in that world, over the summer is a good time to think about what they’re playing, what they get out of it and who they’re playing with. Is it bad that they spend an hour or two every night in Fortnite? Or are they meeting friends, having a laugh and even building stuff in the Creative mode?Gamesare also wonderfully adaptable to different situations. You might not want them playing video games on the beach, but in those interstitial moments – a long journey, a rainy afternoon – they can be invaluable – and parents shouldn’t feel bad about that. For a lot of gen Z and gen alpha, games are a part of the texture of their lives now – they fit in, like reading a comic or listening to an album on a Walkman did when I was their age.Earlier this week, I took one of my sons, now 17, to London. I met a friend while he went off and explored the city by himself. On the coach on the way home to Somerset, we were a bit too knackered to chat, but instead we played Mario Kart World together. We stood the console on the little seat tray in front of me, but it kept juddering and moving as the coach drove along, usually to my advantage. It was funny; we laughed and compared tactics and occasionally looked up as the evening sun made the fields outside glow. I think I will remember that hour and a half I spent with him on the bus longer than anything else I did that day. There may have been a screen between us, but we were together.What to playView image in fullscreenLoose and reckless fun … Fumes.Photograph: Fumes TeamCar battle games were wildly popular in the mid-1990s when titles such as Twisted Metal, Carmageddon and Destruction Derby encouraged players to smash their cars into other cars, repeatedly, often while also firing rocket launchers.NewcomerFumesis looking to bring those heady days back – it’s an open-world single-player vehicle blast-’em-up where you explore a vast Mad Max landscape in an upgradeable muscle car destroying enemies.

I feel he is oversimplifying gaming. Time spent on “good gaming” can be a good thing. I think about this a lot, and I’m very interested in how you think gamingmight actually be helping young people find and cultivate a healthy pride, identity and culture for themselves?”Although there are huge problems withtoxic communitieswithin gaming, thankfully there is also a multitude of positive examples. I’ve experienced a lot of kindness and acceptance in communities focused on particular games, especially space exploration simsDeep Rock GalacticandNo Man’s Sky, and in creative games such asMinecraft, where players praise each other’s construction skills. Minecraft has also fostered strong accessibility communities – for example the wonderfulAutcraft, which runs servers for neurodivergent players, allowing players to build friendships in a way that wouldn’t otherwise have been possible. Plenty of Twitch and YouTube streamers such as Aimsey, SpringSims and xChocoBars also create communities that give fans a sense of identity and belonging. And I love that certain games foster communities in which creativity and inclusivity expand beyond the games themselves – whether it’sLeague of Legends cosplay gatheringsorLife Is Strange fan-fiction groups. Video games, like music and movies, provide channels though which fandoms are able to express themselves and explore their identities. For many young people, I genuinely think the modern world would be almost impossible to navigate without these spaces.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterMinecraftSuper MariofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Titles such as Thief and Dishonored drop players into clockwork worlds where there are emails or letters to be read, vents to wriggle through, and desperate situations to overcome with smarts and social engineering as much as sheer violence.You could argue that all that’s been missing from the genre until now is a colossal policeman whose lanky body rises hundreds of feet into the sky, and who can look down at you and see absolutely everything you’re doing. Luckily, the new game from the Russian developer Tallboys is here to fix that. In Militsioner, you have been arrested for some manner of nebulous crime and must now leave town as quickly as you can. Bribe the ticketmaster at the railway? Break a window to create a distraction? All classic immersive sim solutions. Sadly, there’s that policeman to deal with first, a melancholic but watchful giant who towers over the ravaged urban surroundings even when sat down with his hands resting on his knees.View image in fullscreen‘A new dimension to storytelling’ … Militsioner.Photograph: TallBoys GamesThis giant defines Militsioner. He’s both a mechanic to toy with, depending on whether you want to flatter him or distract him, and a stark piece of visual brilliance that means you’ll never mistake this particular game for anything other than a paranoid immersive adventure. Even so, Tallboy’s director and game designer Dmitry Shevchenko explains that the project had been in development for a good six months before the policeman even turned up.“I remember watching an interview about the development of Thief: The Dark Project,” Shevchenko says. “We were really struck by the idea of giving the player a clear role, almost like a profession. That resonated with us. Around the same time, we were also thinking about giants as a theme.”These ideas converged when Shevchenko remembered a painting by the Russian digital artist Andrey Surnov, depicting a giant traffic policeman sitting in a field. “It just clicked,” Shevchenko laughs. “That image perfectly captured both the player’s role and their antagonist: criminal and policeman.”View image in fullscreenCruel dystopia … MilitsionerPhotograph: TallBoys GamesThe rest of Militsioner fell into place quite quickly after that. The game explores a cruel, totalitarian world that pits the individual against an overwhelming system. Yet it also plucks at more personal, even intimate threads. Is it illegal to bribe a giant policeman by offering them an apple? Is it illegal to try to date them?To pull this stuff off, Militsioner employs a kind of Tamagotchi system to monitor the specific internal worlds of all the non-player characters, that giant policeman among them. “We play with the classic immersive sim design pillar, where encounters can be approached through talking, sneaking or shooting,” Shevchenko says, and suggests that the moods add what he refers to as an additional layer, inspired by The Sims. “It’s the emotional states of characters,” he says. “Their moods become a core part of the systemic gameplay.”Sneaking into another character’s house and getting caught might send them into a panic, for example, which will change their dialogue options and, by extension, how you can interact with them. “This creates a deeply interconnected system where every action feeds into a web of reactions,” Shevchenko says. “It adds a new dimension to problem-solving and storytelling.”All of this is being expanded on by a process of rigorous player testing, where the team at Tallboys not only asks players what they did in a game but what they wanted to do but could not. This is where the idea of trying to date the policeman came from. “Players wanted to explore that side of the relationship,” Shevchenko says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe product of a Russian development team that has spoken out about the invasion of Ukraine, Militsioner is deeply political. It’s also quietly literary. Alongside that other towering and melancholic figure Kafka, Shevchenko says the team has been influenced by the works of the Strugatsky brothers, who are most famous for the sci-fi dystopia Roadside Picnic. “I keep trying to capture the feeling [of their books],” Shevchenko says. “I love how they approach abstract settings and describe characters, particularly in The Snail on the Slope, with its surreal depiction of the directorate and the system around it.”Dig deeper and there’s also the hint of another giant of Russian literature, Nikolai Gogol, whose stories pick at hierarchy and the manifold perversities of power in a playful, strikingly game-like way. His antiheroes, including a man whose nose leaves his face and goes on to greater social status than him and another who wants to cheat his way to riches buying up the ownership of dead serfs, would probably be quite at home living in a town where a giant policeman sat in the town square, sadly taking everything in.Militsioner is being developed for PC, release date is TBCExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our country is committing genocideYuli NovakMy generation was raised wondering how ordinary people could countenance an atrocity. In a grotesque twist, the question has circled back to usWed 30 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 16.12 EDTShareThe question keeps gnawing at me: Could this really be it? Could we be living through a genocide?OutsideIsrael, millions already know the answer. But many of us here can’t – or won’t – say it aloud. Perhaps because the truth threatens to unmake everything we believed about who we are, and who we wanted to be. To name it is to admit that the future will require reckoning – not just with our leaders, but with ourselves. But the cost of refusing to see is even higher.For Israelis of my generation, the word “genocide” was supposed to remain a nightmare from another planet. A word tethered to our grandparents’ photographs and the ghosts of European ghettoes, not to our own neighborhoods. We were the ones who asked, from a distance,about others: how could ordinary people go on with their lives while something like this happened? How could they let it happen? What would I have done in their place?In a grotesque twist of history, that question now circles back to us.For nearly two years, we’ve heard Israeli officials – politicians and generals alike – say out loud what they intend to do: to starve, flatten and eraseGaza. “We will eliminate them.” “We will make it uninhabitable.” “We will cut off food, water, electricity.” These weren’t slips of the tongue; they were the plan. And then, the Israeli military carried it out. By the textbook definition, this is genocide: the deliberate targeting of a population not for who they are as individuals, but because they belong to a group – an attack designed to destroy the group itself.We told ourselves other stories to survive the horror, stories that kept guilt and grief at bay. We convinced ourselves that every child in Gaza was Hamas, every apartment a terrorist cell. We became, without noticing, those “ordinary people” who keep living their lives while “it” is happening.I can still recall the first time reality cracked open for me. Two months into what I was still calling a “war”, three of my B’Tselem colleagues – Palestinian human rights workers we’d worked alongside for years – were trapped in Gaza with their families. They told me about relatives buried under rubble, about not being able to shield their children, about the paralyzing fear.In the frantic efforts to extract them from Gaza, I learned something that has seared itself into my mind: at that moment, a living Palestinian in Gaza could be “ransomed” for roughly 20,000 shekels. Children cost less. Life priced in cash, per head. These were not abstract statistics; these were people I knew. And that was when I understood: the rules had changed.Since then, the surreal has become routine. Cities reduced to ash. Entire neighborhoods flattened. Families displaced, then displaced again. Tens of thousands killed. Mass starvation engineered, with aid trucks turned away or bombed. Parents feeding animal fodder to their children, some of whom die waiting for flour. Others are shot – unarmed civilians, gunned down for approaching food convoys.Genocide does not happen without mass participation: a population that supports it, enables it or looks away. That is part of its tragedy. Almost no nation that has committed genocide understood, in real time, what it was doing. The story is always the same: self-defense, inevitability, the targets brought it on themselves.In Israel, the prevailing narrative insists this all began on 7 October, with Hamas’s massacre of civilians in southern Israel. That day was a true horror, a grotesque burst of human cruelty: civilians slaughtered, raped, taken hostage. A concentrated national trauma that summoned, for many Israelis, a profound sense of existential threat.But 7 October, while catalytic, was not enough on its own. Genocide requires conditions – decades of apartheid and occupation, of separation and dehumanization, of policies designed to sever our capacity for empathy. Gaza, sealed off from the world, became the apex of this architecture. Its people became abstractions, perpetual hostages in our imagination, subjects to bomb every few years, to kill by the hundreds or thousands, with no accountability. We knew more than 2 million people were living under siege. We knew about Hamas. We knew about the tunnels. In hindsight, we knew everything. Yet somehow we were incapable of understanding that some of them might find a way to break out.What happened on 7 October was not only a military failure. It was a collapse of our social imagination: the delusion that we could corral all the violence and despair behind a fence and live peacefully on our side. That rupture arrived under the most extreme rightwing government in Israel’s history, a coalition whose ministers openly fantasize about Gaza’s erasure. And so, in October 2023, every star in our darkest nightmare aligned.This week, B’Tselem released a report, Our Genocide, compiled by Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli researchers together. It is divided into two parts. The first documents how this genocide is being carried out: mass killings, destruction of living conditions, social collapse and engineered starvation, all fueled by incitement from Israeli leaders and amplified through media. The second part of the report traces the path that led here: decades of systemic inequality, military rule and policies of separation that normalized Palestinian disposability.Israel committing genocide in Gaza, say Israel-based human rights groupsRead moreTo confront genocide, we must first understand it. And in order to do so, we – Jewish-Israelis and Palestinians – had to look at reality together, through the perspective of the human beings living on this land. Our moral and human obligation is to amplify the voices of the victims. Our political and historical responsibility is also to turn our gaze to the perpetrators, and to testify, in real time, to how a society transforms into one capable of committing genocide.Recognizing this truth is not easy. Even for us, people who have spent years documenting state violence against Palestinians, the mind resists it. It rejects the facts like poison, tries to spit them out. But the poison is here. It floods the bodies of those who live between the river and the sea – Palestinians and Israelis alike – with fear and unfathomable loss.The Israeli state is committing genocide.And once you accept that, the question we have asked ourselves all our lives rematerializes with urgency: what would I have done, back then, on that other planet?Except the answer is not rhetorical. It is now. It is us. And there is only one right answer:We must do everything in our power to stop it.Yuli Novak is the executive director of B’Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied TerritoriesExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

This is how democracy diesWed 30 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareThe latest casualty ofDonald Trump’sefforts to silence media criticism is Eduardo Porter, one of the most thoughtful and intelligent critics of his heinous regime.On Tuesday, Porter wrote his last column for theWashington Post. In a widely circulated email, he explained why he was leaving the Post:Jeff Bezos and his new head of Opinion are taking the paper down a path I cannot follow, directed toward the relentless promotion of free markets and personal liberties … I have no idea to what extent this is driven by Mr Bezos’ fear of what Donald Trump could do to his various business interests, most of which are more valuable to him than The Post.”Well, I do have an idea. Bezos stopped the Post fromendorsing Kamala Harris.Amazon made a hugecontributionto Trump’s inauguration. And he stood in front of Trump at the president’s swearing in.Why? Because Bezos has founded a bunch of mega-corporations, including Amazon, that depend on Trump’s goodwill and could be in deep trouble if Trump decided to retaliate against Bezos.It’s much the same story withStephen Colbert, longtime host of CBS’s The Late Show and the top-rated late-night talkshow host in the US.On 14 July, Colbert openly criticized CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for its$16m settlementwith Trump over his frivolous lawsuit over the routine editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that Trump claimed gave her an unfair advantage in the 2024 election.Said Colbert in his opening monologue:As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended. And I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company … I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s a big fat bribe. Because this all comes as Paramount’s owners are trying to get the Trump administration to approve the sale of our network to a new owner, Skydance.”Three days later, on 17 July, Paramount pulled the plug on Colbert’s show, eliciting from Trump a celebratory: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”(A few days later, Colbert came out swinging, telling Trump to “go fuck yourself”, and joking that it had always been his dream to have a sitting president celebrate the end of his career.)On Thursday, one week after Colbert’s show was cancelled, Trump’s Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s sale to Skydance.To clinch the deal, Skydance promised that it wouldeliminateall US-based diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount and CBS and create a newombudsmanto field complaints of supposed bias in news coverage (presumably anything critical of Trump).Let’s be clear. Bezos has silenced any criticism of Trump on the editorial pages of the Washington Post because Bezos fears Trump’s wrath.CBS and its parent corporation, Paramount, have silenced criticism ofTrump on Colbert’shugely popular late-night show because its top corporate brass fears Trump’s wrath.The new owner ofCBShas agreed to some federal interference in the content of what it produces because he fears Trump’s wrath.It’s the same withAmerican universities, whose professors have often criticized Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional actions and whose research has often yielded conclusions that contradict Trump’s lies (such as thatclimate changeis a “hoax”).Columbia Universityand a handful of others have gone out of their way to “cooperate” with the Trump regime in order to avoid Trump’s wrath.What does “cooperation” entail? Silencing Trump’s potential critics.Columbia has just agreed to allow the regime to review its admissions and hiring practices in order to receive the federal research grants that the regime had held back.Friends, this is how democracy dies.The silencing is happening across America because Trump cannot stand criticism, because he’s vindictive as hell, and because he’s willing and able to use every department and agency of the federal government to punish any media corporations or universities that allow criticism of him.Shame on any media outlet or university that allows Trump to silence it.Trump is a dangerous despot. America needs its Eduardo Porters, Stephen Colberts, and all others in the media and in academia who have helped the nation understand just how truly dangerous Trump is.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It is nothing less than astonishing and unbelievable that we have achieved so much progress in so little time.At the turn of the century, sun and wind in the form of solar panels and wind turbines were expensive, primitive, utterly inadequate solutions to power our machines at scale, which is why early climate activism focused a lot on minimizing consumption on the assumption we had no real alternative to burning fossil fuels, but maybe we could burn less. This era did all too well in convincing people that if we did what the climate needs of us, we would be entering an era of austerity and renunciation, and it helped power the fossil fuel industry’s weaponization of climate footprints to make people think personal virtue in whittling down our consumption was the key thing.There’s nothing wrong with being modest in your consumption, but the key thing to saving the planet is whittling down the fossil fuel industry and use of fossil fuels to almost nothing by making the energy transition to renewables and an electrified world. And that’s a transformation that has to be collective and not just individual.We face daunting global challenges. But here are eight reasons to be hopeful | John D BoswellRead moreOther stuff is great – changing our diets, especially to reduce beef consumption and food waste, protecting natural systems that sequester carbon, better urban design and better public transit, getting rid of fast fashion, excessive use of plastic, and other wasteful climate-harming forms of consumption – all matter. But the majority of climate change comes from burning fossil fuels, and we know exactly how to transition away from that and the transition is underway – not nearly fast enough, not nearly supported enough by most governments around the world, actively undermined by the Trump administration and many fossil fuel corporations and states.But still, it is underway. And, arguably, unstoppable. Because it’s just a better way to do everything. One thing that’s been striking in recent years, and maybe visible in recent years because there is now an alternative, is the admission that fossil fuel is a wasteful and poisonous way to produce energy. That’s the case whether it’s to move a vehicle or cook a dinner.Oil, coal, and gas are distributed unevenly around the world and just moving the fuel to the sites where it will be used is hugely energy inefficient. About 40% of global shipping is just moving fossil fuel around, and more fuel is moved on trains and trucks. But also, fossil fuel is extracted, shipped, and refined for one purpose: to be burned, and in the future coming fast, burning is going to look like a primitive way to operate machines.As the Rocky Mountain Instituteexplains it: “Today, most energy is wasted along the way. Out of the 606 EJ [exajoules] of primary energy that entered the global energy system in 2019, some 33% (196 EJ) was lost on the supply side due to energy production and transportation losses before it ever reached a consumer. Another 30% (183 EJ) was lost on the demand side turning final energy into useful energy. That means that of the 606 EJ we put into our energy system per annum, only 227 EJ ended up providing useful energy, like heating a home or moving a truck. That is only 37% efficient overall.” That’s the old system, and it’s dirty, toxic to human health and the environment – and our politics – as well as the main driver of climate chaos. And wasteful.The new system, on the other hand, is far cleaner, and the fact that sun and wind are so widely available means that the corrosive politics of producer nations and their manipulations of dependent consumer nations could become a thing of the past. I know someone is about to pipe up with an objection about battery materials and there are two answers to that. One is that the race is on, with promising results, to produce batteries with more commonly available and widely distributed materials.The other is that batteries are not like fossil fuel, which you incessantly burn up and have to replace; they are largely recyclable, and once the necessary material is gathered, it can be reused and extraction can wind down. But also the scale of materials needed for renewables is dwarfed by the materials to keep the fires burning in the fossil fuel economy (and the people who complain about extraction sometimes seem to forget about the monumental scale of fossil fuel extraction and all the forms of damage it generates, from Alberta to Nigeria to the Amazon).And renewables are now adequate to meet almost all our needs, as experts like Australia’s Saul Griffiths and California’s Mark Z Jacobson have mapped out. Simply because it’s cheaper, better and ultimately more reliable, the transition is inevitable – but if we do it fast, we stabilize the climate and limit the destruction, and if we don’t, we don’t. Almost no one has summed up how huge the shifts are since the year 2000, but the Rocky Mountain Institute has done that for the last decade, during which, they tell us: “clean-tech costs have fallen by up to 80%, while investment is up nearly tenfold and solar generation has risen twelvefold. Electricity has become the largest source of useful energy, and the deep force of efficiency has reduced energy demand by a fifth.” Estimates for the future price of solar have almost always been overestimates; estimates for the implementation of solar have been underestimates.Another hangover from early in the millennium is the idea that renewables are expensive. They were. They’re not anymore. There are costs involved in building new systems, of course, but solar power is now the cheapest way to produce electricity in most of the world, and there’s no sign that the plummet in costs is stopping. As Hannah Ritchie at Our World in Datasaidin 2021 of renewable energy: “In 2009, it was more than three times as expensive as coal. Now the script has flipped, and a new solar plant is almost three times cheaper than a new coal one. The price of electricity from solar declined by 89% between 2009 and 2019.”But even cheap is a misnomer: wind and sun are free and inexhaustible; you just need devices to collect the energy and transform it into electricity (and transmission lines to distribute it). Free energy! We need to get people to recognize that is what’s on offer, along with energy independence – the real version, whereby if we do it right, we could build cooperatives, local (and hyperlocal or just autonomous individual) energy systems, thereby undermining predatory for-profit utilities companies as well as the fossil fuel industry.Renewable energycould be energy justice and energy democracy, as well as clean energy.An energy revolution is underway in this century, though it’s unfolded in ways slow enough and technical enough for most people not to notice (and I assume it’s nowhere near finished). It is astonishing – a powerful solution to the climate crisis and the depredations of the fossil fuel industry and for-profit utilities. Making it more visible would make more people more enthused about it as a solution, a promise, a possibility we can, should, must pursue swiftly and wholeheartedly.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

The priority must be ending the butchery in GazaWed 30 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 19.51 EDTShareAlmost two years into a conflict that has cost tens of thousands of lives, amid an Israeli military campaign and humanitarian blockade that have reached apocalyptic proportions, and faced with their own powerlessness as they bear witness to what growing numbers of experts call a genocide,Emmanuel Macronhas announcedFrance’s dramatic next step: it willrecognize a Palestinian statein September.Keir Starmerquickly followed suit, stating that theUKwould do likewise unlessIsraeltook actions – including ending the appalling situation inGazaand committing to a process leading to a two-state solution – he surely knows it will not. Palestinians rejoice; Israelis seethe; the Trump administration denounces the move and issues dire warnings. It is all profoundly pointless. The step is utterly disconnected from reality and at odds with its purported goals. It will do nothing to end Israel’s onslaught. It will not bring the parties any closer to a two-state solution. It will boost Benjamin Netanyahu’s political fortunes. The Palestinian people will end up the biggest losers.For Palestinians, the day after France’s announcement will be much like the day prior. Israel will continue to bomb, starve and seek to ethnically cleanse Gaza; it will carry on land grabs, home demolitions, displacement of Palestinians, and will further entrench its presence in the West Bank. Already, close to 150 countries recognize the State of Palestine, barely 20 fewer than the number that recognize Israel. The entity so recognized has no defined territory, no effective government, no sovereignty. It has, in short, none of the attributes that define a state. To the Palestinians will go empty statements and diplomatic gimmickry. To Israelis, the land, the resources, the wealth. Some deal.I live in Britain; I grew up in Israel. It’s painful to say, but we need real UK sanctions to save Gaza | Yair WallachRead moreIf anything, the situation will worsen. The Israeli government feigns fury, but the fury will fade fast. Far from feeling embattled, Netanyahu’s government will be emboldened, grateful for anything that distracts attention from the slaughter it is conducting in Gaza and that, under cover of its anger, it will redouble. Domestically, Israel’s opposition may blame the prime minister for putting the country in this position, but it feels compelled to close ranks, unanimous in its condemnation of anything that hints at a Palestinian state. Hostility to Palestinian statehood is not the province of the current Israeli government alone. On the eve of 7 October, it pervaded Israeli society; in the wake of the bloodiest attack in the nation’s history, it has become an article of faith. A year ago, presented with a bill rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state,68 members of the Knessetvoted in favor; only the Arab parties voted against.The damage may run deeper still. Having defied Israel, ignored its protestations, alienated its people, offered a prize to its foes, France and European governments that follow in its lead – asFrance hopes they mightat a UN conference this week – might conclude that, for now, their work on behalf of the Palestinians is done. They will expect from them deep gratitude. They might feel relieved of any obligation to exert pressure on Israel where it really hurts and really matters – to impose tangible consequences, demand accountability, or enforce sanctions if it does not stop the war, end the siege, halt its settlement enterprise. Instead, the pressure will turn on the Palestinians to prove they are worthy of this munificent offering.Protesting over Gaza’s starvation feels like screaming into a void – but we mustn’t stop | Nesrine MalikRead moreAll this for what? The most absurd part of this endeavor is that it is taking place on behalf of what has become an imaginary goal. Worthy as it was, the quest for a two-state solution has come to an end. It succumbed to Israeli intransigence, Palestinian ambivalence, American fecklessness, and the rest of the world’s impotence. It failed under far more auspicious circumstances – when settlements were significantly fewer, Israel’s territorial encroachment less intrusive, Palestinian and Israeli politics more promising, popular backing on both sides greater. It failed when it might have had a chance and today it has none. Starmer illustrated the nonsense of his position even as he argued for it, justifying recognition of a Palestinian state by pointing to dwindling prospects of its coming about. The recurrent recitation of support for two states, whether by Joe Biden yesterday, Macron and other European officials today, Arab leaders at all times, is an empty lie that will not become truth by virtue of repetition.The lie is a distraction. The priority today is to end the butchery inGaza, which will not be done without imposing material costs on the Israeli government that is perpetrating it and depriving it of the weapons with which it does so. Beyond that is a need to reimagine creative approaches to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that renounce deceit and pretense, put aside the illusory goal of hard partition between two states, and seek a different pathway to dignified coexistence between the two peoples.The irony is that recognizing a Palestinian state is of no interest to its purported audience: the Israeli and Palestinian people. They have a long and painful experience of such symbolic statements. The gains will be made by others, whose bitter verbal disagreements conceal a more cynical alignment of interests: recognition suits the Israeli government, which will not have to suffer from more punitive actions; the French and UK governments, which will not have to take them; and the Palestinian political system, which will cover its evident weakness with this futile victory. For the Palestinian victims of this most unimaginable of tragedies, it will end up doing nothing in the costliest of ways.Hussein Agha has been involved in Israeli–Palestinian affairs and negotiations for more than half a century.

I’ve seen that pain and I know silence is deadlyRK RussellAs a former NFL player, I’ve seen up close what brain trauma can do. Shane Tamura’s final note echoed a familiar pain while showing how silence, access and neglect can killWed 30 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 05.21 EDTShareFour people lost their lives this week in a Manhattan office building, gunned down in a place I know well, by a man with a rifle and a three-page note blaming football and the brain diseases it allegedly left him with. One of the victims was an off-duty NYPD officer. Another was a Blackstone executive. All were innocent. All were just trying to make it home, and thanks to 27-year-old Shane Tamura, they never did.RK RussellI’ve walked through those NFL offices. I’ve sat in those rooms. I have friends who still work there, people I care about deeply. And on the other side, I’ve known people and lost people who havesuffered with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), not always to death, but to the isolation that comes with it and the slow unraveling of mind, body, and spirit. And I’ve lost people to gun violence. Too many of us have.So when I read that the shooter claimed to suffer from CTE, that he was trying to reach theNFLoffices and take revenge for what he believed the game did to his brain, though he never played on the professional level, I felt more than shock. I felt grief. I felt rage. I felt an urgency I can’t ignore, and neither should you.This tragedy isn’t just a story about one man. Even in the gunman’s three-page note found is his wallet, he referenced Terry Long, a former NFL player who died by suicide and was later confirmed to have CTE, it’s a warning about everything we still refuse to confront: how we treat brain trauma, how we ignore mental illness, how we arm the broken, and how silence, in football, politics, and culture, continues to kill.I know what it feels like to weaponize your own body.I played Division I football at Purdue and was later drafted to the Dallas Cowboys. I went on to play and start for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Buffalo Bills. I’ve lined up across Hall of Famers, driven my shoulder into men twice my size at ungodly speeds, and felt my own skull rattling in my helmet tackles after tackle and hit after hit. In football, that wasn’t cause for concern. That was cause for celebration. I often remember teammates from as young as high school to 12-year vets in the NFL often hiding their concussion symptoms to not lose time on the field, and too often, coaches and trainers encouraged, or at the very least, turned a blind eye to these circumstances. That’s not to say that for every indifferent coach or trainer, there weren’t a host of more diligent and careful ones to check in with them, but still, athletes slip through the cracks more often than not.We were conditioned to treat pain like performance fuel. If you could keep playing, you did. You’d tape it, ice it, pop a pill, and keep quiet. But there is no quick fix for the brain. We called it toughness. We called it loyalty. We called it team culture. But let’s be honest, it was silent, slow bleeding. And for some of us, it never stopped.I recall playing for the Buccaneers as a starter back in 2017, dislocating my shoulder, tearing my labrum and breaking part of my clavicle, only to take two weeks off, medicate, ice and rehabilitate, so that I could play the rest of the season, missing only one game. Each week, while my teammates were practicing for our next opponent and getting better at their craft, I was rehabbing my shoulder enough to be able to raise my arm on its own – never above my head, though – and play again that week, repeating my own self-torture. And I was thanked for it every week until it became expected of me by everyone in the organization. I was later cut in 2018 for that same injury, which had gotten substantially worse through playing.View image in fullscreenAt least six people were shot Monday and a police officer was killed when a suspected gunman unleashed gunfire inside a midtown Manhattan office building that houses the Blackstone investment firm and the headquarters of the NFL.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockCTE isn’t something you talk about in the locker room. It’s something you whisper about years later when a former teammate loses his marriage, disappears into depression, or dies by suicide, which I have personal accounts of. It’s something you fear will show up in your own life like a ghost or the boogeyman, in a burst of rage you can’t explain, in the way your memory blurs, in the quiet moment you wonder if your mind is slipping away.The man who opened fire in Manhattan didn’t play in the NFL. He played high school football over a decade ago. But the way he described his suffering in his final note, the way he named CTE, and the league, and begged for his brain to be studied: that language, that desperation, it’s familiar. I’ve heard it. I’ve lived adjacent to it. Some of my friends and former teammates’ lives have been ruined.What to know about the victims of the New York City skyscraper shootingRead moreNone of these are excuses for what he did. Let me be absolutely clear: the victims of this attack did not deserve what happened to them. Their families, their communities, and our country are left mourning yet another senseless act of violence. But if we don’t look at what led him there, the culture of silence around brain trauma, the lack of access to mental healthcare, the glorification of pain and masculinity in football, then we’re choosing ignorance. And ignorance has never saved a single life.For all its faults, the NFL at least has the awareness to ban finger guns and any gestures resembling violence from celebrations, yet our country remains hell-bent on not just refusing to ban real guns but actively loosening gun laws under the current administration.This wasn’t just about CTE. It was also about access. Shane Tamura drove across the country with a file in his car and pain in his chest. He crossed state lines, walked into a corporate building in Manhattan, and took four lives before taking his own. That kind of devastation doesn’t happen without a weapon in hand, and in this country, that weapon is far too easy to get.I’ve lost people to gun violence. People who looked like me. People whom I called uncle, brother, and friend. I could have been lost to the same fate, but I was lucky enough to have sports to escape into. Football, manhood and masculinity teach men to bottle up what hurts, and then America hands them a gun when they finally explode. There are more regulations on touchdown celebrations and social media content than on who gets to buy an AR-15.Grief and condolences are not enough. Not this time. Not anymore.The NFL has taken steps, but it’s time to double down at all levels. Mental performance and mental wellness can no longer be an afterthought in a sport built around pain. From the first padded practice in youth football to the final snap of a pro career, we need to talk openly about trauma, identity, support and care, as well as regular mental performance screenings. Not just for stars. For everyone.We also need to take along hard look at the laws that let people like Tamura move through this country with a weapon of war and no safety net. If CTE was the fuel, access to that rifle was the match. How many more lives have to be lost before our lawmakers act? Before mental health and gun access are treated as connected crises, not isolated talking points?I’m speaking up because silence has already cost us too much. I was lucky. I got out with my body and my voice. But I know players who didn’t. I know communities that didn’t.So remember the names of the victims. Officer Didarul Islam. Wesley LePatner. Aland Etienne.

We’ve already seen theUK’s Online Safety Actmaking global headlines over the past week, where it isproving to be a nightmarefor enforcement.Let’s be clear: the harmful content the federal government keeps referencing isn’t going anywhere. This content (excluding videos already restricted to those over 18) can still be viewed by anyone in a logged-out state or by teenagers using the account of their parents. Once you turn 16, there is nothing stopping you from accessing the content, and it could just as easily lead to a negative impact.Children to be banned from having YouTube accounts as Albanese government backflips on exemptionRead moreWhat this ban does do, however, is effectively punish teenagers, even those who have always had overwhelmingly positive experiences fromYouTube. Parents who are more than happy for their teenager to use YouTube with an account are not given any exemptions, despite the government’s repeated line that the social media ban gives power back to the parents.The reason for YouTube’s initial exemption was education, something I can personally attest to as a current year 12 student. After remote learning ended, YouTube continued to be used as a key tool for learning, both during and outside of school hours. This includes simple things such as a homework task involving taking down notes from a video, to a teacher uploading their own set of videos for a particular subject unit for student viewing anytime and anywhere. There have even been more than a few instances of teachers recommending subscribing to an educational channel, which I know has been a help to me and many of my peers.That’s not to say YouTube isn’t also a source of harmful content. But while there’s no perfect solution for keeping young people safe online, there are clear steps that could and should be taken by the federal and state governments. And it starts in the classroom.From the late stages of primary school into secondary school, repeated lessons on ways to report content and dangers to look out for (among many other things to teach) would be a welcome addition. Crucially, this prevents the entire burden being on parents, many of whom are not tech-savvy by their own admissions.Simply saying “don’t do this” has never worked for any generation of teenagers, and it doesn’t work for keeping them offline in this day and age. The more parents – or for that matter, governments – try to force a restriction on social media use, the more young people will be motivated to get around it.Additionally, measures to actually target the platforms, rather than the teens who use them, would make a lot more sense. Exactly what those measures would be is a further question, but we already know the government has plenty of tools at its disposal, such as the eSafety commissioner, if it’s looking for a direct fight with tech giants.Four alternatives to Spotify: swapping is easier than you thinkRead moreWith a high court challenge from Google seemingly looming, it’s worth remembering that – like it or not – Australia is far from the largest market for social media companies. This means it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that these platforms could abandon Australia altogether rather than follow this legislation, just as Facebook did with news for a short period in 2021. I’m personally not convinced that will end up happening, but it also doesn’t require that much imagination.Banning teens from accessing YouTube through their own account isn’t going to stop harmful content in the slightest. Genuine problems need genuine solutions, but the social media ban isn’t one of those.Leo Puglisi is chief anchor and managing director at 6 News AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralia newsOpinionLaw (Australia)YouTubeSocial mediaAustralian educationInternet safetycommentShareReuse this content"

Work with us: if you go to war with us, you’ll loseWes StreetingWe value and rely on BMA members, but on this, we’ll stand firm. They are only hurting patients and themselvesWes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careWed 30 Jul 2025 13.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 13.33 EDTShareAs five days of strike action by resident doctorscome to an end, the BMA has written asking me to return to the negotiating table. I’ve responded, with the irony of their letter being that I never left the table. We are back to where we were two weeks ago, when I sat down in good faith and offered to work intensively with them over a few weeks to negotiate a package of measures that would make a real difference in meeting the costs of doctors’ training, the costs associated with being a doctor and the lack of promotion opportunities.The only difference between now and a fortnight ago is the damage that the BMA has done to theNHSthrough its reckless strike action.Thanks to the hard work of NHS leaders and the heroic efforts of frontline staff who stepped up, including many resident doctors who showed up for work, the disruption was not as bad as it might have been. We managed to protect more operations and procedures than in previous years, and our accident and emergency response times improved during the period of strike action.But I do not want for a moment to play down the real impact of strike action on patients. The BMA has made no bones about the fact that it wanted to do damage to the progress we are making on cutting waiting lists and waiting times, and use the suffering of patients as leverage against the government. It cannot duck the consequences of its actions now.On Saturday, I spoke to a patient whose kidney cancer surgery has been postponed by a month until the end of August. I rang him personally to apologise because, having been through kidney cancer myself, I know exactly how it feels to wait, and the impact the fear and anxiety has on our families and close friends. It was just one of countless examples of cancer care that was affected, not to mention many other operations, appointments and procedures.We are still counting the costs of strike action on patients and stretched NHS budgets – budgets that doctors are relying on to deliver real improvements to their working conditions, as well as to patient care.Doctors are not the only staff I am responsible for in the NHS. The Royal College of Nursing will shortly publish a survey of its members and, without having seen the results, I have spent enough time with our nurses to know that they have not felt valued by the previous government and they are looking to Labour to deliver meaningful change to their profession. The GMB union has made similar representations on behalf of paramedics.Unite returned a negative ballot this week. Unison, the largest trade union in the country, knows better than anyone that staff right across the NHS are looking for material improvements to their pay and conditions. Many of them will never earn as much as the lowest-paid doctor. I have committed to work with them through the NHS staff council to make sure that we drive real change for their members, too.View image in fullscreenA striking resident doctor holds a placard during a picket outside the Royal Liverpool university hospital in Liverpool, 25 July 2025.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPANone of them have hada pay rise of 28.9%. Only resident doctors can claim to have received the highest pay rise in the public sector two years in a row. No wonder other NHS staff have looked on aghast at the action of the BMA. The BMA’s demands, and the speed with which it launched a strike – and a five-day strike at that – have left many other NHS staff, most of them paid far less than doctors, dismayed and appalled.The BMA is now adding jobs to its pay dispute, presumably because its members agree that picking a fight on pay after a 28.9% pay increase is unprecedented and unreasonable, and they are more worried about whether they have jobs to go into. They are right to be concerned, but working with the BMA to address doctor unemployment and career bottlenecks are among a number of things we are able and willing to do to improve the lives of doctors.Wes Streeting’s divide and rule tactics may have won against the doctors – but more strikes are coming | Polly SmytheRead moreAll I ask of the BMA is two things. The first is to drop this unnecessary and unreasonable rush to strike action. It harms doctors, it harms patients and it is fundamentally self-defeating, because it leaves the NHS with less money to address the issues that doctors care about. The second is to recognise that this government has a responsibility to all NHS staff and, above all, to patients. We can’t fix everything for everyone everywhere all at once.Labour didn’t break the NHS, nor did the doctors. Patients are looking to us to work together, as a team, to get their NHS back on its feet and build an NHS fit for the future. The past 12 months has shown what this government and the NHS can achieve when we pull together. Waiting lists are at theirlowest levels in two yearsand it feels like the NHS is finally moving in the right direction.It should be clear to the BMA by now that it will lose a war with this government. It’s not too late for us both to win the peace.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Because, to give credit to the RBA, in itsMay statement on monetary policyit predicted inflation of 2.1%. That it did predict this inflation and yet still kept interest rates steady tells you something about how punishingly timid it has been.In June, not only was the official CPI at 2.1%, meaning it has now been below 3% for a year, but the core measure of inflation (the trimmed mean) fell from 2.9% to 2.7%:If the graph does not display click hereEven more astonishing is that in a majority of capital cities, inflation is now below 2% – yep,belowthe Reserve Bank’s target range:If the graph does not display click hereAnd if you want even more confirmation of just how low inflation is at the moment, the monthly measure of inflation – which in November will take over as the official measure once a few more items are added – rose just 1.9%:If the graph does not display click hereAll of this is very good news for those who were struggling with rising prices in 2022 and 2023.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIt is less good news for the opposition. The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, took to theparliament on Mondayand told the treasurer that “inflation remains too high”. If that is the case then we need to change the English language as well as economics to redefine “high”.Even when you compare our core inflation with those in other major economies, Australia is doing well.If the graph does not display click hereCore inflation is the measure that the RBA mainly focuses on because it gives a less erratic view of what is happening.What it does is top and tail (or “trim”) the 15% biggest price rises and falls.All the way with Donald J? Albanese’s second term will be defined by how he handles the elephant in the room | Peter LewisRead moreThistime around, that means, for example, the trimmed inflation measure does not include fuel or lamb prices which fell the most, and at the other end of the scale it mostly ignores the jump in secondary education cost and also electricity prices which jumped 8.1% this quarter.The reason electricity jumped was the end of state-based subsidies – especially in Western Australia and Queensland.If the graph does not display click hereThe Bureau of Statistics notes that without these subsidies electricity prices across Australia would have risen just 0.4% in the June quarter. But even still, electricity costs on average 14% less than it would without the subsidies. So you can bet the government will be very happy it extended its scheme:If the graph does not display click hereThat the RBA did not cut rates earlier this month is even more inexplicable when you dig deeper into the figures.The RBA always looks at the price increase of services rather than goods, because services are more closely linked with wages (because you need workers to do the services). In the year to June service prices rose just 3.3% – that is back at the level they rose in 2011 to 2014 – a period whenthe RBA cut interest rates eight times:If the graph does not display click hereAnd the level of inflation is also very broad. The prices of about two-thirds of all items counted in the CPI basket rose less than 3% – that’s a very solid level:If the graph does not display click hereThis of course does not mean all things are hunky dory and life is a sweet basket of chocolates and strawberries.Pleasingly the prices of non-discretionary items – those things we have to buy, such as food, petrol or insurance – are now rising the slowest, but there is still a lot of catching up to do after the past four years.Since June 2022, which was about the same time the RBA began lifting rates, wages have risen 14% – well behind the 22% increase in the price of those necessities. That makes for a lot of people still feeling worse off than they were then:If the graph does not display click hereBut overall, the story is very good. Inflation should no longer be such a concern that the RBA holds off on cutting rates until it gets more information.But unemployment is now rising above 4%; when you combine that with inflation falling close to 2% that equals an interest cut. And even though they won’t, when they do cut in August, the RBA also should apologise for making everyone wait six weeks longer than they needed to.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaOpinionAustralian economyInterest ratesBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

She’d been worried about them – her mum had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and her dad had been having frequent falls. For years she’d been trying to get them to talk about whether they needed to move to aged care, to assess their financial situation and face what was coming next, but they’d dismissed her, saying they were fine.On the first day of their visit, Anna’s dad fell and broke his leg, badly. “He went into hospital and Mum came and stayed with me. I realised what they’d been covering up. Mum was so confused she was walking around the house without any pants on, which was confronting for my teenage boys. She didn’t know what day it was and she couldn’t read a clock. Then the hospital told me Dad was withdrawing from alcohol and had some dementia.”I thought when my mother went into aged care my daily work would be over. I was wrong | Caroline BaumRead moreAnna moved her parents to a nearby aged care centre while her sister packed up the family home. The sisters had always had some issues in their relationship but the stress of seeing their parents so vulnerable, of selling the house and working through the financial situation, led to harsh words and hurtful accusations. Anna’s sister told their parents they were arguing. “They were distraught. It was awful. I had to set some boundaries, and I just stopped all communication.”Read moreCaregiving can expose cracks in families and widen them to caverns. Since I’ve been working in this area, I’ve heard many stories like Anna’s and spoken to experts about how families can fall apart just when they need to come together. There’s often resentment about the burden of care on one child, conflict around the pressure of making huge decisions and the horror of the “sad-min” of form filling. Issues around money are particularly messy. And families who have had past conflict and trauma are particularly at risk.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsResearch released on Thursday by online care platform Violet reveals the depth of anxiety surrounding Australia’s ageing population and gives insights into families who love deeply but plan poorly. Its poll of a thousand people found more than three-quarters of Australians are concerned that caregiving will damage their relationships with family members and 70% worry about managing past family conflicts and unresolved trauma when caregiving.Previous studieshave shown 45% of caregivers experience relatively serious conflict with another family member, usually because one sibling tends to carry the heaviest load.One sibling will often demand life support because they want to believe in hope or a miracleProfessor Ken HillmanEach statistic tells a unique and personal story of relationship breakdown, resentment and real anguish. But the consequences affect us all, because the conflict often plays out in publicly funded late-stage hospital care.A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2019found patients whose families are in conflict were nearly 10 times more likely to receive unbeneficial treatment towards the end of their life.Ken Hillman, professor of intensive care at the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales, has been warning about the cost of misaligned care in the last moments of life since the 1980s. His most recent research in the Internal Medicine Journal cited overtreatment as a major contributor to decreased capacity of hospitals, reduced ability to conduct elective surgery, increased attendances at emergency departments and ambulance ramping. Hillman says family conflict is the biggest cause of non-beneficial treatment at the end of life. “I’m not too sure if it’s guilt or existing conflict or just not facing the problem, but one sibling will often demand life support because they want to believe in hope or a miracle.”Why do we age in dramatic bursts, and what can we do about it? - podcastRead moreProf Imogen Mitchell also sees the cost of conflict in her job as an intensive care specialist at Canberra hospital. She says most families haven’t even thought about whether they’d want their loved one going to intensive care and this can lead to panic.“Often sons are more wedded to keeping them alive, saying, ‘She’s a fighter’, whereas it’s often a daughter who does more of the care who will say ‘I’m not sure Mum would want all this’. Often, a new wife and the children of the patient will be in conflict – the wife wants all treatment that is possible and the children will be more pragmatic. Meanwhile, we hold a patient in suspension while family members get on the same page.”Often this can take time because all sorts of family issues can play out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Families need guidance to navigate complex medical decisions and care coordination. Different states have different recommendations for health directives, but clearly we need better guidance and fundamental planning tools. Parents hate it when their children fight – setting the rules around ageing with clear direction and communication may be the best gift they can give their children and themselves.Not all conflict can be avoided but some plain old appreciation for those who do the hard work in caring is a good place to start. Sharon* in Sydney spends half her week driving her father to appointments, cooking his meals and cleaning his flat. She does it with love but concedes the lack of the slightest bit of interest from her two siblings has lessened her love for them. “Just an acknowledgment and a pat on the back would go a long way. There are times I even feel I hate them.”Often healing old wounds in families is too difficult.

Still, public sector workers are struggling, and they have public sympathyWed 30 Jul 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 13.14 EDTShareWhenthousands of ambulance workerswent on strike on 21 December 2022 to demand better pay and conditions, the then shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, wasn’t shy in pointing out who was responsible. In their refusal to negotiate,he tweeted, Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay had driven NHS staff to strike, leaving patients “in no doubt who is to blame for this chaos”.Three years and one general election later, the surgical slipper is firmly on the other foot. Resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – have just finished a five-day strike, demanding a 29% pay rise over the next few years. Among placards on picket lines calling for “pay restoration” andan end to“cuts so deep that even a surgeon couldn’t fix it” wereprinted copiesof Streeting’s tweet.Gone is the relaxed attitude displayed by the health secretary towards the British Medical Association (BMA) in 2024, when he agreeda deal with doctorsthat set them on a “journey to pay restoration”. He has called this latest strike a “gift to Nigel Farage” andurgedresident doctorsto cross picket lines and join their colleagues still “turning up to work”. He has described the strike not only as “reckless”, but as an action that “enormously undermines the entire trade union movement”.Union general secretaries have been quick to shoot back, with Dave Ward of the Communication Workers Union calling Streeting’s comments “shameful”, and the Public and Commercial Services Union’s Fran Heathcote accusing the health secretary of “carping in the Murdoch press” instead of negotiating a settlement. For a government whose relationship with organised labour has so far been largely harmonious – apart from Unite’ssuspension of Angela Raynerover the Birmingham bin strikes – Streeting’s denouncement of the BMA is the closest Labour has come to picking a fight with the unions. Is this the government’s industrial shot across the bows?While on the face of it, the row might seem like the first real sign of confrontation between Labour and the unions, it’s worth taking a closer look at what is happening. Underlying Streeting’s intervention are a number of factors that make the BMA an easy target for a government that’s keen to display that it can be tough on unions and not in the pocket of its “union paymasters”.The BMA isnot affiliated to Labour, nor is it part of theTrades Union Congress, making Labour’s institutional link to it much weaker. There’s also the fact that resistance to the strike isn’t coming only from the government’s side: other healthcare unions have expressed unease over existing discrepancies in NHS pay offers. Last month, the Royal College of Nursing called the government’s decision to award resident doctors a 5.4% pay increase while offering nursing staff 3.6% “grotesque”.In a videoposted on Xabout the strike, Streeting plays into those divisions within the movement, stoking tension between resident doctors and other NHS workers. He talks about “working hard with … staff that aren’t paid as much as doctors to make sure that your pay and your career progression and the conditions that you work in are also good for you”.Add to that the older consultants and medical professionals who have been having their say: that a strike would “further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver”, that “it is too soon to go again”, or simply that resident doctors are being “very greedy”.Then there’s the drastic lurch by the Tories – both in government and opposition – to the right on industrial matters, with Kemi Badenoch proposing this week toban doctors from taking strike action, putting them under the same rules that apply to police, prison officers and soldiers. This approach gives Streeting more room to present himself as tough but reasonable.This isn’t to defend Streeting, who is probably more than happy to use strike actionto justifyfurther NHS privatisation. Nor is it to undermine how galling his comments are for those standing out on the picket lines. One doctor has called them a “slap in the face”, while anotheraskedwhere the Streeting of 2022 had gone: “He was making some good points.”But government condemnation of the strike does not necessarily reflect a wider shift in its strategy towards unions. Amid frenzied attacks by Tories and their media allies on Labour’s link with the unions, the reality of the relationship is all too often drowned out. That makes it harder to understand key dynamics: it’s likely to be transport unions that the government hopes to take on, not only industrially but politically.It also makes it harder to spot how unions’ different industrial priorities inform their relationship with the government. With so much of Labour’s employment rights bill left to secondary legislation, general secretaries still have eyes on the prize of getting their sectoral needs met, whether that’s Unison pushing for fair pay agreements or the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers forzero-hours contract reform. Then there’s the fact that there are those in Labour who are itching to embrace the spirit of the 1980s and launch a full-frontal attack on the movement.The country is once again facing the prospect of widespread public sector industrial action, with nurses and teachers potentially set to join the strike action. A decade of suppressed public sector pay, inflation and increases in the cost of living has challenged the idea that certain professions’ wages are always guarantees of a good life. On a basicstarting salary of £38,831and saddled with as much as£100,000 of student debt, it’s no longer enough for new resident doctor recruits to simply wait to earn more at some distant point in the future.While there are grievances specific to the resident doctors’ strikes – ashortage of speciality training postsand having to spend thousands of pounds on exam fees, courses and equipment such as stethoscopes – many of their concerns are felt deeply across the movement. Stubborn mountains of student debt, housing costs that utterly eclipse wages and crumbling public services that drive down working conditions are not unique to the BMA.For this dispute, Labour has used inter-union tensions overNHSpay – as well as the outdated idea that all resident doctors are middle-class professionals – as a political opportunity to dodge blame for the strike. But that strategy won’t work for all strikes. As public sector unrest continues to unfold, the government’s battle with the unions might well begin in earnest.Polly Smythe is labour movement correspondent at Novara MediaExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionIndustrial actionWes StreetingLabourHealthNHScommentShareReuse this content"

As a clinical psychologist who works with professional athletes and sports teams, I know that discipline and aggression will have played an important role in their victory – but that habits and hobbies off the pitch might have been just as vital.In the training camp, away from the spotlight and competition of the tournament, the Lionesses would come together in the evenings to engage inwholesome activitiesincluding building Lego, doing jigsaws and playing Monopoly.Michelle Agyemangplayed a piano in her room.DefenderLotte Wubben-Moybrought a sourdough starter from home for the team chef to feed. They were also encouraged to spend time with their families and to talk and journal about “how they had made it to the Euros, their footballing journeys and the personal battles they had faced”.Mastering professional sport requires resilience, composure and an ability to navigate the highs and lows inherent in competition. Highs – such as when an important match is won and the stadiumroars with approval– kick players’ sympathetic nervous systems into overdrive as the neurotransmitters adrenaline and dopamine are released. In this state, returning to a hotel room to sleep and recover ahead of upcoming fixtures can feel virtually impossible. It’s not uncommon for athletes to continue to seek out dopamine hits in the form of intense physical exercise, alcohol, social-media feedback, gaming or gambling – all of which can have negative outcomes.View image in fullscreenLauren Hemp with her Beauty and the Beast Lego castle during Euro 2025.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASimilarly, when athletes experience a low – a day off, the off-season, an injury or retirement – their mood can plummet. Not only is there now ample time to ruminate on negative thoughts, but their brain chemistry is suddenly deprived of all that lovely pleasure-inducing dopamine as the highs of winning subside and social-media feedback wanes. All too often, the instinct is to pursue dopamine through other, potentially harmful stimuli because it feels too uncomfortable to tolerate the sense of lacking something. Little sympathy is often felt by the public towards football stars who appear seemingly reckless in their behaviours off the pitch, but in reality they are sliding down a slippery slope of addiction and are desperately fighting to get off.Managing the cognitive, emotional and neurotransmitter-fuelled rollercoaster inherent in sport is crucial for athletes if they want to avoid emotional dysregulation, depression, addiction and burnout.Here’s where the Lionesses played a blinder with their choice of downtime occupations. Low-tech, slower activities such as Lego, puzzles and journalling, as well as being engaging and satisfying, provide an off-ramp for dopamine chasing. They allow players to build emotional and psychological resilience. If you’ve ever attempted a complex Lego build – like the forward Lauren Hemp, who reportedlybuilt a Beauty and the Beast castleduring the Euros – you’ll know all too well the level of patience required. Tolerating the discomfort of a fiddly project can help build emotional regulation and resilience – vital for managing uncomfortable pressure points on the pitch.Many of the Lionesses’ purported pastimes were also low- or no-tech. In choosing to play an instrument or give each other beauty treatments (defender Esme Morgan was reportedly the woman to see about lash lifts), the Lionesses were giving their sympathetic nervous systems an opportunity to switch off, allowing for faster recovery. Moreover, in doing non-football related activities together during their leisure time, the players opened up space for social and emotional connectedness – a key component of a cohesive and connected team.The type of calm, low-tech, collaborative activities practised by the Lionesses during the Euros provided balance between the rush of fast-paced highs and the discomfort of tolerating uncomfortable, slower-paced moments. It’s this balance that our minds and bodies need to sustain the physical fitness and mental stamina required to meet the demands of a major tournament – and it’s this balance that has been a key ingredient of England’s success.We can’t all be Lionesses, but we can learn from them. When the going gets tough, the tough … do jigsaws.Dr Amy Izycky is a clinical psychologist specialising in professional sport and neuropsychology working throughout the UK and internationally.

Now we’re being punished for speaking out against the killing of medics and patients in GazaWed 30 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 11.03 EDTShareMedicine is a humanistic profession, grounded in ethical values of justice, beneficence and the commitment to do no harm. It is a vocation of healing, of saving lives and of easing physical and emotional suffering. Being a doctor requires inner strength – the ability to see another’s pain, to feel it and to respond with empathy and compassion, alongside the knowledge and professionalism the role demands. I believe a physician also bears a critical responsibility in advocating for their patients’ right to health and in upholding the principle of justice. In that sense, every doctor is, to me, a leader.I explored these ideas in a new Guardian documentary,The Oath.I tell my story as a Palestinian doctor living in Israel and working within its healthcare system. Made over the past year, the film portrays the struggles and challenges I have faced in that time. However, since I was first filmed in March 2024, the situation in Gaza, and the position we are in as doctors, has only worsened – day by day, hour by hour.As a Palestinian doctorliving and working in Israel, in the midst of a longstanding conflict, I learned during my studies and work that injustice has been done to many populations living here. The occupation and coercion that Israel exercises over the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and the policy of discrimination against the Palestinian minority living within Israel cause serious harm to the right to health of these populations. Control over territories, expulsion, dispossession, violence, restriction of movement, establishment of settlements and apartheid cause great suffering to the population, prevent access to medical care and directly affect their health. Already as a medical student, I decided that I could not sit on the sidelines in the face of all that. I joinedPhysicians for Human Rights – Israelin order to fight for the health of the populations under Israeli control, together with many partners.When we began filming the documentary, five months had already passed since Israel’s assault on Gaza began. At that point, thousands had been killed and widespread destruction had taken place. Still, I could not have dreamed that for the next year and a half we would continue to witness daily bombings, mass death – including thousands of children – millions displaced, starvation and the unprecedenteddecimation of Gaza’s health system. Hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, universities and entire neighbourhoods have been wiped off the map. The scale of devastation is unlike anything I have seen elsewhere. This is not merely a humanitarian crisis, it is what many international legal scholars and human rights organisations have begun to describe as agenocide in progress.My personal story is inseparable from this struggle. Marwan, the brother of my sister-in-law, a paramedic, was killed in the line of duty on 7 October 2023. These past two weeks were even more tragic for his family: their tents in a camp inGazawere bombed, killing 10 relatives, among them Abdullah, an eight-year-old boy full of life and dreams of becoming a doctor, murdered in his sleep. Little Marwan, seven years old, lay unconscious in a hospital for a week due to a severe head injury, but was denied proper treatment due to the severe shortage of medical staff and resources.Since that tragic day, more than1,500 Palestinian medical personnelhave been killed. Many have been detained, subjected to ongoing persecution and humiliation. Some have died by torture and neglect in Israeli detention facilities. All this takes place under deafening silence from the Israeli healthcare establishment and many of my fellow physicians, who too often choose silence over basic ethics and morality. Only very few voices were heard among some in the Israeli healthcare system against targeting their colleagues in Gazan hospitals.Amid all this, I try to speak with restraint, to choose my words carefully, out of fear and understanding that my voice might be seen as dangerous. Since 7 October, Palestinian staff in the Israeli healthcare system have faced persecution, slander and paralysis. Anti-Palestinian sentiment is surging, even among patients and colleagues. Slogans such as “there are no innocents in Gaza” or “burn Gaza to the ground” are neither rejected nor punished by the system. Any expression of sympathy for victims – women, children, innocent civilians – is seen as support for terror, and puts the speaker at risk of dismissal or disciplinary action.A fellow physician, a partner in our struggle, was recently fired for delivering a brief speech in which he criticised the crimes committed in Gaza. The silencing and persecution are only intensifying.Medicine, once assumed to be a neutral profession, has become politically and morally fraught. To treat an injured child in Gaza is no longer merely a medical duty – it is a profound moral declaration. The oath to provide equal care to all shatters against the brutal reality in which doctors and children are killed, patients are arrested, voices are suppressed and dreams – like Abdullah’s – collapse.And still, I continue to fight. Because as long as we remain silent, our oath is hollowed out, and the right to health becomes a fantasy too far to reach. Yet, as long as I have a voice, I will use it: for my patients, for justice, for the oath we all swore.Lina Qasem Hassan is a Palestinian doctor working in the Israeli healthcare system and is chairwoman ofPhysicians for Human Rights - Israel.

The best joke of the fringe award – the lighthearted, groan-inducing staple of the Edinburgh festival –has been scrapped after 17 years.The award’s retirement may not prompt national mourning, but it does bring to an end a curious fringe tradition – one that delivered easy headlines as well as endless debate.Launched in 2008, the award set out to distil the spirit of the festival into a single one-liner. Longlisted by a panel of critics and then voted on by the public, it aimed to showcase the sharpest bite-size humour from that year’s fringe. Still, the announcement was never without controversy. In 2023, whenLorna Rose Treen took the titlewith the joke “I started dating a zookeeper, but it turned out he was a cheetah”, she was met with a wave of online criticism (the Sun claimed her win had “killed comedy”). Last year, an article in the Herald deemed the award Edinburgh’s “most heated controversy”.The backlash feels somewhat overblown for an award that was simply a celebration of something meant to make people laugh.Comedyis inherently subjective, and everyone is never going to like exactly the same thing. But we all like a good (or at least eye-roll-worthy) joke. Just look at how much time we dedicate to reading the ones from Christmas crackers; it’s not necessarily about their quality, but the shared joy they bring.On this level, the award made sense. Digestible punchlines are entertaining – we can steal them for ourselves, repeat them in our social circles and hopefully elicit some hearty snorts. And at one of the world’s biggest comedy festivals, it’s hardly surprising that people would want to crown the year’s most crowd-pleasing quip. Still, the idea that the art of live comedy can be condensed into a single line is undeniably flawed. How many times have you been told a “funny story” and found yourself unmoved?The act of relaying humour is a difficult task. For standup in particular, a joke can’t be separated from its setting. While the fringe’s best joke list tended to be pun-heavy, jokes don’t always land in isolation. They live in a comedian’s energy, the crowd’s mood and the rhythm of the moment. Stripped of this context and presented simply as written words in a list, even the most dynamic line can fall flat.Perhaps that’s why the list often felt underwhelming: it ignored the bigger picture. There’s no mention of physical comedy, timing or tone, which are crucial ingredients to bringing humour to life onstage. The shows that made me laugh hardest across the festival, as both a critic and, more recently, as a judge on the Edinburgh Comedy Awards, rarely got a look in from the best joke award list. Last year’s winner for best newcomer,Joe Kent-Walters, transformed himself into Frankie Monroe, a Rotherham working men’s club MC, complete with corpse-like, Sudocrem-white face paint and leering movements. Did his hour consist of neat, packable humour? Absolutely not, but it was genuine, full-body comedy that stayed with me long after the show ended.Similarly, the year before,Julia Masli’s show,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, became a word-of-mouth hit. Masli, a clown by training, took on the role of an agony aunt of few words. There was nothing close to a standard joke in her act; instead, it lived on the curiously trusting relationship she built with the audience. There were plenty of confessions and practical solutions, but no linguistic wit. It was all the funnier for it.It is unlikely that anyone reading the best joke award lists from years gone by would have let out a guffaw. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that the award was a welcome addition to the general merriment of the fringe – so much so that the unofficial ISH Comedy Awardshave announced that they’d be running their own best joke award this year. The punchline can live on. That, at least, should be a cause for celebration.Anya Ryan is a freelance journalist.

They knew what was happening all alongWed 30 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 04.17 EDTShareWhat have we done?As theUN-backed monitordeclares that “the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip”, this should have been the question ricocheting between the walls as Keir Starmer met Donald Trump this week. Israel’s deliberate starvation of Gaza is, after all, a crime confessed to, designed and implemented in plain sight. Starmer has said the UK willrecognise Palestinian statehoodif Israel doesn’t agree to a ceasefire and a two-state solution, but don’t be beguiled: Palestinian national self-determination is an inalienable right, not a bargaining chip, and it’s the most symbolic action he could take rather than, say, imposing sweeping sanctions and ending all arms sales.The hand-wringing of western politicians and media outlets will not feed Gaza’s emaciated children, any more than it will absolve them of guilt.Israel’s leaders have said, explicitly, repeatedly, from the very beginning, that they are deliberately starving Gaza’s people. “Man-made famine is not something that I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Martin Griffiths, the UN’s former humanitarian chief, tells me. On 9 October 2023, Israel’s then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, announced “a complete siege on [Gaza]:no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel”, justified on the grounds: “We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly”. The next day, the Israeli general charged with humanitarian affairs in Gaza and the West Bank –Ghassan Alian– declared that the “citizens of Gaza” were “human beasts” who would suffer “a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”The following week, the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, promised“we will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip”. These statements were not reported at all by many western media outlets – or, if they were, it was in passing and with no explanation given about their objectively illegal intent. It’s as though these statements were being uttered in a parallel universe, because if they were accurately covered with due prominence, then our media would have been forced to cover Israel’s onslaught as a criminal enterprise, rather than a war of self-defence.Israel’s western allies knew exactly what it was up to. In March 2024, our then foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, wrote a lettersetting out many rusesused by Israel to block aid from entering Gaza, yet Britain took no action. In April 2024, two US government departments concluded that Israel wasdeliberately blockingaid, which legally required the administration to stop supplying weapons. This was overruled by Joe Biden’s team.Later that year, that same administration sent a public letter detailing Israeli aid obstructions, but Tel Aviv correctly calculated this was political posturing during the presidential election, largely ignored the demands and sufferedno consequences for doing so.Israel has perpetrated the biggest slaughter of aid workers in history,killing more than 400by the spring. It waged a relentless war against Gaza’s main humanitarian agency – Unrwa, the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency – andbanned itfrom the occupied territories last October. Its militarykilled police officerscharged with escorting aid and preventing looting. It’s not just the blocking of aid from entering. Israel’s onslaught has leftnearly all agricultural land unusable, as well as damaging 80% of cropland.Nearly all livestockand mostplant lifeis dead.Gaza’s portand fishing vehicles have been destroyed, and Palestinians defying Israel’s ban on fishingface slaughter.The massacre of starving Palestinians looking for aid has been a consistent theme. In February 2024,more than a hundred civilianswaiting for flour were butchered by the Israeli military, yet – as been the case throughout the genocide –media outletstreated its denials, deflections and lies as credible claims. A detailed investigation by CNN weeks later concluded what should always have been obvious – the Israeli military was to blame – but by then attention had moved elsewhere. In March this year, Israel imposed a total siege, and replaced the UN’s effective aid system with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose “distribution sites” are dystopian killing fields. As the UN-backedIPC notes, that aid is not only far too little, but it is often unusable because Israel has left Palestinians without cooking gas and clean water to prepare it.More than a thousandcivilians have been butchered trying to access this aid. As aid agencieshave noted, the GHF is designed to coax a starved population to the south, so they can be confined in what the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert described as a “concentration camp”, before being deported.Despite Israel’s obvious, transparent, shameless guilt, its lies are indulged by western politicians and media outlets. On Monday, Donald Trump repeated that “a lot of the food is stolen” by Hamas. This lie has been contradicted byCindy McCain, director of the World Food Programme, and widow to the hawkishly pro-Israel late Republican senator John McCain. An internal US government analysisfound no proof, and Israeli officials have briefed thattheir militaryreached the same conclusion. Perversely, it iscriminal gangsbacked by Israel – which Netanyahu’s own former deputy noted arelinked to Islamic State– that are stealing aid.The international criminal court’s arrest warrants, issued eight months ago, centred on Israel’s deliberate starvation for a reason: the evidence is overwhelming. Yet even if Gaza were suddenly flooded with aid, many Palestinians would die because their bodies have been irreversibly ravaged by hunger. And that is not even on the agenda.The 73 trucksallowed in on Monday were forced to take an unsafe route, and then looted.Our own prime minister has been promoting airdrops of aid. These are pinpricks, badly targeted and have killed Palestinians when they’ve fallen on their heads. All they really achieve is cover forIsrael, to pretend it is doing something, deflecting from its deliberate mass starvation. But what else should we expect from Starmer, who backed Israel’s right to impose a siege on Gaza at the beginning of the genocide, then tried to gaslight us into believing he hadn’t?What have we done?If western elites had any shame, this question would be robbing them of sleep. And the answer would be straightforward. You facilitated the mass starvation of an entire people. You knew what was happening, because of a deluge of evidence for 21 months, and because the perpetrator – your friend – repeatedly boasted to the world about its crime. Alas, the architects of this abomination will not hold themselves to account. That will be left to history – and the courts.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even over the phone from upstate New York, the venerated graffiti artist is a force to be reckoned with, talking at a breakneck tempo punctuated by bursts of raucous laughter. There’s a sense that this energy might quickly combust too – she admits she “totally lost it” while preparing for her current solo show, Miss Subway NYC, at D’StassiArtin London.The exhibition sees her vividly recreate a New York City subway station. There are paintings in eye-popping colours depicting trains, train yards and playful portraits of the characters you typically see there: a busker in a cat costume, an elderly lady with a shopping cart and a chihuahua. With the help of her husband, fellow graffiti artist Smith, she has even meticulously reproduced layers of tags on the walls from her halcyon days, when she would risk arrest – and sometimes her life – to spray across the city at night. On the show’s opening night, more than 1,000 people showed up to pay their respects to the grande dame of graf.I invited Keith Haring to paint a train. Dude was not down – he didn’t want to break the lawLady Pink was born Sandra Fabara in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1964. Her story begins on her grandparents’ sugarcane plantation in the Amazon rainforest – a vast, wild terrain that, like the snake who met its fate at her feet, didn’t intimidate her. Her mother had returned after leaving Pink’s father, an agricultural engineer who was a “womaniser, gambler, cheater … ”. As soon as she had enough money, when Pink was seven, they left Ecuador for New York City. “When we came here, we had no papers, we didn’t speak the language.”View image in fullscreen‘I cried for a whole month’ … David and Sandra, First Love.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkPink was a self-assured, determined and talented kid who quickly learned how to channel her pain and grief into creativity. She first got into graffiti at 15, after her boyfriend was arrested for tagging and sent to live with relatives in Puerto Rico. “I cried for a whole month, then I started tagging his name everywhere.” A painting in her London show of the artist as a teen kissing a handsome boy pays tribute to this defining moment in her personal history.When she started high school in Queens, she met “kids who knew how to get into yards and tunnels. The more they said, ‘You can’t, you’re a girl,’ the more I had to prove them wrong. I was stubborn as a mule. I was crazy.” As one of the only women accepted by the notoriously macho graffiti scene in New York in the late 1970s, she quickly gained a reputation for tagging subway trains. “We are like a guild, a clannish, tribal group who go out at night and watch each other’s backs.”She later earned her official moniker “Pink” from a fellow member of TC5 crew, Seen. “I was the only female in the city painting, and I needed a female name so everyone would know our crew tolerated a female,” she explains. “I knew I was the token female and that got my foot in the door – but to keep up with the big bad boys, I had to back it up with real talent too. There was sexism of course, but I’m a little bit of a badass. I don’t appreciate being walked over and I stand up strongly for myself. Even if I’m petite, I’m loud. Don’t judge me by my size, judge me by how big and fast I paint!”She added the “Lady” title – at first inspired by the European nobility in the historical romance novels she was reading. “But I don’t write Lady – I’m terrible at the letter Y.” Later she used the Lady title to avoid confusion with the pop singer of the same name – who approached the artist to design her first album cover. “I said, ‘Hell no!’ Are you kidding me? But she’s a fan, I’m not going to say anything bad about her, she’s fine, she sings fine.”View image in fullscreenSubway Village Pink Train, 2022, acrylic on canvas.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkAs a young woman out at night in New York’s most insalubrious neighbourhoods in 1979, Pink was especially vulnerable. “I would dress like a boy and pretend to be a boy. The teens I ran with weren’t much bigger than me and I knew they weren’t there to protect me if shit went down. You’re in the worst neighbourhoods of New York City relying on the kindness of strangers to save your life – you’ve got to be prepared. What happens in the dark alleys of cities, you don’t want to know. You shake a spray can and hope they let you live.”“Bombing” subway trains is one of the most perilous activities of graffiti – “loads of kids have died doing it, getting run over by the trains or electrocuted. It still happens. It’s live electricity: if you touch the rail you will die.” How did she survive? “You don’t stumble in like you’re drunk, it’s like a military manoeuvre. You know the train schedules, where to walk, where to hide. You have all of that figured out ahead of time. You need to be sure where you’re going when you’re running like panicked rats in the dark maze.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She recalls she once sliced her finger open and “it was bleeding badly, it was a terrible cut and I probably should have had it stitched, but I just stuck it in my pocket and it quietly bled in there. I didn’t want people to say: ‘Oh you’re a girl you’re hurt and crying, you’re going to slow us down,’ – you’ve got to be a good soldier.”Another time, there was a near miss with an unforeseen moving train. “I had gone to pee and I thought I could just walk it,” she laughs. “Then there was a train coming and it was doing a weird curve, slanting into the wall. At the last minute I ducked, but if I had stayed standing the train would’ve taken my head off. After that, I just ran at top speed. I can’t believe I survived it.”The 1980s were a whirlwind. She rose to fame in 1983 after featuring in Wild Style, the cult film that launched American hip-hop culture globally. Her spray-painted canvases, horror vacui compositions with bold, attention-grabbing colours of scenes inspired by the street, began to be accepted in conventional, legal art spaces, and in 1984 she was included in MoMA PS1’s The New Portrait alongside Alice Neel, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. “No one was aware it was going to launch anything, we were just in it for the moment and the money. People told us the art market was fickle and eventually we’d have to get jobs.”View image in fullscreen‘It was wild out there’ … Miss Subway NYC 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkOnce she invited Haring to come to paint a train with her. “Just me and him, no machismo – but dude was not down, he didn’t want to cross the line of breaking laws. What he did was chalk on boards. He was a white dude; he wasn’t incurring any kind of arrests. They weren’t graffiti artists, but they were the original street artists. Graffiti artists work with spray, with fonts – and we hit stuff with wheels.”Pink also received an invitation fromJenny Holzer, who was wheatpasting her Truisms posters in Manhattan. “We were like the only women going out at night doing things. She was a tall lady, like two metres, she would wear a hoodie and a big coat so she could pass off as a man going around at night alone. I am very small and I couldn’t pass off like that, so I had to run with a crew. She reached out to me and suggested we collaborate.”Holzer had done up an entire building in the Lower East Side. “It was wild out there at that time, there were a lot of people doing drugs, there was a lot of crime. But she made this beautiful, safe building, and I loved going there and working with her.” Holzer would prep three-metre-square canvases for Lady Pink to spray paint her images on, and Holzer paired them with text. The works were later shown at MoMA and Tate Modern. In 1983, 19-year-old Pink was photographed by Lisa Kahane wearing a vest emblazoned with Holzer’s famous words: “Abuse of power comes as no surprise” – in 2017 the photo went viral as an emblem of the #MeToo movement.View image in fullscreenPlayful portraits … The Strap Hanger, 2025, from Pink’s London exhibition.Photograph: Courtesy of Lady PinkThough artwork sales and interest did wane in the late 1980s, Pink pivoted. She set up a mural company with her husband, doing public commissions and working in communities. While many of her peers “couldn’t handle the business, they couldn’t leave the ghetto behind, they couldn’t show up on time or answer a phone call”, she says she was able to “adapt to polite society. Artists don’t know how to hustle, and you’ve gotta hustle, hustle, hustle. Some don’t have thecojones. But good grief, you’ve got to go knocking on doors!”She stopped illegally painting subway trains decades ago – “now I save my crazy for the galleries” – but the spirit of the subway lives on in the London show. And she says she’s still paying the price for her years of youthful rebellion. Twelve years ago, she and her husband moved upstate after “one too many” police raids on their home in NYC. “They took my stuff – including my husband – and messed with us. We had to spend money on an expensive attorney. They’ve told me to stick to the indoor stuff and not paint big old murals because they inspire people. I said yeah – community people, poets, artists, I should hope I inspire people!”One thing is for sure: she doesn’t have any regrets. “Street art is the biggest art movement, we are in every corner of the world. By whatever means possible, we are taking over this world, it’s our whole plan! I think it’s cool, man – you’ve got to take control of your environment. You don’t need an MA to be an artist, you just need a little paint plus a little courage. Just do it!”Lady Pink: Miss Subway NYC is at D’Stassi Art, London, until late September.Explore more on these topicsArt and designStreet artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s set himself the goal of becoming a five-time Olympic gold medallist’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 30 Jul 2025 10.17 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareWhen I was about 16, I went to Bradgate Park in Leicestershire with a couple of friends. We were there as sunset approached and the landscape became illuminated by beautiful golden-hour light. There were deer and stags all around and I asked one of my friends if I could borrow his camera. It must have been quite annoying for him because I remember wandering off, trying to capture this feeling of mystery and magic.That was the moment I first really felt a sense of excitement for photography and image-making. Before then, I’d visited many museums and art galleries with my mum and was inspired by some of the art we saw. I was particularly drawn to portraits by Vermeer and Rembrandt. I’ve never been good at drawing or painting, but having a camera gave me a tool to express that creative energy.While studying photography at university, I was introduced to mind-blowing work, like Alec Soth’s bookSleeping by the Mississippi. I was struck by hisportrait of a man holding a pair of model aeroplanes. There’s a simplicity to the image, but it’s also powerful and visually striking. I felt drawn to narrative-based documentary portraiture.For my final-year project, I spent time in monastic communities around Britain, making portraits of nuns, monks and other people I encountered within them. That branched out into one of the three long-term projects I’m currently working on,Rivers of Living Water, a wider-ranging series about the Christian faith in Britain, and the diverse nature of its cultures, denominations and perspectives.Fabian is determined to help increase inclusivity in the equestrian communityFabian, who you see in this photograph, is someone I found on Instagram. I was inspired by his story of growing up in inner-city east London, where it was hard for him to pursue his love of horses. He persevered and now competes in eventing competitions, determined to help increase inclusivity in the equestrian community. He’s set himself the goal of becoming a five-time Olympic gold medallist.This was taken in Hertfordshire, near the stables Fabian was using, on a January morning last year. Initially, I went to photograph him a few months before and while we had got some good images the light wasn’t great and we agreed to try again later. On this occasion, just before sunrise, we got this soft pink sky and the field was still covered with beautiful morning frost. Fabian looks incredible in that outfit and the horse, Morgan, also looks amazing.My preferred approach is to take things slowly and spend time with my subject, create a calm energy and capture a sense of who they are. I rarely use film now, but my technique is informed by having used it – I don’t take lots of photographs, but instead wait until there’s a moment of stillness and peace.I love natural light: a lot of my work makes use of evening or morning light or mist. There’sanother shotof Fabian taken about an hour after this one that I’m equally happy with. By then, the frost had mostly gone but the rising winter sun created strong shadows and a warmer tone. In both cases, I didn’t want the photographs to appear staged, I wanted something simple and genuine.I chose to photograph Fabian because I found his story interesting and inspiring. These portraits are about him and his equestrian journey. They are also included in the Rivers of Living Water series. The project encompasses spirituality, peace and serenity, but not every image is obviously religious. There are many that show people going about their everyday lives. My approach is always to try to be respectful and to honour the people I photograph. It’s a way of exploring my own personal faith, too.View image in fullscreenJohn Boaz.Photograph: Brad ManiscalcoJohn Boaz’s CVBorn:Northamptonshire, England.Trained:Visual communication degree at Birmingham City University.Influences:“Paintings are a major inspiration for my work and music, too, helps me develop ideas. I’d name Alec Soth, Alys Tomlinson and Bryan Schutmaat as inspirational.”High point:“Being one of the winners ofPortrait of Britain Volume 7and having one of my portraits as the front cover of the book. Also having my work selected to be part of this year’s Royal Photographic Society International Photography exhibition.Low point:“I sometimes have creative low moments when I feel drained and not inspired or motivated but this does not last long, thankfully. This year a low point was not being chosen as a finalist in the Belfast Photo festival – howeverRivers of Living Waterwas shortlisted so I am grateful for that.”Top tip:“Stay true to who you are and make work you feel led to make. Be inspired by others but do not compare your work in a negative way to them. Be kind and supportive to other artists/photographers’ work and their journey.”John Boaz’s work is part of the RPS International Photography exhibition at theSaatchi Gallery, London, 5 August to 18 September.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And that’s before you consider the challenges …Lucy ManganWed 30 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTShareIt’sThe Traitorson a bus! It’sRace Across the Worldin blindfolds! It’s the BBC’s new reality competition series, Destination X!The premise is simple. A baker’s dozen of contestants assemble at Baden-Baden airport in Germany, from where they are transported via helicopter and a luxuriously appointed coach with blacked-out windows to various mysterious locations in Europe – one an episode – taking part in challenges en route to earn clues to help them work out where they are. At the end of each episode, the contestants enter the “map room” and indicate where they think they are by placing an X. The person who is least accurate is thrown under the bus. The overall winner will net £100,000.The US version is presented byJeffrey Dean Morgan– an unsettling choice for those of us who associate him inextricably with his grotesquely violent character in The Walking Dead, but perhaps Americans feel the need to be protected as they venture into the wilds of Europe in a way that, even post-Brexit, Britons do not. Whatever the reason, we have gone for a warmer, less armed-with-a-barbed-wire-wrapped-baseball-bat approach and given the gig toRob Brydon, in an array of natty suits. “I’m actually Anton Du Beke,” he jokes.The contestants are as carefully cast as ever. We have the sweet, hapless contingent – foremost among them 23-year-old James, who has been on holiday only once without his mum and dad and who describes himself, on this voyage predicated on deep geographical knowledge and cultural inference, as “not the best traveller”. We have the feelings-first brigade, led by poor Deborah, a crime author who is consumed by guilt and self-loathing when she is required to tell a white lie in pursuit of a competitive advantage. Then there are the terrifyingly competitive types, such as the endurance athlete Nick, who was the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world and fibrillates with energy and ambition (“I wouldn’t let a child win something, no”), and the surf school director Ben, hiding his tendencies a bit better under a bonhomous mien and a shock of blond hair. But we see you, Ben. This isn’t our first rodeo.Credit where it’s due, though – it’s Ben who takes one look at the tiny toilet on their coach and suggests they make it a rule that everyone has to sit down “for everything”. Ben has four children.View image in fullscreenThe ‘carefully cast’ contestants … Destination X.Photograph: BBC/TwoFourAs is now de rigueur in reality competition series, a good chunk of the cohort do not make it past the preliminary stage. Three of the 13 fail the first challenge and don’t even make it out of the departure lounge. The remaining 10 go on a disorienting 125-mile helicopter ride, during which Judith, a 28-year-old nuclear engineer, notes that they are flying backwards with the sun to their right and therefore probably southwards. Dawn reckons that flicking through her toddler’s atlas before she set out is likely to have given her the edge.The challenges and rewards are, of course, set up to sow division, requiring alliances and betrayals as the journey unfolds (“I think my competitiveness will alienate me,” says Nick). This will have to be enough to keep viewers watching, because the challenges are baffling. At one point, the contestants find themselves in a picture-lined cubicle in the middle of an unknown market square “bordered by two countries and influenced by all three” and must answer multipart questions to earn the right to peek out of one of two windows; one gives a clue to their location and the other is a red herring, with no way of discerning which is which. A further clue will be presented to the participant who has given the most right answers – although we don’t know what they are – who is then allowed to tell one other person what it is. Are we in Vienna? Or Amsterdam? It becomes slightly hallucinatory and I truly do not know what is going on.Viewers are invited to play along via QR codes and place their own Xs in a virtual map room. This is more involvement in my small-screen entertainment than I like to undertake. But have at it if that’s what floats your boat – possibly down a Dutch canal. Also, where do they speak Flemish, because the local people sound very unusual here, but the street signs are in French, despite there being a Café Mozart – what gives?Destination X does not close like a vice around you in the manner of The Traitors, nor does it have the cockle-warming aspect of Race Across the World. But it’s fun to go along for the ride.Destination X aired onBBCOne and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVRob BrydonBBCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her line to Paltrow eventually fell silent, and her book,Gwyneth, has just been published to much buzz, without the star’s participation. Paltrow, a source claimed to Odell, “inventedghosting”.Now, post-publication, you can picture dozens more being cast out of her golden glow. Odell spoke to more than 220 people for her book, on and off the record; more rebuffed her. “Many were terrified to talk about Gwyneth,” she writes.The result is nonetheless thoughtful, fair and fastidiously researched – even without Paltrow’s oversight. It is also brimming over with gossip. Here are 10 standout topics.Gwyneth Paltrow may be the signature nepo babyPaltrow’s pedigree makes many of the “nepo babies” (lately singled outfor havingbeen given a leg-upinto Hollywood) look like competition winners. Her mother, Blythe Danner, is a critically acclaimed actor of stage and screen (best known to a younger generation as the mother in Meet the Parents). She met Bruce Paltrow when he was producing one of her plays.Gwyneth and her younger brother, Jake, grew up in a five-storey brownstone close to Central Park in New York. She attended the Spence school, a private girls’ school on the Upper East Side, along with Mick Jagger’s daughter Jade and the princesses Alexandra and Olga of Greece (“their last name just ‘of Greece’,” adds Odell).Her parents’ connections came into play before she had even finished school. For her senior project, she covered a Bonnie Raitt song – accompanied by Steely Dan’s singer, Donald Fagen. Soon after, at 19, she landed a speaking part in Hook, directed by Steven Spielberg – her godfather, “Uncle Morty”. (He called her “Gwynnie the Pooh”.)Many years later, Paltrow would tell Vanity Fair that fame had felt to her “like a predestined thing” – that she had known her “whole life that this was going to happen”.View image in fullscreenBlythe Danner, Gwyneth, Bruce and Jake Paltrow in 1991.Photograph: Jim Smeal/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesHer parents tried to give her a normal childhood. Sort of …Blythe and Bruce weren’t as confident that acting would work out, Odell writes: they wanted their daughter to have “a backup plan”. After Paltrow was rejected from Vassar College, her parents asked their friend, two-time Academy Award-winner Michael Douglas, to put in a word at his alma mater. She was accepted by the University of California, Santa Barbara (Douglas gets it done!), but ended up dropping out. Studying film, she had been dismayed to find Uncle Morty on the syllabus. “I’m sitting here learning about people I know,” another aspiring actor recalls Paltrow complaining.Bruce cut her off financially, and she was forced to get a waitressing gig (though again, through her parents’ connections). “I remember she was so mad about it,” the actor told Odell. Years later – after she had won an Oscar forShakespeare in Love, broken off her engagement to Brad Pitt and gone, according to one account, “totally Hollywood” – Bruce sought again to keep his daughter humble, telling her she’d become “kind of an asshole”. Paltrow was “devastated”, she said, but eventually grateful for the course correction. Fame had gone to her head, she admitted: “There is nothing worse for the growth of a human being than not having obstacles and disappointments.”It pays to know your beluga from your oscietraPitt and Paltrow met in 1993, auditioning for Legends of the Fall. She was passed over for the part but made an impression on Pitt, who went on to suggest she play his character’s wife in David Fincher’s Se7en. Paltrow had also been offered Feeling Minnesota alongside Keanu Reeves. As she dithered, a helpful friend suggested: “Who do you want to date, Brad Pitt or Keanu Reeves?” Paltrow said yes to Se7en. Not long into filming, she and Pitt were together – delighting her father, who reportedly crowed to a friend: “Can you believe my daughter? It’s fucking Brad Pitt!”View image in fullscreenGolden couple … Paltrow and Pitt at the Ivy, London, in the early 1990s.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAccording to Odell, Paltrow was never so certain, finding Pitt – from a southern, conservative, religious background – a bit beneath her. “When we go to restaurants and order caviar, I have to say to Brad, ‘This is beluga and this is oscietra,’” she told an interviewer.After two years together, they broke off their engagement. She went on to date Ben Affleck, who she found to be more her intellectual match (not to mention – as she disclosedonly in 2023– a “technically excellent” lover). But Affleck’s addiction issues, penchant for video games and what one of Paltrow’s friends remembers as his “kind of miserable” vibe prevented the relationship from progressing.Before there was Brad, Ben or Chris, there were cigsCigarettes may have been Paltrow’s first love. She started smoking in her first year at Spence, much to Bruce’s displeasure. Seeking to get his teenage daughter to quit, he once again leaned on his connections, calling in a favour with his friend’s son’s new wife – AKA Madonna – asking her to “write a note to Gwyneth to discourage her”. According to Odell, Madonna happily played model, describing her average day: “I wake up, I don’t smoke … And I go home a happy healthy me. … PS: Good girls live longer.”View image in fullscreenOn a cigarette break while filming Great Expectations.Photograph: Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesGwyneth showed the letter off at school, then displayed it, framed, in her bedroom – and continued to smoke “a pack a day, probably” until she was 25. She eventually quit in September 1997 after spending three days marooned on a deserted island in Belize. Paltrow had requested the experience as a condition of guest-editing an issue of Marie Claire. Magazine budgets were bigger back then.Paltrow was Weinstein’s ‘golden girl’ – before she helped bring him downOdell describes Paltrow as being ambivalent about fame – and scornful of “tacky, pointless, big, fluffy, unimportant movies”. She found her professional home in Miramax Films, Harvey Weinstein’s production company, after being cast in the 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma. Odell describes Weinstein working hard to make Paltrow a star, throwing his formidable weight and influence behind her Oscar bid for Shakespeare in Love. Her 1999 triumph over Cate Blanchett (nominated for Elizabeth) was later attributed to Weinstein’s intense campaign. Even Paltrow had her doubts, betting a pair of CAA agents $10,000 she wouldn’t win. (She made good, going to the bank the morning after the ceremony.)But being Weinstein’s “golden girl” didn’t come without costs, least of all pressure to do lacklustre parts or press. As Paltrow told the New York Times for their seismic #MeToo report, early in her working relationship with Weinstein, he made a pass at her at a Beverly Hills hotel. (Weinstein disputed her account.) In their book She Said, the journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey describe Paltrow’s pivotal role in their investigation. “When so many other actresses were reluctant to get on the phone and scared to tell the truth … Gwyneth was actually one of the first.”She was one of the first women we love to hateAs well as having been born rich, beautiful and well connected, Paltrow is described by Odell as possessing some “exceptional, if hard to define” X-factor, registering as far back as her school days. This worked against her as much as it did in her favour. Even before becoming an Oscar winner aged 26, Paltrow feared overexposure in the press. Hertearful acceptance speech, coupled with news that her father bought her the diamond necklace she’d been loaned for the ceremony, turned the public against her.Building women up before tearing them down is now a well-worn cycle, Odell notes, pointing to Anne Hathaway and Blake Lively (you might also add Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Swift). Paltrow was one of the first victims, if not the blueprint. In 2013, she was named Star magazine’s most hated celebrity, 19 spots above Chris Brown, who had been arrested for assaulting Rihanna four years earlier. “Gwyneth would never manage to outrun” the contempt, Odell writes – perhaps influencing her subsequent decision to make it work for her with Goop.It is interesting how different people’s bodies areView image in fullscreenWith Jack Black in Shallow Hal.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxPaltrow was ahead of the curve with many modern movements and trends; body positivity was emphatically not one of them. Schoolmates recall her evident “disdain for fat people”. One remembered changing into swimsuits next to the “naturally skinny” Gwyneth, and her comment: “Isn’t it interesting how different people’s bodies are?” In her senior yearbook, alongside Gwyneth’s chosen quote from Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, editors specified her nightmare: “Obesity”. Later, when she was famous, she allegedly paid for a school friend to undergo an abdominoplasty (or “tummy tuck”).Paltrow’s defining interest in healthy eating, alternative medicine and “wellness” began after her father was diagnosed with throat cancer. While caring for Bruce, she began researching preservatives, pesticides and environmental toxins; she started following a macrobiotic diet and doing nearly two hours of yoga before dawn, six days a week. Meanwhile, she was also shooting Shallow Hal, “spending her working hours in a fat suit”, Odell observes. Doing press, Paltrow described the film as a “love letter”, and the experience of making it as edifying. “I got a real sense of what it would be like to be that overweight, and every pretty girl should be forced to do that.”Paltrowinvented wellness – for Goop and badAlong with her passion for “alternative” ideas of health, the seeds for Goop had been sown years earlier, on the sets of Jefferson in Paris and The Talented Mr Ripley. In Paris and Ischia, Paltrow tapped local crew for their recommendations for the best hotels, restaurants and shopping on location – insider info around which she would later build a lifestyle brand. In 2007, she shot a public television show about Spanish cuisine – “a novel premise” at the time, Odell notes (and one that riled the late Anthony Bourdain,who said of the series: “Why would you go to Spain with the one bitch who refuses to eat ham?”).Paltrow was married to Coldplay’s Chris Martin by then, with two young children, and she was beginning to tire of acting. After the success of Iron Man in 2008, she turned to her side project: an online newsletter. Goop sought to “nourish the inner aspect”, but timing was not on its side. The website launched the week after the stock market crash; Jezebel declared Paltrow “about as publicly savvy as Marie Antoinette”. Yet she was proved right in her instinct to let them eat banana-nut muffins (her inaugural recipe). In 2008, the wellness industry “was barely even measured”, Odell writes; today it is valued in the trillions.There’s no controversy you can’t style out. Even an ‘eccentric stone sex egg’Paltrow was probably one of the first celebrities to conceive of herself as a brand, paving the way for today’s saturation of product lines and endorsement deals – and shaping consumer culture. Among the trends and treatments she helped to popularise were Spanx, cupping, gluten-free diets and, more recently,mouth-taping.View image in fullscreenThe infamous Yoni Egg.Photograph: GoopEven the bonkers ones took off with Goop’s endorsement. After a “vaginal steaming” treatment featured in its 2015 Santa Monica city guide, bookings doubled. Odell describes Paltrow being unfazed by controversy, and even relishing it as good for business. In 2017, Goop went viral for featuring an egg-shaped stone, designed to be inserted vaginally and worn (?) overnight (!) so as to “balance the cycle” and “invigorate our life force”.In a staff meeting, Paltrow was reportedly staunch in the face of ridicule: “Goop defined the concept of modern wellness … Let’s own it.” Once again, she was right. The company had ordered 600 “Yoni” eggs; after the backlash, the waiting list to buy them, for about $60 each, was 2,000 names long. When Goop was sued the next year by regulators for making allegedly unlawful health claims,Paltrow chose to pay $145,000 to settle, without admitting wrongdoing; the claims about the eggs disappeared from Goop’s website, but they were still on sale earlier this year.Dubious claims pay – and Paltrow always winsOdell notes the irony: for all Paltrow’s enthusiasm to factcheck her biography, she was not so exacting or hands-on with the articles published on Goop. Among the famously dubious claims platformed by the site were the healing powers of celery juice and raw (unpasteurised) goat milk, a possible link between bras and breast cancer, and every word uttered by Anthony William, the so-called “medical medium”. (“We used him when we needed page views,” one former Goop employee admitted to Odell.)Gwyneth: The Biography by Amy Odell review – Gwyn and bear itRead moreOdell makes a valiant effort to factcheck every claim she references in her book, quoting medical experts and Paltrow’s many critics to counterbalance all the Goop. But, at a certain point in the narrative, you sense it become futile: wellness is no longer a celebrity foible, a trapping of “Gwyneth’s extravagant and eccentric life”, but the water we are all drowning in. On social media, influencers – many in Paltrow’s image – spread advice with little oversight or regulation, while trends have had to become more extreme to cut through the noise. After 20 years of Goop, the world has become harder to shock, more receptive to “alternative” ideas of health and medicine, and even sceptical of science. Today the wellness industry is as big as the US pharmaceutical and agricultural industries combined.By stoking fear about “toxins”, encouraging people to “do their own research” and seeding distrust in the medical establishment, Paltrow – Odell suggests – paved the way for the conspiratorial, anti-expert, post-truth thinking now embedded in Donald Trump’s White House. Both Paltrow and Robert F Kennedy Jr – Trump’s vaccine sceptic secretary for health and human services – are avowed fans of raw milk; the real harbinger of end-times will be if she starts eating red meat.Meanwhile, Paltrow continues to sail through with the seemingly untouchable self-belief that has made her such a compelling celebrity to adore, abhor and emulate. “She is fucking borderline brilliant,” Odell quotes a former Goop executive as saying. “GP knows exactly what she’s doing.”Explore more on these topicsGwyneth PaltrowBiography booksShakespeare in LovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

To be fair, Neeson has more career capital to lose than Nielsen did. He deadpans it impeccably, but perhaps doesn’t quite have Nielsen’s eerie innocence. In any case, it doesn’t stop this reboot of the Naked Gun franchise from being a lot of fun: amiably ridiculous, refreshingly shallow, entirely pointless and guilelessly crass. It is a life-support system for some outrageous gags, including sensational riffs on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sex and the City, and one showstopping are-they-really-gonna-do-it reference to OJ Simpson, who featured in the original films.David Zucker, co-creator of those and the Airplane! films, isreportedly dissatisfied with this new versionfrom the team of director Akiva Schaffer and co-writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand. A spoof of a spoof is always going to be a potential problem, but Schaffer et al canter entertainingly through their succession of absurdist scenarios – and at one stage contrive a classic Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker homage: a moment of mayhem followed by a wide-shot of people queueing up obediently for violence, like Airplane!’s line of (hitherto unseen) passengers.Neeson plays Det Lt Frank Drebin Jr, who is the son of the LA cop once played by Nielsen, and haunted in a rather Freudian way by his late father’s reputation. He is given to making yearning monologues addressed to Drebin Sr’s presence, begging him to send a sign “like an owl or something”. Paul Walter Hauser plays his stolid partner Capt Ed Hocken Jr, son of Drebin Sr’s partner who was once played by George Kennedy. The next-gen Drebin investigates the possible murder of a man found dead at the wheel of a hi-tech electric car, and must confront the sinister Muskalike plutocrat who invented this vehicle; this is Richard Cane, played byDanny Huston.Drebin then falls in love with the dead man’s sister Beth, a true-crime novelist played byPamela Anderson. When Drebin first sees Beth, he has an ecstatic voiceover about what I can only describe as her person; it finishes with a quite extraordinarily bizarre and offensive tribute which caused the audience I was in to go into gibbering shock. The memory of this amusing line recurred like PTSD throughout the film’s running time.The new Naked Gun has the look and feel of an 80s LA action movie, with sense-memories of Beverly Hills Cop and Terminator. The first rush of Frank and Beth’s romance is represented by an uproariously extended winter-sports-themed pop video of the sort beloved by Wham! fans. There is no reason for this new Naked Gun to exist other than the reason for the old ones: it’s a laugh, disposable, forgettable, enjoyable.The Naked Gun is out on 1 August in the UK and US, and on 21 August in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCrime filmsLiam NeesonPamela AndersonDanny HustonComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The final price of the property, which has lain unused and derelict for more than 20 years, could be in the region of £336,000.The building, regarded by conservators as a jewel of late-modernist British architecture, was designed by the highly regarded architect Peter Womersley in 1972. It was created for the textile designer Bernat Klein, whose clients included Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent.View image in fullscreenPeter Womersley as a student in 1953 with one of his models.Photograph: ANL/Rex/ShutterstockThe studio was built near Klein’s home so he could work on designs, meet clients and display his products. The category A-listed building – Scotland’s highest preservation rating – has been on its at-risk register for more than 20 years because of neglect.Despite its fame and rarity,Savillslisted the studio with a guide price of £18,000, but a flurry of bids, online and by telephone, quickly pushed the price up in increments of £5,000 until it reached more than £270,000.At that stage, it edged up by smaller sums until reaching a final hammer price of £279,000. Savills was reticent about publiclyconfirming the total price but with VAT at 20% and a sales fee of £1,900 (including VAT), that suggests the final cost for the coalition could reach approximately £336,700.The coalition is liable to pay land and buildings transaction tax, Scotland’s version of stamp duty, on the total purchase price and is working out how much that will be.Prof Alison Harley, the chair of trustees for the Bernat Klein Foundation which was set up to preserve and disseminate the textile designer’s work, said: “We are delighted that after many years the future for Klein’s studio looks very bright.”View image in fullscreenThe coalition’s immediate task is to carry out urgent repairs to stabilise the building.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe coalition crowdfunded£33,000 in donationsand National Trust for Scotland also offered financial backing for the purchase. The National Lottery Heritage Fund has also indicated it would accept a funding application towards the studio’s restoration.The coalition estimates it could cost up to £3m to restore the studio under the supervision of the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust (SHBT). Its immediate task is to carry out urgent repairs to stabilise the building, repair its flat roof and assess the condition of the concrete cladding.Dr Samuel Gallacher, the director of SHBT, said: “The scale of the repair and restoration required at Peter Womersley’s Bernat Klein Studio is extensive and will take many months, the skills of specialists and the support of the many people who have an interest in both Peter Womersley and Bernat Klein’s work.”Heritage groups try to save decaying modernist studio in Scottish BordersRead moreThe building is in a dilapidated state and surrounded by security fencing in overgrown grounds, with rolls of razor wire running along an elevated walkway and entrance.A burst internal water pipe caused severe damage some years ago and wrangles with Scottish Borders council over a planning application to fit a second internal kitchen and convert the studio into a home added to the delay in maintaining the empty property.Many of the building’s painted metal panels are buckled, corroded and stained by water penetration and several windows are shattered and boarded up. The end of one of its horizontal concrete cantilevers has sheared off and graffiti has been sprayed on internal walls.View image in fullscreenBernat Klein with examples of his textiles in 1964.Photograph: Mirrorpix/GettyThe current owners’ decision to put the property up for auction surprised the coalition which was in talks to buy the building privately. Savills said the owners were not willing to be interviewed.Klein and Womersley, who was known locally for driving around in a red E-type Jaguar, were close friends. The architect also designed the Klein family’s home,High Sunderland, next door to the studio in Selkirk in the late 1950s.The coalition, which has been supported by Scottish Borders council, plans to reopen the studio as a permanent home for the Bernat Klein Foundation and as a base for exhibitions, workshops and talks on textiles and architecture.Explore more on these topicsHeritageArchitectureScotlandPropertyTextile artnewsShareReuse this content"

The best joke of the fringe award – the lighthearted, groan-inducing staple of the Edinburgh festival –has been scrapped after 17 years.The award’s retirement may not prompt national mourning, but it does bring to an end a curious fringe tradition – one that delivered easy headlines as well as endless debate.Launched in 2008, the award set out to distil the spirit of the festival into a single one-liner. Longlisted by a panel of critics and then voted on by the public, it aimed to showcase the sharpest bite-size humour from that year’s fringe. Still, the announcement was never without controversy. In 2023, whenLorna Rose Treen took the titlewith the joke “I started dating a zookeeper, but it turned out he was a cheetah”, she was met with a wave of online criticism (the Sun claimed her win had “killed comedy”). Last year, an article in the Herald deemed the award Edinburgh’s “most heated controversy”.The backlash feels somewhat overblown for an award that was simply a celebration of something meant to make people laugh.Comedyis inherently subjective, and everyone is never going to like exactly the same thing. But we all like a good (or at least eye-roll-worthy) joke. Just look at how much time we dedicate to reading the ones from Christmas crackers; it’s not necessarily about their quality, but the shared joy they bring.On this level, the award made sense. Digestible punchlines are entertaining – we can steal them for ourselves, repeat them in our social circles and hopefully elicit some hearty snorts. And at one of the world’s biggest comedy festivals, it’s hardly surprising that people would want to crown the year’s most crowd-pleasing quip. Still, the idea that the art of live comedy can be condensed into a single line is undeniably flawed. How many times have you been told a “funny story” and found yourself unmoved?The act of relaying humour is a difficult task. For standup in particular, a joke can’t be separated from its setting. While the fringe’s best joke list tended to be pun-heavy, jokes don’t always land in isolation. They live in a comedian’s energy, the crowd’s mood and the rhythm of the moment. Stripped of this context and presented simply as written words in a list, even the most dynamic line can fall flat.Perhaps that’s why the list often felt underwhelming: it ignored the bigger picture. There’s no mention of physical comedy, timing or tone, which are crucial ingredients to bringing humour to life onstage. The shows that made me laugh hardest across the festival, as both a critic and, more recently, as a judge on the Edinburgh Comedy Awards, rarely got a look in from the best joke award list. Last year’s winner for best newcomer,Joe Kent-Walters, transformed himself into Frankie Monroe, a Rotherham working men’s club MC, complete with corpse-like, Sudocrem-white face paint and leering movements. Did his hour consist of neat, packable humour? Absolutely not, but it was genuine, full-body comedy that stayed with me long after the show ended.Similarly, the year before,Julia Masli’s show,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, became a word-of-mouth hit. Masli, a clown by training, took on the role of an agony aunt of few words. There was nothing close to a standard joke in her act; instead, it lived on the curiously trusting relationship she built with the audience. There were plenty of confessions and practical solutions, but no linguistic wit. It was all the funnier for it.It is unlikely that anyone reading the best joke award lists from years gone by would have let out a guffaw. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that the award was a welcome addition to the general merriment of the fringe – so much so that the unofficial ISH Comedy Awardshave announced that they’d be running their own best joke award this year. The punchline can live on. That, at least, should be a cause for celebration.Anya Ryan is a freelance journalist.

They’re all dying off. It’s heartbreaking. I can’t believe he’s gone.”He said he missed Osbourne’s final concert as he was abroad. “It was one of those times when you think there’ll probably be another time. We didn’t expect him to pass away.

She gave young people from all walks of life the chance to pursue their performing arts skills to the highest standard.“Her rare ability to recognise raw talent and encourage all her students contributed to the richness of today’s theatre and music world, even winning herself an Olivier award along the way. She believed hard work with a bit of luck brought success and she was an example of that herself.”Young, who grew up in London’s East End and was one of nine children, founded the Sylvia Young theatre school in 1981 in Drury Lane in centralLondonbefore it moved to Marylebone two years later.The school produced a conveyor belt of talent with alumni including actors such as Billie Piper, the TV presenter Denise van Outen and Winehouse.Youngtold the Guardianthat reading was a refuge for her growing up and she would consume dozens of plays, but she was a reluctant performer herself even after joining a theatre club.She said: “I used to lose my voice before every production. When I think about it, they were sort of panic attacks.”She said she never intended to start a school, but it gradually grew out of drama classes she would hold for children at her two daughters’ primary school.‘I don’t want any stage school brats!’: Sylvia Young on nurturing Billie Piper, Daniel Kaluuya and a host of starsRead moreYoung said there was no way to tell which children would go on to be successful. “You see the ones that should, but it doesn’t always work. It is talent, but it’s also the right job at the right time,” she said. “Pure luck.”Ruffelle said in her social media post: “Above all, she leaves the memory of an East End girl who worked hard to achieve her goals, took hold of life and lived it to the full.”The McFly star Tom Fletcher met his wife, the podcaster and presenter Giovanna Fletcher, at the school, which they attended from the age of 13. Young was at their wedding.In a tribute, Giovanna Fletcher posted on Instagram: “My life would not be what it is without Sylvia Young. I remember watching Sylvia on Live and Kicking when I was 12 years old, she was talking about her school and all the fun they had there.“I phoned up for a brochure and applied for a scholarship without telling my mum and dad. I didn’t get the scholarship, but I got a place with a ‘deal’ attached because Sylvia wanted me there – something I quickly learned the majority of the 140 students had.”She continued: “I loved sitting in Sylvia’s office and watching her work. She was meticulous, she knew what every child was up to and how to get the best out of everyone, she was devoted to helping her kids and I know how much she cared for each of us. Sometimes she cared when others didn’t – helping some incredible talent flourish in the process.”In a comment on Young’s daughters’ social media post, the actor Bonnie Langford added: “Such sad news, Sylvia was such an inspiring, kind and generous person.“She made a difference to so many and will be missed by so many, love to all the family and all those who she made feel were her family. Heartfelt condolences to you Frances and Alison and to Stephen and all the team.”The radio presenter Tony Blackburn, who was a friend of Young, also paid tribute in a post on X.He said: “So sorry to hear Sylvia Young has passed away, she founded the Sylvia Young theatre school which has been responsible for starting so many careers in TV and theatre. She was a very lovely lady who I have had the privilege of knowing for many years. She will be sadly missed.”Young was the subject of an episode of This Is Your Life in 1998, and received an OBE in 2005 for her service to the arts.She married Norman Ruffelle in London in 1961 and is the grandmother of the singer Eliza Doolittle.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTelevisionSchoolsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

His bandmates in his subsequent band, More, shared the news, acknowledging Day as “a huge part of the new wave of British heavy metal” and “a well-loved figure in British rock music”.Maiden bassist Steve Harris recruited Day in late 1975; the band gave their first live performance in Poplar, London on 1 May 1976 and then held a residency at a pub in nearby Stratford.Day remained with the group for 10 months, but left after being accused of lacking energy and charisma. His replacement, Dennis Wilcock, was similarly short-lived, ultimately replaced by Paul Di’Anno, who was fired for drug and alcohol abuse and replaced by long-term vocalist Bruce Dickinson.In 2019, Day said of his firing: “Steve was saying, ‘You’ve got to get better. You’ve got to be more in the audience’s face. You’ve got to be commanding. You’ve got to be a hero.’ And I agreed with him, but I didn’t actually know how to make that happen.“I got a warning for maybe three months: ‘Get it together. Get it together.’ And I wanted to, I just didn’t know how to do it. So the funny thing is, the worst experience was the best lesson because when I got that notice and I felt so gutted, it changed me.“Iron Maiden at that time were nothing, honestly … What Steve was doing was trying to make the band big. He knew what he wanted. What he wanted is what he got. He got one of the biggest bands on the planet. As much as it hurt, as much as it upset me, I learnt a big lesson that day. I really did. I used that emotion, I guess, in my singing.”In 1980, Day formed the heavy metal group More and remained with the band until 1982, playing at the famous Donington Monsters of Rock festival in 1981. During his time with the group, they also supported Maiden on the 1981 Killers tour. He later joined the band Wildfire and then fronted the reformed glam rockers Sweet, whose guitarist Andy Scott paid tribute: “We needed a singer and when Paul arrived for the audition we looked no further.”After moving to Australia, Day remained active as a musician. He spent some of his later years being cared for in a hospice. He is survived by his wife Cecily.Explore more on these topicsIron MaidenMetalnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a novel with no clever structural devices or burden of symbolism and a setting so limited geographically that the reader ends up knowing precisely where everything is.It is narrated by Bo, a former timbermill worker who has reached the age when people worry about him, and has a network of carers calling in three times a day. One of Ridzén’s inspirations was the team journal kept by the carers looking after her dying grandfather; very movingly, bulletins from the journal of Bo’s carers punctuate his narrative, the alternative perspective like a chill breeze through a briefly opened door.Bo lives in the Swedish far north, surrounded by the sort of woods, lakes and meadows that are a paradise for dogs but a constant worry for the adult children of old men who persist in living somewhere so remote. His adored wife, Frederika, no longer knows who he is and has been taken away to a dementia care home, imposing on Bo a kind of living bereavement. His one close friend, Ture, a man local gossips have down as a “confirmed bachelor”, has also reached the stage of being cared for around the clock, but the two old men enjoy regular catch-ups on their geriatric-friendly mobiles. His other great love is a dog, Sixten, an elkhound who needs far more exercise than Bo can now possibly give him, but is a constant presence at his side or on his bed. Bo also has a fiftysomething son called Hans, a divorced conservative and worrier, and a student granddaughter, Ellinor.The plot, such as it is, involves Bo becoming ever frailer and Hans threatening to have Sixten rehomed, now that walking a dog in rugged terrain has become too perilous for a man prone to falling over. However, almost from the first page, Bo’s first-person, present-tense narrative is enriched by repeated dreamlike digressions. These take us out of the grim present realities of adult nappies, phlegm cups and frozen ready meals into stories of a country boyhood overshadowed by a cruel and brutal father, the happy marriage into which young Bo escaped, the adorable little boy Hans was before he somehow turned into an overweight, fretful bully, and Bo’s long friendship and regular fishing trips with the ambiguous Ture.Bo faces the challenge of overcoming his masculine conditioning so as not to die with love unexpressedBo is haunted by a peculiarly male anger – the scarring, remembered rages of his father and his own bursts of rage at his increasing lack of independence that somehow stops him telling Hans what he really feels. As Bo’s end draws near, he faces the twin challenges of keeping his beloved Sixten at his side and overcoming his masculine conditioning so as not to die with love unexpressed.Another element, hinted at in the title, is the steady parade of seasonal changes all about his little house, as the year moves from the glories of May, through the pale nights of midsummer, to golden autumn and the arrival of bitter cold. The sense of place is conjured deftly – Ridzén is describing the landscape on her doorstep near Östersund – but just as evocative are the many mentions of Swedish food, from the tinned fishballs and microwaved stew served by the carers, which are evidently inferior to thefiskbullarand lingonberry-enhanced roasts once made by Frederika, to the superior almond tarts, ormazariner,served by Ture, all of which had me googling recipes to try at home.At a couple of slightly awkward points, translator Alice Menzies has the characters talk a northern English, presumably as an equivalent for northern Swedish dialect, but there was really no need. Anyone anywhere who has worried for a crumbling parent, or worried about the crumble in themselves, or simply worried that their dog understood them better than their family, will identify with Ridzén’s novel and take it to heart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It’s a vibrant, funny, complicated allegory of a down-at-heel launderette in a dreary London parade of shops, which gets laundered and cleaned up by south Asians who are subjected to nothing but racist abuse. It was formerly called Churchill’s Laundrette and now cheekily renamed Powders, in homage to washing powder or to income from a different powder which this place is going to launder.It is a sharp, smart picture, with English eccentricity, sly quirk and political subversion, that represents a brilliant and almost unique engagement with contemporary history in 80s British cinema: a satire of Mrs Thatcher’s Britain which involved playing Toryism at its own game. This was the world in which the Conservative government brought inthe Enterprise Allowance Scheme to bring down the unemployment-claimant figures, but found that immigration stimulated enterprise. Kureishi’s writing was part of the new energy of postcolonial literature; it came from the same place as Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children and Timothy Mo’s Sour Sweet.There are terrific performances from those titans of British-Indian acting: Roshan Seth and Saeed Jaffrey as brothers Nasser and Hussein Ali; Nasser is a melancholy intellectual socialist with a drinking problem; Hussein is a rackety businessman, poignantly in love with his white lover Rachel (Shirley Anne Field). Hussein hires Nasser’s apparently gormless son Omar (Gordon Warnecke) to run his crumbling launderette – and Omar figures out that with a little imagination and by siphoning off drug profits belonging to his cousin Salim (Derrick Branche) he can turn this into the most beautiful and lucrative launderette in London. But Omar has a secret: he is gay and in love with Johnny, played byDaniel Day-Lewisin his first lead film role, a white punk tearaway who once marched in the streets with the racists but now feels something for Omar and remembers Nasser’s kindness to him as a child.My Beautiful Laundrette is a vivid time capsule for the gloomy London streets of that time; it’s also an essay in gentrification, like Mike Leigh’s High Hopes and John Mackenzie’s The Long Good Friday – and it’s a reminder of a time when videotapes and VCRs were almost unimaginably exciting consumer goods. Day-Lewis at this stage had not quite evolved into the mature screen actor that he was soon to be, and tough-guy fisticuffs were not exactly his forte, but he always sold it with conviction; this was a homophobic era when gay love, presented clearly and unapologetically, was a rarity. Warnecke’s line readings feel perhaps a little bit theatrical sometimes, but he has enormous charm and presence. Rita Wolf is excellent as Tania, the exasperated cousin to whom Omar is expected to marry but who wants and demands more.“How could anyone call this silly little island home?” asks one of Omar’s relatives. But they do, and that complex, love-hate relationship is the film’s fabric.My Beautiful Laundrette is in UK cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsStephen FrearsHanif KureishiDaniel Day-LewisSaeed JaffreyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, they may be the new princes or the new marquesses of horror anyway; I can’t think of anyone who outranks them. The Philippou brothers grabbed audiences by the throat withtheir debut Talk to Me, and now they’re back with a macabre new adventure set on their home turf of suburban Adelaide in South Australia. It takes place in a bizarre house with a triangular empty swimming pool destined to be filled with rainwater as the film’s bad weather continues into the horrible finale.Bring Her Back gives a great villainous role toSally Hawkinsand a terrifically smart debut for non-professional teen Sora Wong. It’s a horror preying with hideous expertise on our protective instincts towards the vulnerable, our fear of our own vulnerability, the shame and guilt of abuse, and survivors’ wretched sense of loyalty to their abusers. And the theme of blindness and visual impairment might even call to mind the unreconstructed attitudes of movies such as Wait Until Dark and Don’t Look Now.Andy (Billy Barratt) and his partially sighted stepsister Piper (Wong) are orphaned when their cruel widower father dies of some kind of seizure in the shower. They are fostered by an odd woman called Laura, played by Hawkins, who is grieving the loss of her own (blind) daughter and already looking after a disturbed boy called Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips). She is creepily matey, always yelping and chirruping with forced laughter and misjudged jokes, a mask of mumsiness which slips when Andy reveals that on his 18th birthday he intends to apply for parental custody of Piper and they will move away.But his ability to do this will depend on a reference from Laura, who begins a campaign to undermine him and subtly terrorise Piper. In private, she likes to watch a certain VHS videotape – a relic whose antique oddity is endowed with something uncanny – which she has perhaps purchased from the dark web; a tape showing a group of Russian-speakers who have unusual ideas about how to deal with grief and loss … ideas that Laura wants to put into practice.The Philippou brothers have a diabolical talent, not just for the jump scare but the slo-mo cringe-scare, the squirm-scare and the writhe-in-your-seat scare. It is brought to the fore in a grisly scene in which Laura insists on coming to the funeral of Piper and Andy’s father and impresses on Andy the need to carry out certain healing traditions and observances towards the dead of which he was (understandably) unaware. The whole thing is underscored by barnstorming performances from Wong and Hawkins.Bring Her Back is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsSally HawkinsreviewsShareReuse this content"

His new film is if anything more visceral, with waking-nightmare images captured in pin-sharp 4K digital clarity. It is a moment-by-moment account of his experience embedded with Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade in 2023 (one of them appears to be a Brit) during Zelenskyy’s highly anticipated counteroffensive, making a gruelling journey along what amounts to a two-kilometre corridor of “forest”.In fact, it is scrubland offering no real cover – but it is free of Russian mines, unlike the areas of farmland either side. The forces brutally fight every metre of the way, heading for the symbolic liberation of the largely ruined village of Andriivka in north-easternUkraine. They are carrying a precious Ukrainian flag, and it is their mission to fix this to any broken bit of wall they can find, to proclaim their national spirit is not dead. They are in a wasteland, as one says: “It’s like landing on a planet where everyone is trying to kill you. But it’s the middle of Europe.”Chernov is armed only with a camera, to the astonishment of many soldiers he encounters, and the film was constructed by editing his footage together with that of solders’ helmet cameras and drone material. Chernov shows us how drones are now utterly ubiquitous in war, delivering both the pictures and the assaults. That is the ultra-modern, even postmodern aspect of this film, but it coexists with an eerie resemblance to the eastern front of the first world war. Chernov, in one of his murmuringly subdued voiceovers, comments: “The smell of death, explosives and freshly cut trees.”‘The soldiers want you to see what they’re going through’: the heartbreaking follow-up to 20 Days in MariupolRead moreThe wrecked landscape does indeed look like 1916, and Chernov does not scruple to show us real dead bodies (but spares us the ultimate horror of the corpses’ faces). When the intertitles flash up the grim advances – 1,000 meters to go, 300 metres to go – it is like the cricket-style scoreboard for the Battle of the Somme in Richard Attenborough’s film ofOh! What a Lovely War: “Ground gained: nil.”The most heart-wrenching moments come when Chernov interviews soldiers in a quiet moment, their twentysomething faces alive with intelligence – and in a sombre voiceover tells us how they were killed four or five months later. It is a (repeated) flourish that might be considered on the verge of bad taste, but Chernov manages it with such unflinching conviction. Since the events of this film, Russia has counter-counterattacked and retaken Andriivka; though now we hear Trump has soured on Putin. A Ukrainian soldier surveys the wreck of Andriivka and says: “Everything will grow back.”2000 Meters to Andriivka is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It feels befitting of Mackenzie’s rather madcap interwar story featuring a Bloomsbury-style group of lesbians on the fictional island of Sirene.Under the nifty direction of Paul Foster, we follow their romantic shenanigans, sparked by the seductive central figure of Rosalba (Amy Ellen Richardson, magnetic), a Swiss Italian aristocrat – and inveterate womaniser.There is the British writer, Aurora (Caroline Sheen), who is Rosalba’s longsuffering lover, alongside experimental French singer Cleo (Sophie Louise Dann, very funny), who is in a relationship with Russian Olga (Monique Young), but might secretly be seeing Rosalba.View image in fullscreenMore than a touch of Marlene Dietrich … Amy Ellen Richardson.Photograph: Steve GregsonShe, in turn, sends romantic signals to anyone within reach, including wealthy American composer Olimpia (Amira Matthews) and young Lulu (Jasmine Kerr), who has been banished to this island after falling for a man beneath her station.More love interests keep developing, it seems, and you slightly lose track, but that is the point: this group is so bohemian that it just likes to bed-hop.Overseeing the love-struck and lovelorn are ancient Greek goddess-like figures, including Sappho, who offer slightly laboured commentary on the mortal intrigues.But on the whole it is silly, entertaining and excellently performed. There is live music and songs which range from romantic whimsy to satirising the avant garde, while the art deco costumes by Carla Joy Evans bear a detailed fidelity to the era.An adaptation of Orlando was staged in this venue recently and this feels in keeping with that bohemian vibe. But it is a less serious work, tongue firmly in its cheek, with actors playing two parts and quick costume changes conjuring sense of chaotic mischief.What really makes it is the cast; Richardson has more than a touch of Marlene Dietrich in her swagger and rakishness. Dann is brilliantly OTT as Cleo while Jack Butterworth single-handedly plays all the male parts, from a Scottish waiter wounded in the Great War to a foppish friend and an errant fiance.None of it quite has a point, its radicalism no doubt more potent in 1928 when the book was published. Still, it is certainly worth a revival in this comic vein for the sheer fun of it.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 10 August.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreJermyn Street TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

At the height of the musician’s fame, Mehdi’s cousin Myriam Essadi recalls in a new documentary, he had to jet straight from a nightclub in Ibiza to his grandfather’s funeral in Tunisia. “He was wearing red glasses, white jeans and a jacket with a cross. In Tunisia! For our grandfather’s funeral!” Essadi laughs. “We didn’t get it. And in Tunisia you don’t mess with religion.”DJ Mehdi: Made inFrance, a six-part documentary now available with English subtitles on Franco-German broadcaster Arte, revisits the life and tragic death of one of the most fascinating, influential and misunderstood French musicians of his generation.View image in fullscreenArtwork for DJ Mehdi: Made in FranceIllustration: Arte TVInternational audiences largely know Mehdi, who died in 2011 at the age of 34, for his work with Parisian label Ed Banger in the 2000s, spearheading a new wave of French dance music alongside artists such as Justice – they of the cross logo on Mehdi’s jacket – and SebastiAn. In France, however, his legacy is more complicated, opening up questions about the rift between hip-hop and dance music, as well as underlying divisions in French society.Born to a French-Tunisian family in the north-west suburbs of Paris in 1977, Mehdi Favéris-Essadi rose to prominence for his production work with rap group Ideal J and hip-hop collective Mafia K-1 Fry. His first big hits came with 113, a rap trio whose 1999 album Les Princes de la Ville is considered one of the most important albums of the decade in France.When Les Princes was released, dance music had already entered Mehdi’s life via Cassius duo Philippe Zdar and Boombass, whom he worked with on MC Solaar’s 1997 album Paradisiaque. Several of the leading producers of French house music had roots in hip-hop, including Pépé Bradock and Cassius themselves. But none were as well known within the rap world as Mehdi, and his pivot was not always warmly received. “You couldn’t switch from rap to electro or vice versa. In the other world, you weren’t legitimate,” Essadi explains in the documentary.View image in fullscreenDJ Mehdi, at The Zoo Club, Manchester, September, 2007.Photograph: PYMCA/Avalon/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIn the US, hip-hop and dance music were initially closely linked, sharing roots in soul and funk music as well as production methods, a connection Mehdi appreciated when he heard Daft Punk’s 1997 album Homework. “I thought: ‘That’s funny, we use the same machines, the same samplers, they live just around the corner, they’re about my age, that could have been me,’” Mehdi says in an archival clip.By the late 90s hip-hop had risen to such prominence in the US that its leading artists tended to view dance music as a forgotten fad, if they thought about it at all. In the UK the opposite was true, with strength of British dance music eclipsing domestic hip-hop.In France, homegrown rap was extremely strong in the late 1990s. In the media, however, it was often vilified, while dance music was viewed as the next big thing, thanks to the rise of acts like Daft Punk, Étienne de Crécy and Cassius. The tension between two types of music and their various associations – Parisian elite v working class, city v suburbs – was palpable.“In 1997, if 47 guys and girls from [Paris suburb] Bobigny wanted to get into the Queen club [a Paris club known for house music] they couldn’t,” Boombass says in the documentary.“To them we were just guys who smoked weed, only good for a bank robbery or to deal drugs to them,” Essadi adds. “‘You’re from the suburbs.’ That meant many different things to people from central Paris who went to the Palace club or to Bains Douche to listen to dance music.”View image in fullscreenDJ Mehdi performs Electric Zoo festival on Randall’s Island, New York, September, 2010.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicWhen Mehdi tried to bridge this gap – for example, with the Kraftwerk-sampling beat for 113’s Ouais Gros – the response was often negative. “When people heard it they thought: ‘Who are these guys hardcore rapping to music like this? I don’t get it,’” 113’s AP says in the documentary.“I remember people stopping me in the streets, people from the rap world saying: ‘What’s Mehdi doing? Talk to him! What’s this new music, this crazy music,’” Essadi recounts.Mehdi would go on to have huge success in electronic music off the back of the release of Signatune in 2007. “Signatune was soon being played by the most well-known DJs all across the globe and promoters all wanted to book DJ Mehdi for their events,” former Daft Punk manager Pedro Winter explains in Made in France.The final part of the documentary shows footage of Mehdi’s international success, DJing at huge clubs and festivals alongside the Ed Banger crew to adoring, hedonistic crowds. It comes in sharp contrast to scenes of poverty and crime, burnt cars and drab suburban tower blocks, that mark the documentary’s first two episodes, examining Mehdi’s roots in hip-hop and the unfashionable outskirts of Paris.Mehdi died on 13 September 2011 at the height of his international fame, when the skylight on the roof of his Paris home collapsed as he was celebrating the birthday of British producer Riton. “Four of them were sat on this … glass, sort of, roof,” Riton says in the documentary. “They just got to stand up, that’s when it like … made the roof collapse through. Then the next thing, we were just looking through this hole at this horrific scene.”Tributes to Mehdi came in from the elite of the global dance music world, including US dubstep artist Skrillex and Ed Simons from the Chemical Brothers. And yet, for people in France in particular, this was only half the story.“Internationally [Mehdi’s] probably best known as one of the frontrunners of the Ed Banger crew that defined an entire era,” Canadian DJ A-trak says at the end of the documentary. “But, of course, he has a huge legacy as the king of French hip-hop production and even just someone who brought together these unlikely pairings of scenes.”“He helped us evolve our music over time,” 113’s Mokobé adds. “It’s thanks to him that there are no limits, no bars, no borders for us … This is what his music was all about; no bars, no barriers, no border.”DJ Mehdi: Made in Franceis available to watch on Arte from 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicHip-hopDance musicFranceEuropeMusic documentaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Titles such as Thief and Dishonored drop players into clockwork worlds where there are emails or letters to be read, vents to wriggle through, and desperate situations to overcome with smarts and social engineering as much as sheer violence.You could argue that all that’s been missing from the genre until now is a colossal policeman whose lanky body rises hundreds of feet into the sky, and who can look down at you and see absolutely everything you’re doing. Luckily, the new game from the Russian developer Tallboys is here to fix that. In Militsioner, you have been arrested for some manner of nebulous crime and must now leave town as quickly as you can. Bribe the ticketmaster at the railway? Break a window to create a distraction? All classic immersive sim solutions. Sadly, there’s that policeman to deal with first, a melancholic but watchful giant who towers over the ravaged urban surroundings even when sat down with his hands resting on his knees.View image in fullscreen‘A new dimension to storytelling’ … Militsioner.Photograph: TallBoys GamesThis giant defines Militsioner. He’s both a mechanic to toy with, depending on whether you want to flatter him or distract him, and a stark piece of visual brilliance that means you’ll never mistake this particular game for anything other than a paranoid immersive adventure. Even so, Tallboy’s director and game designer Dmitry Shevchenko explains that the project had been in development for a good six months before the policeman even turned up.“I remember watching an interview about the development of Thief: The Dark Project,” Shevchenko says. “We were really struck by the idea of giving the player a clear role, almost like a profession. That resonated with us. Around the same time, we were also thinking about giants as a theme.”These ideas converged when Shevchenko remembered a painting by the Russian digital artist Andrey Surnov, depicting a giant traffic policeman sitting in a field. “It just clicked,” Shevchenko laughs. “That image perfectly captured both the player’s role and their antagonist: criminal and policeman.”View image in fullscreenCruel dystopia … MilitsionerPhotograph: TallBoys GamesThe rest of Militsioner fell into place quite quickly after that. The game explores a cruel, totalitarian world that pits the individual against an overwhelming system. Yet it also plucks at more personal, even intimate threads. Is it illegal to bribe a giant policeman by offering them an apple? Is it illegal to try to date them?To pull this stuff off, Militsioner employs a kind of Tamagotchi system to monitor the specific internal worlds of all the non-player characters, that giant policeman among them. “We play with the classic immersive sim design pillar, where encounters can be approached through talking, sneaking or shooting,” Shevchenko says, and suggests that the moods add what he refers to as an additional layer, inspired by The Sims. “It’s the emotional states of characters,” he says. “Their moods become a core part of the systemic gameplay.”Sneaking into another character’s house and getting caught might send them into a panic, for example, which will change their dialogue options and, by extension, how you can interact with them. “This creates a deeply interconnected system where every action feeds into a web of reactions,” Shevchenko says. “It adds a new dimension to problem-solving and storytelling.”All of this is being expanded on by a process of rigorous player testing, where the team at Tallboys not only asks players what they did in a game but what they wanted to do but could not. This is where the idea of trying to date the policeman came from. “Players wanted to explore that side of the relationship,” Shevchenko says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also quietly literary. Alongside that other towering and melancholic figure Kafka, Shevchenko says the team has been influenced by the works of the Strugatsky brothers, who are most famous for the sci-fi dystopia Roadside Picnic. “I keep trying to capture the feeling [of their books],” Shevchenko says. “I love how they approach abstract settings and describe characters, particularly in The Snail on the Slope, with its surreal depiction of the directorate and the system around it.”Dig deeper and there’s also the hint of another giant of Russian literature, Nikolai Gogol, whose stories pick at hierarchy and the manifold perversities of power in a playful, strikingly game-like way. His antiheroes, including a man whose nose leaves his face and goes on to greater social status than him and another who wants to cheat his way to riches buying up the ownership of dead serfs, would probably be quite at home living in a town where a giant policeman sat in the town square, sadly taking everything in.Militsioner is being developed for PC, release date is TBCExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dunbar’s Close is a favourite, off Canongate towards the bottom of the Royal Mile. It’s a 17th-century-styled formal garden with benches and one of the city’s most tranquil hideaways. Pick up a delicious direct-trade Brazilian coffee and pastel de nata fromSantu Coffeeand enjoy the peace, just steps from the party.

Crisp up the leftover potato skins in a pan with sea salt to enjoy as a snack, or freeze them for making loaded potato skins (recipe coming next week).Baked potato gnocchi with broad beans, pecorino and mintA great way to make extra-flavourful fluffy pillows of gnocchi is to make them with leftover baked potato. Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them reduces their moisture content, meaning less flour is required, which in turn results in a lighter, less pasty gnocchi. Leftover baked potato also saves about an hour of prep time.This recipe serves two, using just one leftover baked potato, which I’ve turned into a one-pot wonder with seasonal broad beans, feta and mint. I wouldn’t recommend baking a single potato just for this, not least because the recipe is designed to make use of leftovers. If you’d like to make it from scratch, plan a baked potato meal earlier in the week and make one extra. Otherwise, steaming is a good, efficient alternative.If you want to get ahead, gnocchi freeze well. Lay them flat on a tray to freeze, then transfer to a sealed bag or container and store for up to three months. Cook straight from frozen, and give them a few extra minutes to rise to the surface.As a wholefood chef, I use wholemeal spelt flour, which adds flavour and nutrition, and also helps reduce waste by retaining the bran and wheat germ. To save money and potential waste, instead of using an egg yolk to bind the mix, I add a pinch of baking powder to lighten the dough.Serves2For the baked potato gnocchi1 medium-large cooked baked potato, flesh scooped out to yield 200-250g50-60gwholemeal flour(I used spelt), plus extra for dusting½ tsp baking powderSalt and black pepperFor the broad bean, feta and mint toppingJuice of½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if organic and unwaxed2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 large sprigs mint150g broad beans(from roughly 450g pods), or frozen broad beans100g feta, crumbledPut the potato flesh in a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, then mix and knead into a ball; if it’s a little sticky, add a little more flour. Split into 16 similar-sized pieces, then, using your hands, roll each one into the shape of a rugby ball and arrange in a single layer on a floured tray. Cook the gnocchi either by frying them in a little oil until golden brown all over, or by dropping them into boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, or until they float to the surface. Lift out, drain and serve with your favourite topping.At this time of year, I like to serve gnocchi with broad beans, feta and mint. In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice (and, if it’s organic and unwaxed, the grated zest, too) with the oil. Pick the leaves off the mint sprigs, then finely chop the stalks, add these to the dressing bowl and season generously.Blanch the broad beans in boiling salted water for five minutes, then lift out and drain. Meanwhile, cook the gnocchi either by frying them in a little oil until golden brown all over or by dropping them into boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, until they float to the surface, then lift out and drain.

Its more traditional form is broody and stewy, designed to burble away on a winter stove a bit like ratatouille, but with more fresh herbs. In summer, while the barbecue’s on and veg dishes of this kind are va-va-voom, it makes sense to just chuck them on the barbie instead and perhaps team with a spicy shortcutadjikapaste using a jar of roast peppers. And, second, a very adaptable carpaccio for any firm fruit in your fridge or fruit bowl: melons, stone fruit – heck, even pineapple! The key is to use a sharp knife and slice against the grain for the best mouthfeel, much as you might sashimi.Barbecued adjapsandal with adjika yoghurt dressing (pictured top)Piquillo peppers work best here, if you can find them, but you can use the ones from the deli counter, too, though maybe add a splash more red-wine vinegar to balance the acidity, tasting as you go. If it’s not barbecue weather, you could also cook this indoors on a griddle – just make sure to get it smoking hot and open a window.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4-61 large or 2 mediumaubergine(about 500g), cut into 1cm-thick discs2 largecourgettes(about 400g), cut into 1cm-thick discs1 large red onion(about 250g), peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rings4 largetomatoes(about 400g), quartered vertically60mlextra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushingFor the adjika4 garlic cloves40gsun-dried tomatoes, drained250g drained piquillo peppers¼tsp mild chilli flakes15g coriander sprigs, leaves picked and reserved to garnish15gparsley, stems and leaves15gholybasil, or Thai or young regular basil leaves, plus extra to garnish30mlneutral oil– I use sunflower or grapeseed1tsp ground fenugreek1tsp ground coriander1tsp salt flakes½tsp sugar¼tsp ground black pepperTo finish230gnatural yoghurtHeat a barbecue or grill plate until smoking. Pop the sliced aubergine and courgette on a baking tray and put the onion and tomato on another. Brush the aubergine generously with olive oil (or use an oil spray); the courgette doesn’t need as much oil, because the residual oil left on the grill by the aubergines will be plenty.Lay the aubergines on the open grill side of the barbecue for 10–15 minutes, turning halfway, until cooked through and with defined char marks (more is more with aubergine, really). Transfer the cooked slices to the upper rack to keep warm (if you don’t have an upper rack, pop them back on the tray and cover loosely with foil).Next, grill the courgette slices for six to eight minutes, flipping them over halfway. Repeat with the tomatoes and onion, until they are slightly blackened and blistered and seeping out juice. As each vegetable is cooked, introduce them to the aubergines on the upper rack (or in the loosely covered tray) to keep warm.For the adjika, put everything in a small blender and whizz smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.When you’re ready to serve, dot blobs of the adjika and the yoghurt all over a large platter, then use a flexible spatula or the back of a spoon to smear them into a marbled pattern. Arrange all the warm grilled vegetables on top, then finish with extra olive oil, the reserved coriander leaves and extra basil leaves.Honeydew carpaccio with coriander pestoView image in fullscreenSome people don’t like coriander (they’re wrong), but you could use basil to make the pesto instead; if need be, it could easily be made days in advance and loosened with extra oil. Serve chilled on a hot summer’s day.Prep15 minCook15 minServes4-6200g yellow cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced250g baby cucumbers, thinly sliced into rounds1tbsp lime juice1 perfectly ripe honeydew melon(about 1.2 kg), peeled and sliced into thin half-moonsFor the coriander pesto25gfresh coriander,prettier sprigs reserved to garnish40gsalted roasted peanuts30g baby spinach leaves, refreshed in chilled water125mlneutral oil– I use peanut or rice bran1 garlic clove, peeled½tbsp fish sauce½tbsp sesame oilFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lime½tsp sugar½tsp salt1 pinchcracked black pepperTo finish1 long green chilli, flesh finely sliced40gsalted roasted peanuts, choppedLime cheeksTo make the pesto, muddle all the ingredients in a mortar or blitz in a food processor until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to taste, if necessary, then put in a bowl if serving imminently, or decant into a clean jar and store in the fridge if making ahead.Toss the halved tomatoes and cucumber rounds in the lime juice. Arrange the melon slices on a platter and scatter the tomato and cucumber on top. Drizzle with the coriander pesto and sprinkle with the sliced chilli, chopped peanuts and reserved coriander sprigs. Serve with lime cheeks for squeezing over.These recipes are edited extracts fromSalad for Days, by Alice Zaslavsky, published by Murdoch Books at £20.

Will its ‘coffee to go’ business model, apple fizzy americanos and coconut lattes see off its biggest rival?Wed 30 Jul 2025 13.00 EDTShareName:Luckin.Age:Seven – it was founded in October 2017.Appearance:20,000 locations and counting.Locations doing what?Serving coffee. It’s agiant coffee chain.Oh yeah? If it’s so giant, how come I’ve never heard of it?Because it started inChina.Isn’t China better known for tea?Yes, but they have drunk a lot more coffee since Starbucks opened its first outlets there in 1999.Luckin overtook Starbucks as China’s biggest coffee chain in 2023.If Chinese people want Chinese coffee, so be it. It’s a big world.Luckin knows that, which is why it has just opened up two outlets in New York City, on Starbucks’ doorstep.It’s aiming for global domination?It certainly looks like it. “This is just the beginning,” Luckin posted on Instagram. “NYC, we’re here.”But why would I go to Luckin when I can go to Starbucks?For a largely frictionless technological experience. It has an app-based ordering system, no cashiers and hardly any seats. You just grab your latte and go.Is thecoffee any better?If you really cared about coffee, you wouldn’t go to either of these places.But Starbucks is home of the caramel macchiato, the pumpkin spice latte …Luckin is known for bestsellers like the coconut latte, the velvet latte andapple fizzy americano.Apple what?That’s apple juice, fizzy water and coffee, over ice.What is Starbucks doing to fend off the Luckin threat?It is closing a bunch of stores.A bold strategy, if a little counterintuitive.The companyplans to phase outits 90 or so “mobile-order-only” locations in the US, to concentrate on “community coffee houses” and a more personal customer experience.Soit’s going in the exact opposite direction to Luckin.It seems so. It has plans to refurbish existing locations, and it is going back to writing your name on the cup.A warm, friendly, welcoming atmosphere versus zero human interaction? I’mtorn.If it helps you make up your mind, Luckin is also engaging in furious promotional discounting, selling $1.99 coffees in a city where a $6 cappuccino is not uncommon.Starbucks is doomed.That’s a little premature. Luckin reported$4.7bn in sales last year, compared with$36.2bn net revenue for Starbucks.Still, a remarkable rise for the Chinese upstart.All the more remarkable after a 2020 false accounting scandal caused its stock price to collapse, driving the company into bankruptcy in the US. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2022, having replaced its top brass and received huge cash injections from a private equity firm.Do say:“Good morning, young barista. One of your legendary handcrafted flat whites, please.”Don’t say:“You know what I miss? Vending machines.”Explore more on these topicsCoffeePass notesFood & drink industryChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"
