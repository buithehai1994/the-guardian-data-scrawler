TheSunday Timesclaimed Rachel Reeves would divert money earmarked for green investment in the UK to the defence industry. It would be the first time that money from frozen Russian assets would contribute towards military spending.The irate exchanges between Trump and Vance, on the US side, and Zelenskyy, which led to the Ukrainian president being told to leave the White House before any formal talks took place, led to fears among European and other world leaders of irreparable damage to the western alliance, and to the hopes of peace in Ukraine’s war withRussia. At today’s defence summit, which demonstrates the increasingly central role being played by the UK in Europe’s defence and security, Starmer will be clear that Europe must stand united against President Putin.Starmer said last night: “Three years on from Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we are at a turning point. Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security and secure our collective future.”View image in fullscreenThe heated exchange between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office on Friday.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersYesterday, as Zelenskyy touched down in the UK on his way back from the US, he appeared intent on trying to repair the damage caused by the diplomatic showdown in the Oval Office. He posted on social media that he was “thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and the American people”, adding that Trump’s support was “crucial”.On Friday evening, Trump and Vance had accused him of not being grateful to the US for the huge sums they had spent on helping Ukraine to defend itself following the Russian invasion in 2022.In stark contrast to the White House meeting, Zelenskyy arrived at Downing Street to be met with cheers from crowds standing on Whitehall.And in a clear sign that Starmer wanted to demonstrate his ­sympathy for Zelenskyy, the prime minister took the unusual step of walking along the pavement to greet him. The two men then embraced before the prime minister gestured towards the crowds.Inside No 10, Starmer told his guest that the cheering outside was “the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine”.Starmer said he had “absolute determination … to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace – a lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine, so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom”.Zelenskyy replied: “We count on your support, and we’re really happy that we have such partners and such friends.”Among the key issues to be discussed at today’s defence summit will be the extent to which Europe can beef up its military support for Ukraine, and maintain the strength of Nato if the US is seen to be reducing its involvement in European defence.The leaders will also discuss how to increase economic pressure on Russia in order to hit Putin’s military machine. Many western experts say that the weakness of the Russian economy means that it has, at most, a year of being able to sustain its operations on the borders of Ukraine.King Charles met Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s surprise visit to the UK in February 2023, when the king told him: “We’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.”Zelenskyy also used his address to parliament during that visit to thank the UK for its steadfast support, finishing by saying: “God bless Great Britain and long live the king.”View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meets King Charles at Buckingham Palace during a visit to the UK in 2023.Photograph: EyePress News/REX/ShutterstockOn Friday, in their curtailed meeting, Trump had claimed Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” as he became increasingly angry with what he thought was Zelenskyy’s resistance to his plans for peace with Russia. The meeting ended with a proposed deal on exchanging Ukrainian mineral rights for American arms being put on ice.After Starmer’s meeting with Zelenskyy, which lasted an hour, the prime minister escorted the Ukrainian president to the motorcade outside No 10 and waited to wave him off – in contrast to his lonely departure from the White House 24 hours earlier.With European leaders believing the rift with the US over issues from security to trade could present an existential threat to the bloc, they will meet on Thursday, aiming to reinsert themselves into the US-led peace efforts on Ukraine. But they will insist that Ukraine be at the heart of any talks, something that the Trump administration has remained equivocal about.“There can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine,” states the draft summit text seen by theObserver. “There can be no negotiations that affect European security without Europe’s involvement. Ukraine and Europe’s security are united.”Summing up the sense of crisis, one EU diplomat said: “If this is not a wake-up call, then I don’t know what is. It is extremely important that the EU now moves from talking the talk, to also walking the walk in a much more focused and diligent way.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverKeir StarmerRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyKing Charles IIIDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

What could go wrong?The high-stakesWhite House showdownthat unfolded on Friday after the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded US security guarantees was deemed a damaging setback toDonald Trump’s goal of forging a peace deal – and a win for Russian dictatorVladimir Putin– by some US political commentators.And others in the US who are closely aligned with Trump cast the president’s meeting with Zelenskyy as a win for his “America first” realignment goals.“It is bewildering to see Mr Trump’s allies defending this debacle as some show of American strength,” the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial board said on Saturday, noting that US aims of limiting Russian expansionism without the use of US forces was now “harder to achieve”.The outlet warned that “turningUkraineover to Mr Putin would be catastrophic for that country and Europe, but it would be a political calamity for Mr Trump too.“Friday’s spectacle won’t make [Putin] any more willing to stop his onslaught” after invading Ukraine in 2022.The New York Times assessed that the derailed Oval Office meeting pointed to Trump’s “determination to scrap America’s traditional sources of power – its alliances among like-minded democracies – and return the country to an era of raw great-power negotiations.”“The three-year wartime partnership between Washington and Kyiv was shattered,” the paper added.Some conservative political figures also hit out at their fellow Republicans Trump and Vance for their handling over the meeting. “I hate to say this … but the United States right now is not the good guys in this,” said Adam Kinzinger, the former Republican congressman from Illinois who once served on a House committee that investigated Trump supporters’ attack on the US Capitol in early 2021.Whether diplomatic relations between Ukraine and the US can be repaired remained an open question Saturday. But the dispute points to the dangers of conducting diplomacy in public, despite the assessment from Trump – a former reality-TV host – that the clash with his Ukrainian counterpart, an ex-actor, made “great television”.“It is going to be incredibly hard to walk back from the kind of animosity we saw in that room today and to walk back some of those statements,” Republican strategist Karl Rove told Fox News. “It could have been done if cameras had not been running, but the only winner out of today is Vladimir Putin.”The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, revealed after the showdown that his meeting with Zelenskyy in Kviv days earlier resulted in a similar outburst. After Friday’s meltdown, BessentcalledZelenskyy’s approach “one of the great diplomatic own goals in history”.“Clearly it very difficult to do an economic deal with a leader that doesn’t want to do a peace deal,” Bessent told Bloomberg.“I’m not sure what he was thinking,” Bessent said of Zelenskyy, who was ultimately asked to leave the White House by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, after Ukrainian diplomatic aides texted that they were prepared to sign the agreed economic rare earth minerals deal.The White House deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, called out what he termed Zelenskyy’s “impertinence” and described the showdown as “one of the great moments in the history of American diplomacy”.“Millions of American hearts swelled with overflowing pride today to watch President Trump put Zelenskyy in his place,” Miller said, without elaborating on what public opinion information he had to justify that belief.Foreign Policy’s Ravi Agrawal wrote: “For a former comedian used to the cameras, it was strange that Zelensky got the script wrong.” Agawal noted that Trump had been testing the boundaries of press attention all week with “freewheeling” discussions in front of the world’s cameras.Such commentary came as Fox News host Bret Baier asked Zelenskyy whether he wanted to apologize to Trump, to which the Ukraine president said: “I’m not sure we did something bad.”“I respect [the] president and I respect [the] American people, and … I think that we have to be very open and very honest,” Zelenskyy told Baier.But arriving in London on Saturday ahead of a summit of British and European leaders, Zelenskyy thanked the US and its leadership while voicing hope for strong relations. “We want only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them,” he said.European leaders have stood behind Zelenskyy, with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, saying he “would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said if someone is gambling with the third world war – as Trump accused Zelenskyy of doing on Friday – it was not Zelenskyy.“If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,” said Macron, after Trump complained that Zelenskyy had been overly negative about the Russian dictator.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationUS politicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

He had already played them, and his hand was not strong enough to prevent the US-Ukraine breakdown.Courtesy of King Charles, he offered an unprecedented second state visit to President Trump. He had rushed through a cut in the overseas aid budget so as to be in a position to present Trump with an increase in UK defence spending, and during his meeting on Thursday he had fawned over Trump’s ability to “change the conversation over Ukraine”.Yet despite the decent atmospherics, Starmer, in common with Emmanuel Macron earlier in the week, could not extract the one concession he wanted: a clear US commitment to provide security guarantees – principally air cover and intelligence – for a European force being prepared to oversee a ceasefire inside Ukraine. Trump continued to insist he trusted Vladimir Putin to abide by the ceasefire and focused on the concessions Ukraine was going to have to make.There seemed to be no reserves of goodwill between the US and Europe on which Starmer could draw.So now, when as many as 12 European leaders gather in London for a defence summit on Sunday, Starmer will have to lead a conversation on whether Trump’s mind is made up, or whether the president’s mercurial mood swings can even at this late hour lead to a reconciliation.The prime minister will hold a meeting on Saturday afternoon with Zelenskyy, who landed in the UK this morning after the high-profile bust-up.Everyone has their own account of the precise moment when the Zelenskyy-Trump meeting went off the rails, and whether, after 30 minutes of tense but manageable discussion, Zelenskyy should have held back from pointing out that Putin, historically, has not kept to his word – possibly the spark that Trump wanted to start the shouting match.In retrospect, too, someone in the Zelenskyy circle could have minimised the risk of the seething resentment between the two men coming into public view by asking that Trump not repeat his relatively new practice of holding a 30-minute plus freewheeling press conference alongside his interlocutor before they sit down for formal talks. It is in these unstructured exchanges that landmines are most likely to be stepped on.Trump sensed Zelenskyy’s vulnerability, and once he had decided to take on the role of a sneering Draco Malfoy, JD Vance was only left to play both the bullying henchmen roles of Crabbe and Goyle.At this distance, it does not matter if it was an ambush designed to belittle Zelenskyy in the mind of Republican America, or something that evolved into a vicious takedown. What matters is that the anger reflects Trump’s true feelings towards Ukraine, his faith in Putin and his belief that Zelenskyy does not warrant his support.In one set of judgments, it marks the end of the post-1945 world order. The US may no longer be a trusted ally, but a competitor, even a strategic threat. It leaves Europe feeling even more alone than at the end of the Munich Security Conference when Vance portrayed Europe’s leaders as a threat alongside Russia and China.Indeed, after the trio of Oval Office meetings with Macron, Starmer and Zelenskyy, it is an illusion to think that Trump can be motivated by any sense of shared history or common values.Shocked European leaders have rallied to support Zelenskyy. “You are not alone,” said the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk. Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy representative fresh back from Washington where the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, refused to meet her, insisted Europe would not abandon Ukraine. “We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor,” she said. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of this will bleed into yet another summit, this time being called by the EU on Thursday.They will also have to make a brutal assessment of how long Ukraine can hold out without US support, and whether it is better to sue for peace early or late. Turkey, at the London summit, will offer to act as the venue for those talks.Only Giorgia Meloni, now under growing domestic political pressure to break from Trump, wants to see if the relationship can be restored. The Italian prime minister said: “What is needed is an immediate summit between the United States, the European states and the allies to talk frankly about how we intend to face the great challenges of today, starting with Ukraine, which we have defended together in recent years.”Either way, the US is determined to end the freeze in its bilateral relations with Russia. Europe is now alone in its conflict with Russia, and the US may not even play the role of a neutral bystander. Somehow, this disparate continent has to decide if it has the strength and cohesion to do what is required to force Moscow’s retreat.For Starmer, the choice between Europe and the US – one he has sought to avoid – comes ever closer.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

However, there are also service charges, which can initially be £250 to £350 a month. Once sold, some residents discover these charges can rise to £600 a month or more.The SocialHousingAction Campaign (Shac) will this week submit a dossier to the National Audit Office (NAO) on alleged service charge abuses, warning of inaccurate bills, overcharging and a failure to provide residents with supporting evidence of costs.It plans to apply for a judicial review if the National Audit Office refuses to investigate, warning that a chunk of the service charges are footed by the taxpayer in the form of housing benefit.An investigation by theObserverreveals:Residents in affordable homes at a former pickle factory in London, who face service charges of up to £8,000 a year, say they must enter their flats through a “poor door”. Private flats benefit from an entrance with a concierge funded by all residents.Housing association officials are warning residents in affordable properties who face service charge increases of up to 83% over two years that, if they don’t pay, they could be served notices “seeking possession” of their homes.At one development with affordable homes, residents were charged more than £2,200 for a “lamp test” and repair. There were also charges of £1,218 for workmen to replace 14 light bulbs – an average of £87 for each light bulb, according to information compiled by Shac.Suzanne Muna, from Shac, said the scandal of service charge abuse affected tenants in social housing, residents in shared-ownership homes and other leaseholders. She said: “We have found that service charge accounts are riddled with errors. There has been no proper scrutiny of these accounts.”An analysis by Shac of property tribunal rulings in 2024found that residents in service charge disputes had been overcharged in more than 70% of cases.Service charge income for housing associations in England rose by 15.8% to £1.95bn in the year to March 2024, according to figures compiled by the Regulator of Social Housing.Housing associations are also being challenged by residents over why service charges for shared properties increase so dramatically after sale. Campaigners are calling for regulation to prevent hefty increases once a sale is concluded.Residents at the former Crosse & Blackwell factory in Bermondsey, southeast London, known as the Pickle Factory, say they can no longer afford their affordable homes because of service charge increases. Residents in the affordable flats contribute to all the services in the development but enter their flats via modest lobbies, described as “poor doors” by some residents, compared to the grander entrances with concierge desks.‘We have found service charge accounts are riddled with errors; there has been no proper scrutiny of these accounts’Suzanne Muna, SHACAt another development in Islington, north London, with affordable shared property homes provided by the Peabody housing association, residents face demands for service charges which, for some, have increased to more than £7,400 a year.Residents have been sent letters warning of the risk of repossession of their homes. They say it is almost impossible to sell their properties and move out because of the exorbitant service charges.Wayne Baxter, 43, who works in marketing, said his service charge had increased in just two years from £337 a month in 2022/23 to £617 a month in 2024/25. He bought a 25% share in the £670,000 flat in February 2020.“We are stressed beyond belief,” said Baxter. “I’m losing so much sleep. These are not affordable homes. If we were told the service charges would be going up to £600 a month, I wouldn’t even have looked at this development.”He said Peabody and the estate management firm had failed to provide a detailed breakdown of the charges and supporting evidence for the bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionResidents in affordable homes at the development have stopped their direct debits for the service charges. They are now demanding a detailed breakdown of the charges, but are being sent “urgent” demands by Peabody for as much £6,000.The guidance is that, in affordable homes, rent and service chargesshould not exceed 40% of income, but this is now regularly breached because of the hefty increases in service charges once residents move in.Many residents across the country are refusing to pay service charge increases, which have been imposed without any breakdown of the bills.At another Peabody development in east London, people in affordable flats have successfully challenged excessive charges. The refunded charges, seen by theObserver,include the cost of testing and replacing a lamp, with the bill cut from £2,280 to £253. There was also a £49,085 refund for communal boiler costs and a £9,000 refund on repairs to access gates to the development.Shac wants new laws for disputing service charges, with a regulator to oversee service charges. It wants penalties imposed on private landlords, councils and housing associations for unfair, inaccurate and unreasonable service charges.The Leasehold and Reform Act 2024 aims to improve the transparency of service charges and give leaseholders a new right to request information about these charges and the management of their building. Ministers have said they will consult this year on the act’s provisions on service charges, bringing the measures into force as quickly as possible.A spokesperson for Peabody said: “We really sympathise with residents who are bearing the brunt of rising costs, and share concerns about increasing service charges set by external managing agents.“We never make a profit on service charges and advocate on behalf of residents to ensure charges are calculated accurately and transparently. Charges listed on sales adverts should accurately reflect what residents can expect to pay. We’re aware of the issues raised and are looking into residents’ concerns.”The NAO said: “We carefully consider all correspondence received in line with our remit to audit government spending.”A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “Far too many leaseholders and social housing tenants across the country are being asked to pay unreasonable and extortionate charges.“All service charges should be reasonable by law, and we will keep any action towards landlords under review.“We will also consult this year on implementing measures in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act to drive up transparency of service charges and hold landlords to account for the money they spend.”Explore more on these topicsHousingThe ObserverSocial housingPropertyShareReuse this content"

On 11 January,gritters were blockedfrom accessing the road at Rushup Edge, close to Mam tor, by about 200 doubled-parked cars.“I understand a lot of the issues we’re having at the moment is because there’s a TikTok craze for going and seeing sunrise/sunset on Mam tor and that’s caused the peak in the parking issues we’ve got at the moment,” Pearce told the BBC. “But that has at least given us the heads-up that we’ve got to be prepared for the summer.”In a letteraddressed to the Peak District national park, Derbyshire county council, Derbyshire police and High Peak borough council, Pearce said the “increasingly untenable parking situation” had escalated since early February.“Living in the Hope valley, I am personally aware of the issues but the volume of complaints from my constituents continues to rise,” he said.View image in fullscreenMam tor ridge at sunrise in the Peak District.Photograph: Annapurna Mellor/Getty Images“Residents are rightly alarmed that current parking restrictions are failing to deter motorists from parking irresponsibility.”His letter said solutions could involve stronger enforcement measures such as higher fines for illegal parking, improved signage and a review of possible expansion of parking infrastructure.A Derbyshire county council meeting earlier this week heard that boulders could be placed on either side of the road near Mam tor to help curb the illegal parking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fines are from a series of days where we have managed to hand out 300 or 400 tickets in a day.”A Peak District national park authority spokesperson said: “The concerns raised by Jon in his letter are issues we have been focused on for some time, along with the many stakeholders required in tackling these complex challenges.

Charli xcx wins five Brits for zeitgeist-conquering albumDance-pop artist picks up album and artist of the year prizes, while Ezra Collective see off big names to become first jazz artists to win British groupThe Brit awards – in picturesThe full list of winnersBen Beaumont-ThomasSat 1 Mar 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 18.57 ESTShareCharli xcx has won fiveBrit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat.At the ceremony in London’s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year.The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: “Brat summer”, plus various things being declared “brat”. It was nebulously defined – Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat – but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool.Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli’s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys.She thanked some of her dance music heroes – resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards – as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: “Not all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.” On winning album of the year, she said: “I’ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven’t made any sacrifices.” She told her fellow artists: “You don’t need to compromise your vision.”The chief architect of Brat’s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards’ eligibility period, entitled Britpop.Charli – real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 – first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year:Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&B act for the second year in a row.Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK’s best live acts.Bassist Georgia Davies said they “wouldn’t be a band without the UK’s incredible independent venues – they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying”. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to “keep going, because that’s the best kind of art there is”.View image in fullscreenJoe Armon-Jones, Ife Ogunjobi, Femi Koleoso, James Mollison and TJ Koleoso of Ezra Collective.Photograph: John Phillips/Getty ImagesThe Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon.Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London’s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London’s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They’re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize.After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: “So many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we’re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone – because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.”In the genre categories – which were voted for by the public –Sam Fenderpicked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022.Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as “a man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist”, Fender also performed his new album’s title track.View image in fullscreenJade performing Angel of My Dreams.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageFormerLittle Mixmember Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories.He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, butStormzywas something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country’s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can’t Rush Greatness isn’t eligible until next year’s Brits).As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, “I don’t entirely think this award should be fan-voted … sometimes I think it doesn’t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.”The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that theoutcry at Stormzy’s recent McDonald’s campaigndid not affect his votes.This year’s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You.Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: “If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?”“We have to protect the foundations that make it,” he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: “Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments … please stick with artists past a viral hit.”It was a sentiment shared byChappell Roan, who called for artists to “not be pressured into making music based off what is trending” as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to “trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sinéad O’Connor.”Irish rockersFontaines DCpicked up international group, their second win in that category.View image in fullscreenSabrina Carpenter performing at the Brit awards.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockIntroduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown,Sabrina Carpenterwas given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: “In a primarily tea-drinking country, you’ve streamed the shit out of Espresso … cheerio!”Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, andEzra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith.Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (“the public school Nickelback”) and even the previous day’s “cringe” Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade’s live performance, saying: “I really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme”, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor – all of it casting the Brits as the award season’s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an “incredibly kind soul”.Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.Brit awards 2025: full list of winnersAlbum of the year:Charli xcx– BratArtist of the year: Charli xcxBritish group: Ezra CollectiveBest new artist: The Last Dinner PartySong of the year: Charli xcx – Guess (ft Billie Eilish)International artist: Chappell RoanInternational group: Fontaines DCInternational song: Chappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!Alternative/rock act: Sam FenderHip-hop/grime/rap act: StormzyDance act: Charli xcxPop act: JadeR&B act: RayeProducer of the year: AG CookSongwriter of the year: Charli xcxGlobal success: Sabrina CarpenterRising star: Myles SmithExplore more on these topicsBrit awardsCharli xcxPop and rockAwards and prizesRayeThe Last Dinner PartyEzra CollectivenewsShareReuse this content"

She had reportedly been on her way home from a show and was the only person who died in the crash.Her daughter Diamond Stonewroteonline: “My mommy is gone.”Stone has been a founding member of groundbreaking female hip-hop trio the Sequence in the late 70s at the age of 16. They scored a hit with Funk You Up, a song that was later sampled by Dr Dre for his single Keep Their Heads Ringin and Bruno Mars in Uptown Funk.“I think that being the first female rap group to actually come out and have an authentic original rap record is an accomplishment that no one else has been able to top,” shesaidin 2023.After the group disbanded in the mid-80s, Stone worked as a vocalist for Vertical Hold and then Devox before she later provided songwriting credits to D’Angelo for his first two studio albums. She was also a backing vocalist for the singer on tour before providing vocals for Lenny Kravitz on his album 5 in 1998.In 1999, Stone released her first solo album, Black Diamond, which contained the hits No More Rain (In This Cloud) and Life Story. She went on to record the theme to the hit sitcom Girlfriends in 2000 and released her second album, MahoganySoul, the following year.That album featured the hit Wish I Didn’t Miss You, which became her biggest international success.Her third album, Stone Love, featured the song I Wanna Thank Ya with Snoop Dogg, which became a big hit in Europe. The video also featured a young Idris Elba.Stone went on to record a further seven albums, the most recent of which was 2023’s Love Language, which featured Musiq Soulchild and Stone’s son Swayvo Twain.She was nominated for three Grammys in her career and also wrote songs for Erykah Badu and Raphael Saadiq. “There is a deep sad feeling that as a songwriter – something such a gift – you never get acknowledged for it,” shesaidin 2011. “People think that’s how I eat because I make records but I make far more money as songwriter than from being a singer.”Stone also worked as an actor, with roles in big screen comedies like The Hot Chick and The Fighting Temptations and on stage in Chicago playing Big Mama Morton.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as being straightforwardly thrilling, it proved to be hugely influential, pointing the way from glam to the punk music that was beginning to brew in New York City. They never broke the Top 100 of either the US or UK charts, but critics have deemed songs such as Personality Crisis – sung by Johansen with a throaty, lung-busting howl – some of the greatest rock of the 1970s.View image in fullscreenThe New York Dolls performing at the Waldorf Halloween Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in 1973: guitarist Sylvain Sylvain plays alongside David Johansen.Photograph: Richard Drew/APJohansen was born and raised in Staten Island, and fronted local band the Vagabond Missionaries before he joined the nascent New York Dolls in 1971, and became the heart of an irreverent scene centred around Manhattan’s Mercer Art Center. They were signed to Mercury Records, who released their 1973 debut and the follow-up Too Much Too Soon the following year. The latter title felt prescient: the often debauched band broke up in 1975, with Johansen fronting a version that continued until 1976.Johansen began a solo career, releasing his self-titled debut album in 1978, and released three more before taking on a new pseudonym: Buster Poindexter. This was as theatrical as his New York Dolls days but pointed in a very different direction, performing classic R&B, blues and pop as a tuxedoed crooner. He had a hit with his cover of Arrow’s holiday anthem Hot Hot Hot, and his self-titled 1987 debut took him to the US Top 40 for the first time. Three more Poindexter albums followed over the next decade.View image in fullscreenJohansen as his alter ego Buster Poindexter at the Grammy Awards in New York in 1988.Photograph: Anonymous/APIn 2004, Morrissey induced the New York Dolls – Johansen, along with bandmates Sylvain Sylvain and Arthur Kane – to reform for the Meltdown festival he was curating. Kane died weeks later, but Johansen and Sylvain kept the band going, releasing three more studio albums and touring until 2011.Johansen had an acting career, including opposite Bill Murray as the Ghost of Christmas Past in 1988’s Scrooged. He also worked as a radio host and was a painter. Among his admirers was Martin Scorsese, who co-directed the 2023 documentary Personality Crisis: One Night Only, centred on Johansen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Five years ago at the beginning of the pandemic we discovered that David’s cancer had progressed and he had a brain tumor … To make matters worse, the day after Thanksgiving David fell down the stairs and broke his back in two places. ​After a week in the hospital and a successful surgery David has been bedridden and incapacitated.”He is survived by Hennessey as well as his wife Mara, who he married in 2013.

Many are “around cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Sunderland and Newcastle – as well other post-industrial regions like the West Midlands (including Birmingham)”, it says.A briefing document to government ministers, based on the report’s findings and seen by The Observer, says that even since the general election last summer there is evidence that Reform has deepened its support in these most deprived areas.The note, written ahead of the report’s publication on Wednesday, says: “The number of highly disadvantaged neighbourhoods based in seats demonstrating high support for Reform (30%-40% vote share) has increased significantly since the election, from just 4.8% of these neighbourhoods to 26.2%. The number of those based in ‘Reform stronghold’ areas (those polling above 40%) has also risen from 1.4% to 4.8%. All existing Reform MPs have some of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in their seats.”Polling carried out for the commission, which will also be published on Wednesday, shows support for the Reform party is driven by voter concerns about issues such as antisocial behaviour, crime and litter on the streets.View image in fullscreenHilary Armstrong says Reform has deepened its support in deprived areas since Labour took office.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The ObserverThe commission identified the UK’s areas most in need by analysing local attitudes to crime, health, energy, jobs and educational achievement, alongside publicly available data. As part of the in-depth investigation it used that data to compile an index of areas that score poorly when measured against the government’s five “missions”.The accompanying briefing adds: “Constituencies containing neighbourhoods that are furthest behind on the government’s missions tend to be those that are demonstrating greater support for Reform.”Starmer’s government set out the missions ahead of July’s general election to focus minds on Labour’s policy offering. The missions promised to deliver safer streets, economic growth, green energy, better education and NHS reform.The report argues that a “trickledown” approach – the idea that the most in need will benefit over time from a policy delivered nationally rather than in a more targeted way – is destined to fail.The polling, carried out by Public First, found that “highest need” neighbourhoods were more concerned about litter (53%), antisocial behaviour (49%) and illegal drugs (48%) than “lowest need” neighbourhoods.The report will urge ministers to “transform places street by street, estate by estate” through public investment in “social infrastructure” and by supporting economic development. With focusing support on areas most in need it risks “wasting billions of pounds in higher public spending while failing to transform the places that need it most”.ICON was launched in September 2024 to address the challenges faced in England’s most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.The government is understood to be looking closely at its work and ministers are meeting regularly with the commission. Others on the commission include the mayor of the North East, Kim McGuinness, and former government advisor Dr David Halpern.Last month YouGov published the first national opinion poll to suggest thatReform UKhad overtaken Labour, placing it on 25%, one point ahead of Labour and four ahead of the Conservatives.Explore more on these topicsPovertyThe ObserverLabourReform UKNigel FarageKeir StarmerCommunitiesOpinion pollsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had no fever and no signs of new infection, was feeding himself and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said.The 88-year-old pope had a good response in his blood gas levels even during the “long periods” he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen. But his prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger.“The Holy Father is always vigilant” and aware of what was going on around him, the statement said, adding that he received the Eucharist and spent time in prayer.The comparatively positive update came after Francis suffered a setback on Friday in his two-week battle against pneumonia.Francis had a coughing fit in which he also inhaled vomit. Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs. Doctors said episode resulted in a “sudden worsening of the respiratory picture”.The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the manoeuvres to help him recover.The fact that Francis on Saturday was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.TheVaticansaid the episode was different from the prolonged respiratory crisis on 22 February that was said to have caused Francis discomfort. Doctors not involved in Francis’s care said it was particularly alarming given his existing lung disease and fragility.Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can go back to using oxygen alone. Friday’s statement said Francis showed a “good response” to the gas exchange using the mechanical ventilation.Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in “critical condition”, which has been absent from their statements for four days now. But they said he was not out of danger, given the complexity of his case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I urge local people to speak with these officers if you have any information or any concerns. The officers are there to support you, and they will be in and around Holloway throughout the weekend.”Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

They were told they had to buy their portfolio photographs from the studio in order to join an agency and become a model.Some of them used credit deals arranged by the fraudsters, or expensive payday loans to make the upfront payment.In return, the victims got poor quality digital photographs that stood no real chance of landing them professional jobs and most did not get paid modelling work.Foster bought high-end watches and cars with his share of the proceeds, while many victims said they had been left financially and emotionally devastated and felt humiliated and betrayed.The sham agencies, which paid no tax, existed for short periods before being dissolved and repeatedly rebranded.Money from the scam was laundered through UK bank accounts before being transferred to Spain or carried in cash on commercial flights by co-conspirators, the NTS said.North Yorkshire councillor Greg White said: “Foster and his fellow scammers cruelly exploited young hopefuls trying to break into one of the most competitive industries. In some cases, parents borrowed money or sacrificed savings, believing they were investing in their children’s futures.“I urge anyone searching online for modelling opportunities to remember that legitimate agencies don’t ask for money upfront, it’s often only scam agencies who push expensive photoshoots as a prerequisite to getting work.”Foster’s associates were also convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced. Michael Foster, 27, of Liverpool, was jailed for three and a half years, while Jamie Peters, 52, of Warrington, received a suspended 24-month prison sentence.View image in fullscreenLeft to right top row: Michael Foster, Jamie Peters, Lisa Foster, Emily Newall.

Paul Fleury, 57, of Swinton, Manchester, received an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.Meanwhile, Aslihan Foster, 39, of Coventry, received a suspended 18-month prison sentence, and Paul Evans, 39, of no known address, got a three-and-a-half year suspended prison sentence after they were both convicted of offences related to money laundering.Jenny Kent, of City of York council, said: “Mr Foster and his associates made millions by exploiting the hopes of young people, leaving a trail of broken dreams and financial hardship.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeSoap operaTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The apartment was beautiful. It was central and near to the university [where I work]. The price was affordable … compared with the private market,” he says.Scalvini, a lecturer, met the criteria for affordable housing: he was a first-time buyer and had been priced out of thecapital’s housing market. But in the past year, his dream has turned into a nightmare. Peabody – the housing association managing the affordable flats in the development – has increased his service charge by 77%: he has gone from paying about £4,500 in 2023/24 to about £8,000 in 2024/25.To make matters worse, in November, Peabody sent him a letter demanding £3,000 more because there had been “a shortfall” in the service charge for 2023/24. “I’m already struggling,” he says. “They have offered me a payment plan, but that’s just for the adjustment [for 2023/24]. Then there is the permanent increase [in my service charge]. There is no way I can pay … it is breaking my heart.”Like other councils, Southwark insists developers sign up to planning agreements to ensure residents in affordable homes do not spend more than40% of their household incomeafter tax on housing costs, including service charges. But there is nothing to stop private management companies and housing associations from hiking up service charges after people move in. An email from Southwark council’s head of planning enforcement to Scalvini states: “The test of affordability is only carried out on the date of exchange of contracts.”There is nothing to stop private management companies from hiking up service charges after people move inScalvini, who is the acting chair of the block’s newly formed residents association, says the “affordable” flats in the development – a former Crosse & Blackwell factory – are now beyond the reach of people on low and middle incomes. “Everyone in the block is spending more than 40% of their incomes on housing. You need to earn between £80,000 and £90,000 to afford to live here [to stay below the threshold]. It is shocking.”View image in fullscreenAlan Crookham and John Whelan bought an ‘affordable’ shared ownership apartment.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverJohn Whelan, a theatre director, and his partner Alan Crookham, bought a one-bedroom flat in the development in 2021. Their service charge for 2023/24 is £4,029, compared with an original estimate of £2,687. “It looks like there is going to be another massive increase next year,” said Whelan. “How can you market something as affordable when it’s not affordable?”The residents also complain they are paying for facilities used by better-off private residents. Shared ownership residents use relatively modest entrances into their apartments while private residents enter through gated, landscaped gardens, which are open to the public during the day. There is a concierge service at two private entrances of the development, which all residents are expected to contribute to through the service charge.A budget breakdown supplied by the private equity-owned managing agents of the building, Rendall & Rittner, reveals that Scalvini and other shared ownership residents are paying for the concierge service as well as landscape and tree maintenance on the estate. “It is a total injustice … we are subsidising the services for private residents … it is outrageous,” he said. The entrance to Scalvini’s block has been labelled a “poor door” by the affordable housing residents on the development. “They insist they treat us all equally but they are denying reality,” said Scalvini. “Our entrance is on the street at the back of the building. The private residents’ entrance has a concierge. That’s a textbook definition of a poor door.”He is frustrated Peabody has passed the maintenance bill from Rendall & Rittner to the shared ownership residents. “[Peabody] should advocate for us because these charges are not sustainable for affordable housing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others are paying under protest. Peabody has sent letters and text messages demanding payment. Scalvini is worried he may eventually have to sell, but there is nowhere else he could afford in the borough: “It is driving me out of my mind. Everyone is in the same situation.”Southwark council said it understood service charges can be “shockingly” high. “We want homes to be genuinely affordable to residents and support leaseholders in negotiations with their landlords to ensure charges are fair and available for scrutiny,” said Helen Dennis, Southwark’s cabinet member for new homes. “We have been exploring if we can do anything in planning to secure affordable service charges in perpetuity.”Peabody said it never made a profit on service charges, and advocated on behalf of residents to ensure charges were calculated accurately and transparently. A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner said: “At all our developments, we strive to keep service charges as reasonable as possible as we understand the pressure this puts on leaseholders. To this effect, we have raised our concerns with government over the pressure faced by leaseholders as a result of service charge increases.”The property management firm said new requirements under the Building Safety Act, along with inflation and rising energy costs, had contributed to rising costs.Explore more on these topicsHousingThe ObserverInequalityLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are five steps we need to take nowPeter PomerantsevEurope can’t wait to react to Trump’s mood swings but must show we have the will and the wallet to take back controlUkraine war liveSat 1 Mar 2025 11.29 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 12.45 ESTShareIt’s exhausting and humiliating to have no control – watching every meeting in the Oval Office for a glimmer of Trump’s approval or displeasure, our security resting on a perceived slight or a mood.The last week of meetings between Trump, Macron, Starmer andfinally Zelenskyyalways felt like crawling across a minefield. Some might agonise about whether Zelenskyy could have played things differently. It’s the wrong question. The point is that we can’t carry on being so dependent on every meeting at the White House. Until we start taking charge of our future, we will always be one heart palpitation away from dreading doomsday.Here are the steps to solve that.First:Europehas to show a united front. Britain can have its own side channels – there are some benefits of avoiding the coming EU-US trade war – but the most “special” relationship we have now is the one with our nearest neighbours.Second: If you want to be taken seriously, bring serious money. There are, for example, $300bn worth offrozen Russian assetssitting in Euroclear in Brussels. Use these to negotiate with America and other providers of weapons about actual deals, rather than relying on maddening meetings predicated on mood swings to hope for rhetorical ones.But we also have to be clear what we need from America. For the next few years, Europe is still dependent on the US for artillery supplies and for tech updates to Patriot missiles and other essentials.Nothing should be off the books: digital disruption, sabotage, the whole gamut of secret service tricksThird: Recognise that the only real “security guarantees” lie in having armed forces that can defend you. So build a real European defence industry. That sounds terribly grandiose – but it’s possible.Start thinking like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who took moribund American arms production in the 1930s and built it up to out-compete Germany’s. Don’t fall for any pauses in the fighting that Putin might sell Trump. Russia is continuing its military build-up all the time, preparing for many decades of conflicts. We are fortunate there is already one serious army in Europe – Ukraine’s.Fourth: Disrupt Russia’s military supply chains. We usually think about this in terms of sanctions, but that’s just one tool. Nothing should be off the books: digital disruption, sabotage, the whole gamut of secret service tricks.Fifth: Learn how to fight hybrid and information wars. We already know that Russia is waging relentless campaigns of covert disinformation and overt propaganda, cyber attacks, corruption and espionage across Europe. It’s about to get much worse. All the assets Russia has been using to subvert America will now be repurposed to attack Europe, and especially the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we will need a sword too. Here we can learn from countries like Moldova who are already developing the hard craft of fighting non-democratic enemies with democratic tools.But it’s also something the British excelled at in the past: the second world war Political Warfare Executive united the wittiest minds from the arts with spies and soldiers to create a communications force that was far more effective than the Nazis’.Once we show we have the will, and the wallet, to take these steps, then we can negotiate differently. Then we can speak of “mutual interests” as equals, not supplicants.But most importantly, we will no longer feel as if our destiny is decided by others. The propaganda campaign for Brexit was sold on the idea of “taking back control”. It turned out to be an empty promise. But the feelings it tapped into were real enough. In a chaotic world, people feel vulnerable. Now we have the chance to do it properly.Explore more on these topicsEuropeThe ObserverUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpJD VanceVladimir PutinDefence policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

How are these family-run businesses coping?William ChristouBekaa valleySat 1 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTShareIn September Elias Maalouf and his father were sitting inChateau Rayak, the family winery in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, when they decided to head home for a lunch break. Five minutes later an Israeli jet dropped a bomb on a house across the street, crushing the three-storey building and destroying much of the winery.“If we hadn’t left we would have died,” said 41-year-old Maalouf, sitting in the winery as repair workers replaced a shattered television five months later. The doors had blown in from the force of the blast and shattered glass had rained down on the table where he now sat, the wood of the furniture still pockmarked from shrapnel.An hour after the bombing, Maalouf returned to the winery and started repairs. He swept up broken bottles, some of them more than 20 years old, removed a severed foot that landed in front of his storage room and collected broken equipment in his distillery.“All I could smell was wine. You always enjoy the smell of your own wine, but that day it was the worst smell I could imagine. It was the smell of my loss,” he said.Maalouf lost about 40,000 bottles and £158,600 in damages. He had to leave 60 tons of grapes to wither on the vine.MapChateau Rayak in central Lebanon.An increase in fighting across the Lebanese border betweenHezbollahand Israel started on 8 October 2023, after the Iran-backed group had launched missiles into Israel “in solidarity” with Palestinians following the 7 October Hamas-led attack and the start of Israeli bombing of Gaza, kicking off 13 months of war.So far, the fighting has left more than 3,900 people dead inLebanon, displaced more than 1million people and left parts of the south, the Bekaa valley and the capital, Beirut, in ruins.View image in fullscreenElias Maalouf, owner of Chateau Rayak, points out the damage done, including to roof tiles, by an Israeli airstrike on an alleged Hezbollah drone making facility, which can be seen in the background, next to his winery in the town of Rayak in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon.Photograph: Oliver MarsdenFor Lebanon’s winemakers, the war has been catastrophic. The country’s wine industry is one of the oldest in the world and produced7m bottles a yearbefore the war, including the famousChateau Musar. But it relies heavily on tourism, with many of the small boutique vineyards that have popped up in the last 15 years dependent on visitors and events for their livelihoods.Maalouf has little hope of receiving compensation fromHezbollah, which promised funding to those affected by the war but, as an Islamist group, would not fund the reconstruction of a winery. Unknown to him, the building Maalouf had seen across the street was a Hezbollah drone production facility, a prime target for Israel.It is not the first time that war has interrupted Maalouf’s winemaking. The same land whose rich soil suffused his wine with flavour and the same country whose rich history inspired his craft had, at times, also jeopardised it.His family history is intertwined with the grapevines that they have cultivated for more than five generations in Rayak. His wines reflect that history: one is named Station after the Ottoman-era railway station that used to be in Rayak, another is titled The Good Old Days”, bearing the pictures of Rayak’s 1950s cinema on the bottle. That history was interrupted only once before, during Lebanon’s 15-year civil war which plunged the country’s many sects into a cycle of retaliatory violence. Maalouf returned to Lebanon and resumed work at the winery in 1997, with the guidance of his 92-year-old grandfather.Despite the danger, Maalouf was determined not to allow his family’s wine to stop flowing for a second time. “I’m here to stay,” he said. “When you see your winery, your dreams broken, then you know you can’t give up.”View image in fullscreenRoland Abou-Khater and his wife Tamara taste one of their Coteaux du Liban white wines.Photograph: Oliver MarsdenRoland Abou-Khater, who runsCoteaux du Libanin the city of Zahle in the Bekaa valley, also refused to let the war stop him from producing wine. In recent months, when he heard the bombing stop, he would raise a white flag on his truck, race to the vineyard, and begin to harvest.He transported the grapes in trucks which had their roofs removed, so that Israeli drones could see that the vehicles posed no threat – a trick he had learned from his father in the 2006 Lebanon-Israel war.“He used to tell me that the grapes will never wait for the war to end, and that we couldn’t just leave the grapes on the vine,” said 29-year-old Abou-Khater, who runs the vineyard along with his wife, Tamara Gebara.The vineyard produces about 150,000 bottles a year, mainly for export to Europe. Although both Abou-Khater and Gebara were trained in winemaking techniques in France, they insist on using grape varieties indigenous to Lebanon.Their bottle of 2024 Obaideh, named for the eponymous Lebanese white grape variety, reflects the hard ground it is grown in – the minerality of the wine a product of the high limestone content of the Bekaa’s soil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were unable to bottle some of their wines on schedule during the war, as they had a shortage of imported corks. Air freight was stopped along with all other flights to Lebanon, with the exception of the national carrier.“We had to ferment without knowing if we could ever sell. The grapes would not wait, the wine will not wait,” said 33-year-old Gebara.In south Lebanon, closer to the border with Israel, winemakers had to contend with widespread environmental destruction. Up to 2,192 hectres (5,414 acres) of vines were burned by Israeli munitions, tens of thousands of olive trees were razed and thousands of livestock killed, according to the Lebanese National Council for Scientific Research.View image in fullscreenA Hezbollah martyr poster in Rayak.Photograph: Oliver MarsdenIn addition, environmentalists fear that the widespread use in south Lebanon of white phosphorus munitions, which produce a thick, toxic smoke, will have a long-lasting effect on the environment. The sticky, black tar-like remnants of the munition can can reignite upon exposure to oxygen.In a study, Lebanon’s ministry of environment found elevated levels of heavy metals and 900 times the amount of phosphorus in soil hit by artillery and white phosphorus bombs. Scientists are still testing the soil in south Lebanon to see if there are any long-term effects that could pose a danger to public health and agriculture.Although theirLes Vignes du Marjevineyard was not directly hit by any Israeli bombs, Carol Tayyar Khoury and her husband Imad Khoury did not use any of the grapes from their plot in Marjeyoun, a town 8km from the Lebanon-Israel border. “None of the land was hit by white phosphorus but just in case, we didn’t use any grapes from Marjeyoun, because we were afraid of people asking if white phosphorus affected the wines,” said Carol. To protect their wine from being shaken in their tanks from nearby bombardments, the Khourys transferred the liquid to a second location away from the border in July 2024.The bottles had to be transported very slowly under cover of darkness, as exposing them to sunlight and shaking could spoil the contents. Israel and Hezbollah were more active in bombing at night, so the journey was not without its risks.Keeping the wine still throughout the journey meant that they had to drive painstakingly slowly, turning what should have been a two-hour journey into more than four hours, as the threat of bombardment loomed overhead.“This was the longest night of my life,” Khoury said.With the war over after a ceasefire in November and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, Lebanese winemakers are rebuilding and looking forward to better days.Maalouf is already working on a new bottle of wine, named Juliana, after his wife, who he proposed to in the first 10 minutes after meeting. The bottle will be his latest volume on the history of his family and the town they come from, the loves they have had and the wars they have seen, all told through the wine they drink.Explore more on these topicsLebanonThe ObserverHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warWineAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She reopens the bin and reaches in, passing each can to her friend, Julie Griffin, 63.The retirees spend around 20 hours a week diving into recycling bins around Sydney’s eastern suburbs, collecting every eligible can, carton and plastic and glass bottle they can find for New South Wales’Return and Earnscheme.With bags looped over her forearms, Griffin sorts as they go. They both wear gloves and occasionally masks: despite the morning’s heat, there haven’t been any maggots or putrid chicken carcasses to contend with – so far.They’ll earn $40.10 from about three hours’ work today, boosted by that single bin load, while last week, they made $80 in one morning alone.In the beginning, you feel sort of ashamed ... Then you get to the point of ‘Who cares?’RickyShe’s pleased about those results, but Lee says she did not expect to spend her retirement hunting through strangers’ rubbish as a means to supplement her pension.“I like it, I enjoy it,” she says, “but never in a million years did I think I’d be doing this.”Originally from northern England, Lee has been living in Sydney since 1969.

Some 10.3m containers were returned on 23 December alone – a new record – with two out of three eligible containers sold in NSW now redeemed.The containers are valued by recyclers because they are separated, cleaned and easier to recycle into a new container or other product.The scheme, which does not condone what it calls fossicking, has no data around the number of active hunters, but data compiled by Verian show the highest participation rate at collection points by age group to be 18- to 24-year-olds. About 66% of people over the age of 65 have used the scheme.Lee’s home bins are off-limits (an elderly man has claimed the turf) so she drives from her social housing in Matraville to spots around Malabar, Clovelly, Rose Bay and Bondi where friends have left her bags-full on porches and outside front doors.She knows where the bottled-water drinkers and the Jack Daniels premix fans live. And, she has learned when unit block caretakers move bins on to kerbsides before collections.“It’s getting more fierce,” she says of the competition. “It’s so hard. You’re on the road at a quarter past six and already you see the hunters.”Ricky’s main rivals are a duo who each start from one end of the same street, moving inwards. They used to give her the cold shoulder, Ricky says, but they now wave to one another.“Two other men used to work the same patch. They were cleaning up everything in the area.

I’m embarrassed,” she says. She and her late husband once owned five properties between them and dreamed of moving to Queensland in their retirement.“He would turn over in his grave if he saw me going through the bins.

I was a poor swimmer and splashing in the sea on holiday always had a hard edge to it. The second my toes left the sandy floor I panicked, for fear of being swept away.Things changed a few years ago at a friend’s birthday weekend in Cornwall. One February morning, a dozen of us took a hungover walk to the beach. It was overcast and blustery, and we had come to skinny-dip. I was buoyed up by the camaraderie and games of the night before, and felt a safety in numbers. People stripped off, actions hastened by the wind, and before I could think, I followed. We ran over sand and pebbles and dived into the oncoming waves. It was a total sensory overload. Salt filled my nose and mouth. I heard shrieks and cursing, and so much laughter. As I emerged there was a surge of adrenaline, and I couldn’t stop giggling. It was scary, but I was also proud, like a child who’s climbed a really big tree. Afterwards my skin tingled and as we shared a flask of tea, I felt singularly happy.I’d caught the bug. I started seeking out water – oceans, lochs, rivers – in all weathers. I proceeded nervously at first, like a puppy suspicious of a new toy, fighting the urge to jump right in or run away. It’s a feeling I revisited in my novel where my protagonist Elom, a solitary man who struggles to make sense of people and relationships, finds himself drawn to both the danger and serenity of open water. I think many people feel powerless – over finances, reproductive choices, living situations, our own bodies and minds. I see it at work, as a doctor in psychiatry and general practice in areas of high social deprivation. Wild swimming won’t solve the structural problems and isn’t for everybody, but I wonder how many of my patients might benefit from the feeling of agency that comes after a swim.My breaths became ragged and I was swallowing saltwaterIt’s a shame it took me so long to come round to it, given I’d shown promise as a five-year-old at swimming lessons. I won Most Improved after the first term and Mum sewed the goldfish badge on to my trunks, but we moved from Glasgow to Accra shortly afterwards, leaving the lessons behind. In Ghana, we spent lots of time by the pool, but more as an accessory to days out at hotels, rather than as a serious sport. The difference became clear when I was back in Scotland as a teenager, when I signed up for a regional swimming competition as part of an after-school club. I thought I’d missed my race when I saw the front crawl heat splash past. Turns out I’d confused it for the breast stroke and was in a race for a stroke I couldn’t do. When my 50m race actually started, everyone else finished their two lengths while I was still spluttering my way through the first. As I made my way back for the final length, the audience erupted into the sort of encouraging cheering saved for the end of a Hollywood film. Heartfelt, but entirely mortifying.I’d played into the stereotype – a Black guy who couldn’t swim – and was made to remember it through the casual cruelty that counts as banter in certain groups. I internalised it, too. I knew in theory that for an entire group, it was racist, but for me it was true – Iwasa bad swimmer, I just “couldn’t do it”, and that was that. I put it to one side and the next year signed up for athletics instead – a more fitting sport for someone like me.I next made a real attempt at swimming years later, on a university holiday to Nice. My friends decided to swim out to a platform about 100m from the shore. I felt sick at the thought, but was too proud to tap out among a group of athletic, gung-ho white guys, so I said I’d go along. They shot ahead, while I struggled along, fatiguing with every kick. The platform got no closer and I could see my friends on it, cannonballing into the water. I was about 20m out when I was sure I was going to drown. My breathing had become ragged, and I was swallowing saltwater with each gasp.Despite my panic, I didn’t call out. They say films are misleading – people don’t scream when they’re in trouble because they’re conserving oxygen. That’s true, but I was quiet because it was so humiliating. I almost let myself actually die of embarrassment. Fortunately, I did reach the platform and was trembling so much I was barely able to pull myself up the ladder. I lay flat for an hour, silently pretending to sunbathe when I was simply nauseated and dreading the return swim. When the time came, my friend Nick saw my poorly hidden despair as I stepped down the ladder into the water and he swam alongside me, coaching me to shore.It took years to get back into the water after that and in advance of our next holiday, I spent months doing laps at the local pool in my lunchbreak and after work, drilling myself until I was able to swim four sets of 25m lengths without stopping. The driving force wasn’t my own safety: it was the fear of further embarrassment, of once again being the only person who couldn’t swim, and who also happened to be the only Black person there, too. I made it through that holiday without incident, but I didn’t find any love for the sea. So the spontaneous skinny-dip in Cornwall caught me by surprise. The shrieks of laughter and deranged splashing changed open water from a minefield to a playground.I think a big part of that was the shock of the cold, too. Cold water is physically destabilising, but mentally calming. The sensations in my body become so urgent that my mind loses grip of anxious thoughts. Then, once my brain realises that yes, I am safe and no, I will not freeze to death, the adrenaline surging through me becomes fuel for a burning euphoria.I’ve now dipped all over the world: the Highlands, Inner Hebrides, Western Isles and Lake District; rockpool plunges in Inishmore (ofThe Banshees of Inisherinfame) and a New Year’s dip in Dublin; icy baths in the Japanese Alps; warmer Mediterranean splashes (though wild swimming doesn’t really count when it’s hot); and even a London reservoir, where one can break in after closing for a midnight swim and a moongaze.Admittedly, I’m probably stretching the word “swimming” pretty far. For me it’s usually a run and a frantic dip. It’s silly and full of laughter. I haven’t bought lots of kit, joined a club or set aside loads of time.You never regret a dip. No matter how cold, euphoria always winsI’m guided by two principles. First, when I see an appealing body of water, I assume I’m getting in until convinced otherwise. This spontaneity has changed how I look at the world: it’s a playground again and I’m a toddler, stomping in puddles instead of stressing about my shoes. Last year, during a cycle through the centre of Kyoto in 40C heat, a friend and I dunked ourselves in the crystal clear Kamo River. It’s safe for swimming and a few people had dipped their feet in, but it’s so shallow you have to lie as flat as a pancake to submerge yourself. The second principle is that you never regret a dip. No matter how cold or public, the euphoria always wins.It’s a powerful feeling and one which stayed with me while writing my novel. Elom finds solace in the tranquil waters around Iona in the Inner Hebrides. I found my own peace there, too, dipping every morning and writing in the afternoons for a week in early January. Like me, Elom struggles to follow the rules dictating who he’s supposed to be. For me, those rules became apparent in secondary school, when the playground stopped being a place of actual play. Instead, I found islands of teenagers, clumped together by some group identity. Survival required wearing the right uniform, even if it didn’t fit. There are just some things you can’t do.I still feel that way when I approach the water deep in the rural countryside – a look of surprise, or confusion from someone who’s supposed to be there, unlike me. But when the cold water hits, all of that goes out the window. It’s simply fun to make noises I’ve never heard myself make or to see my friends in disbelief, elation, or terror; doubled over with giggles as they stumble across shale to reach our pants before the waves do. It’s childlike and immediate, and for a few moments, I’m fully present, inside my own head, rather than watching myself from outside, assessing how I’m being viewed. Wild swimming reminds me who I am, not who I’m supposed to be.Before We Hit the Ground by Selali Fiamanya is published by the Borough Press at £16.99.

Despite the cold, they look happy and healthy, without a care in the world. Elsewhere on the farm it has been a stressful time. For better or worse, farms our size depend a lot on government grants to get by, but we’ve had compounding problems on this front recently. There was the announcement that thebasic payment schemewasn’t just being cut, but beingphased outfar quicker than expected.Another grant, our Environmental Stewardship agreement, ended at the end of 2024, and is mainly replaced by the SustainableFarmingIncentive scheme. I submitted an SFI application on 4 September, well ahead of the start of the agreement on 1 January, but it wasn’t confirmed until mid-February (and even then it was half the expected amount). Added to that, our final ES payment – paid annually, but usually in December – didn’t come through until February.These may not sound like big delays, but the margins on farms like ours are so tight, we were at one point running out of cash. We were starting to consider selling some livestock just to keep going. Planning ahead is also so important to this job, but delays make it almost impossible. This year we had plans to do some roofing and improve our farmyard drainage and water quality, but we’ve had to cancel those, which means someone else has lost work too. We could also have planted more orchard and restored habitats.I love farming this land. We’ve moved towards focusing on “public goods” as well as food, like successive governments have asked, but that’s also made us more reliant on state funding, so we need them to be reliable in return. We don’t even pay ourselves a wage, we just cover our costs and aim to stay in business. The stress and worry doesn’t go away that easily, and you start to expect nasty surprises, which isn’t a nice way to live.My son is still very concerned about inheritance tax. For many upland farms it would be impossible to pay the bill. He wants to try to make a better future for himself and other young farmers, and so has put himself forward in the Eamont and Shap byelection to the county council. Every evening is now spent knocking on doors, listening to the many concerns of local people.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsFarmingCountry diaryRural affairsCumbriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the top brass there were individual villas; for the lower ranks, a choice of six hotels, while the foot soldiers were relegated to a camping site surrounded by palm trees and lush greenery.Tito found Kupari so agreeable that he built his-and-hers holiday villas nearby overlooking the Adriatic Sea. where he and his wife, Jovanka, entertained VIP guests including Hollywood stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.In the 1990s, whenYugoslavia descended into war, more than a decade after Tito’s death and during the battle for Croatian independence, the site was shelled. Today, the hotels, once the height of postwar luxury, are concrete skeletons, strewn with detritus and covered with graffiti.Now, after three decades of neglect, locals are hoping the site will finally be returned to its former glory as part of a €150m five-star development.“It has been an eyesore for 30 years, so everyone is pleased it will be developed and it will offer local employment,” Marko Dabrović, the architect overseeing the plans, told theObserverduring an exclusive visit to the fenced-off site. “But after 10 years of on, off, stop, start, will it, won’t it happen, they are waiting to see if it really does.”View image in fullscreenVisitors to Kupari 1922, before Tito ordered the resort to be built.Russian investors first approached Zagreb-based architects 3LHD, which Dabrović runs with three partners, to draw up plans for the site 10 years ago, but Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions forced the investors to pull out. A Singapore-based consortium working with the Four Seasons hotel group has since taken over the project.View image in fullscreenKupari today … dilapidated and in need of a serious makeover.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The ObserverIn recent years, Kupari’s ruins have appealed to off-the-beaten-track tourists who have picked over its deserted rooms or camped in dusty corridors and hallways while composing blogs about the “bay of abandoned hotels”.View image in fullscreenJosip Broz Tito and his wife, Jovanka Broz, on his 65th birthday.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveIn 2022, the biopicLee,in which Kate Winslet played the second world war photographer Lee Miller, was partly shot at Kupari, made to look like 1945 Normandy. And in March last year, popular YouTuber Mr Beast released a video filmed here calledISurvived 7DaysinanAbandonedCitywhich was viewed by more than 2 million people in the first half hour.On a crisp February morning, the Jugo wind that gave Yugoslavia its name gusted through the windows of the Pelegrin Hotel, a trapezoid-shaped building designed by Sarajevan architect David Finci and lauded as a masterpiece when it opened in 1963. Today, it is a concrete carcass: the roof open to the rain, the marble steps smashed or stolen, the furniture gone and the Olympic-size swimming pool full of rubbish.The sea-facing walls are covered in graffiti and pockmarked with shrapnel from artillery attacks by the Yugoslav navy in the 1991-92 siege of Dubrovnik. Campaigners sought – unsuccessfully – to have it listed as a heritage building but Dabrović believes it is beyond repair.“It was architecturally interesting but even if we could rebuild it – and we cannot – it would not meet modern safety standards,” Dabrović said.Having grown up in Dubrovnik, he remembers the site in its heyday: “I have fond memories of playing water polo at the Kupari pool when I was 13 or 14. I would come here on a daily basis. There was a lot of military around back then. It was spooky but was still a working holiday resort.”View image in fullscreenAn abandoned and vandalised hotel at Kupari.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The ObserverKupari’s historic centrepiece was the Grand Hotel, a palatial-style edifice built in 1923 by a Czech businessman around the kiln of a former brick factory.

I’m slightly put out by the nervousness with which the servants serve us all.”He added: “Both Tito and Madame Broz tell long stories which they don’t allow the interpreters to interrupt, result being that by the time the latter have finished one couldn’t care less what the story is about … It is as well that I’m not drinking or I might be asking some very awkward questions.”View image in fullscreenKupari in 1972.The Pelegrin and other buildings will be demolished but the Grand is subject to a preservation order and will be rebuilt, keeping the original facade. The new development features a 220-bed luxury hotel with terraced wings on one side of the bay and 32 individual villas set into the hillside on the other, which will be sold to private owners and rented back to the hotel.The beach will be reinstated and a small marina added. The site and coastline will be open to the public. Tito’s villas, while in desperate need of renovation, remain state property and will not be touched.View image in fullscreenArchitect Marko Dabrović at the Grand Hotel.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The Observer‘Everyone loved each other’: the rise of YugonostalgiaRead more“The challenge has been to integrate the new buildings into the landscape.

Standing on the roof of the Pelegrin, Dabrović juggled calls from officials threatening to delay building permits, but remained optimistic that the bulldozers parked on the site would soon be at work.“As architects, it has been very frustrating.

One doctor argues just thatBySuzanne O'SullivanSat 1 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTShareSchool was a difficult time for Anna. It still haunts her. She recalls being a sociable child, good at making friends. But she also remembers becoming hyperfixated on one friend, then another and another in succession. She tended to be impulsive and, wanting to please others, easily led. One distressing incident in particular has never left her. On the first day after moving to a new school, she was relieved to be taken under the wing of two girls. At lunchtime, in fits of giggles, the girls egged each other on to do naughty things. Anna spat orange juice at the boys. She did it with relish, only to reproach herself later. She feels the episode coloured her whole school experience.As a child and an adult, Anna felt sanctioned, judged and misunderstood. She considers herself a chameleon who adapts to new environments and survives by being funny, but all too often regrets things she has said. Her self-esteem is low. Anna is a nurse and, although she loves her job and is good at it, she still often feels inadequate. “People don’t think I’m as clever as I feel. I can’t get the words out quickly enough,” she says.When she was in her early 20s, she remembers being exhausted all the time. She couldn’t control her emotions and complained of a poor memory. She left her keys in ridiculous places – one time in the fridge. She forgot to turn off the hob and unplug the iron. “I can never remember things people tell me, like how many children they have. I hate it because it makes me look as if I don’t care, and I do.”Anna has sought medical advice many times throughout her life. In her 20s, her GP diagnosed her with depression and put her on antidepressants. They made her feel numb, so she stopped them. She saw a nutritionist who told her she had a yeast infection and put her on a restrictive diet. It helped but only for a few months. She saw a therapist weekly for 10 years and found that beneficial, but still her mood fluctuated.Anna came to wonder if she was neurodivergent only when she was in her 40s, after a conversation with a friend who had been diagnosed withattention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD). “I have always been lovingly teased as somebody who would trip over the pattern in the carpet,” she says with a smile. “I was quirky. So when my friend sent me a newspaper article about neurodivergence, the description hit me like a bus. The article could have been written about me.”After some research, Anna paid to have an online assessment for ADHD. The diagnostic interview took 90 minutes. The assessor, who Anna thought was a psychiatrist but wasn’t sure, drew her attention to things she hadn’t noticed about herself. When asked if she was excessively fidgety, Anna said she was not, but the assessor pointed out that she had twiddled with her hair repeatedly during their consultation. Anna realised that shewasunusually fidgety, remembering how she always doodled during meetings.Anna now realises she has underplayed her ADHD traits all her life. The diagnosis made so much sense to her. Slow neurological processing explained why she had such a bad memory and could not communicate her ideas to other people as clearly as she wished to. No wonder she was exhausted, with all the effort required to camouflage her difficulties and hide her mistakes.Anna now takes the stimulant drug methylphenidate (Ritalin). “The first time I took it, I couldn’t believe how clearly I could think.” She could make decisions more quickly, prioritise, and had more energy. I wondered how this affected the practical aspects of her life, in work and relationships. “Is my life better? Yes and no.”Anna’s workplace have been supportive. They have made adjustments, such as giving her a private, low-ceilinged office, which she feels reduces noise reverberation and provides quiet when she needs it. She is also allowed to wear noise-cancelling headphones if she is in a busy environment. Colleagues have been taught not to burst into her office without warning. Despite this, Anna still finds work challenging and feels she has to constantly remind people that she has a disability. So much so that she is off work now and does not see herself ever returning. Part of the ongoing problem is that neither Anna nor her employer know what she really needs. “When somebody asks if I want help, I don’t know what to ask for,” she tells me.I ask how family and friends received her diagnosis. A common response when she describes her symptoms is “everybody has that”. Everybody is a bit disorganised. Everybody finds work hard. “The difference is I feel like that all day, every day,” Anna says. “I never feel OK.”Ihave been a doctor for more than 30 years and a neurologist for 25 of those. I have recently grown particularly worried about the large number of young people referred to me with four or five pre-existing diagnoses of chronic conditions, only some of which can be cured.Autism, Tourette syndrome, ADHD, migraines, fibromyalgia, polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, eating disorders, anxiety and many more.The startling rise in people diagnosed with mental health disorders, behavioural and learning difficulties features regularly in newspaper headlines and in our conversations: “ADHD: what’s behind the recent explosion in diagnoses?”,New Scientist, May 2023. “Autism prevalence rises again, study finds”,the New York Times, March 2023. The story is the same for multiple categories of mental health disorder. “PTSD has surged among college students”,the New York Times, May 2024. “Depression and anxiety rates have increased by 25% in the past year”,Forbes, February 2023.What do these astonishing statistics say about the state of our health? On the surface, they make it seem as if we are considerably less mentally and physically healthy than we used to be. But there are other ways of interpreting them. Could they simply reflect the fact that we are much better at recognising medical problems and identifying people in need of treatment? Disorders such as autism may be on the rise because people are finally getting the right diagnosis and being given support. But there is a third possibility. It could be that not all these new diagnoses are entirely what they seem. It could be that borderline medical problems are becoming iron-clad diagnoses and normal differences are being pathologised. These statistics could indicate that ordinary life experiences, bodily imperfections, sadness and social anxiety are being subsumed into the category of medical disorder. In other words: we are not getting sicker – we are attributing more to sickness.Which of these explanations is most likely to be correct is a matter on which it is hard to find agreement. But it is very much in our interest to find the answer because the trend of detecting health issues in milder and earlier forms, and the assumption that is always the right thing to do, is pressing forward relentlessly.I would make a case for possibility number three: that we are becoming victims of too much medicine and it is time to turn back the dial. That we are living in the age of diagnosis for mental and physical health conditions. And there is no better illustration of this than the recent explosion of people diagnosed with ADHD.ADHD started out as a defined medical condition in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-2) in 1968, in which it was referred to as hyperkinetic reaction in children, described in a single line as distractibility and restlessness that went away in adolescence. In 1980, the DSM-3 introduced the term attention deficit disorder (ADD), with hyperactivity added in the revised edition of the DSM-3 in 1987. The DSM-5 describes ADHD as a pattern of inattention or hyperactivity that interferes with social functioning or development. The diagnosis requires that the difficulties be present before the age of 12, that they are present in two or more settings, and reduce the quality of social, academic or occupational functioning. The distinction between mild, moderate and severe ADHD is very vague.Like all medical problems, ADHD has a range of severities. One of my most vivid encounters with it was not with a patient, but in spending time with Kendra, the young daughter of a friend. Aged eight, Kendra, who had severe ADHD, had a level of energy and lack of focus that was impossible to keep up with. She pinged from person to person in a group, speaking quickly and jumping from topic to topic. She was a wonderfully affectionate child and I had the sense she was also very intelligent, but it was hard to test that theory because she couldn’t apply her attention to anything for long. I once joined her and her mother for a shopping trip. Such was her energy that no one could relax. I was sure she’d dash away and we’d lose her. She didn’t. She grew up safe and well cared for to become a creative adult. She still has problems with lack of focus. She found education hard, but she found her place. She’s an artist, which allows her to work at her own pace, in her own way, and which makes the most of her flexible thinking.Diagnostic rates of severe ADHD, as Kendra had, are actually quite stable. But those with severe ADHD are now vastly outnumbered by those with mild ADHD. As with autism, there have been staggering increases in the number of people diagnosed with ADHD in the last 30 years, but that growth is almost all at the milder end of the spectrum.New diagnosis in adulthood has gone from being very rare toas high as one in 20adults in some places. These are almost all in the mild domain. The UK has seena 400% increasein adults seeking an ADHD diagnosis between 2020 and 2023.Every new DSM volume suggests potential future ‘conditions’. The committee suggested ‘caffeine use disorder’ for the next editionThe diagnosis is less formalised than for autism. It involves a detailed clinical evaluation by a qualified professional. In addition, various rating scales are available to help quantify symptoms present that might indicate either inattention or hyperactivity. Many of these rely on self-reported symptoms. That makes the diagnosis inherently subjective. The DSM lists examples of the sort of difficulties that might be expected, including “often loses things”, “often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly”, “often avoids … tasks”, “often talks excessively”, “often fidgets”. The word “often” is open to interpretation. A diagnosis requires that symptoms interfere with the quality of social, academic or occupational functioning. That is very difficult to measure. Presumably any person who seeks out an assessment for ADHD will do so only because they are struggling in some aspect of their life.A large number of people who have ADHD also have one or more other related diagnoses, such as autism, anxiety and depression.One study found87% of adults with ADHD had a second psychiatric diagnosis and 56% had a third. The DSM-5 allowed a diagnosis of both ADHD and autism in the same person for the first time in 2013. Before that, these diagnoses were mutually exclusive. Since the DSM-5, the number of people with both is rising steadily. Anna has a history of depression and is considering asking for an assessment for autism.The frank truth of it is that, despite decades of work, no biomedical research project has succeeded in finding any brain abnormality common to ADHD sufferers. There are no biomarkers that allow behaviours exhibited by people with ADHD to be distinguished from other disorders or from normal human experience. Even those researchers intent on finding the biological “cause” for ADHD will admit it is a condition that manifests in many ways in a wide range of people, and has lots of different long-term outcomes. Yet we gather people who have the traits considered consistent with ADHD under one medical category, studying and treating them as if they were a single group, all of whom unequivocally have a brain development disorder.The biologising – or more accurately the pathologising – of mental health problems and behavioural disorders is a trend right now, within medicine and in society. It is not unusual to hear depression described as a serotonin deficiency rather than as a reaction to life circumstances. In that atmosphere, concentrating too much on the social or psychological aspects of illness is increasingly referred to as medical gaslighting by some patients – it is seen as denying somebody else’s truth.Forgetfulness, lack of motivation, noise intolerance, social anxiety, low mood, distractibility and concentration difficulties are all part of the human experience. Each of these has become increasingly pathologised, in part because of their inclusion in categories in the DSM.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Anna Parini/The GuardianSystems that classify illness and disease are essential, and I can’t see how health services or research facilities would operate in their absence. The problem with the DSM is not that it exists but that it is taken more literally than intended. It also seems to be very hard to dial back DSM categories, even when it is clear they have gone too far. Whenever a tightening of criteria risks taking a diagnosis away from some people, a new diagnostic label is usually created so nobody will be without a diagnosis. That is what happened in the DSM-5, when a “social (pragmatic) communication disorder” category was developed to account for people who might no longer qualify as having autism according to the newest criteria. Every new volume even suggests problems worth considering as future “conditions”. The DSM-5 committee suggested “caffeine use disorder” as a potential category for the next edition. This is defined as problematic caffeine use leading to impairment and distress. And the biologising is already under way: studies on twins showcaffeine overuse is heritableand variants in the ADORA2A gene have been associated with it.The DSM approach is not the only way. Many fear, as I do, that biologising mental distress and behavioural problems can get in the way of an examination of life and society that might lead to personal insights that could contribute to more lasting improvement. There is a growing feeling among some medical professionals that there should be a move away from an overly biologising approach. Vocal among that group ispsychologist Lucy Johnstone, who sees the diagnosis of mental health conditions as obscuring personal meaning, damaging personal identity and removing agency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In this theory, experiences that are described as “symptoms” are actually a reaction to threats and a manifestation of what a person needs to do to overcome that threat. Humans are essentially social beings. Troubled behaviour and low mood are inseparable from their social environment and relationships. As Johnstone says, what is classed as mental illness can be a person’s attempt to be protected, valued or to find their place. For Anna, this might mean examining how events such as the need to change schools in the middle of an academic year affected her. Her subsequent feelings and actions might be better regarded as a survival strategy rather than as a brain disorder. “Our behaviour is an intelligible response to our circumstance, history, belief systems and bodily capacities,” Johnstone says.When mental health problems are viewed in this way, recovery starts to seem far more possible. The importance of this is illustrated by the story of Prof Paul Garner, a UK-based senior medical doctor and researcher. In March 2020, Garner caught Covid-19 and was shocked to find himself severely fatigued weeks after the acute infection seemed to have passed. His initial infection had been mild but the aftermath left him feeling as if he had been hit “around the head with a cricket bat”. At points, he felt he was dying. He had a new symptom every day: muggy head, upset stomach, tinnitus, pins and needles, breathlessness, dizziness. In a blog for the British Medical Journal, he described his illness as like “an Advent calendar, every day there was something new”.Garner is an infectious disease specialist. He expected that he, of all people, should be able to explain what was happening to his own body, but found he couldn’t. He wondered if the virus had triggered some novel immunological disorder that did not exist in medical textbooks. So he turned to the internet for answers and found he was not alone. Inlong Covidsupport groups, there were lots of people who shared his exact experience. Marathon runners who could no longer walk after mild Covid. Through the long Covid groups, he found his way to communities of people who had developed chronic fatigue syndromes after other infections. Many of these people had been ill for decades. His original expectation, based on his medical knowledge, was that he should get steadily better with time, recuperation and gentle increases in activity. But that was not marrying with his unfolding reality. A 10-minute bike ride taken on a good day had provoked a three-day relapse. So Garner decided to learn from the narratives of those who had been dealing with non-recovery for much longer than him. They recommended pacing: working within the limits of his energy levels rather than trying to exercise his way out of the situation. He took advice from a friend: “Stop trying to dominate the virus … accommodate it.” He learned to do less. That brought him to a baseline in which he was not getting worse – but he was not getting better, either.I suddenly believed I’d recover completely. I stopped reading about illness and discussing symptoms. I spent time seeking joyThat could have been where Garner’s story ended. By September 2020, he had improved but he was no longer recovering further. So he started searching beyond the non-recovery stories, for those with more positive outcomes. That was how he found Recovery Norway, a group of people who once had chronic fatigue syndrome but had beaten it. The group gave him a recovery mentor as well as another perspective and, crucially, a recovery identity. He realised that while pacing had helped him at the start, he had then become obsessed with it. As he described in his blog, he had started to unconsciously monitor signals from his body until he became paralysed with fear. He believed long Covid was a metabolic disease that had damaged his mitochondria, but the Norway group made him think differently. He didn’t doubt the virus had triggered the fatigue but felt he had later become caught in a vicious cycle of illness driven by his fear. Viruses cause fatigue in order to make people rest, which promotes recovery. But, in Garner’s case, his recovery had gone awry because he inadvertently conditioned his body to stay tired. Garner realised he had to retrain his brain to react differently to the fatigue if he was to get better.“I suddenly believed I would recover completely,”he writes. “I stopped my constant monitoring of symptoms. I avoided reading stories about illness and discussing symptoms, research or treatments by dropping off the Facebook groups with other patients. I spent time seeking joy, happiness … and overcame my fear of exercise.” By the end of 2020 he had made a full recovery.ADHD USED TO HAVE a recovery identity. In the 1960s and 70s, the DSM described it as condition that went away in adolescence. By the 90s, it was recognised that the symptoms did not always disappear completely but did lessen as people got older.Some studies found remission in up to 60% of people. Severe ADHD lessened but often persisted, while people with mild ADHD could expect a chance of full recovery. But ADHD is slowly being incorporated into the identities of many young people. Some support groups discourage the attempt to overcome ADHD traits. People are told to unmask and to share their ADHD selves with others. But learning to control our moods, behaviour and impulses is part of growing up, whether one has ADHD or not. We all become more socially competent, gain focus and are better able to cope through practice. Encouraging young people to do otherwise may be well-intentioned but potentially sets them up for non-recovery. The rise in subtler ADHD presentations in adults may also undermine a young person’s expectation that their difficulties will disappear in time. A growing population of adults have incorporated ADHD into their self-concept. When a medical problem is part of a person’s identity, it becomes inescapable.Neurodiversity was coined in 1998 by theAustralian sociologist Judy Singer. It is not actually a medical term but it sounds like one. In an interview, Singer described how she came up with it: “I got it from a combination of biodiversity, which is a political term saying it’s good to have diversity in the environment. I noticed that psychotherapy was becoming a bit of a joke and neuroscientists were the new priesthood, so I thought, let’s put them together.”The term has come to be used to encompass a range of conditions, including depression, ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia and Tourette syndrome. There is certainly a lot that is positive to be said about its use to remind us that all our brains are different and that, as a consequence, we perceive the world and function differently. There is no right or wrong way to behave or feel, and all ways of being should be embraced.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Anna Parini/The GuardianHowever, the problem is that the term is not used in that way. Instead, it is used as a counterpoint to the term “neurotypical”. A neurotypical person is said to organise their thoughts and behave in a “typical” way. A very common explanation for the difference between neurodivergent and neurotypical people is that the latter were born with an inbuilt handbook for life, which gives them an innate sense of social rules. Neurodivergent people did not receive the handbook and therefore have to work much harder to learn and fit in. The division of people into typical and diverse immediately contradicts the sensible statement that we are all different. It brings to mind George Orwell’s Animal Farm, where the pigs decide that “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others”.Neurodivergent conditions are still finding their place but what is clear is that people with that label are suffering. Their hardship is real or they would not have sought a diagnosis. Anna has struggled for a very long time. She’s had a lot of internal pain and needs support. But the question arises as to whether the benefits to those diagnosed with ADHD outweigh the drawbacks of being labelled with a brain disorder. If they do not, then this is an example of overdiagnosis – the diagnosis might be right but it is not beneficial.The issue with overdiagnosis is always around the benefit of diagnosis and value of special accommodations to those mildly affected. One Canadian study compared university students with ADHD, some of whom received no special accommodations and some of whom were given help, such as extended time for tests and separate test-taking rooms. The students who got extra support perceived it as helpful but there was no measurable benefit in terms of academic performance. Several studies have looked at school-age children and students in higher education who weregiven various allowances, including a reduced distraction environment, use of a calculator, more frequent breaks and oral presentation of written information. Again, people with ADHD who received this extra support performed no better than pupils with ADHD who did not. One study found children screened for ADHD in school did not benefit but raised the concern that they were harmed by being labelled at such a young age. Similarly, special accommodations made to support adults with ADHD have yet to be proved to make a useful difference to their lives.Stimulants are not first-line treatment for ADHD in children. They are reserved for when behavioural treatments and support are not enough. The short-term efficacy of stimulants in children is considered to be well-established in reducing symptoms such as hyperactivity. They improve concentration and teachers perceive better behaviour in children taking them. However, most studies have followed the children for only a short period of time. What is less clear is whether or not that symptom reduction translates to something more meaningful in the long term, such as a better quality of life or academic performance. Stimulant medication reduces symptoms only while you are taking it. For a more lasting treatment effect, behavioural interventions are needed. Again, children with severe ADHD are the ones who stand to gain from stimulant medication, because their disability is such that medication has a more palpable effect on their ability to concentrate on tasks such as reading so they have time to learn. At the mild end, there is doubt that stimulant use has enough of an impact to offset either the negative effects of labelling or the low expectation that can be inferred from a mental health diagnosis.Nobody could help me with my psychosis. Then I was sent to jail for holding up a shop with a toy gunRead moreIt is only anecdotal, but the lack of palpable life improvements for people diagnosed with either ADHD or autism is something that concerned me many times as I interviewed people about this subject. Of the scores of people I spoke to, all of whom were adults, all perceived their lives to be better off thanks to a diagnosis. Every person welcomed the diagnosis into their lives. But almost all had left their job, dropped out of education and lost many old friends. Several were housebound. The same can be said about those I spoke to with chronicLyme diseaseand long Covid. I saw a worrying gap between the perceived benefit of being diagnosed and any actual improvements in quality of life. In most conversations, I was left wondering how long the positive impact of validation would last.The people I talked to each got great psychological relief from their diagnosis and were sure it had made their lives better. Perhaps what they actually needed from a diagnosis was permission to do less in a world that values only very particular types of success. For some, medical diagnosis is a means to take the pressure off, so they no longer feel forced to continue chasing after an overly idealistic social and work life.One woman’s story stood out. She’s an artist who has had some significant successes, but not the success she wanted. She would prefer to be an academic, she told me, but it wasn’t her talent. As a teenager, she imagined her adult self quoting poetry off the cuff. The pain of not turning out to be that adult was terrible for her. It stopped her enjoying the success she had. Eventually, a diagnosis of ADHD helped her accept that she could not be equally talented in every way she wanted. The diagnosis gave her some comfort but also caused stagnation in her life. It reinforced her belief in a lesser version of herself. Rather than being defined by a successful art career that others would envy, she became a woman whose life revolved around ADHD and was defined by the things she could not do because she was neurodevelopmentally different. I worry that a child told they are different in this way will underestimate themselves and limit their future.Excessive medical diagnosis risks robbing people of a recovery identity and promoting intolerance by othering; by dividing the world into neurodivergents and neurotypicals. It must be very hard to set out or continue on life’s big journey if your aspirations have been narrowed by a diagnosis that is uncertain or offers very little. Let’s find a way to be more tolerant of difference and imperfections that still allows people to live a life unencumbered by a diagnosis.This is an edited extract from The Age of Diagnosis: Sickness, Health and Why Medicine Has Gone Too Far by Suzanne O’Sullivan, published by Hodder Press, on 18 March at £22.

Various other operators come and go in William Friedkin’s gritty and unsettling procedural – based on a real heroin sting – before Hackman’s Detective Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle emerges from behind an ill-fitting undercover Santa Claus outfit, like a background player busting into his first lead role. It’s as fitting an entrance as ever for Hackman, leveling up after his supporting work on TV and films like Bonnie and Clyde. And he gives a performance that sets the tone for his whole career, playing the brutal and racist cop, a morally murky figure who just doesn’t sit right as the hero of the story. Many of the qualities that made Hackman so great in later villainous roles – the way he moves like a menace with a devilishly charming grin, slipping so easily from comforting to antagonizing – are in Doyle. That detective’s infamous query, repeatedly grilling suspects about picking their feet in Poughkeepsie, is as mischievously disorienting as Hackman’s onscreen presence.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe Poseidon AdventureAs an 11-year-old of a nervous disposition, The Poseidon Adventure was a sight to behold. Possibly the first disaster movie I saw, and certainly the firstGene Hackmanfilm, it went straight to the heart of those pre-adolescent terrors: Would the cross-channel ferry stay upright? Was there a priest about who could save everyone’s skins? Was there an Olympic swimming champion concealed inside someone’s unlikely looking mum? Hackman would of course make much better films, both before (Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith, The French Connection) and after (take your pick), but for sheer messianic fervour there’s nothing to match it. The amazing scene where he yells at the Almighty while trying to turn off a steam valve is one of the all time greats, Gene Hackman at his Gene Hackmanest. His character – a hip, muscular clergyman – was an outdated trope even then (and probably was when Karl Malden did one in On the Waterfront 20 years earlier) but I personally prefer it to sax-tootler Harry Caul, his generally lauded performance of a similar vintage. “Keep going. Rogo!”Andrew PulverThe ConversationI was embarrassingly late toThe Conversation, despite a youth in which Gene Hackman played an important part, and like many films one only consumes through references and iconography, I developed an impression of what I thought it would be. I was partly right (there is a great deal of both paranoia and the granular details of early 70s surveillance tech) but I was mostly wrong. I had assumed a grander tale of a more complex conspiracy but what I found was something smaller and sadder, a thriller second and a character study first, one of a low-key everyman wrecked by guilt and cursed by loneliness. Hackman’s Harry Caul is a man whose greatest skill – the “best bugger on the west coast” – is something that will never bring him peace, just permanent anxiety. He knows how unsafe the world can increasingly be – it’s his job to further make it that way, and this distrust leads him away from potential relationships and toward an internal unravelling. Hackman plays this with poignance, carrying the visible, shoulder-crippling weight of what he’s been forced to live with, avoiding the cheap, nervy mannerisms many others would lazily employ. The ending is one of dramatic combustion but there’s also a calm in Harry realising that his overbearing control was just an illusion. It’s not about giving up, it’s more about accepting life’s limitations and trying to find peace within them.Benjamin LeeNight MovesGene Hackman’s second collaboration with director Arthur Penn revolves around some convoluted business with illegally imported indigenous artifacts from the Yucatán peninsula, but the ne plus ultra of New Hollywood downers is really the story of a beaten-down man working his way to the end of his rope. Introduced in decline as past-his-prime former football player turned PI turned cuckold Harry Moseby, Hackman spends the film on defense, the substance of his performance resting in his efforts to stave off undesirable parts of himself: his physical deterioration following a recklessly spent youth, his bitterness toward women, his cynicism amplified by the cruelty and greed and statutory incest all around him. We leave him on a dour note, bleeding out and spinning in impotent circles, but Hackman shines in the asides of sardonic wit delivered with a hangdog almost-smirk, which now cement his legacy with a dozen classic soundbites. Of a night at the movies: “I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kind of like watching paint dry.” When asked who’s winning an anemic football game: “Nobody. One side is just losing slower than the other.” Offering cold comfort to a wayward teen: “I know it doesn’t make much sense when you’re 16. Don’t worry. When you get to be 40, it isn’t any better.” We could go on.Charles BramescoHoosiersNo film has done more to shape American sportswriting than Hoosiers. Scribes of my generation in particular proudly boast of wearing out VHS copies of the film in adolescence, and how those ad infinitum replays destined them to a future of sweating out press deadlines from some of the best seats in the house. But Hickory High’s unlikely march to the Indiana state basketball championship doesn’t become the too-good-to-be-true story that sportswriters look for in every gym without Hackman bringing it home as Normal Dale, the disgraced college coach tasked with turning around the team. When sportswriters take note of actual coaches sermonizing about playing the game ”the right way”, it’s because we can’t help quoting Coach Brown when we hear him. And though the character may take inspiration from flesh-and-blood Hoosier state personalities – Indiana coach Bobby Knight, not least – it was Hackman who ultimately made Coach Dale complex, compassionate and imminently worth rooting for. Coach Dale’s disciplined, team-first approach may have gone out of style decades ago (“There’s more to the game than shooting!” he famously groaned), but Hackman at the top of this acting game lives for all time.Andrew LawrenceUnforgivenHackman’s shady sheriff is the lawman in the small town of Big Whiskey, where the ladies of the saloon demand justice after one of them is assaulted by a passing cowpoke. He’s entirely the low-key psychopath Eastwood’s antiheroic western deserves, a man capable of plausible affability but then, with a sudden darkening of his mood, callous rough justice. First he outrages the sex workers by attempting to appease them with horse-trading, then he applies his boots to the faces of elderly mercenaries like Richard Harris’s English Bob who come to collect the bounty. In one chilling scene, Bill sneers as he forces Eastwood’s feverish Will Munny to slither out of the saloon on his belly into the mud. Disarmingly, he’s often quite likable. He’s an inept amateur housebuilder, ham-handedly manufacturing himself a porch where he can pass his retirement admiring the sunset, or a vivid raconteur, impressing a hack writer with by factchecking some overcooked yarns of the good old days. Similarly, Hackman resists the temptation to overplay this double-sided character, and this Oscar-winning performance is all the more unsettling for it.Pamela HutchinsonThe FirmAs Avery Tolar, a senior partner at a sinister Memphis law practice in The Firm, Hackman haunts Mitch McDeere, the idealistic young recruit played by Tom Cruise, like the ghost of his own corrupt future, when boozing and womanizing will be his only means of muting his guilty conscience. In order to survive at the firm – quite literally, Mitch will learn – he must embrace its rogue culture of mobbed-up criminality and Avery is Mitch’s mentor through the process, walking him through the legal shortcuts he’ll need to master in order to serve his wealthy clients. He also has an eye on Mitch’s wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn), despite their age difference, which speaks to a life where he’s constantly rewarded for his ethical compromise. Yet Hackman plays Avery with an unmistakable world-weariness that’s fully revealed in a moment when he seems to remember the man he used to be and willingly pays the toll for his sins.Scott TobiasThe Royal TenenbaumsIt’s become a bit of a naysayer cliche to claim that Gene Hackman was the last actor to really bring a Wes Anderson character to life within the writer-director’s hermetically sealed, tightly controlled environment. But while I don’t agree with all that, there is inarguably something special about Hackman’s performance in The Royal Tenenbaums as the shifty, irascible patriarch of a genius family he doesn’t seem to understand (at least not at first). As Royal Tenenbaum, a deeply flawed man who is nonetheless – unlike his depressive adult children – unburdened by faded memories of prodigious achievement, Hackman’s unfussy, straight-ahead acting style perfectly cuts through the movie’s deadpan melancholy and enhances it at every turn. Though he was great in plenty of comedies, Hackman was rarely pitched this many comic fastballs, every one of which he knocks out of the park with a crisp crack, helping to make Tenenbaums Anderson’s most quotable film. (“I’m very sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” “It’s still frowned upon, but then, what isn’t these days, right?” “That’s the last time you put a knife in me!” – and so on.) And though Royal is more two-bit conman than precocious prodigy, he’s still a deeply Andersonian creation: a man so fixated on his vision that he will self-consciously engineer his own redemption arc, even if it means faking a cancer diagnosis. When Hackman shows that shamelessness giving way to tenderness at the end of the film, demonstrating gentle empathy to his distraught son Chas (Ben Stiller), The Royal Tenenbaums becomes not just Anderson’s funniest film, but one of his most moving, too.Jesse HassengerExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanThe ConversationClint EastwoodFrancis Ford  CoppolaWilliam FriedkinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are the smart choices to make – with weights and without – for all agesJames WittsSat 1 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 10.33 ESTShareGym culture is changing. Once the preserve of musclemen whose veins looked ready to pop, now muscle-strengthening activities are being advised by the NHSfor those aged 19-64at least twice a week. That’s because an increasing body of evidence links strength work with wellbeing and longevity, including a2024 studythat showed 90 minutes of strength training a week resulted in four years less biological ageing. Maybe that’s why about 15% of the UK population is now a member of a gym. Part of the appeal is accessibility – it’s not as technical as swimming, for example – but despite its simplicity, there’s a huge amount of misinformation and conflicting advice.Low or high reps?Strength-training exercises are structured into a number of sets made up of repetitions. For instance, eight lifts, rest, followed by eight further lifts equates to two sets of eight. Finding the optimal combination of sets, reps and rest for gaining strength is a well-worn gym debate, but science is beginning to settle on an answer.“Building muscle – hypertrophy – can occur across all rep ranges, from low, moderate and high,” saysChris Peden, a former Royal Navy physical training instructor and now a strength and conditioning coach to professional and amateur athletes. “However, the optimum range appears to be in the moderate range of 6-12 reps and with a moderate intensity of load between 65% and 85% of an individual’s one-rep maximum.”Peden adds that finding your one rep maximum (1RM) isn’t essential for beginners, especially as you could strain a muscle through inexperience. Just go on what feels tough but not dangerously so. Alternatively, you can use an app such asHevyorStrongliftsto create a programme, calculate your 1RM, track your progress and suggest when you’re ready to upgrade to a heavier weight.Peden stresses that a high rep number isn’t the most efficient way to increase strength. A 2015studyin theJournal of Strength and Conditioning Researchthat compared a high-rep (25-35 reps), low-weight group and a higher-weight, lower-rep (8-12) group, and discovered that muscle size for both groups was similar. However, the heavier-weight group enjoyed the greatest strength gains because of the greater recruitment of muscle fibres.View image in fullscreenMuscle building happens ‘across all rep ranges’ and with higher and lower weights’, says personal trainer Chris Peden.Photograph: Hiraman/Getty ImagesHow much rest do I need?When it comes to strength gains, what you do between lifts matters as much as what you do during them. “Generally, you should enjoy 90-150 seconds’ rest between sets for hypertrophy and 3-5 minutes’ rest for building strength,” says Peden. “If time isn’t an issue, I’d recommend resting a little longer if you can because it cranks up quality across all reps and sets. Rest as required; in other words, rest until you feel ready to go again and not by a strict timer.”Free weights or machines?When it comes to choosing machines or free weights, take heed of the legend of Milo of Croton, a six-time Olympic champion wrestler in the sixth-century BC, whose training is said to have involved lifting a calf over his head every day until it became a fully grown cow. Milo’s beefy exploits show that your workload needs to progress if you want to keep on improving, and also indicate that the precise usage of specific equipment isn’t the be-all and end-all.“A mix of machines and free weights usually works best for strength and building muscle, though free weights help train the body in a more rounded fashion, incorporating stabiliser muscles,” says Peden. “This has its advantages in sporting settings and everyday life.”Dumbbells and barbells that aren’t connected to a pulley deliver a greater benefit because you’re forced to balance your entire body while performing an exercise. For example, a standing biceps curl, which engages not only the biceps but also your back, abdominals and even your quadriceps to keep your body upright. This multimuscle engagement is more reflective of the real world, whether hitting a forehand on the tennis court or easing yourself in and out of a car.Aren’t body-weight exercises sufficient?Do you really have to spend on gym membership if crunches, press-ups and so on will give similar results? “Body-weight exercises kickstart the process of getting stronger and building muscle,” says Peden, “but ultimately it becomes harder to progress as you’ll lack the meaningful level of resistance to sufficiently stress the muscular system.”A fundamental weakness of body-weight exercises is that the stress (your weight) stays the same (or even decreases) while your strength increases. That said, you can adjust the difficulty of home-based exercises; with press-ups, you can put your feet on a chair or use just one arm.View image in fullscreenBody-weight exercises ‘kickstart’ the process of building strength and muscle.Photograph: Djordje Krstic/Getty ImagesHow should I balance weights and cardio?The benefits of strength work are unequivocal, but what if you wish to tap into cardio work, too? One school of thought said that they’re unhappy bedfellows, each minimising the impact of the other. But arecent studyrevealed that people who took the NHS’s recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week lived longer than those who didn’t, while those who combined regular aerobic exercise with muscle-strengthening activities once or twice a week fared even better.Am I too old to start?Thinking of hitting the gym but put off by your advancing years? Don’t be. “It’s never too late to start,” says Peden. “We can still build muscle and grow stronger in later life, which helps to offset the rate of the ageing process. Weights are great for maintaining quality of life.”Muscle mass declines with age – a process that can begin in your 30s – and the resulting reduction in strength can lead to frailty and falls. But studies have shown that strength training can reverse this process and is associated with a variety of other benefits, including reductions in belly fat and blood pressure, and improved cholesterol readings.Additionally, strength training has been shown to slow age-related decline in testosterone in men. And resistance training increases bone density – particularly beneficial for women at risk of osteoporosis.Older gym-goers should think about increasing their protein intake. This is important for all ages but especially the over-60s because of an age-related anabolic resistance to protein. Onestudyshowed that protein absorption and assimilation was much slower in those over 60 compared with 20-to25-year-olds, leading to reduced strength gains. Evidence suggests a minimum of 1 gram of protein for every kilogram of bodyweight is a good starting point as you age.Explore more on these topicsFitnessThe ObserverHealthOlder peopleNHSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Raheem Sterling in startling decline after hitting the fateful 500 markJonathan WilsonThe Arsenal forward, once England’s key player, is only 30 but his confidence is shot and his career on a downward curveSat 1 Mar 2025 15.00 ESTShareIn Rafa Benítez’s first season in English football, he rested Steven Gerrard for an FA Cup tie at Burnley, who were in the Championship. When Liverpool lost, there was a predictable backlash and, from certain quarters, derision as Benítez explained his rotation policy and the need to manage the number of minutes each player played.Social media being in its infancy, it wasn’t quite the culture war that it would have become today, but certain old-school football men clearly felt that players should just get on with it: hard work never hurt anyone. But at the same time a piece of ancient wisdom kept surfacing, usually from elderly coaches who had spent a lifetime in the game: as a rule of thumb, however much they play, whatever age they start, a player has 500 games in them.Aston Villa’s Kirsty Hanson: ‘Dementia impacts so many people. It’s nice to connect with fans on a deeper level’Read moreRaheem Sterling’s 500th senior appearance came in Manchester City’s 2-0 Champions Leaguedefeat by Paris Saint-Germain on 28 September 2021. Obviously, the figure of 500 is a guide. This isn’tBlade Runner: no one is turning players off when they hit 500. Sterling’s 499th appearance had been as an 87th-minute substitute against Chelsea the previous weekend: how significant, really, were those few minutes? Sterling was 27 when he got to 500. He has played 151 games since. But in how many of those has he played well?City won the league in 2021-22 and reached the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and Champions League. Sterling played in fewer games than he had in any previous Premier League season for City, but only just. He still scored 13 league goals. There were no great alarm bells ringing. But Pep Guardiola had evidently seen something, some diminution of the hunger, some fractional loss of acceleration, some infinitesimal leadening of the touch. At the end of that season,City sold him to Chelseafor £47.5m.Sterling was the first of the legions to sign forChelsea under Todd Boehly. Thomas Tuchel was still the manager. Goodness knows what sort of vision of the club was sold to his agent as negotiations were conducted via scribbled-on napkins in a members’ club in London. But it’s unlikely either Sterling or his agent realised there would be 41 further signings in the following two and a half years (a figure that includes João Félix twice).Sterling did not have an easy start but he did score twice in a win over Leicester. ThenTuchel was sackedafter a month and so the long, slow drift into confusion began, the hop from Graham Potter to Frank Lampard to Mauricio Pochettino to Enzo Maresca. Did any of them have a clear vision for Sterling as he moved into his late 20s, his notional peak?View image in fullscreenNot even being reunited at Arsenal with Mikel Arteta, who helped coach him at Manchester City, has revived Raheem Sterling’s form.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesHis indifferent form could at first be attributed to Chelsea’s struggles. It was only at the World Cup that winter that the extent of his drop-off became apparent. Sterling had been England’s most effective attacking player at the Euros in the summer of 2021. But in Qatar he was largely ineffective. He was withdrawn in the group games against Iran and the USA, rested against Wales and then missed the last-16 game against Senegal as hereturned to London after a break-inat the family home.What was remarkable was how, from a football point of view, it didn’t seem much to matter. Sterling returned but Phil Foden retained his place for the quarter-final. He came on for the final 12 minutes, but has never played forEnglandsince, the star of one tournament becoming obsolete within 18 months.Thereafter his club form has been, at best, indifferent. There was a persistent hamstring problem that ruined the months after the World Cup, since when there have been regular social media posts showing him training harder than ever, running up hills with the army to try to redevelop his sprinting speed. There has been no suggestion that his focus or commitment has waned at all. And yet results on the pitch have not been good.Maresca gave him some part in every pre-season match last summer and then left him out of the match‑day squad for the opening game of this season against Manchester City, promptingSterling’s statement expressing bewildermentabout how he had been treated. Which may not have been the best way to go about showing his dismay, but it’s easy to see why he was confused, why he felt let down by the continuing chaos at Chelsea, the constant changing of ideas, the flux of players and managers, the way he had even tried to play at wing-back to make it work, only to be ostracised as a new season began.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mikel Arteta had worked with Sterling at City, had helped refine and hone his talent, but he could not reawaken it. The idea of Sterling was good;Arsenalhave needed somebody to relieve the burden on Bukayo Saka for years. But it hasn’t worked: Sterling has managed only 310 minutes of league football this season.Even in the past two games, with four other forwards out, Sterling has been given a total of just 24 minutes off the bench. Arteta preferred to start at centre-forwarda midfielder who had not played the role since he was ninerather than risk Sterling for another full game on the flank to allow Leandro Trossard to play through the centre.There was something deeply uncomfortable when, in injury timeagainst West Ham last Saturday, Arsenal got a free-kick just outside the box and Sterling rather than Martin Ødegaard went to take it. His confidence is shot; it was inevitable that the opportunity would be wasted.His decline has been startling; when the body starts to go, everything else that sustains a player at the highest level tails off too. It’s a reminder of just how high a levelPremier Leaguefootballers habitually operate at, just how fragile their excellence often is, how quickly a small decline can become a huge one. Sterling is only 30, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, at the highest level, he is finished. The law of 500 has struck again.Explore more on these topicsRaheem SterlingInside footballArsenalChelseaEnglandPremier LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

Only in the weeks, months and years to come will we know the lasting impact of Super League’s first foray into the United States but, while so many things felt new, one thing was eerily familiar: the brilliance ofWigan Warriors.Matt Peet’s side have made it their habit to bring out their best on the biggest stages and in Nevada, with more eyes on them than ever, they certainly did not wilt as they beatWarrington48-24, from 42-0 up.It was easy to forget given all the pomp and circumstances surrounding Las Vegas’s four-game rugby league extravaganza that there were two competition points at stake. But really, that is the point. Wigan making it two wins from three with a commanding victory is almost the footnote. What really matters is why they sacrificed a home game at great financial cost to come and why Australia’s National Rugby League took a chance on addingSuper Leagueto the bill after last year’s inaugural Vegas event. It’s not about this: it’s about what happens next.The hope from the NRL’s five-year arrangement with Las Vegas is that the most congested and intense sporting market on the planet takes an interest in rugby league. Moments such as the flying one-handed finish from Abbas Miski and the brilliance of Junior Nsemba should have certainly caught the eye of casual sports fans, if nothing else.But it is not just here, in Las Vegas, where the impact of this game could be felt for Super League. Australian officials returned home after last year’s inaugural Stateside trip and reported a major boom in the sport on their own patch, with attendances rising and audiences going up off the back of the Vegas interest. Super League is hopeful of experiencing a similar boom in the UK. If the hype around Las Vegas catches a few new supporters on this side of the Atlantic, then that has to qualify as a major success.View image in fullscreenSpectators at the Allegiant Stadium wait for the Super League action to begin.Photograph: David Becker/APMore than 10,000 British fans made this trip, which pretty much ensures a repeat invite for two more clubs next year. Leeds, St Helens and Hull KR are among those at the head of the queue. And while the rest of the crowd trickled in after this one-sided win for Wigan had begun, the most important onlookers were already sitting down for kick-off.Super League was given the NRL treatment. The facilities, the glitzy, high-end TV production and the experience of being on a par with Australia. With British officials in town to cosy up to the NRL, and its most powerful administrator, Peter V’landys, admitting he wants a strong British game, it creates food for thought.The prospect of the NRL purchasing Super League and taking it under its wing for the good of the global game has never felt closer. And if the Australians do want to take Super League to new heights, they have a ready-made juggernaut to build it around in this Wigan team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His review will also mean identifying a successor to Jos Buttler as white-ball captain.Jos Buttler’s England reign ends in painful defeat by South AfricaRead moreHarry Brook, the vice-captain, has endured a tough start to the year and, as a three-format player, his stepping up could leave the 26‑year‑old overburdened. Other candidates may not even be in the squad that has flopped, with McCullum ruling nothing out when asked about proven domestic leaders such as Sam Billings, Sam Curran and James Vince.“If it is the same person [for ODIs and Twenty20], great, if it’s two, that’s great too,” said the head coach, who has struck up a strong alliance with Ben Stokes in the Test setup. “Give me a couple of weeks to work it out and get this thing back on track.”The notion of three captains – last occurring between 2011 and 2012 when Andrew Strauss (Tests), Alastair Cook (ODIs) and Stuart Broad (T20s) were briefly a triumvirate – would be a messy one. It would cut across McCullum’s belief that the best cricketers should be able to transfer across squads, with England’s schedule now starting to ease.In that respect McCullum was unrepentant about merging the 50-over team with the more successful Test side for this Champions Trophy, noting that Ben Duckett (227 runs) and Joe Root (225) were England’s two highest scorers. The same went for banking on high pace in the bowling attack at the expense of greater variety, even if this failed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not hard to see this is a slightly different task and we’ve got to put plans in place for the demands of white-ball.“But I still have tremendous confidence in the talent that is across English cricket, not just in the dressing room right now, but also guys around the domestic scene at the moment or have played for England before. We’ve got to find ways to make sure that our team walks out there a lot more confident than we are at the moment.”On Buttler, who has no intention of retiring from international duty, McCullum added: “We still see him as a big player within that and he’s still got a huge role to play.

The academy graduate Nico O’Reilly scored two headers before the club’s most-decorated outfield player, Kevin De Bruyne, ended the resistance.Plymouth could not have done more as they fought to contain City, even taking a shock lead through Maksym Talovierov but a happy ending never looked likely. The Premier League champions were made to toil by the well-drilled Pilgrims, who will rue conceding from two set pieces.Miron Muslic radiates optimism with Plymouth rising to the occasion | Simon BurntonRead moreDe Bruyne’s contract is up in the summer and the FA Cup provides perhaps the best opportunity, amid a difficult campaign, to add to the 16 winner’s medals he has earned inManchester City, though he is line to bow out at the Club World Cup. Paired with Ilkay Gündogan to provide experience in the middle of the park, the Belgian showed he still possesses the quality with delivery and offered constant endeavour even though he has physically diminished.Pep Guardiola’s side did not reach their optimum tempo, hindered by an extremely well-disciplined side. Plymouth made it this far thanks to a1-0 win over Premier League leaders Liverpool. On that afternoon they had a mere 25% possession and in the early stages reaching that milestone would be seen as a success. City controlled proceedings, passing the ball with precision in front of a green wall, doing what it could to keep the hosts at bay.Few were surprised that Plymouth’s box hosted plenty of action, considering they sit second from bottom in the Championship and have conceded 68 in 34 league matches. Conor Hazard’s first involvement was to get down smartly to save a Gündogan header going towards the bottom corner but the goalkeeper was a spectator as he watched James McAtee’s shot thudded off the inside of a post and away to safety.Everyone was waiting for City to take the lead as Plymouth rarely crossed the halfway line. Their own players looked somewhat surprised to be rewarded for their hard work when Matthew Sorinola swung a 38th-minute corner to the back post, where Talovierov rose highest to head past Stefan Ortega with what would be Plymouth’s solitary effort on or off target. It was only the third time Argyle had been ahead away from home in all competitions this season. Cue pandemonium from the 7,800 in the away end, able to dream for a few minutes.View image in fullscreenMaksym Talovierov (centre) gives Plymouth the lead.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockTaking the lead might have been ill-advised with so much of the game to play. City equalised in straightforward fashion in first-half injury time to change the dressing-room moods. De Bruyne whipped in a free-kick around 30 yards out, academy graduate O’Reilly made a smart run and flicked to the far post, Hazard got a hand to it but it was not sufficient. The celebrations were more muted on this occasion.“We can only be disappointed with the result, we are very proud of the performance,” Plymouth’s head coach, Miron Muslic, said. “We gave Manchester City a proper game. They are one of the best teams in the world with the best coach in the world. We did well, it is a bit of a pity we conceded with the final touch of the first half.”It might not have been a full panic but Erling Haaland was brought off the bench before the hour mark. The Norwegian and Bernardo Silva contrived to not convert chances in quick succession from inside the six-yard box as Hazard produced a number of fine saves to keep the score level. Unfortunately for the goalkeeper, the resulting corner found makeshift left-back O’Reilly at the back post from where he nodded home his second, calming the nerves of the majority. O’Reilly attracted interest from Chelsea in the winter transfer window and Guardiola’s decision to keep him is being rewarded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s not a typical player for the academy because all the players are small, skilful and good talent. But he has a big presence. Normally he’s an attacking midfielder, he’s a No 10. He’s another threat for our set pieces because we are not a tall team. He plays really well with the ball, without the ball and helps us with two fantastic goals.”Nathan Aké, meanwhile, had to be replaced at half-time by Rúben Dias because of injury and Guardiola intimated that the Dutchman would face a spell on the sidelines.With stamina diminished, Plymouth had little to offer and the search for an equaliser never began, comprehensively ended by De Bruyne’s late third. City still have a chance of silverware this season but they were made to labour to keep the opportunity alive.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverManchester CityPlymouth Argylematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Portuguese took over in November and has overseen five victories in 16 Premier League matches, leaving them 14th.One of those wins wasat Fulham, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday in the FA Cup fifth round. The holders face a crucial week with a last-16 first leg trip to Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday with redundancies off the pitch and poor performances on it.Alejandro Garnacho will ‘buy dinner’ at United after substitution reactionRead more“Better is hard to say because I’m not winning games, so I don’t feel like I’m a better coach,” Amorim said when asked if he had improved since arriving at Old Trafford. “I lived here for three months, I lived certain things. I’m a more complete manager because sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow.“I felt that during these three months, I’m not going to die if I lose three games in a row. That is something that I learned here and I can cope to maintain the energy. I’m learning a lot about myself and the players, but I prefer to win games.”Amorim has stuck rigidly to his preferred 3-4-3 formation as he attempts to weed out those players incapable of fitting into the system. It is likely the club will attempt to overhaul the playing staff during the summer but Amorim accepts United need to sell first and has no qualms about telling players they are not wanted.“That is not a difficult situation because everybody understands that in football, sometimes you stay, sometimes you have to move on,” he said. “If I know how to explain, I can do it, and I like to do it because I want to be clear.“When I was a player, I tried to use all that experience. When you are honest with someone, they can take it. In the beginning it’s hard, but they will understand.“I’m quite honest with my players and they already know that sometimes they have to move on at the end of the season.”Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already implemented 250 redundancies and a further 200 are planned as part of the latest round of cost-cutting, which also involves the end of free lunches for staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it’s hard, but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.”Amorim has already made big calls, seeing no role for Marcus Rashford and Antony. “I’m trying to understand everything in my team to help them to be better,” he said. “When I feel that something is going to harm the team, I’m quite ruthless.

The MCL39 appears to have a genuine edge on a competitive field. Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were circumspect about their car and it did demonstrate a spot of instability in the rear but their confidence on track has been palpable. They look to have taken the stable platform of last season and improved it with the long-run race simulations presenting a fearsome pace, even given all the usual caveats of fuel loads, temperatures and card-holding in testing. When off the leash for a burst of potentially qualifying pace it was impressive on the brief occasions McLaren opted to show their hand, Norris aborting one flying lap that would have set tongues wagging. That early show of pace has not gone unnoticed by the other teams, withLewis Hamiltonamong others acknowledging that McLaren are set to be sharp from the off – the start Norris has long craved for a tilt at the title.Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton tells critics they give him ‘fuel’ to work even harderRead moreHamilton at home at FerrariHamilton has dismissed criticism from“older, white men” – Eddie Jordan and Bernie Ecclestone– who had questioned his move to Ferrari and certainly he has displayed nothing but enthusiasm and confidence in his new challenge.He has been effervescent in his approach to testing, a task he dislikes, throwing himself into it as he tries to make the most of every possible moment in a steep learning curve at the Scuderia. Intriguingly he seems to be making as fresh a start as he can, referring to his former team Mercedes as “the previous place” and “another place”. It’s a new journey for the 40-year-old Briton but one he insists has gone smoothly. “It’s felt seamless, easy in a sense of gelling with the team,” he said. “It’s not felt that we’ve had to force it and I feel at home.” He is then in a good place, his motivation is stronger than ever, even lightheartedly addressing one key detail with his new race engineer, Riccardo Adami. “Is hammer time still going to be hammer time? I haven’t spoken to my engineer about that,” he said. “I don’t know how it would sound with an Italian accent. So I have to find an Italian word. We’ll probably find something new.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton has cut a happy figure in his early days at Ferrari and seems determined to make an major impression.Photograph: Hasan Bratic/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockConvergence at the frontRed Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes have unsurprisingly remained tightly matched on their pre-season runs, with McLaren possibly having an edge. Mercedes may have taken their time to get to this point after three unpredictable seasons but it appears they have found consistency. The W16 looks well balanced and George Russell pronounced in Bahrain that it is the best Mercedes he has driven. Ferrari, too, are thereabouts. Hamilton, Charles Leclerc and the team principal, Frédéric Vasseur, are guarded but pleased. The SF-25 has been impressive, looking strong on corner turn-in, and the car has improved each day. More is likely to come given that Leclerc considered that it had given them no surprises and was ready to be exploited. Ferrari may yet still be a dark – prancing – horse at the front. Red Bull, meanwhile, had the task of addressing the issues that had plagued it in the second half of last season, a lack of balance leading to a testing, unpredictable ride thatMax Verstappen decried as a “monster”. Interestingly, the RB21 is strikingly similar to last year’s model but the team insist a raft of aero developments have been made and their motorsport consultant, Helmut Marko, was convinced the issues had been solved. That said, the test did not go entirely smoothly and Red Bull were putting in a lot of time experimenting and adapting setups, suggesting they are still not quite where they want to be.View image in fullscreenWilliams driver Alex Albon puts his car through its paces in testing in Bahrain, with hopes high that the team can improve on ninth last season.Photograph: David Davies/PAWilliams on the turnHaving struggled so hard of late and with 2026 targeted to reap the rewards of their rebuilding process,Williamsmight just be ahead of schedule and, whisper it, perhaps even with a nose in front of RB, Haas, Aston Martin and Alpine, with Sauber set to be very much in a field of one at the back. After finishing ninth last season, the early signs are that Williams may be a real player in the midfield. The Mercedes rear suspension has been integrated well, the car looks very planted on track, with the team able to find a better balance as testing progressed. Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were both quick and complimentary about their new ride. Indeed, Sainz set the fastest time of all the three days with a 1min 29.348sec lap, only a couple of tenths off the pole time from last year. The FW47 was consistent on long runs, with Sainz banging out 127 laps on Thursday and Albon 137 and the third-fastest time on Friday while, observed from trackside, it was at ease both in and out of the corners, an indicator of a robust race car. While a little unruly on the absolute limit, this is potentially the best car Williams have produced in years and for the teams in its proximity a real cause of concern. An enticing prospect not least with both Albon and Sainz being feisty competitors.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneThe ObserverMcLarenLando NorrisLewis HamiltonFerrariRed BullMercedes GPanalysisShareReuse this content"

This will replace the current system whereby a keeper has six seconds to move the ball on and is punished with an indirect free-kick if they do not.“Goalkeepers holding on to the ball for too long have been a bane of many people’s lives for quite some time, so some action has been taken,” said Patrick Nelson, the chief executive of the Irish FA, who chaired Ifab’s AGM in Belfast on Saturday. “The results of the trials have been very, very positive, so we’re going to move forward and put that into the laws of the game as soon as possible.”Rage against the refs has become the norm but surely we can do better?  | Jonathan LiewRead moreIfab is to implement the change following trials at more than 400 matches, including in the academy competition Premier League 2, after a sense the previous law was not being properly enforced. Officials see the change as potentially revolutionary, as it will be the first time an infringement in live play will be punished by something other than a free-kick or penalty.David Elleray, the former Premier League referee and now Ifab’s technical director, citedBrighton’s victory at Manchester Unitedlast season as an example; whereas the United keeper held on to the ball for an average of 4.8sec, the Brighton goalkeeper’s average was 14.8sec.“Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears,” he said. “If it speeds up the game, if it’s more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.”A new approach to time-wasting was just one of several incremental but potentially transformative developments that were announced. Another is confirmation that trials of a new approach to offside are to continue, with the possibility that the law ends up finding an attacking player onside if any part of their torso is in line with a defending player.View image in fullscreenArsène Wenger says an attacking player should be onside if any part of their torso is in line with a defending player.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersCurrently a player is offside if any body part that can legally score a goal is in advance of a defender. Current trials, championed by Fifa’s chief of global development, Arsène Wenger, are flipping that approach and finding attackers onside if any part of their body is in line with a defender. But moving the line back, to where the player’s torso is in line, is gaining favour among lawmakers, with the rationale that not only would it be a more balanced cut off point, but that the torso is easier to capture using tracking software, potentially allowing for quicker decisions.A further change is a rule to allow referees to wear body cameras in Fifa competitions. Already successfully trialled at grassroots level in England, with the aim of pushing back against player abuse of officials, the system will be tried at the Club World Cup this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, they wanted to look tough on TVSat 1 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 12.03 ESTShareThe last time Donald Trump did this, it was in secret, and he got impeached over it. In 2019, Donald Trump, on a phone call withVolodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded that the Ukrainian president produce – or fabricate – evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of Trump’s eventual opponent in the 2020 election, in exchange for continued US military aide.At the time,Russiahad already seized control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and was funding violent insurgent groups in the country’s east; it was increasingly clear that a full-scale Russian invasion was coming, as it finally did in 2022. Since the end of second world war, it has been America that checks Russian expansionist ambitions in Europe – America that provided the backstop to the Nato alliance, America that secured the independence of eastern Europe. Trump wanted to condition that longstanding role on Zelenskyy doing him a personal political favor. The international order could be ended, he suggested, if those who depended on him didn’t do enough to indulge his vanity, self-interest and impulsive whims.Something similar was already afoot earlier this week, when Trump summoned Zelenskyy to Washington at the last minute to pressure him to sign a mineral rights deal. Trump wanted to make continued American support for Ukraine’s military effort contingent on American involvement in the country’s mineral industry. But the deal that was offered to Zelenskyy in fact containedno security guarantees: it offered something less like a bilateral agreement and more like a shakedown. Nevertheless Zelenskyy, who is leading a besieged people in danger of losing their country, seemed willing to take it – even after Trump called him a “dictator” last week.But things went downhill from there. Trump seemed determined to antagonize Zelenksyy, making a passive aggressive remark about what the Ukrainian president was wearing when he arrived at the White House. (Sources close to Trumpleaked to Semaforthat the administration was also displeased with Zelenskyy’s “body language”.) In a meeting in the Oval Office, with film crews and reporters present, the US vice-president, JD Vance, began berating Zelenskyy for what he alleged was the Ukrainian president’s disinterest in diplomacy, by which he seems to have meant a Ukrainian surrender on Russia’s terms.When Zelenskyy countered that Russia has not been a reliable partner, breaking promises toUkrainerepeatedly in past ceasefires, Vance began berating him that he was not grateful enough for US support. “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” said Vance, who had initiated the confrontation with cameras in the room, in a practiced cadence. “Have you said thank you once?” Zelenskyy has in fact said “thank you” to the United States many times, including at the outset of the meeting. Both Trump and Vance began raising their voices, ignoring Zelenskyy’s attempts to speak and impugning both his leadership and his personal character. Zelenskyy was soon kicked out, and left the White House without signing the minerals agreement that Trump had nominally summoned him from Ukraine to conclude.It is clear that the post-second world war international order is over. It is clear that Europe will have to look elsewhere, and not to the United States, for its security, and that America will increasingly be isolated among nations, without allies to advance its interests abroad and without friends to share the benefits of science, culture and commerce. Few world leaders, after all, are willing to make deals with such a mercurial partner; fewer still are willing to try, if the attempt will be met with public humiliation in such brutish and bullying style.It is clear that other great powers, including those who do not share what were once America’s stated principles of justice, democracy and human dignity, will fill this vacuum, to America’s detriment. It is clear thatDonald Trumpdoes not intend to check Vladimir Putin’s expansionist ambitions – that he will force a deal in the Ukraine war on Russia’s terms, that Zelenskyy himself will likely be exiled or killed in the aftermath, and that other countries in Europe are in danger.In the hours after the meeting, many world leaders publicly voiced their support for Zelenskyy, including the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. Like him, they stand on the edge of an uncertain future. Russia is on the march, indifferent to borders, laws and freedoms, and the United States will no longer stop them. As an American, I was embarrassed by the display. I am also, now, very scared.Because what Trump did to Zelenskyy on Friday is not a departure from his style: it is entirely typical of his domineering approach to politics – one in which violence or harm is threatened to extort his preferred outcomes, and in which good faith negotiation or even basic dignity is shrugged off in favor of petty displays of domination and cruelty.Trump and Vance, I now think, never really intended to have a conversation with Zelenskky: they intended, instead, to try to make themselves look tough on TV by humiliating him.Jake Paul, a boxer, influencer and alleged crypto scammer who has been a booster of Donald Trump, said of the televised shouting match against a head of state, “This isn’t attacking. This is called being a MAN.”Manliness seems to be all that Trump aspires to: and he defines it, almost exclusively as cruelty. Both on the international stage and on the domestic one, Trump and the crowd of racist, misogynist and endlessly immature idiots who surround him will stop at nothing to prove what men they are – no matter how much America suffers, or how many people die, in the process. At the meeting, when Zelenskky tried to persuade Trump to feel differently about the prospect of Russian expansion, Trump cut him off. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he said. “We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.” Maybe he does.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS politicsUkraineRussiaJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

And the frontman of New York Dolls, who has died aged 75, was deeper than many gave him credit forNews – David Johansen, frontman of New York Dolls, dies aged 75Gallery – David Johansen: a life in picturesSat 1 Mar 2025 16.21 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 20.05 ESTShareNick Kent’s fabled 1974 NME piece about New York Dolls, Dead End Kids on the Champs-Élysées, is packed with characters and incident. The band have arrived in France after a showcase gig at London boutique Biba, marred by various members getting caught while attempting to shoplift from the store. Their famously dissolute guitarist Johnny Thunders vomits copiously in front of the assembled press at a record company reception to welcome the band to France, then pukes again midway through a “horrendous, tuneless” Dolls gig at Paris’s prestigious Olympia theatre. Bassist Arthur Kane, a large man clad in a ballerina’s tutu who apparently looks “like he’d just been run over by a truck load of Valium” confides that he’s in fear of his life: the last groupie he slept with tied him up in his sleep and attempted to cut off his thumb with a knife.And yet, even in such exalted company, there’s no doubt who the star of the show is. Frontman David Johansen never appears to stop talking throughout, an endless, wildly entertaining source of tall tales – at one juncture, he claims to have been an underage star of gay porn films – hysterical bitching about other artists (John Lennon is an “asshole hypocrite”, Keith Richards is “past it”, Mott the Hoople’s Ian Hunter has “terrible piggy eyes”) and eminently quotable statements: “We attract only degenerates to our concerts”; “We want to be known as the tackiest boys in New York.” Whatever you made of New York Dolls’ music – and, as the evident distaste with which host Bob Harris greeted their appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test proved, it was nothing if not divisive – you would have a hard time arguing that Johansen wasn’t fantastically good at the business of being a rock star.He was also very much the right man to front New York Dolls. He was good-looking, charismatic and the press loved him – Johansen always provided great copy – and he sang in a brash, snotty yowl, the perfect complement to the band’s punk-inspiring edge-of-chaos sound. A former participant in the confrontational avant garde Theatre of the Ridiculous shows put on by directors John Vaccaro and Charles Ludlam – big on drag queens, outrage and cast members covered in glitter – Johansen applied their techniques to New York Dolls’ image, helping make the band an instant underground sensation in early 70s New York. Their early residency at the Lower East Side’s Mercer Arts Centre attracted not just an equally flamboyant crowd of followers, but celebrities including David Bowie, Elton John, Lou Reed and Bette Midler, while Rod Stewart invited them to support Faces in London before they’d even released a note of music.View image in fullscreenJohansen and Johnny Thunders of New York Dolls play Biba's Rainbow Room, London, in 1973.Photograph: Ian Dickson/ShutterstockJohansen wrote or co-wrote every original song that appeared on New York Dolls’ eponymous 1973 debut and its follow-up Too Much Too Soon bar one, minting a raunchy, trashy style. Flying in the face of rock’s increasing seriousness and grandeur, his songs were as in love with 60s girl group pop as they were the Rolling Stones: Looking for a Kiss opened with a steal from the Shangri-Las’ 1964 hit Give Him a Great Big Kiss. They made a virtue of the band’s rudimentary musicianship, but for all Johansen claimed “there wasn’t a lot of intellectualising going on”, they were always far sharper and deeper than the band’s detractors gave them credit for. Vietnamese Baby pondered the effects of the Vietnam war and collective guilt on attitudes to hedonism (“everything connects,” it suggests); Frankenstein was a garbled hymn to the alternately glitzy and grubby allure of New York; Subway Train quoted the lyrics of the 19th-century folk song I’ve Been Working on the Railroad.The music press understandably thought New York Dolls were going to be huge, but perhaps they were too polarising for their own good. A degree of homophobia provoked by their appearance – every member of the band was straight – undoubtedly hampered their progress in the US; a sound that seemed incredibly prescient when punk arrived was easy to dismiss as sloppy, semi-competent flailing in 1973: “the worst high-school band I ever saw”, sniffed the Rolling Stones’ Mick Taylor. Even the producer of their debut album, Todd Rundgren, thought they couldn’t play and treated them with a degree of disdain.Certainly, everything that could go wrong for New York Dolls did go wrong: drug addiction, a disastrous hook-up with the alcoholic former Shangri-Las’ producer Shadow Morton on 1974’s Too Much Too Soon, a dalliance with Malcolm McLaren as their manager who convinced them to take up a new Marxist-inspired image that succeeded only in alienating even the New York hipsters who had flocked to their gigs in the first place. They lost their record deal, and most of the band quit: Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain soldiered on until late 1976, finally giving up just as the seeds New York Dolls had sown began to bloom: their last gigs featured a support act called Blondie.View image in fullscreenJohansen in 2015.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianJohansen’s first eponymous post-Dolls solo album and 1979’s In Style – the latter featuring a guest appearance by Ian Hunter, who’d presumably forgiven him for the “piggy eyes” jibe – should theoretically have capitalised on punk, a genre he’d done more than most to inspire, but both flopped. A pity, because they were packed with smart, impactful, witty songs: Funky But Chic’s brilliant defence of the Dolls’ image (“mama says I look fruity, but in jeans I feel rotten”), Girls’ surprisingly pro-feminist rallying call; the gleeful Wreckless Crazy. He finally scored an American hit with a medley of British Invasion classics in 1982, and finally became the star he’d always threatened to be by adopting the character of Buster Poindexter: a dinner-suit clad lounge singer performing old jump blues, swing and R&B numbers. His cover of Arrow’s Hot Hot Hot ended up all over MTV (Johansen later called its success “the bane of my life”) and he regularly turned up on Saturday Night Live before tiring of his alter ego in the early 00s, returning to his own name and making a couple of blues albums that revealed his deep knowledge and understanding of the genre: New York Dolls had covered Bo Diddley and Sonny Boy Williamson.‘They were inventing a new definition of sexy’: stars and scenesters on the New York Dolls’ riotous rockRead moreThe surviving members of New York Dolls reformed at the behest of super-fan Morrissey when he curated the 2004 Meltdown festival: bassist Arthur Kane died shortly after the gig, but Johansen and Sylvain carried on under the name. You could hardly blame them for basking in the glow of belated glory, moreover the new albums they then made as New York Dolls were far better than anyone might reasonably have expected them to be. They evoked the band’s past without seeming like a wan facsimile, they addressed latter-day topics – the “war on drugs”, mobile phones, online surveillance – with enough wit to avoid sounding like old-man-shouts-at-cloud moaning. And they occasionally boasted an affecting air of reflective melancholy. Implausible as the very idea of a grownup New York Dolls seemed, here it was, sounding oddly moving as it looked back at their glory days, “jumping around the stage like teenage girls, casting our swine before the pearls,” as Johansen put it on We’re All in Love, a song from 2006’s One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This.On their final album, 2011’s Dancing Backwards in High Heels, there was a song called I’m So Fabulous, a paean to the band’s good looks and sense of style, filled with snorting disgust at what passed for fashion in “nebulous” 21st-century Manhattan. “I’m so fabulous, you arriviste … The way you dress is so insidious – how do they even let you on the subway? … you’re so Cincinnati … I don’t even want to look at you,” sang Johansen, to a backdrop of raging guitar and wailing harmonica, sounding just like the guy who’d boasted to Nick Kent about New York Dolls’ tackiness and degenerate audience nearly 40 years before. In its own cocky, swaggering, outspoken way, it’s the perfect epitaph.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockPunkcommentShareReuse this content"

This is the traditional point when one is supposed to muse, baffled, over youth vernacular, perhaps balk at theClockwork Orange-esque strangenessof it all.Sure enough, there are some I don’t know: “poggers” (enthusiasm); “drip” (stylish clothes/accessories); “touch grass” (time outside). However, others I’ve heard of: “finsta” (fake Instagram account to fool parents); “NPC” (non-player character; a nobody); “clout” (influence); “rizz” (charisma); “brat” (confident, rebellious). In fact, there are quite a few on the list I already know. Too many.First, it should be acknowledged that it is a modern parent’s inalienable human right to wind their children up by deploying their slang back at them. After picking up the phrase fromLove Island, I had months of fun telling my youngest daughter not to “deep it” (overthink something). The good news: it appears that I am not the 21st-century equivalent of the 20th-centuryjudge who hadn’t heard of the Beatles. The bad news: I could be something far worse. A pan-cultural youth-vampire, sinking my old, greedy, generation X fangs deep into the young – their words, clothes, music, TV, films – and refusing to let go. What’s more, look around, and it’s clear I’m not alone.You’ll have heard of cultural appropriation: the hijacking of the culture of others by a dominant people or society without recognition or permission. Perhaps there’s a form of generational appropriation that involves older people commandeering youth-signifiers, to the point they leave nothing that actual young people can identify as just their own.What music do you listen to? Is it that different from young people? Do you feel you have the full, non-embarrassed run of Spotify? What programmes do you watch? What food do you eat? Do you buy your clothes from strictly demarcated grownup shops, or do you end up online looking at jackets, shoes and tops aimed at younger people, rationalising that they won’t look like that on you, so that’s completely fine and normal?If the urban myths are to be believed, young people can barely go to gigs or festivals without their parents trying to tag along (well, they did have to buy the tickets). They can’t rebelliously get tiny ankle tattoos because their parents have made them an uncool, middle-aged quirk. And so it goes on. For some time now, older generations haven’t just observed youth, as they have always done – they have taken from it, filleted it, sucked it dry and nourished themselves.It’s not as if there is anything new per se about older people invading youth culture. As far back as the 1990s, tax-paying, property-owning adult men riding skateboards, and grownup professional women modelling Little Miss Naughty T-shirts, were being observed out in the wild. And, after all, where is the harm – why should people have to stiffly keep to their own age brackets, or be made to feel old before their time?Moreover, it’s understandable that people are fascinated by younger generations, as well as, at times, alarmed and saddened. All those reports about young people shirking sex and alcohol (laudable and smart, in many ways). The pernicious effect of online porn and mobile phones (only last week,Denmark banned themfrom classrooms and after-school clubs). The cyclical concern aboutmental health(last year, one in three in the 18-24 bracket had reported mental health issues such as anxiety or depression). Hasgen Z struggleda lot more than previous cohorts, or just refused to be stigmatised and silent about it?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which is hardly surprising, considering all the other factors making young lives dark and difficult: climate change; the pandemic; tuition fees plunging them into sinkholes of debt; war; injustice… the list sprawls on.Still, older people being concerned about younger generations is one thing; gatecrashing their culture quite another. In all the debates that periodically ignite about gen Z, amid the constant scrutiny and conjecture, are we guilty of forgetting that they’ve been deprived all along of the one thing most older people could take for granted: a youth-scape to call their own? As for “Where’s the harm?”, are we kidding ourselves?In the realm of music alone, older generations might have inadvertently helped to hike up the costs, and price young people out. If older people weren’t involved in elite big-ticket pop concerts and music festivals (paying for their children, or actually attending), would there be any justification (or market) for thempreposterously costinghundreds of pounds? Beyond mere student discounts, should there be official age-tested sharply reduced tickets so that actual young people can afford them?Similarly, concern over mobile phones in classrooms is reasonable, but perhaps phones are one of the few spaces where young people achieve a modicum of generational privacy and agency. And what is slang if not an attempt to have a private, secret language (likePolariwas back when it was illegal and dangerous to be gay). Is that why teenagers update it so often – they want to keep it just for themselves, locking out nosy fogies like me?At this late stage of what could be termed generational osmosis, there is no stuffing the genie back into the bottle, but we could at least be aware. Listen, fam, no need to deep it. Just sometimes, back off, and let the young have some cultural space to themselves.Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s the end of the line for soft, middle-class authors. Lefty-baiting headteacherKatharine Birbalsinghhas declared that “gentle parenting” advice books by middle-class writers are sabotaging families by insisting adults become friends with their children.She’s probably got a point – most mums and dads have watched with a cocked eyebrow as a Boden-clad parent has tranquilly informed little Johnny that punching another child in the face while playing in the sandpit “might not be what they like” – but I say Birbalsingh is not going far enough. Why stop with the parenting books? Why not fillet the whole damn bookcase of toxically middle-class ideas? Visionaries such as Chairman Mao have tried it before – with, admittedly, mixed results – but this time we’ll do it right.Let’s face it, the bookshelf in every Victorian terrace house with a side return extension isn’t there to be read, it’s there to be seen. Your copy ofYuval Noah Harari’sSapienshas been avidly absorbed right up to the second chapter; the Jilly Cooper hidden in your bedside cabinet, on the other hand, is so well used that some of those pages have been torn to shreds. Why the disparity? Crippling middle-class literary competitiveness.It’s hard to say why books ever became objects of show, rather than functional items, though we can probably blame the monks who spent their years copying out and beautifying volumes for nothing more than the aggrandisement of their order and the prospect of centuries-later inclusion in Umberto Eco mysteries. The Reformation thankfully put paid to that game. So now a domestic Reformation may be called for.How best to clean up that toxically middling bookcase? First off, there’s the low-hanging fruit. Any textbook on parenting that sports a soft-focus cover image of a child happily walking hand in hand with a grownup, written by anyone with a double-barrelled surname, is straight into the recycling bin. Ditto for anything recommended by an ethereally calm Instagram influencer or a member of the Green party. Burn before reading. Protect yourself. Protect your family.After that, we’re on to the fiction. The golden rule is: nothing in translation. If it was written by anyone who lives more than 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, it’s out. Keep in mind, too, that anything described as “vital” or “necessary” by a newspaper critic is to be viewed with the deepest suspicion. No book is “vital” or “necessary”. Not one.After disposing of the wrong’uns, you’ll want to replace them with the sort of book that Nigel Farage likes to read:Scouting for Boys,The Dangerous Book for Boys,The Boy’s Own Annual 1948. Something about a loyal dog, perhaps.If you’re looking for a literary classic,Nicholas Nicklebyis a solid choice in the family home, due to a depiction of Victorian schooling that will scare the bejeezus out of any child; hopefully terrifying them into doing something at school other than vaping and recording violent drill rap TikToks. Immerse your offspring in these reliable works and they’ll thank you one day.At the very least, if you make these changes there will no longer be any danger of being “friends” with children; and anyone who has heard the drivel they come out with will appreciate the value of this.Reading, like the curious American phenomenon the spelling bee, has too often become divorced from its primary literary function and turned into a method of social place-staking: leave boxing to the working class, polo to the aristocrats, the middling folk have novels by Salman Rushdie to be paraded in conversation. It’s time we thought about how to reset that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOnce we stop treating books as relics for show and veneration, we can also stop treating their authors as prophetsPerhaps the answer is to make reading a private affair like it used to be. Instead of displaying your books like Ernest Hemingway showing off the head of some rhino he’s blasted to kingdom come, shut them away to be enjoyed privately, perhaps by candlelight.Then we can drop all the pretence. If you like a felon-bashing Jack Reacher story, fill yer boots and be proud of it. If you secretly want to binge the latest Dan Brown romp, then why not? Anyone judging you for doing so is really only jealous. Just think how much more space you will have on your bookshelf forThe Da Vinci CodeorJack Reacher: Killing Floorwhen you’ve ditched Sally Rooney’s latest navel-gazing drear.Once the novels are gone, keep checking along the shelf and decide what you actually look through. All those Yotam Ottolenghi cookbooks that leave you searching for herbs hand-plucked from the slopes of the Judaean mountains, when the children would be happier with chicken nuggets, can go; and the same for all those biographies of Nelson Mandela thatsoundreally interesting but have never been opened. If you don’t use or read them, they’re ballast to be dropped.Once we stop treating books as relics for show and veneration, we can also stop treating their authors as prophets. Like football players commenting on international relations, the fact that someone has been handed a megaphone really doesn’t mean they have the first clue what they’re shouting about. Yet, social mores seem to weigh on middle-class parents to largely outsource the raising of their young to books. This is despite that fact that doing so devolves all moral instruction to Peppa Pig.We can end on positive news, though: it was revealed last week that many childrenhave stopped reading almost entirelyand now prefer to have the words spoon-fed to them by audiobook. That will make it easier to conceal from your finger-wagging middle-class peers the fact that they like Enid Blyton books.Holmes and Moriarty, the new authorised Sherlock Holmes novel by Gareth Rubin, is out nowExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Our children are pampered. We raise the coddled brats not as stern parents but simpering friends. We flatter their whims and let them bury their heads in screens. We fetishise what they feel, care not for what they learn, and neglect what they need: that good old-fashioned commonsense discipline that raised the great generations of times past.Inarguably the greatest peddler of this diagnosis is Katharine Birbalsingh,Britain’s Strictest Headmistress™ and co-founder of the Michaela Community School in Wembley, which boasts fastidious adherence to uniforms, timed loo breaks and silent corridors. In an interview with theTimeslast week, she yet again bemoaned the “­gentle parenting” that is leaving her students ill-equipped for modern life.Her approach is hardly new in modern times. Amy Chua’s 2011 bestsellerBattle Hymnofthe Tiger Mother, preached stern, academically focused parenting, in which withholding compliments, denying playdates and banning sleepovers were the order of the day. It was a sensation at the time (and, in fact, so influential to this cohort that Michaela would release a book entitledBattle Hymn of the Tiger Teacherstwo years later).In the time since, these age-old woes have been joined by constant panics over smartphones, tablets and screen time, perhaps best represented by Jonathan Haidt’s 2024 tomeThe Anxious Generation, which posits that allowing our children to avail themselves of the technology that powers our lives has spawned an epidemic of mental illness that we must do all we can to forestall.View image in fullscreenKatherine Birbalsingh, founder and head teacher of Michaela Community School, a free school established in 2014 in Wembley Park, London.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAt this juncture, I’ll admit I’m not convinced. In the case of Birbalsingh, I find her pronouncements to be boilerplate conservatism rebadged as revolutionary pedagogy, complete with consistent, and tired, ­jeremiads against “woke culture” and “Marxist” education ministers.Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua – reviewRead moreMichaela’s academic results are indeed excellent, but so are those of many other schools that do not subscribe to its philosophy, and the web of factors that inform how schools perform is complex. As for how their students are parented at home – the most common crux of Birbalsingh’s pronouncements – we, quite rightly, have no idea, despite her constant endeavours to sow the airwaves with charming anecdotes about how feckless and stupid they often are.In the case of Chua, the available research counters her claims quite starkly. A 2013 paper by Su Yeong Kim at the University of Texas at Austin found that children of tiger parents were “more likely than those with supportive or easygoing parents to feel more alienated from their parents, report greater depressive symptoms, and, in contrast to the stereotype of high achievement, report lower GPAs [grade point averages]”.Haidt’s thesis that smartphones and social media use are ­turning our children into depressive zombies sounds ­convincing until one considers the correlative fallacy in connecting increased smartphone use to rising diagnoses of mental ill health. When I recall the entirely unaddressed mental wellbeing of classmates during my own pre-smartphone schooling, I can freely imagine that diagnosis and treatment had a lot of catching up to do. Consider, also, the consistent refrain that British kids are falling behind in coding, and that touchy feely subjects like arts and languages should make way for computing classes for every child in Britain. How, precisely, we achieve this ­without screens is left for brighter minds than ours to figure out.If I sound glib about all these Cassandras, perhaps it’s because I’m sick of the tired grift that rewards them for passing off alarmist hectoring as common sense. My own generation of parents – the timid, indulgent, millennials they so despise – are, ourselves, the “terror tots” of the 80s and 90s, raised on a diet of ultraviolent computer games and video nasties; the very same tykes the press insisted would grow up to be remorseless, vacant serial killers. Were I to sit with those currently stigmatising parental indulgence and yearning for the return of cold, hard discipline, I’d have little problem discerning which generation had trended toward psychopathy in the intervening years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A greater awareness of their individual needs is warranted, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach aimed at scaring parents and flattering the culture war zealots who consider every new thing strange and every kindness wicked.Childrenare, it turns out, frustratingly ­individual. In this sense, one might almost compare them to human beings.A greater awareness of children's individual needs is warranted, rather than a one-size-fits-all approachAnyone still doing the “kids these days” routine in 2025 is engaged in a con as old as time. You’ve possibly encountered an old quote that often does the rounds. “We have fallen upon evil times. The world has waxed very old and wicked. Politics are very corrupt. Children are no longer respectful to their parents.” It’s often attributed to King Naram, who ruled the Akkadian empire from approximately 2255–2218 BC, with the humorous implication that people have been saying these kinds of things for millennia. In actual fact, no useful source for it stretches back further than 1913.As such, we don’t know if a Mesopotamian king wrote those words more than four millennia ago, but we do know that we’ve been mocking our peers for echoing these scaremongering, solipsistic sentiments for a century at least.Call me old-fashioned, but this is a tradition I reckon we should uphold.Explore more on these topicsChildrenThe ObserverParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The onus must fall on ‘coalitions of the willing’ to stop a US-Putin carve-upSat 1 Mar 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 16.35 ESTShareAt moments of great crisis, national leaders and governments generally put their countries’ (and their own) interests first. Transnational geopolitical, economic and security alliances are all very well. But if such organisations do not or cannot rise to the urgent challenges of the day, they risk being bypassed, ignored or shunted aside. This is the predicament now facing theEuropean Union.After Donald Trump’s appalling treatment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in full view of the watching world on Friday night, all agree that the US president’sbetrayal of Ukraine, sickening embrace of Russia and his blunt demand that Europe henceforth defend itself represent just such an extraordinary challenge, and one that must be swiftly addressed.Three developments stand out. One is that Europe’s national leaders are taking charge of crisis management, pushing the EU Commission and, to a lesser degree, US-led Nato to one side.A second phenomenon is the Trump administration’s unprecedented hostility to the EU as an institution. Trump says the EU was created to “screw” the US – a bizarre claim even by his semi-deranged standards. Now he is threatening25% tariffs on EU imports. He is determined to exclude Brussels from talks on Ukraine. Yet he insists Europe must guarantee any future peace.The third, linked, development is the way Britain is unexpectedly being drawn back into the centre of European affairs after nearly a decade of self-imposed estrangement. The need to repair the dangerous folly of Brexit has never been so glaringly obvious. At the same time, Trump wants to use the UK not as a bridge,as Keir Starmer would like, but as a wedge to weaken and divide Europe.Among national leaders, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is in the van. After Trump’s volte-face, he convened an emergency summit in Paris. Then he hot-footed it last week to the White House, where he spoke for Europe in seeking a continuation of US security guarantees, not only for Ukraine butfor the continent as a whole.Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor-elect, is busy urging fellow leaders to “strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieveindependence from the US”. He doubts Nato’s usefulness “in its current form”. Donald Tusk is also taking a prominent role – as Poland’s prime minister, not as the holder of the EU’s rotating presidency.Capitulation to Putin is unacceptable, he says, rebuking Trump. He wants others to match Poland’s above-average defence spending.Where is the EU in this fast-moving crisis? Plodding slowly along. The presence of Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, in Kyiv for last week’s anniversary of Russia’s invasion was largely symbolic. She and the other top Brussels luminary, António Costa, have been ghosted by Trump & co. It appears that no one in Washington sees any need to talk to the EU aboutUkraineor anything else.Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, is trying her best. She flew to the US last week, having finally secured an audience with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. While she was in the air,Rubio cancelled the meeting. It was a deeply offensive, calculated snub, intended to convey contempt for all things EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another “emergency” EU summit isdue this week, where a €20bn Ukraine aid package will be discussed. But as usual, consensus is lacking. Italy, Spain and Portugal are reportedly not keen. And pro-Putin Hungary may play its customary spoiler role, after trying to veto the EU’s latest round of Russia sanctions.Important decisions may be put off again, to 19 March, whenyet another summitwill discuss pooled defence manufacturing, procurement and financing. The fact that an agreed plan to meet Trump’s challenge may prove elusive even then illustrates the bigger problem: in a crisis, the 27-country EU is not nimble enough, too easily paralysed. The need for majority voting on key foreign and security issues and curbs on national vetoes grows urgent.This crisis will not wait. In the meantime, the onus is on national governments and mooted “coalitions of the willing” to keep Ukraine in the fight and prevent a Trump-Putin carve-up. And this is where Britain comes in. Starmer is coordinating closely with Macron on a “reassurance force” for Ukraine. And he is holding his own European leaders’ summit in London tobrief them on his talks with Trump.The wider political significance of a central UK role in boosting and re-organising Europe’s post-Trump defence, outside the confines and constraints of the EU, is plain. Closer cooperation on security and intelligence could in time generate goodwill – and consequently, more non-EU, ad hoc government-to-government cooperation on UK-Europe trade, borders, free movement and other noisome Brexit hangovers.Nato is another multilateral organisation adrift in a world turned upside down. Ukraine aside, Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, hints atbig cuts in US troops in Europe. Does Nato’sarticle 5all-for-one guarantee still hold? Would Trump fight if, say, Poland were attacked? Has the US nuclear umbrella, Nato’s last resort, folded? These are genuine questions, unthinkable only months ago.Nato is traditionally led by a US general. But why have the Americans involved at all? Thirty of Nato’s 32 members are European. It would certainly cost a bomb, but an alliance liberated from Trump could eventually produce the “army of Europe” that Ukraine and leaders like Macron talk about. It could deterRussia. And the US, if need be.At a moment in history when autocratic hyper-nationalists are trying to divvy up the world, multilateral organisations such as the EU, the African Union and the Arab League are more vital than ever. But not if they don’t work. Many, including major UN agencies and the security council itself, need a wake-up call. Desperate times demand bold new thinking. The choice is clear: shape up – or be trumped.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs CommentatorExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionNatoUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

After years of speculation that powerful people have been concealing information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender, the Trump administration said earlier this week that it would release unseen details about the case.“Breaking news right now, you’re going to see some Epstein information being released by my office,” Pam Bondi, the attorney general, told Fox Newson Wednesday night. “This will make you sick.”Apparently intent on treating this “new” Epstein information like an album drop rather than a horrific sex-trafficking case involving the abuse of young girls, the White House gave a bunch of influencers a first look at the information. On Thursday, Bondi’s team handed out big white binders labelled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “The Most Transparent Administration in History” to a group of 15 rightwing activists and self-styled “citizen journalists” visiting the White House. Grinning gleefully, these influencers proceeded to pose for the press with the binders like they were trophies from a school sports day.So what was in those binders? A whole lot of heavily redacted nothing, basically. A bunch of people at Bondi’s office appear to have hastily printed out Epstein’scontact book, which was published by the (now shuttered) website Gawker a decade ago, along with other information that has been in the public domain for years. They then shoved 200 pages of printouts into binders and gave them to a handpicked collection of useful idiots. Being as they’re the most transparent administration in American history,the justice department also made the information available on its website later that day – along with a note acknowledging that there wasn’t actually much to see. “The first phase of declassified files largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government,” the note said.“This isn’t a news story, it’s a publicity stunt,” the Palm Beach lawyer Spencer Kuvin, who has worked on the case since 2005, representing nine victims,told the Miami Herald. He added that he feared that the Trump administration was using Epstein’s victims for political purposes. But then what do you expect from Trump – a guy who, in 2002 said of Epstein: “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It’s even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do. And many of them are on the younger side.”In short, this whole big “reveal” was an embarrassing flop – so much so that it was mocked by people on the right. Even Laura Loomer, a white nationalist conspiracy theorist, thought the stunt was distasteful.“I hate to say it, but the American people can’t trust the validity of the Epstein files released today. It was released in an unprofessional manner with paid, partisan social media influencers to curate their binders for us,” Loomertweeted on Thursday. She later added: “Sorry I won’t celebrate dancing like a school girl with a binder full of pedophile names.” When even Loomer thinks you’ve gone low, you’ve gone very low indeed.Ultimately, however, while nothing new may have been revealed in Bondi’s “Epstein files”, this grotesque stunt was very revealing. It was yet another reminder that there is nothing – not even the sex trafficking of minors – that Donald Trump and his associates won’t cynically turn into a self-serving photo opportunity. Or, I should add, an opportunity to “Rickroll” people: midday Thursday, while people were waiting for the documents to be published online, the House judiciary GOP account on Xposted in all-caps: “#BREAKING: EPSTEIN FILES RELEASED.” This thenredirected usersto the YouTube music video for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit Never Gonna Give You Up. Classy.Also revealing was who the White House thought should get a first look at documents involving sex trafficking. Among the influencers assembled was Mike Cernovich. Who is he? Just a rightwing manosphere influencer whohas said things like“rape via an alpha male is different from other forms of rape” and told men that women exist “for your sexual pleasure”.The reaction to the backlash over the Epstein files fiasco also shows how, when anything goes wrong, people in Trump’s orbit are quick to point fingers and turn on each other rather than take responsibility. Bondi, for example, responded to all the criticism byaccusing the FBIof withholding information from her. Meanwhile, some of the conservative influencers who got the binders full of nothing accused the southern district of New York of hiding information.“These swamp creatures at SDNY deceived Bondi, Kash, and YOU,” the conservative media personalityLiz Wheeler tweeted. “Be outraged that the binder is boring. You should be. Because the evil deep state LIED TO YOUR FACE.”Perhaps what is most revealing about this fiasco, however, is that it is a stark reminder of how justice still hasn’t been served when it comes to Epstein’s many victims. Apart from Ghislaine Maxwell, none of Epstein’s manyenablersand associates have faced any real consequences. A lot of rich and powerful people have got away with disgraceful things. And that’s not a conspiracy theory; that’s just our legal system.Andrew Tate and brother land in US from Romania after travel ban liftedSpeaking of predators evading accountability, theTate brothers, who are charged with human trafficking in Romania,landed in the US on Thursday. This comes after it was reported last week that the Trump administration had asked Romanian authorities to lift travel restrictions on the pair.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate (foreground) with brother Tristan outside the court in Bucharest, Romania, on 9 January 2025.Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP‘Pro-lifers’ are demanding women face the death penaltySelf-described “abortion abolitionists” – who oppose all abortions without any exceptions and want to criminalize the procedure and ban IVF – used to be at the fringes of the anti-abortion movement. Now, people who believe that the death penalty should be considered for women who have abortions are slowly moving into the US mainstream.Mother Jones looks at howsome of these abolitionist men have turned on women in the anti-abortion movement. “We need Christian men leading the fight against abortion, not feminist women,” one of those “TheoBros” recently wrote.At least six children die of hypothermia amid freezing conditions in GazaI haven’t heard any pro-lifersget upset about this.Jeff Bezos is sending Katy Perry to spaceLast year, Perry came out with Woman’s World, her first solo single in three years and, she said, “the first contribution I have given since becoming a mother and since feeling really connected to my feminine divine”. Unfortunately, her contribution waspanned so mercilesslythat Perry is now taking her feminine divine as far away from the world as possible: the singer willfly to spaceduring Blue Origin’s next (all-female) crewed mission, the Jeff Bezos-owned space companyhas announced. Rumour has it that if you work at the Washington Post and have any opinions that have thetemerity to clash with Bezos’s, then you’ll get shot into space, too.The pill hasn’t been improved in years – no wonder women are giving up on itMisinformation from wellness influencers along with a conservative backlash against birth control is causing more people to stop taking the pill. “But there’s another, underlying problem when it comes to contraception,”writes Martha Gill. “It needs to improve … It’s common for women to be using the same methods as their mothers – or even their grandmothers. Why aren’t contraceptives getting better?”The week in porktriarchyBig news for anyone with a small child:Peppa Pig’s mother(Mummy Pig) is having a new little piglet.

In the cold light of the day that has followed, the world – and Europe in particular – has woken to the most uncomfortable of realities.The US, the country that has styled itself the indispensable nation, has aligned itself with the enemies of peace and democracy. If “America first” marks simply a shattering moment of US isolationism not seen since the run-up to America’s entry into the Second World War, this would be devastating enough. But, as they gather in London tomorrow, European leaders, Keir Starmer among them, must recognise that the contours of European and global security have been transformed.The first lesson should be acknowledgment of what has been obvious since Trump’s inauguration: the US cannot be relied on as a security, intelligence or trading partner. Washington’s underpinning of Nato, and international security, is no longer a given. By giving succour to a Russia already conductinghostile acts against European countriesbeyond Ukraine, including Britain, Trump has made common cause with the greatest threat facing Europe today.That was reflected in thecomment by Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, after Friday’s degrading White House spectacle, that the “free world needs a new leader”. In practical terms, that must mean an end to the pretence that Trump can be flattered and played.It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to seeThe almost unanimous outpouring of support from European leaders for Zelenskyy andUkraineafter the White House meeting needs to be swiftly followed by a show of unity at the London summit – and by concrete measures to support Ukraine and to preserve the wider peace on the European continent.All of which means hard decisions will need to be made, and quickly, in European capitals, not only on defence spending but in recognising and in communicating to the public that a wider conflict with Russia – and without US support – is not unthinkable but must be actively prepared for.For, while it is easy to see Trump’s actions as the petulant, theatrical and narcissistic reaction of a deeply insecure individual, the consequences go far beyond that. If there is a glimmer of hope, no matter how dim, it is that Trump’s poisonous bluster is underpinned by incoherence and weakness that is open to being challenged.It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to see. Washington’s abdication of leadership and support for Ukraine requires a rapid and united European response without caveats.As Kallas suggests, that requires European leaders to articulate the values to which they are committed and how they will practically back them, including material aid to Kyiv. Because the Trump administration’s often bizarre and self-harming view of foreign and trade policy, merging unilateralism, territorial expansion and isolationism, can only work in our deeply connected world if other countries allow it to.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer’s visit to Washington last week – following that of the French president, Emmanuel Macron – was a necessary attempt to influence Trump. That effort has failed and it should be clear that there are now red lines, the most obvious of which is the threat to end US aid to Kyiv. After Friday’s events, it is already highly questionable in many minds whether Trump should be granted astate visit to the UK.What should be clear to No 10 is that ending aid to Ukraine would be a step too far for the UK, even for this highly abnormal regime in Washington. Above all, Starmer and other European leaders must insist on the primacy of one of the key founding principles of the post Second World War order, enshrined in international law: territory may not be acquired through military aggression.The starting point for any peace in Ukraine must be to recognise the illegality of Putin’s aggressions, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine should have a seat at the table in all discussions, free from threats and extortion from Trump and his allies. The aim of those discussions should be to see both the full withdrawal of Russian forces and powerful guarantees for Kyiv’s security. At this moment of dark reckoning, we owe it not only to the people of Ukraine; we owe it to ourselves.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I write about toxic chemicals for a living, so when I learned about the tradition, I let out a small groan while estimating how many microplastics the baby must be shedding into the cake.Then I checked myself. The amount of plastic or chemicals that will leach into the slice where the baby ends up is small.I look at these things holistically, and microplastics are everywhere. Having written about microplastics for years, I’ve developed some principles that guide my thinking on when to take steps to avoid them. I’ll share them below.Detox your kitchen: three things you can do right now to avoid toxic chemicalsRead moreTo go deeper, I also invite you to subscribe to the Guardian’snew seven-week newsletter courseon detoxing your kitchen. It is created in collaboration with Consumer Reports, the leading independent consumer organization in the US, and offers guidance on everything from microplastics to fruit, vegetables, meat, seafood and kitchen cleaners.1. You can’t avoid them completelyMicroplastics are ubiquitous in the food system –seafood,water,produce,meat,beer,rice, and especiallyhighly processed foods. Meanwhile, plastic kitchenware is a major source of contamination at home. It all adds up: by oneestimate, we on average ingest about 3.8m microplastics annually, many through food.The possible health impacts of microplastic exposure are still coming into focus, but someresearchhas linked them to increased risk of heart attack and stroke, for instance, and there are scientists whosuggestit is prudent to attempt to reduce exposure.Some plastic will almost certainly end up in your food, no matter what you do. Don’t drive yourself crazy trying to dodge every last one, and you don’t have to throw out everything in your kitchen today.Instead, prioritize the easiest steps you can take to avoid the chemicals, like swapping out plastic kitchen utensils with items made with safer alternatives, such as wood and stainless steel, which are largely non-toxic materials. For example, if you have a plastic ladle, trythis onemade of stainless steel.But also prioritize those situations in which there’s a consistent source of microplastics, or plastic chemicals, in your diet. Chemicals are most risky when there’s a steady exposure to them over time. For example, a friend just realized the espresso maker she uses three times a day has plastic pieces that are heated up. This is probably a big source of microplastics and plastic chemicals. She’s not throwing it out immediately, but she’s also starting to think about alternatives to a dose of microplastics three times daily. (My friend is looking into some plastic-free espresso makers highlightedhere.)2. Avoid heating plasticPlastic cancontainany of about 16,000 chemicals, thousands of which arethought to be“highly hazardous”, and those chemicals and microplasticscan leachat much higher rates when they are heated or come into contact with hot or acidic food and drink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, tea bagscan releasebillions of particles, and microwavable plastic isalso a problem. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans are, in my view, a slightly lesser worry – but this is also easy to avoid, by getting new utensils.3. Reduce plastic, even if you can’t totally avoid itFor years, I used a blender with a big plastic jar to make my morning smoothies. Plastic can shed at higher rates as the pieces are repeatedly used and become worn, and it recently dawned on me that I was probably getting more plastic than I wanted in my smoothie.But I couldn’t find any plastic-free blenders. Lids and the components at the bottom that hold the blade and affix the jar to the base seem to universally be made of plastic.You’ll run into similar scenarios in which there is no plastic-free alternative. When this happens, just do what you can. I ended up switching to a blenderwith a glass jarthat didn’t remove all plastic from the process, but it significantly reduced the amount that comes into contact with my morning smoothie.You’ll find the same problem with a food processor. They can be found with glass jars, but they also have plastic components. Water filtration systems are another great example – most are made of plastic, or have some plastic components. In some cases, this is the best that can be done, and that’s OK. Any step in the right direction is meaningful over the long term.I’ll share more tips, including suggestions on cookware and cleaning products, in ourDetox Your Kitchen newsletter.Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePlasticsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In response, Farage said the prime minister appeared to be “terribly upset” and “scared” of him.Meanwhile, John Swinney, the SNP leader, called the Reform leader an “accomplice to the Russian agenda and an apologist for the Russian agenda”.With defence and security at the top of the national agenda, polling shows the UK public are still firm in their support for Ukraine and opposition to Russia – despite Donald Trump’s moves to strike a deal with Putin to end the war andnegative statements about President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Luke Tryl, the executive director of the thinktank More in Common, said: “One of the things that we know is that Reform is out of step with the public on Ukraine and Russia. Seven out of 10 Brits say it is important to the UK that Ukraine wins the war. Similarly, Reform’s rise looked unstoppable in the election until Farage made his comments about Putin and Ukraine.”But with Reform having dipped slightly in recent polls, Tryl said the public may be responding to the uncertainty of global events rather than any specific concerns about Reform and its position on Russia.However, even some Reform insiders acknowledge that Russia is a weak point for the party when it comes to alignment with the public, with one describing it as a “chink in the armour”.The Reform source said some in the party believed it would have done even better at the last election had Farage not said during the campaign that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” had given Putin a reason to go to war.“He doesn’t fit the mould which we expect which means he can go off on tangents and so when he was asked about Ukraine he was honest,” the party insider said.Farage’s stance on Russia appears to have shifted to become more critical in recent years but he is still less hostile than many of his political opponents.He made 17 appearances on Russian state-funded RT between 2010 and 2014and while an MEP for Ukip and the Brexit party, his parties several times aligned with hard-right parties in the European parliament to vote against EU motions that were critical of Russia.Over the past year, Farage has said that “of course” Putin was responsible for the war in Ukraine andrejected Trump’s description of Zelenskyy as a dictator, though he said the country should move towards democratic elections and has long been saying there should be a negotiated end to the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We all know that. And my leader has also confirmed that it is Putin that is the aggressor in this war.”Meanwhile, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said he thought the next election could come down to a binary choice between Labour and Reform in the north.He also said Reform presents a serious threat in a potential byelection in Mike Amesbury’s Runcorn and Helmsby seat, and at a future general election, because “politics is changing fast” and the UK has seen the “meteoric growth of one political party”.“I think it will come, in my view, not to a traditional lineup of all of the political parties and more as a more binary choice at the next election,” he added. “Because the Conservative party, I think they’ve almost made themselves somewhat irrelevant in that what’s left has kind of tilted into this sort of the new right view of the world.“I think the public won’t get the same general election choice as normal,” he said, adding that things were moving towards “two options”.Explore more on these topicsLabourNigel FarageReform UKRussiaVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

A 31-year-old man and a 28-year-old man were arrested on Thursday after reports of a fight involving a machete in Lower Parliament Street, Nottingham.A 16-year-old boy also pleaded guilty in relation to a stabbing at Nottingham’s Primark store on 23 February.Supt Kathryn Craner said: “At present, there is nothing to suggest that this incident is linked to those earlier in the week. We will however keep an open mind while the events of last night are meticulously investigated.“We will continue to maintain a high and visible presence in the city to provide reassurance and speak with anyone who has concerns.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week it emerged that ministers are considering a proposal to cut the maximum amount that people can put into themfrom £20,000 a year to £4,000.Organisations such as the Building Societies Association (BSA) are spearheading the campaign to save cash Isas, which has gathered support from others in the industry.On Wednesday the consumer champion Martin Lewis told a committee of MPs: “I’ve already had people telling me they are worried about what’s going on, so they are going to withdraw from cash Isas, which is clearly not the right thing to do.” He added: “I don’t think we should reduce the cash Isa limit.”The government has not ruled out cutting the limit and, when asked about the proposal, Reeves appeared to lean into this thinking when she said: “At the moment there is a £20,000 limit on what you can put into either cash or equities, but we want to get that balance right.” She added that she wanted to create “more of a culture in the UK of retail investing like you have in the US, to earn better returns for savers and support the ambition to grow the economy”.The two main types of Isa are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa. Consumers can spread their money across different types of Isa or pay into only one. At the moment savers can, if they wish, stash up to £20,000 a year in one or more cash Isas.This allowance is a lot more generous than it used to be: for almost a decade the cash Isa limit was £3,000 a year.Some investment firms want the government to put more emphasis on investing in the stock market, which would align with its mission to boost economic growth and could deliver higher returns to individuals over the long term.But the big savings providers have pledged to fight any attempts to rein in cash Isas. This week, the BSAissued researchshowing that 73% of UK adults with cash Isas are opposed to the government scrapping the accounts or reducing what you can pay in; some people might be surprised that the figure wasn’t even higher.Meanwhile, two-thirds (67%) of cash Isa savers said they knew about stocks and shares Isas, and a further 30% had heard of them, but 90% said it was important to them that they get back at least the amount they had saved or invested – a guarantee that can only be provided with cash savings.Robin Fieth, the BSA chief executive, says that “it’s clear many people are making a conscious decision to save in cash rather than stocks and shares”. He adds: “We will continue to press the chancellor to listen to all sides of the cash Isa argument, not just to the loud voices of a group of self-interested big businesses.”However, the investment platform AJ Bell says a glance at the long-term performance of different markets “shows that cash is definitely not king”.It published figures showing that £1,000 saved in a cash Isa in April 1999, when the accounts were launched, and earning the average cash Isa rate over that almost 26-year period, would have turned into £2,016, assuming no further contributions. That’s only a little bit better than inflation.But if that same £1,000 had been invested in global equity funds, it would have on average grown to £4,641. And if you had put it into a fund specialising in North American companies, you would typically be looking at £5,964.Laura Suter, at AJ Bell, says: “When it comes to choosing between a cash Isa and a stocks and shares Isa, the key question is: are you saving for the short term or the long term? If you’re setting money aside for an emergency fund, typically three to six months’ worth of expenses, then a cash Isa is a solid option … But if you’re looking at medium-to-long-term goals, such as saving for retirement alongside a pension, for a house deposit, home improvements in future or a career break, then a stocks and shares Isa could be a more effective route.”Explore more on these topicsIsasSavingsBanks and building societiesConsumer affairsInvestment IsasInvestmentsSharesnewsShareReuse this content"

Muslims observe the holy month of Ramadan around the world by abstaining from food and drink for 30 days during daylight hours, as a means of celebrating and reflecting on their faith. After sunset, the fast-breaking meal iftar is taken.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Yasser Ranjha, Sadiq Khan, Rahima Aziz and Adil Ray take part in switching on the lights in central London to celebrate the start of Ramadan.Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/ReutersThis year’s lights feature some new additions, including a ground-level interactive installation in Leicester Square and a halal-friendly iftar trail, made up of local dining spots such as LSQ Rooftop at Hotel Indigo and FarziLondon, offering Ramadan specials.“I remember when I was little, my mum and dad would bring me to see the Christmas lights at West End,” Khan said. “If you had told me all those years ago that, within my lifetime, we would have lights in London celebrating Ramadan like we do Christmas, I wouldn’t have believed you.”View image in fullscreenThe lights were inaugurated as a tradition in 2023.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAziz said: “It hits me with new excitement every year. For me, the lights symbolise being a part of this city that I’ve always called home. It symbolises being a British Muslim. It’s about unity.”According to Aziz, the display is intended to be enjoyed by all, regardless of faith or background. “Enjoy it the way that I enjoy Christmas lights,” she says. “It’s festive. It’s an amazing time of year. It will bring lots of economic value to local businesses in the area, but there’s also an educational element to it. If you don’t know what Ramadan is and you’d like to find out more, this is the time.”The switch-on event also included a lantern parade around Piccadilly Gardens with the lord mayor of Westminster, Robert Rigby, alongside children from WAW Creative Arts, a creative arts school designed for Muslim youth.View image in fullscreenThe lord mayor of Westminster, Robert Rigby, takes part in the lantern parade with children from the WAW creative arts school.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty Images“Westminster is a very diverse city and the Muslim community is an important part of it,” said Rigby. “With Ramadan starting on Friday, it’s wonderful to be a part of that process.”“This is such a monumental moment,” says WAW’s founder, Nusaiba Mohammad Timol, who grew up in Saudi Arabia. “When I first moved here, I didn’t feel the excitement, but to know that we’re actually making steps to include Muslims and celebrate Ramadan in this way is so special.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was connected to the rise of “mixed ideology” motives, which included “incel” culture, the “alt-right” and mass-killing manifestos. The problem was compounded by cuts to youth clubs and mental health provision, he said.Greg Stewart, a criminal lawyer and former youth justice lead for the Law Society, said successful reforms to the youth justice system picked up youngsters behaving badly in communities but missed “exceptional children”.“The escalator, which was the old way of looking at things, has been disabled, so you’re more likely to go from a low base to very high seriousness,” he said, adding that there was an overlap between autism, obsessive behaviour and becoming radicalised online.He recommended a Prevent-style response, in which teachers and lecturers picked up “thinking patterns and views”. For example, Nasen Saadi,who stabbed a woman, alarmed a lecturer by asking questions about murder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

State visits, inward and outward, are decided by the royal visits committee, “with members from the Foreign Office and Buckingham Palace,” said Dr Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert at Royal Holloway, University of London, and author of the forthcoming book ModernMonarchy. “But fundamentally these are decisions made by the government to pursue its diplomatic objectives.”A young Queen Elizabeth’s widely photographed foxtrot with the Ghanian president Kwame Nkrumah silenced his threat to split from the Commonwealth in 1961. Her decision to seat Nelson Mandela at an international dinner in Africa before he became South Africa’s president was loaded with symbolism.Throughout her long reign, she was so deployed. She was not always grateful. Welcoming Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife to Buckingham Palace in 1978, in line with the government’s agenda, was particularly problematic. “He was among the most difficult of the queen’s guests at Buckingham Palace. The guest from hell: paranoid about his security, about being bugged,” said Joe Little, the managing editor ofMajesty magazine.“The visit was particularly controversial at the time,” said Prescott. “But it aligned with the government’s priorities. The queen found him so frightful that when there was break she was walking through the gardens of Buckingham Palace with her corgis, and Ceaușescu was coming the other way and she hid in some bushes to avoid him. But when it came to ceremonies she did her duty.”Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was “another out and out tyrant” that she entertained, said Little. “But the monarchy is there to do more or less what it’s told. Whilst I am sure objections are made in private, and adaptations must go on behind the scenes we would never hear about, at the end of the day that’s what they have to do, pretty much.”If the queen felt any disquiet about shaking the hand of former IRA commander Martin McGuinness at Belfast’s Lyric theatre in 2012, it was not betrayed in her warm smile.View image in fullscreenQueen Elizabeth II shakes hands with Martin McGuinness, then Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, in Belfast in 2012.Photograph: PAHowever, she did seem to be imparting a message of her own when, in 1998, she drove Saudi Arabian crown prince, later King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, around the Balmoral estate at a time when women were not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and terrified him so much that he implored her to slow down.Meanwhile Charles, as Prince of Wales, failed to attend not one but two Chinese state visit banquets, in 1999 and 2015,fuelling speculation of a deliberate boycott. “But that was then and this is now, and if the government said you have to entertain the president of China, well he would do so,” said Little.Soft diplomacy costs – massively. The travel for the royals and their entourages is paid from the sovereign grant given to the king. Security costs met from the public purse are not disclosed. “Although I would say if we had an elected president I am not sure the costs would be much cheaper, because this is something that every state does,” said Prescott. “But the royal family are just that little bit different. It was President Obama who said state visits at Buckingham Palace aren’t like state visits anywhere else.”Monarchists argue it brings businesses to the UK and promotes the UK brand. “It is very difficult to quantify the benefits of such visits. There are photo ops and glad-handing. But does it have a long-term benefit? I think it’s almost impossible to say,” said Little.Sometimes it backfires. The then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2022 Caribbean tour waswidely viewed as being misjudged.“It just seemed to accentuate the colonial past in many ways, particularly going round in this open-top Land Rover. Clearly the plans were laid in place by the Jamaican government and alarm bells should have rung with William and Kate’s aides that perhaps this wasn’t such a good idea. But of course as a guest you don’t want upset your host. So that was a misstep. And, of course, the picture of shaking hands through a wire was very unfortunate.”View image in fullscreenAn infamous image of the then Duchess of Cambridge shaking hands with Jamaican locals through a fence.Photograph: ReutersThis will be an unprecedented second state visit for a US president. “One reason we hosted the state visit of Trump in 2019 was our trying to get that trade agreement post-Brexit, though it didn’t materialise,” said Prescott.“Interestingly, when Rishi Sunak was prime minister and state visits started again after Covid, the king’s two first visits were to Europe. And that was post-Ukraine, and to sort of say the UK might have left the EU but hasn’t left Europe, which is another theme of British government policy.“You can see what our whole foreign policy is by the state visits that are undertaken,” he added.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Slowly, the shapes of hundreds of pale stalks emerge from the gloom like an alien species, visible only by the glow cast by a handful of candles.This candlelit ritual is the harvest ofYorkshireforced rhubarb, being carried out by growers Robert and Paula Tomlinson.While these methods have not changed in 150 years, the unusual crop is seeing a huge rise in popularity, with Tesco last weekreporting a doublingin sales compared to last year.The Tomlinsons’ farm in Pudsey, Leeds, lies inside the rhubarb triangle, an area ofWest Yorkshireknown for this unique product, grown in large sheds. “It’s grown in the dark and we harvest it by candlelight,” says Robert.View image in fullscreenGrowing rhubarb in the dark prevents photosynthesis, meaning the sugar stays in the stick, rather than going into the leaves.Photograph: Charlotte Graham/Rex/ShutterstockThe warmth inside the shed means forced rhubarb is harvested during the winter and early spring, and the absence of light leads to a substantial difference between the rhubarb grown in an allotment and this sweet, vivid pink vegetable.“We cut out the photosynthesis. So there’s no chlorophyll in there and the sugar stays in the stick rather than going into the leaves,” he says. “Outdoor rhubarb can be really acidic and stringy, whereas this is a completely different crop. And you can have it for three or four months of the year, and that’s it.”The farm has been in his family since 1880 and some of the varieties he grows are descended from those grown by Robert’s great-grandfather.Gesturing to some early rhubarb growing in a field outside the sheds, he says: “We call this the ‘new’ variety because we’ve only had it since the 70s.”That was a time when the UK seemed to turn its back on rhubarb, as interest waned when out-of-season fruit began to be routinely imported from abroad. The resurgence in the past couple of decades is partly as a result of an appreciation for fresh seasonal produce and traditional British food,with rhubarb gins, sodas and preserves all becoming more commonplace.How to make rhubarb crumble – recipe | Felicity Cloake’s MasterclassRead moreMore recently, the blushing satiny finish of the vegetable has lent itself incredibly well to being photographed for social media.Thea Everett, a London-based food writer who publishes the popularWhat’s That You’re Cooking, Thea?newsletter, says: “As someone who loves to cook, I think its tartness and acidity mean it is a brilliant partner for sweeter flavours and bakes, which can be such a pick-me-up at this time of year.”She created a recipe for an aesthetically pleasing malted milk and rhubarb cheesecake in celebration of a seasonal ingredient that she loves.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

But there are signs that younger people are becoming passionate about the crop.A video filmed at the Tomlinsons’ farm by some Manchester chefs got 6m views on social media last year. “It was just mental,” Robert says.Last weekend, the city of Wakefield celebrated its annual rhubarb festival with music, stalls and a “rhu-bar”, a sign of how beloved it is in this part of the world.The word also seems to be getting out farther afield – Tomlinson Yorkshire forced rhubarb now features on menus across the globe, and demand is only increasing. “The old boys all those years ago would have never believed their rhubarb would be on menus from top chefs in New York and Paris,” he says.“I still can’t believe it myself, to be fair.”Explore more on these topicsFoodFarmingYorkshireBritish food and drinkAgricultureVegetablesNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The devolved Welsh government is following suit this Sunday at the same 4.6% level. Fares in Scotland will rise by slightly less, 3.8%, from 1 April.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I understand that passengers are frustrated rail fares keep rising despite unacceptable levels of delays and cancellations.“We inherited a railway that was not fit for purpose, and I know it will take time for trust to be restored, with trains turning up on time, when and where they’re needed.“My number one priority is getting the railways back to a place where people can rely on them and, through public ownership and the creation ofGreat British Railways, we’ll be putting passengers at the heart of everything we do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This needs to change.”The campaign group Railfuture’s Bruce Williamson said: “We had hoped that a new government would mean a change of policy, but no – passengers are still being punished for going green.“If they can find the money to freeze fuel duty for motorists, they can afford to freeze rail fares, too.

The negotiators left Cairo on Friday night, and there was no sign of them reconvening late on Saturday.Israeli negotiators came to Cairo with a proposal to extend the first phase by another six weeks, but Hamas said it rejected that “formulation”.While the first phase chiefly involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, an increase in aid deliveries and a retreat of Israeli troops from some positions, the second phase requires a complete Israeli withdrawal and a more enduring cessation of hostilities.The withdrawal would first involve a pullback from thePhiladelphi corridoralong Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called control of the buffer zone a strategic necessity but agreed in January to complete the withdrawal from Philadelphi by the 50th day of the ceasefire agreement, 9 March.Such a retreat could however trigger the collapse of his rightwing coalition which would in turn force new elections, in which Netanyahu’s political future would be uncertain.Israeli political analysts have suggested that Netanyahu agreed to the ceasefire under pressure from Donald Trump, confident that the agreement would never reach a second phase. Trump’s Middle East special envoy,Steve Witkoff, has however insisted that a second phase of the ceasefire deal should be implemented, to ensure the release of theremaining 59 hostages, only 25 of whom are thought to be still alive. Most Israelis also want the government to make a priority of freeing the hostages, but that position is opposed by the Israeli far right, without whom the coalition could not stay in power. The rightist parties argue Israel’s priority should be the destruction of Hamas.In the truce agreement in January there is provision for the ceasefire to hold even if the first phase ends without agreement on a second, as long as good faith negotiations are continuing. Earlier last week,Witkoff said he would returnto the region on Sunday if the talks went well. It was unclear on Saturday whether he still intended to make the trip.There remains no agreement on who should run Gaza once an enduring end to the war can be agreed. Trump caused consternation and bewilderment early in February with the shock suggestion that theUS should “own” Gaza, which would be somehow emptied of its more than two million Palestinian inhabitants to make way for a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, Israeli military officers presented UN officials with a plan by which Israelwould tighten its controlover the administration of aid supplies to Gaza, through logistical hubs in areas under military control.The states of the Arab League are due to meet on Tuesday to discuss anEgyptian-designed alternative planinvolving a phased three- to five-year reconstruction plan, beginning with the creation of temporary camps for Gazans to live while their home districts are rebuilt.One of the key issues in contention in the “day-after” plans for Gaza, is who should be in control. Europe and the previous US administration backed an administration by a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority (PA), which currently runs part of the West Bank. But Netanyahu has insisted the PA should have no part in the governance of Gaza, and the body has little credibility among Palestinians.“The Palestinian Authority is neither willing nor able to govern Gaza in the near future. Israeli occupation is neither possible nor desirable, and a constant state of chaos is both a security threat to Israel and an ongoing humanitarian disaster for Gaza,” Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, arguedin a column in theHaaretznewspaper.He suggested Cairo be given the job.“Egypt will take responsibility for the management of the Gaza Strip for eight years, which could be extended to 15 years,” Lapid wrote. “Gaza would be under temporary Egyptian control. During this period, Gaza would be rebuilt and the long-term conditions for independent government would be created.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelEgyptTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported inTexassince late January.The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from theCDCshowed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrMMRInfectious diseasesUS healthcareUS politicsTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

A similar case in Wyoming once helped fuel the LGBTQ+ rights movementEdward HelmoreSat 1 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 11.02 ESTShareA body discarded in a field. Cold weather. Signs of torture.So far, seven people have been charged with the murder of Sam Nordquist, a 24-year-old Black transgender man who was tortured and murdered in westernNew Yorkstate last month. It was a case that Capt Kelly Swift of the state police’s bureau of criminal investigation said was “one of the most horrific crimes I have ever investigated”.Some similarities between the deaths of Nordquist and Matthew Shepard, the 21-year-old University of Wyoming student who was brutally attacked, tortured and left to die while tied to a fence outside Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998, are becoming apparent. Two men were eventually convicted for Shepard’s murder, and his death became symbolic of anti-gay hate and helped fuel the LGBTQ+ rights movement.Seven people have now been charged in connection with the murder of Nordquist, but it’s not yet clear if his death will help to kick off a comparable movement focused on anti-trans hate.Details of the Nordquist case remain sketchy, but the suspects are accused of subjecting Nordquist of “prolonged physical and psychological abuse” after he had travelled from Minnesota to the Finger Lakes region in September to meet a girlfriend, Precious Arzuaga, whom he met online.Nordquist’s family reported him missing on 9 February. Police began a missing persons investigation, and investigators found his body three days later in a field 15 miles south-east of Patty’s Lodge motel in Hopewell, New York, where he had been staying. Arzuaga, 38, of Canandaigua, New York, is among those charged with murder.No evidence of hate crime in killing of US transgender man, authorities sayRead more“I had a bad feeling from the start it wasn’t going to end well,” Nordquist’s older sister, Kayla,said earlier this month. “He thought he was in love with this woman and he thought that this woman loved him back.” His mother, Linda Nordquist, described Sam as “outgoing … with a heart of gold”.Details released in a felony complaint for five of the defendants said they had “recklessly engaged” in conduct that created “a grave risk of death … by torturing, sexually assaulting [him] with a table leg and broomstick and repeatedly subjecting [him] to prolonged beatings”.Evidence suggests that Nordquist had been subjected to physical abuse between December and February culminating in what the Ontario county district attorney, Jim Ritts, said was “by far the worst homicide investigation that our office has ever been a part of … no human being should have to endure what Sam endured.”Prosecutors have declined to designate Nordquist’s murderas a hate crime, citing the fact that “Sam and his assailants were known to each other, identified as LGBTQ+, and at least one of the defendants lived with Sam in the time period leading up to the offense.”Five were initially charged – Precious Arzuaga; Patrick Goodwin, 30, a registered sex offender; Kyle Sage, 33, who carries a conviction for disseminating indecent material to minors; Jennifer Quijano, 30, and Emily Motyka, 19. Then came two others, Kimberly Sochia, 29, and Thomas Eaves, 21, both charged with second-degree murder of depraved indifference. And investigators say there may be more.Under New York law a hate crime is defined as an offense committed “in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or expression, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation of a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct”. It does not matter – in theory – how the assailants identify. It is the victim’s identity that is important and the assailants’ attitude towards it.Many questions remain how or if Nordquist’s gender and race played in his death. But one thing is certain: the horrific crime happened at a time when trans rights are under attack across the US.“The murder of Sam Nordquist shows us that we have not done enough to change the material conditions of trans people’s live, particularly trans people of color,” said Raquel Willis, the Black trans co-founder ofGender Liberation Movement.The investigation is unfolding against the backdrop of the Trump administration’s cuts to legal protections for trans people. On taking office, Donald Trump ordered the government to define sex as only biologically male or female. The National Park Service eliminated all references to transgender people from its website for the Stonewall national monument in New York that commemorates a 1969 gay rights riot.Meanwhile, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dropped lawsuits related to transgender discrimination claims and openly transgender service members are now barred from the US military. The administration also moved to end federal support for gender transition care in people younger than 19, and to bar transgender athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s sports teams.There is no doubt that trans people are subjected to high degrees of violence, especially trans people of color. Reported incidents of violence against trans and gender-nonconforming people also increased 16% in 2023, according to aHuman Rights Campaign reportbased on FBI data. About 84% of victims of all fatal violence targeting trans and gender-expansive were people of color since 2013, according to theHuman Rights Campaign.In a Februarypress release, the Anti-Violence Project (AVP) said regardless of classification, anti-trans violence often intersects with racism, hate violence and intimate partner violence.A report in the Washington Postlast week pointed to an increase in the number of trans people looking to arm themselves, replicating a tradition of members of US minorities purchasing guns for safety, including the Black Panthers in the 1960s and women seeking self-defense options in the 1970s and 1980s.“There is definitely a heightened sense of anxiety and fear, a knowingness and unknowingness, that things are getting worse when they were bad to start off with,” said Eric Stanley, a UC Berkeley gender studies professor and author of Atmospheres of Violence.Prosecutors in western New York have not ruled out the possibility of more arrests in the Nordquist case and warn that it was still a “very fluid” investigation.Meanwhile, vigils and tributes to Nordquist are being held across the region.

None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,” the executive committee of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) said in a statement.The announcement followed a call from the jailed PKK founding member Abdullah Öcalan earlier this week, signalling a desire to end an armed insurgency that has lasted for more than 40 years across south-eastern Turkey, Syria, northern Iraq and into neighbouring Iran. Öcalan, 75, has been imprisoned on an island south of Istanbul since being captured by Turkish security forces in Kenya in 1999.“I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility for this call,” he said in a letter read out to a jubilant crowd of allies in Istanbul. “All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.”1:33Jailed Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan calls for PKK to disarm – videoThe announcement rippled across the Middle East, and may affect an array of Kurdish militia groups with long-held but varied ties to the PKK. The group, which is classified as terrorist in Turkey, the US and the UK, called Öcalan’s announcement part of “a new historic process” for the Middle East.The group’s executive committee also called for Öcalan to be freed from his island prison, in order to “personally direct” a meeting that would prompt them to lay down their weapons. “In order for this to happen, a suitable security environment must be created,” it said.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also called Öcalan’s message the start of a new phase for peace efforts, although his government has publicly rebuffed suggestions that Öcalan’s call could be followed by peace talks.“There is an opportunity to take a historic step toward tearing down the wall of terror that has stood between [the Turkish and Kurdish people’s] 1,000-year-old brotherhood,” he said.Erdoğan’s administration has instead sought a unilateral ceasefire from the PKK, after his rightwing nationalist coalition partner, Devlet Bahçeli, suggested last October in the Turkish parliament that Öcalan could be granted a form of parole if the group were to lay down its arms and disband.An earlier ceasefire between the PKK and Ankara broke down in 2015, prompting a period of violent attacks and reprisals across northern Iraq, Turkey and Syria that claimed thousands of lives. The International Crisis Group estimates that7,152 people have since been killed in clashes or terror attacks in Turkey and northern Iraq, including 646 civilians, 1,494 members of the Turkish security forces and 4,786 militants.The PKK executive committee said it agreed with the contents of Öcalan’s call, adding that “we will fully comply with and implement the requirements of the call on our part”. Even so, the group echoed the statements of Kurdish politicians, campaigners and leaders in adding that “democratic politics and legal grounds must also be secured for its success”.Amid months of shuttle negotiations involving Turkey’s pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party before Öcalan’s announcement, Turkish authorities arrested dozens of its members.In a series of dawn raids across 51 Turkish cities last month, Turkish forces detained at least 282 people including members of DEM, journalists and academics. The interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, accused those arrested of being “suspected members of a terrorist organisation”, later mentioning the PKK.Despite the wave of arrests, some observers believe Erdoğan and his allies could seek the group’s support for constitutional changes to allow him to remain in power.“There will be a series of meetings next week, including state officials and politicians, and many things will become clearer and more concrete. We hope that everything will be arranged in the next three months,” said Sırrı Süreyya Önder, a member of DEM who visited Öcalan in prison and brought his letter back to Istanbul.Öcalan’s announcement has the potential to affect Kurdish-led forces in north-eastern Syria that are negotiating their future position with Damascus, as well as battling Turkish-backed militias in the area.The Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed coalition of militia groups that has fought Islamic State militants in Syria for a decade, are under increasing pressure from Damascus and Ankara despite their efforts to remain in control of swaths of north-eastern Syria including two major cities.The group said Turkish forces conducted airstrikes and bombardments near the Tishrin dam, a frequent flashpoint of conflict between the SDF and Turkish-backed militias since the overthrow of the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last December.Gen Mazloum Abdi, the commander-in-chief of the SDF, said earlier this week that Öcalan had written and informed him about the call to disarm before the announcement.While he hoped the PKK’s disarmament would quell Turkish airstrikes on territory that the SDF controls, he said, “to be clear, this only concerns the PKK and is nothing related to us here in Syria”.Ziya Meral, a lecturer in diplomatic studies at Soas in London, and an expert on Turkish affairs, said the broader geopolitical context for the PKK today was different from the initial peace process in 2015, creating greater incentives for the group to explore talks with Ankara.“From 2018 until now, Turkish security operations have really suffocated the PKK’s operational space, and this has expanded to Syria and Iraq,” said Meral, adding that in 2015, the PKK and its aligned group in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces, felt more emboldened as they were a key partner for the US in the fight against Isis.“Today Bashar al-Assad a former ally of the PKK is now gone in Syria and pressure is growing for the SDF to disband too, so a change in approach was needed.”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyThe ObserverKurdsMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But the industry now faces scrutiny over the rules around investments focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.Several of JP Morgan’s “sustainable” funds are investing in the London-listed commodity trader Glencore, which is under fire for itscoal operations in South Africa, an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the news website Voxeurop and the Daily Maverick, an online South African news publication, has revealed.JP Morgan’s asset management arm has more than 500 funds promoted as environmental or sustainable investments, ranging from a climate change solutions fund to a global healthcare fund. Under current rules, some of these may still hold investments in firms criticised for environmentally damaging practices.For many of its funds that are promoted as sustainable, JP Morgan specifies that at least 51% of investments must have positive environmental and/or social characteristics. The remaining 49% can be invested without such restrictions.Jakob Thomä, chief executive of ­climate thinktank Theia Finance Labs, said: “The overwhelming majority of retail investors, in my view, would feel misled if they knew that was the ­criteria for labelling something as a sustainable fund.”He said some sustainable funds may be breaking EU law, which says anything that “deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer” is misleading commercial practice.View image in fullscreenA view of a coal-fired power station from the town of Phola, which is situated in Mpumalanga’s coal belt in South Africa.Photograph: Julia Evans/Daily MaverickJP Morgan’s sustainable funds also exclude companies that make more than 20% of revenues from thermal coal extraction. Despite being one of the world’s biggest coal companies,Glencoreslips under this threshold in terms of revenues. In terms of actual profit, however, coal mining accounts for nearly half.The investments have angered campaigners who have highlighted environmental breaches in Glencore’s operation in South Africa’s coal belt. Glencore runs three mining complexes around the mining town of Phola, Mpumalanga, which is about 70 miles east of Johannesburg. According to a recent South African government report, obtained via a freedom of information request, one of those has been breaking environmental laws since 2017.The company’s Tweefontein coalmine has been accused by the South African water and sanitation department of several breaches including seriously contaminating a local river, storing hazardous waste in open containers and failing to fix broken walls at a sewage facility.Residents at Phola say they don’t trust the local water supply. Daisy Tshabangu, 52, moved to Phola because her family worked at the coal-fired power station that looms on the horizon. “Most of the people, when they do drink this water they get stomach aches,” she said.Phola residents say they feel abandoned by the companies whose mines dominate the landscape. Unemployment is high and infrastructure is crumbling.“We don’t benefit from the mines,” said Tshabangu. “There’s a lot we don’t have but we are surrounded by mines. So to us, it seems like we are being sidelined as a community.”View image in fullscreenDaisy Tshabangu lives in Phola, which is surrounded by three mining complexes run by Glencore. She says her community feels like it is being sidelined.Photograph: Julia Evans/Daily MaverickGlencore says that its water treatment plant supplies clean water to Phola as part of its “commitment to sustainable development”. It says it is not directly responsible for the overall supply of water and cannot comment on claims about water quality. It says it has had no complaints via a grievance procedure regarding the supply of water.Despite repeated requests to clean up its operations, the Tweefontein mine was still in breach of multiple environmental laws as recently as November 2023, an inspection report by the South African water and sanitation department reveals. Campaigners question why the company’s licence has not been revoked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[They] do not have the political will to enforce our laws,” said Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment, a local campaign group.Angered that finance promoted as sustainable is supporting Glencore, Liefferink wrote to the former Labour MP Chuka Umunna in November last year about the environmental risk, ecological degradation and pollution associated with JP Morgan’s investments in Glencore. Umunna is now head of sustainable solutions and head of green economy for investment banking at JP Morgan. However, the Observer understands that the former shadow secretary of state for business, who did not respond to the letter, is involved only in the activities of the investment bank, and is not involved in and does not have oversight over the sustainable policies of the asset management arm.Liefferink urged the bank to review its investments in Glencore due to the company’s alleged breaking of environmental laws, as well as the pollution, wildlife damage and environmental risk its activities were causing. Liefferink’s correspondence highlighted two JP Morgan funds with ESG in their name, both of which had millions of pounds invested in Glencore.After a rapid rise in popularity, ESG investing is the subject of increasing scrutiny around the world. Regulators are trying to settle on what it means, and create labels that are easy for investors to understand.The Mpumalanga mines form a small part of Glencore’s global operations. It is the world’s fifth biggest coal miner, selling more than 100m tonnes in 2023 – including from the Cerrejón mine in Colombia where there have been allegations ofhuman rights abusesandenvironmental destruction.Glencore says it is committed to responsible engagement and the wellbeing of all workers, and that mitigating negative impacts of its mines is imperative to building trust with local communities, which it maintains through ethical and responsible business practices. The company said the water supply in Phola is a municipal service, but that it contributes to a reservoir that also receives water from other sources. It said it monitors the quality of the water provided by its treatment plant on a weekly basis to ensure it is suitable for consumption.The company said it has been taking action in response to Department ofWaterand Sanitation (DWS) inspections since 2017 and that incidents identified in the 2023 audit have been addressed.“Our industrial assets are closely linked to the communities and regions where they operate. We aim to avoid harm to people from our activities, respect human rights, and establish and maintain trusting relationships with stakeholders, through ethical and responsible business practices,” the company said.JP Morgan declined to comment.This investigation was supported by the Bertha Challenge fellowship; Stefano Valentino is a 2024 Bertha Challenge Fellow.

Bystanders captured the incident from multiple angles, in one instance shouting in shock and swearing as the plane returned to the runway.FedEx flight on fire near Newark airport NJ.

On 30 January, an American Airlines planecollidedwith an US army helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington DC, killing all 67 people onboard both aircraft.The Washington collision was the deadliest US aviation disaster since 2009, when a Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people onboard and one person on the ground.Two days after the crash in Washington, seven people were killed after a medical transport plane collided into a north-eastPhiladelphianeighborhood. Meanwhile, a plane carrying 80 people crashed atTorontoPearson airport in mid-February, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured.Amid rising concerns, Google searches for “is flying safe” have surged. A recent AP-Norc poll, released in February, found that 64% of Americans consider air travel very or somewhat safe,down from 71% last year.Donald Trump’s second presidential administrationescalated tensions further by beginning tofire hundreds of employeesat the Federal Aviation Administration in mid-February, including some who maintain critical air traffic control infrastructure.Still, data indicates that2025 has been a relatively safe year for air travel– at least in terms of total accidents. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, January and February typically see about 20 fatal aviation accidents each month, most of which usually involve small airplanes that operate in a less regulated space.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyPlane crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The official said the pope had had breakfast, including a cup of coffee.The episode at Gemelli hospital in Rome came after three days in which the pope’s health had shown slight improvements, meaning his situation was no longer considered critical.“The pope spent a peaceful night and is resting,” the Vatican said on Saturday.Francis was admitted to hospital on 14 February with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into double pneumonia.He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.Medical experts have said that Francis’s age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.The popewas admitted to hospital in March 2023for what was eventually diagnosed as pneumonia, andunderwent a colon operationin June 2021. He has often been seen using a wheelchair or a walking stick as a result of sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having sold out its three-month run at the 180-seat London venue before first night, it is set to move to the Garrick theatre. But according to its original creatorMel Brooks, the musical might never have happened at all.The 98-year-old Brooks has told the Guardian he was initially reluctant to adapt his 1967 movie for the stage. Only through the persistence of a producer did he relent.“David Geffen called me every day. I said, ‘David, it’s a perfectly good little movie. I won the Academy Award for my screenplay. It’s been honoured and saluted enough. There’s no reason to make it a musical.’ Then the next day, he called me again. He never stopped calling me. And finally, I said, ‘Well, he’s not a dumb guy, so maybe there is something.’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan’ … Mel Brooks.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Peabody awardsOpeningon Broadway in 2001, The Producers went on to win 12 Tonys. The New York Times called it a “sublimely ridiculous spectacle” – a sentiment echoed by UK criticsin 2004and again when director Patrick Marber staged the first major London revivallast year.“Marber is a terrific director and is perfect for it,” said Brooks, who co-wrote the show with the late Thomas Meehan. Brooks also wrote the score, featuring Springtime for Hitler.“Tom was sweet as sugar and very proper as opposed to me who was very improper. In jokes and language, I was the bad boy. I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan – I’m spilling the beans!”The production will transfer to the Garrick theatre, where the author’s horror spoof, Young Frankenstein, picked upfive-star reviewsin 2017. Staying with the show are key cast members Marc Antolin, Trevor Ashley, Raj Ghatak, Andy Nyman, Harry Morrison and Joanna Woodward.“I’m very proud of that production at the Chocolate Factory and I’m so happy we’re going back to the Garrick,” said Brooks.In Marber’s production, Nyman plays Max Bialystock, a failing impresario who sets out to stage a Broadway flop. He and his accountant, Leopold Bloom (Antolin), hire a neo-Nazi playwright, an incompetent director and a useless lead actor in the hope of closing the show and keeping their investors’ money. They assume no audience would tolerate a sympathetic paean to Hitler and would have it shut down, clearing the way for them to make their fortune.View image in fullscreenDianne Pilkington, centre, in Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks at the Garrick theatre, London, in 2017Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBrooks, who was born in 1926 and served as a combat engineer in the second world war (“I mostly ducked”), has seen nearly a century’s worth of authoritarian rulers come and go. “I like the ‘come and go’ – especially the go,” he joked.Now he lives in a country where Nazi salutes appear to have been given at large political rallies. “It’s something we hope will pass and go its way, just like Hitler and his people did go their way.”He said he believes laughter is a powerful weapon against tyranny. “They’re gifted with a kind of flagrant rhetoric, but once you make fun of them and you drag them down with comedy, you win. When you can get people to laugh at them, you win.”It is an attitude shaped by his experience as a young man performing comedy routines at Jewish resorts in the Catskill mountains. “We who have worked in the borscht belt know that comedy is the answer. It’s magical, it pays the rent and also we learn stealing because we steal jokes from each other – recklessly, not even thinking about it.”Public booking for The Producers opens on 5 March.

His novels includeLet the Great World Spin, which won the 2011 International Dublin literary award, and 2020’sApeirogon, which took a kaleidoscopic view of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Last year he co-wrote the memoirAmerican MotherwithDiane Foley, whose son, US journalist James Foley, was murdered by Islamic State in Syria in 2014. In his latest novel,Twist(published on 6 March), an Irish journalist on a cable repair ship off the west coast of Africa is confronted by questions of environmental destruction, information overload and colonialism. McCann lives in New York with his wife Allison and their three children.Undersea communications cables are underexplored in fiction. What prompted you to write about them?In the early part of the pandemic, I was thinking a lot about the notion of repair, because things were shattering around us fairly frequently. Somewhere I fell upon the story of theLéon Thévenin, a cable repair ship out of South Africa. Like everybody else, I thought that [digital] information went up from our phones and hit these satellites and came back down. I was really taken by the notion that it all happens in the bottom of the deep black sea. Bizarrely, since I started writing it, undersea cables are now beingcut left, right and centre– the Houthis in the Red Sea, the Russians and Chinese in the Baltic. We’re going to be talking about it a lot more in the years to come.It’s amazing how vulnerable these cables are to attack – all our ultra-modern communications being funnelled through these flimsy tubes draped across the seafloor.Yes. Close to shore you can send down a remotely operated vehicle to fix a break, but beyond that, you’re going back to the 19th century. You’re throwing a rope down with a grappling hook on the end and hoping for the best.The narrator makes several references toConrad’sHeart of Darkness. What’s the resonance there for you?On very obvious levels, [Twist] is a man on a quest on a boat. The cable break occurs after the Congo River floods and flushes all of its refuse out to sea. It’s interesting that the cables we’ve laid down follow almost exactly the old colonial shipping routes. So all of those little echoes began to kick in.Novels can put a little chink in the wall, and then other people make the chink bigger, and sometimes the wall comes tumbling downYou tackle big subjects… do you think novels can make a difference?I don’t think it’s within [a novel’s] scope to change this stuff. But what it does is put a little crack in the wall, and then other people make the crack bigger, and then sometimes the wall comes tumbling down. I don’t call on novelists to necessarily be activists or to write about the big issues of the day. But for me personally, yeah, I think I do have to. The Israel and Palestine situation inApeirogonwas a big subject to take on. And, of course, there’s a danger in doing so, but the hope is that, in some small way, you disrupt conventional thinking. Novelists are not as important as we were 50 years ago. I find that you have to work out of a reckless inner need more than ever. It dilates my nostrils a little bit and I like that. I like having my back against the wall.Apeirogontold the story ofRami Elhanan and Bassam Aramin, two real-life Israeli and Palestinian friends who work together for peace. Are you still in touch with them?I talk to Rami and Bassam at least once a week, and I filter a lot of how I feel about [the current] situation through them, because I’m sitting here in New York, not in the West Bank or Jerusalem. They will say that they are heartbroken and very angry and very, very scared. I was talking to Bassam’s son Arab recently, and he was stopped at a checkpoint and a gun was put to his head. There are things happening in the West Bank that Bassam tells me about that send absolute shivers down my spine. I too am heartbroken and angry and confused. There are times I think about writing a secondApeirogonbook. But imagine going into that right now. You’re really entering into something that’s very, very raw and complex. But maybe that’s the place where I should go.You taught creative writing for a long time, and you’ve published a book of writing advice. If you were to boil it all down to one key point, what would it be?I love this phrase by the novelist Aleksandar Hemon: “It’s all shit until it isn’t.” Which is really interesting, because it’s all about sitting down and working at the coalface and doing it again and again. It’s the refusal to give up, the refusal to let the story beat you. Every single book that I’ve ever written, I have given up. It’s almost like a necessary part of the process – you’ve got to cause yourself grief in order to understand what it is that it actually means to you.View image in fullscreen‘There are things happening in the West Bank that send shivers down my spine’: Colum McCann.Photograph: Maria Spann/The ObserverRead any good books recently?I just readFrankensteinfor the first time and it blew me away. It’s a perfect metaphor for where we are now, the monster that we are creating and the guilt that’s involved. I’m reading a book calledOne Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against Thisby the Egyptian-Canadian writer Omar El Akkad about the current situation in Israel and Palestine: it’s very good, very necessary, and it pulls absolutely no punches whatsoever. I’ve also been reading Louise Kennedy’sThe End of the World is a Cul de Sac, and I really likedThe Convoyby Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse, about her escape from the 1994 Rwandan genocide.I see you have a photograph ofEdna O’Brienon your shelf.She once told theNew York Timesthat if she could choose anyone to write her life story, she’d choose you.Yeah, that was so nice. I travelled a lot with her. In fact she gave me my very first reading back in London in the early 90s when my first book was coming out. It was a bit of a disaster – I read for far too long – but she became a friend. Her influence has entered the air in many ways. It’ll be interesting to see how young writers, especially young women writers of Ireland, will take up her mantle in the next few years.What do you need in order to write?A perfect day would be getting up at 4am and, without checking the soccer results or my email, getting straight down to it. I’d stop to walk the dog and do a few chores, then go back to work until about midday. In the afternoon I’d do some editing, and then maybe have a glass of wine at about 4pm, meet a few pals. Then late in the evening I’d get a bit more editing done. That would be a perfect day for me.Is that how it usually happens?No, of course not [laughs].Twistby Colum McCann is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99) on 6 March.

We were powerful, right?” On Tortoise Media’s new four-part podcast,Lucky Boy, Gareth (not his real name) is remembering his first love. He was 14 then, bright but a “misfit”, having a secret relationship. She was 27 and a teacher.Lucky Boyis how Gareth thought of himself at the time; nearly 40 years later, he thinks the opposite.View image in fullscreenI approached this podcast, the latest season ofTortoise Investigates, with unease. Not because of the company’s previous form: last autumn,Elon’s Spieswas a timely dig into Captain Techbro’s use of private investigators and surveillance, and the one before that,Master, delved into sexual allegations against the writer Neil Gaiman, making global headlines.I worried that the subject matter – an exploration of who is allowed to be a perpetrator and a victim in our society – was tricksy. Details risked being conveyed in tantalising, titillating ways, however serious the programme’s intent or tone. But in the hands of ex-BBC reporter Chloe Hadjimatheou, who went to a school near Gareth’s in north London, the telling of this story, and her coverage of its ramifications, was handled with exceptional due diligence, sensitivity and power.Many moments lingered. Some were from the past, such as an incident with a pornographic magazine in a cafe full of schoolchildren, or the accounts of Gareth’s mother’s battles with his school (the teacher, she says, her voice breaking, “ruined his life” – the teacher still denies all wrongdoing). Most striking, though, are moments from the present day: the testimony of an old pupil who says that it was a “more innocent time” while acknowledging the teacher and pupil’s relationship, and Hadjimatheou’s chat with a group of current 14-year-old boys.Moorgate felt more like an exorcism, or a piece of time travelThe mother in me cringed when they were asked what they got up to at parties (it’s slightly inappropriate), but Hadjimatheou stayed on just the right side of prurience, showing how young 14-year-olds really are (many didn’t shave yet; one confessed that he still played with his Lego). The 1980s scene-setting, including a subtle, gothy-edged theme by Tom Kinsella, also played a crucial role, reminding me of situations I’ve discussed with other friends about how easily abuse in schools was brushed over back then. We knew, even then, what was wrong. Two excellent episodes are out now; all four if you subscribe.Period scene-setting was also a priority for two-part Radio 4 drama,Moorgate, about the notorious 1975 tube train crash (it sped into a wall, in morning rush hour, killing 43 people). Written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, known for prime-time TV big-hittersThe New StatesmanandBirds of a Feather, it is the culmination of a lifetime personal project for Marks. He was a young journalist at the scene, unaware until later that his father was dead inside the train (he wrote anastonishing pieceabout this recently for theGuardian).View image in fullscreen‘The perfect, groovy big sister’: Lauren Laverne.Photograph: BBCBased on his extensive research into the horror,Moorgatehas a distinctly old-fashioned feeling. The exposition is as heavy as its subject, and much of the dialogue is dated (I lost count of the slightly lairy men), although much of it has a link to the time, like the comment by a firefighter to a trapped woman, saying he’d take her dancing after getting her out.Hints of lives before and after the accident suggested fresher storytelling directions – I was intrigued by the interior world of young WPC Margaret Liles, but this didn’t get enough time.Moorgatefelt more like an exorcism, or a piece of time travel, understandable from someone with a life transformed by such a terrible disaster, rather than an attempt by Marks (and Gran) to create something new.I’ll finish with three gorgeous highlights from my listening week.Thirty Eulogieswas a properly affecting half-hour of radio, about haemophiliac Suresh Vaghela, who contracted HIV at 21 through infected blood. Listen to it without reading the blurb, as I did, and it takes unexpected turns, some desperately sad, others very joyful. I loved Vaghela’s wife getting taken out for a night in Manchester’s Canal Street by a group of gay men. “They’re the only people [with whom] I’ve ever been myself,” she says.View image in fullscreenAlso excellent – if niche – isHarford: An Oral History, a “surreal comedy podcast uncovering the strange and forgotten history of Haverfordwest” by radio comedy writer Dan Hooper. Delivered in his west Walian lilt, these punchy 10- to 14-minuters crackle with bible-black, absurd, twisted humour. Enjoy the tale beginning with teenagers who hang out in the local crematorium as if it’s a nightclub (“it helped that the organist was an absolute legend”) and another about a civic planner who approves a Happy Shopper designed to rival the Acropolis. The first two episodes made me laugh out loud many times; there are more to come.And finally,Lauren Laverne’s back on 6 Music, now at mid-morning, after a break because of a cancer diagnosis. Kicking off with Sly and the Family Stone and Ezra Collective, her first link was typically breezy and bright – she truly is the perfect, groovy big sister – before adding it was wonderful to be “back in the place that feels most like home to me”. Our homes are very happy to have her.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioRadioRadio 46 MusicComedyBBCAids and HIVreviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s more, he wrote his own officialBond novel,Solo, in 2013.NowAmazonhas picked up the rights to the character, Boyd foresees a succession of 007 spin-off products and entertainments. Perhaps even be new AI-generated novels? “Certainly wait for Bond aftershave – and for the theme park and the dinner jackets,” he said. “The new owners will have to commodify everything about their billion-dollar purchase, so there will be nightclubs and vodkas.”But the novelist and screenwriter does not regard this as fresh treachery. The true defilers of the authentic Bond have been at work for decades, making films that bear little relation to creatorIan Fleming’s original.View image in fullscreenA scene from Spectre … ‘the films have nothing to do with the novels,’ says William Boyd.Photograph: United Artists/Allstar“It is too late. The great schism is that the films have nothing to do with the novels,” said Boyd. “The films are preposterous action movies that have to sell globally and so cannot have too much dialogue.”Fleming’s novels from the 1950s were already old-fashioned by the time the first film,Dr No, came out in 1962, Boyd argues. “Since then the film have got further and further away from the stories and the gulf is now so wide, it doesn’t really matter.”Anyone who wonders how Fleming’s Bond behaved should go to his own book, he suggests. “I took Fleming’s character and then ran with it, so if anyone is interested, all the information is inSolo; from Bond’s book-lined study to his favourite marmalade.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His novels remain the Bond mother lode, with all their imperfections and their political incorrectness.”Is franchise writing, then, akin to the process of creating fiction with AI, by “scraping” past data? After all, Boyd scoured Fleming’s 14 books, “pen in hand”, before he wroteSolo. “It is true that everything in that novel that seems unusual is actually sourced from Fleming – for example, that Bond was a nervous flyer. He gave Bond all his own foibles.”But AI, Boyd hopes, could only work to generate strict very formulaic fiction. “It might work for romcoms, but it was absolutely useless when I tried it a year or so ago. I needed someone to fake their own death for a screenplay I was writing and I asked it how. AI will become more efficient, of course. I think, though, you will always only be able to get something ‘quite good’. Serious literature is incredibly idiosyncratic and AI will find that hard to match. The only straw to clutch at is the sheer complexity and randomness of human individuality.”View image in fullscreenBoyd’s latest novel, Gabriel’s Moon – the first part of a cold war trilogy – is released in AprilPhotograph: no creditOn Boyd’s mind this weekend is not just espionage, but literary franchises and sequels in general, as his new 10-part mystery,The Jura Affair, featuring his regular fictional heroine, Bethany Mellmoth, comes to BBC Radio 4 this Monday. MeanwhileGabriel’s Moon, the first of his new trilogy of cold war novels, is set for publication in early April.The radio story, read by Ruth Everett, will see Mellmoth, now about 26, turn detective after she picks up a packet left on a tube train that seems to contain a valuable first edition of George Orwell’s book1984. “She is like a young Miss Marple in a way, because she becomes a sleuth,” said Boyd, admitting he is open to offers to make Mellmoth into a refreshing Bond-style franchise. “Bethany is a character I’ve been writing about for years now. She is ambitious, but she can’t make a decision about her life. We once made a short film about her starring Lucy Boynton andJack Lowden, before they were both so famous. We’d hoped it would spin off into a series.”Boyd’s interest in Jura was piqued by the time Orwell spent on the Scottish island as he wrote his dystopian novel. “It was the strange fact of Orwell going to live in this unbelievably remote house on the island, just with his adopted son and his sister helping out. There was no water or electricity, so this public intellectual, who was very ill, was living this peasant life as he wrote1984.” InThe Jura AffairMellmoth “stumbles across an elaborate scam”, Boyd explains, and even wonders if Orwell is haunting her.The shape of a thriller like this one, but more particularly of a spy novel, is a distillation of the basic function of a novel, the author believes. “I think a strong narrative is fundamental to writing fiction. If you decline compelling story, then you had better be a terribly good to keep entertaining the reader.”The new cold war trilogy is Boyd’s first attempt at full-length sequels, a bigger kind of literary franchise. “I have nearly finished book number two. They are about a travel writer, Gabriel Dax, who is inveigled into the world of espionage.”In previous novels, such asAny Human HeartorRestless, spies are often present. “I just feel it chimes with us,” Boyd explains. “We get the themes of betrayal, duplicity, or changed identity. After all, we have all been lied to and all lied.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondThe ObserverWilliam BoydIan FlemingAmazonFictionThrillersFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is a private space for a company of actors to gear up or wind down, in between slipping into character, but it’s so much more than that. Films such as All About Eve and John Cassavetes’s Opening Night, as well as plays such as Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, show this space bristling with tension, vulnerability and rivalries. And Judi Dench has spoken about the fun to be had in this other, unseen side of the proscenium arch (including accidentally flashing Kenneth Branagh).View image in fullscreenDenise Gough (centre), who plays Emma in People, Places and Things, chats with her fellow Emmas during the interval at the Trafalgar Studios theatre.The intimate, playful and contemplative images here, captured so delicately over the past year by photographer David Levene, illuminate the cloistered life of the dressing room and show a sometimes convivial, at other times meditative backstage area across a host of major productions.View image in fullscreenVanessa Williams as Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada at the Dominion theatre.They are filled with celebrity faces not as we ordinarily see them but in a limbo state, wavering somewhere between themselves and the role they will soon assume, front of stage.

For Billy Howle it is a sacred space – the quiet before the storm of a performance, perhaps. Levene, for his part, sees it as a “pulling back of the curtain” to show an actor as they are. His beautiful images give a depth and dimension to the drama, romance and hidden realities of the life of the stage.View image in fullscreenJohn Lithgow plays word games with fellow cast-members Elliot Levey and Richard Hope, in their dressing room at the Royal Court theatre, before their performance in Giant.Giant – Harold Pinter theatre“We tend to come in at 6 o’clock for a 7.30 curtain.

We’ve become this wonderful, unlikely three-way friendship.View image in fullscreenThe cast of Giant warm up together on stage before the evening’s performance.We’re in the impact game. You wanna have a terrific impact on an audience, whether it’s making them laugh, cry, or cry out in horror. The end of this play, it’s … it’s not like anything I’ve performed before. You can hear the audience gasping. At nothing more than the sound of my voice. Maybe it’s something perverse in me, but I just love that!”John LithgowView image in fullscreenSharon Duncan-Brewster applies a wig for her transformation into Denise, for Death of England: Closing Time at Soho Place.Death of England: Delroy/Closing Time – NationalTheatre“It’s always been about this barnet, basically because my character needs to just look a little bit older than I am. They were trying to work out ways of ageing me up and started off with this profound white strand of hair. You can’t go heavy with the costume: the people sitting close to you will be like: ‘What is that?!’ So it’s become more subtle over time – wisps of grey rather than a clean stripe.”Sharon Duncan-BrewsterView image in fullscreenPaappa Essiedu has a tattoo applied as he prepares for his role as Delroy.“I do tattoos every three days generally if I’m getting more than two shows a week. We liked the idea of him having tattoos that kind of told stories about his contradictions, so he’s got an England three Lions tattoo on his forearm, but then he has a Jamaican flag with the national humming bird on it.I generally arrive two or three hours before the show starts. I usually do at least the first three scenes, I’ll go over the road to get a matcha latte, then I’ll come up here and do maybe like 25 minutes of yoga, breathing exercises, stretching, all of that sort of stuff.View image in fullscreenThomas Coombes in his dressing room before going on stage as Michael, in Death of England: Michael.You know how sprinters or Olympians eat in a certain way and sleep in a certain way to make sure their body is absolutely at its peak at the precise time of day that they’re racing?

For me, sensory stuff is really important. I have visual references, family photos – Mum and Dad. Part of their story is something that I’ve mined. I’ll sit in here and think about my character. There are a couple of hooks that I latch on to – thoughts or feelings or sensations or moments in time. They’re deeply private.View image in fullscreenPhysiologically, I’ll start getting quite twitchy in here, and I often start pacing and I’ll start mumbling to myself.

There’s a magic to just coming down to these dressing rooms. Every time I cross that threshold at the steps, it’s so nice to see everyone front of house and it’s lovely to be back in the in the theatre, but when I come into this space, it feels like an imaginative little den.

I have four kids. Performing is my big love, but it’s my job. It’s just a part of my day. I know many singers who are like: ‘Oh God, I have a performance tomorrow!’ But I’m very easy with it. I do warmups for sure. It’s like with any sport: you have to warm up before, otherwise you can do bad things for your body. But I never warm up for like one hour. I just do a few exercises for five minutes and this is enough. I think it’s a question of technique.”Olga PudovaView image in fullscreenJuan Diego Flórez warms up inside his dressing room at the Royal Opera House while having alterations done on his costume, prior to performance as Hoffman in The Tales of Hoffman.“I like to wake up as late as I can. I sleep a lot when I have a performance. I don’t have breakfast or I have something really light, and then I have my main meal: quinoa with eggs and avocado and salad is the best for me. I start singing some phrases, checking that the voice is there. And then usually I walk to the opera houseto get the air flowing. This is my favourite opera house. The people that work here are really enthusiastic, especially the incredible chorus. I’ve been coming to the Royal Opera House since 1997.”Juan Diego FlórezView image in fullscreenBel Powley stretches in her dressing room at the Old Vic as she prepares for her role as Annie in Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing.The Real Thing – Old Vic theatre“I get to my dressing room at 6pm and fuel up for the show.

I’m really into Debussy at the moment!”Bel PowleyView image in fullscreenSusan Wokoma and Oliver Johnstone, who play Charlotte and Max, in Susan’s dressing room before the show of The Real Thing.“I try and get as open and sociable as possible before the show. This is when I do my vocal warm-up. I sing, not well! But everyone hears me wailing and I’m like: ‘yep, that’s me warming up!’ I try and create a bit of a party mood – it reminds of how I felt when I was a kid doing theatre.

The next day I looked into her eyes and they were yellow. Opening night was on the 1st December, she went to the doctor the 2nd, was in the hospital on the 3rd and died on the 20th. But she had her 85th birthday here. We had 140 people fly in so at least she saw all her friends.View image in fullscreenIn hospital she was like: ‘Don’t you have a show?’ And I said: ‘Yeah, Mom, I’ll be right back.’ I didn’t miss a show. Mum loved me in the theatre and was so proud that I was doing the show, so I was actually doing it for her. December was just the worst. But you’ve just got to get out there and do it, and then you can fall apart in the lift on the way to my dressing room. So it gave me something to take my mind off everything. I think that helped.”Vanessa WilliamsView image in fullscreenDr Strangelove – Noël Coward theatre“At the half, I start doing my routine – shave, hair, brush teeth, moisturise, get all these clothes off, put my undergarments on: shirt, sound straps and all that. They asked me to do three roles – Kong, Strangelove and Mandrake the officer – and I asked if it was possible to do the President as well. I think that’s what’s made the play. The changes backstage are very frenetic. They’re ordered, but they’re fast. Like a Formula One pit stop.At the beginning of last year, I had long hair and a beard. When this is over I’ll probably let it grow back. It’s a kind of barometer for how long its been since I’ve had a job. I just show my agent and if my beard and my hair is long then I’m like: ‘you’ve gotta get me a job!’View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenWhen I’m the president I’m basically doing my Jack Lemon impersonation. And then when I do Kong, I’m sort of channeling Bill Clinton, that Arkansas accent. Mandrake is sort of my stock Hooray Henry, with some nuance, and Strangelove is just a camp Nazi, which I thought would be quite good to take the edge off it somehow, and I don’t know, makes it less distasteful? I try to do it a little Andy Warhol-ish, sort of like Studio 54 …Normally, I start with this… ah, ba, ba ba ba bum. Normally I sing, I siiiiii-ng to warm up the voice. I siiiiing!

I get that pre-flu feeling, and feel my body pushing it away, saying: ‘No, come back another time.’View image in fullscreenThis is hardest thing I’ve ever done.

See below for my thoughts on what makes a boho blouse cool rather than twee, and a tipoff about the return of the brooch. That’s what I love about fashion: you don’t have to buy it to buy into it. But whatever you do, don’t buy anything until you read this.The brooch is backView image in fullscreenYves Saint Laurent tricolour logo brooch£49 at Vestiaire CollectiveView image in fullscreenYves Saint Laurent gold and crystalbrooch£99 at HewiThe favoured accessory of minor royals and secondary-school art teachers is making a fashion comeback. The return of the brooch was my number-one takeaway from a recent trip to New York fashion week, where the chicest show-goers all had something fancy pinned to their coat lapel or beanie. I don’t think many people are on to this yet, which means that now is the time to pounce on a bargain vintage brooch before they get in on the act. Why wait for the high street to catch up (although it will, mark my words) when you can source something original and preloved? I have my eye on two fabulous Saint Laurent brooches: a tricolour logo brooch on Vestiaire Collective, and a sleek gold-and-crystal number, £99 on in-the-know resale site Hewi, which stands for Hardly Ever Worn It.The socks I am obsessed withView image in fullscreenBow socks£10 at CalzedoniaIt is impossible to overstate the importance of socks in fashion right now. These are adorable. If you wear them with jeans, you flash a bow now and again, but they come into their own with a party dress. They come in white with black bows or all black, but the pink-on-pink is givingSimone Rocha, for a tenner.Antler’s completely genius carry-on bagView image in fullscreenEssential overnight bag£125 at Antler£125 at John LewisAfter 20 years in fashion, I have a pretty tasty handbag collection, but the bag that has had complete strangers stopping me in the street and on the Eurostar platform recently is this Antler overnight bag. The clever thing about this bag is the integral back strap, which allows it to slide over the pop-up handle of your wheeled suitcase. This keeps it sitting securely on top of your luggage without everything falling over in chaos when you try to buy a coffee or get on to a train. It’s designed to go with Antler luggage, but I find it works with every case. Fits under the seat in front of you when you fly too.The pilates pump is the new ballerina flatView image in fullscreenAnydayHennriette Point£49 at John LewisBallerina flats never quite live up to their elegant name, on me. Something about the way a ballerina flat leaves the top part of my foot flat lacks grace, visually. And yes, I know we have bigger things to worry about in the world right now, but it still bugs me. I’ve found the solution in a new genre of ballerina/Mary-Jane hybrids, with a strap across the top – like the socks people wear at pilates, hence the name. Looks much more pleasing, and is more comfortable, being more secure to the foot. This John Lewis pair, with a ruched strap and pointed toe, look very classy for the price.Step out: 12 of the best flat pumps – in picturesRead moreA cool boho blouseView image in fullscreenCheesecloth blouse£75 at Me+EmThere’s a fine line between boho and trad-wife, and it feels important to stay on the right side of history here. A boho-style blouse is a useful buy because it works for daytime but can be easily dressed up with a kitten heel and some nice jewellery when you’re going out for dinner and want to make a bit of an effort. But I’ve learned the hard way that what feels charming and feminine in the heady atmosphere of a store changing room can seem costumey and twee in the cold light of day. Me+Em is never cheap, but its clothes are thoughtfully designed and beautifully made, and always walk the right line in looking feminine but not cloying. This cheesecloth blouse has an elevated neckline that gives a pop of interest poking out under a crew-neck knit, so it’s great for layering and will come into its own in summer. The peach sorbet shade is delicious, but it also comes in white and two alternative blues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is true that pesto is an incredibly useful jar to have in the cupboard. It is also true that pesto is a hard thing to preserve in a jar in a way that tastes nice. This is especially true if you are working to keep costs down – as consumers, we can all do ballpark sums for the cost of herbs, nuts, cheese and olive oil. I think one of the problems lies with the herbs’ tendency to get a bit muggy during processing, though some makers are doing quite a good job.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Just to be clear about nomenclature: pesto, from the Latinpestare, meaning to pound, is a generic word for a whole group of similar mixtures, the general guidelines being to mix any herb with any nut and with any cheese, then pour oil over the top. All the pestos I tasted fall into this general category, and they are called green pesto, Italian pesto or basil pesto.Pesto alla Genovese, on the other hand, is a specific mixture of basil, pine nuts, garlic, parmesan, pecorino and olive oil.The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and tested, from Ninja to NutribulletRead moreI am a fan of pesto both generic and specific, and make it all the time; I also like to have a jar in the cupboard. So I found this comparative tasting fascinating, not least for the ingredients lists. I tasted the pestos straight from the jar and stirred through hot pasta, because heat and a splash of the pasta cooking water play a major role: they melt the cheese, awaken the aromas (good and not so good) and change the pesto’s consistency. And remember, jarred pesto can also be spruced up with fresh herbs, more olive oil and, the saviour of so many things, an extra shower of cheese.The best supermarket pestoBestall-rounderM&S green basil pestoView image in fullscreen£2.20 for 190g at Ocado★★★★☆Has both pine nuts and cashews, and the sweet smell of cheese gives way to grass and herbs, which is a good start. I was only let down slightly by its sweetness. Good mixed with pasta, too; the heat brings out the herbs, but also more of that sweetness, sadly. That said, it stays well-balanced and free of the muggy and metallic taste that haunts many jarred pestos. I like this.BestsplurgeFilippo Berio classic pestoView image in fullscreen£2.80 for 190g at Tesco★★★★☆I am always happy to see olive oil in the ingredients list, as well as a mix of grana padano and pecorino. This has a nice aspect and an appealing colour. It’s quite salty, but the basil is also very present and nicely spicy, and I like the rustic consistency. It improves when mixed with pasta, with the heat waking up the basil almost aggressively; you can also really taste the cheese. Very decent.BestbargainLidl Baresa green pestoView image in fullscreen99p for 190g at Lidl★★★★☆The first impression is oily, but the pea-green colour, herbal smell, consistency and rounded flavour make for a well-balanced pesto. It’s even better with pasta – the balance maintained as the heat warmed the oil, including a lemon note that I quite liked.And the rest …Tesco green pestoView image in fullscreen99p for 190g at Tesco★★★☆☆When tasting this pesto with a spoon, the first flavour I get is peas, which is explained in the ingredients list: pea fibre! It actually turns out to be quite nice – vegetal and grassy – plus there’s a good balance of ingredients, especially the cheeses (pecorino and parmesan). Once mixed with pasta, the flavours stay balanced, but they’re a bit subdued: the basil emerges, but the cheese struggles to keep up – I added more.Sacla classic basil pestoView image in fullscreen£3.35 for 190g at Sacla£3.35 for 190g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Leads with cheese – pecorino and parmesan – and so much so that it smells a bit honky. Beyond that is the scent of olive oil and a faint herbal note. Cheese dominates the flavour, too, and overwhelms everything else. I did not add more when I had this on pasta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I like cashews in pesto and also appreciated the slightly spicy note. Same observations apply when added to pasta.Waitrose basil pestoView image in fullscreen£1.90 for 190g at Waitrose★★☆☆☆Just a few ingredients, a pleasing, vivid green and, with no added sugar, a startling contrast to the sweet pestos I tasted. No sign of basil, or indeed anything green or herbal, and a gritty, sandy texture. Things improve when this is mixed with pasta and heat: the herbs arrive and, although it comes out a bit milky, the flavour stays rounded. Good for kids, maybe, and would be helped along by cheese.Sainsbury’s green pestoView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 190g at Sainsbury’s★☆☆☆☆Dull green and not too pleasing a smell. The taste is overwhelmed by a pappy consistency – explained, maybe, by the use of potato flakes (don’t get me wrong: potato can be great in pesto). At first, I thought the flavour was absent – neither sweet nor savoury – but then it arrived in a metallic aftertaste. Not improved by pasta or heat, but helped by loads of grated cheese.Co-op green pestoView image in fullscreen£1.40 for 190g at Co-op★☆☆☆☆Despite the fat in the cashews, vegetable oil and cheese, this is a strangely fatless pesto; it’s a bit weedy, and that goes for its colour, too. But I am an optimist, so hoped that heat and pasta might help. They did not, and may have made things even worse. Maybe I should have spruced it all up with a bit of butter,extra-virgin olive oilor loads of cheese.Rodolfi pesto alla GenoveseView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 190g at Iceland★☆☆☆☆An oily aspect, but it at least smelled of basil, which made me hopeful. I was disappointed, however, by the sweet, slightly pappy flavour and oily aftertaste. I hoped the basil scent would come out with heat, and that cheese would wake it up, but no such luck. Mixed well with the pasta, though, and I helped it out by adding grated cheese and black pepper.Cook up a storm with our guide tothe best blendersExplore more on these topicsSauces and graviesThe FilterFoodPastaItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a while I had been contemplating moving home to Brisbane to escape the chaos of Sydney but, at that time, chaos and I were old friends, and it was a friendship I thought would prevail my whole life.I met Herschel on 20 December 2020 at about 10pm. I remember it well as it was also the day that a once firmly held belief of mine was shattered into oblivion.As much as I cherish my straight allies, there’s a familiar trope that involves them earnestly attempting to set us up with someone merely because they share our sexual orientation. No malice intended, but as most queer people know, it rarely results in a “match made in gay heaven”.The moment I knew: I’d had lots of lovers during our open relationship – then I realised I could trust him with my lifeRead moreIt’s for this reason that I responded to my straight, rugby-loving, beer-chugging brother Nick with trepidation when he insisted in July 2020 that I meet his “gay friend” Herschel from Brisbane because I would really “love him”. I brushed off his eager suggestions and carried on with my life, content in the knowledge my brother couldn’t possibly be on to something.Fast forward six months. I flew home to Brisbane for Christmas and headed straight from the airport to meet my family for dinner. After being bombarded with hugs and kisses, I noticed my brother wasn’t there. “Nick’s at a party at Herschel’s house,” my family explained. Soon, Nick began bombarding me with text messages, urging me to join the party. When I responded I was exhausted and ready for bed, Nick offered to pay for my Uber, which I politely declined: “I cannot be bought!” However, persistence, they say, is key, and, as it turns out, the key to Nick’s persistence came in the form of a video message from him and Herschel.I still remember the visceral reaction I had to the friendly face beaming at me through the screen (no it wasn’t Nick’s!). With brown curls rivalling a Disney prince, piercing blue eyes and a smile that was charming and enigmatic, I was mesmerised. There was something about Herschel’s smile that pulled me out of exhaustion and alerted me to the possibility I was wrong about these straight allies and their match-making endeavours.I ordered a car to his house.Herschel and I hit it off immediately and chatted all night, only interrupted by the occasional “I told you so” whispered in my ear by Nick.View image in fullscreen‘I would do anything to ensure we outlasted infinite summers’For the remainder of my holiday, Herschel and I hung out as often as we could under the guise that this was no more than a “summer fling”. I was due to return to Sydney in a matter of weeks.When I returned to chaos (Sydney), I tried to put the “summer fling” behind me. But 12 weeks later, I quit my job, packed my belongings and moved back to Brisbane to focus on finishing my studies.Herschel brought an unfamiliar tranquillity and stillness to my Brisbane life. He was at the tail end of his university degree studying wildlife science and we spent our time together studying, cooking, taking trips to South Stradbroke Island and getting to know each other’s family and friends. As the months (and eventually years) in Brisbane went on, we kept joking it was the “summer fling” that would never end.One afternoon we were sitting at home watching the Disney movie Luca. The film, a coming-of-age story about friendship, self-acceptance and finding your place in a world where you don’t quite know how to fit in, reduced me to a blubbering mess on the couch. As I sat there, reflecting on my own experiences as a queer person while trying to hide the fact I was snot-crying on a Tuesday afternoon, Herschel put his head on my shoulder. A feeling of immense relief washed over me as he calmly yet compassionately listened to my heartache. I felt safe, free from judgment and drawn to this mature, centred and wise man. I knew in that moment I would do anything to ensure we outlasted infinite summers.A year ago we moved to Sydney to enjoy post-grad life together. Experiencing Sydney again with Herschel by my side makes it feel like an entirely new city. One that I view through a much less chaotic lens.As for Nick, the next time he makes a suggestion, I won’t be so quick to dismiss him.Tell us the moment you knewDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Once we figured out the difference, I wasn’t as intimidated by her process, and she wasn’t as confused by mine.I’m in denial,but I probably am like Kevin [Ready’s hapless character inMotherland]. On holiday with my family in Center Parcs I got caught in the Wild Water Rapids and couldn’t get up. A group of people was watching me struggle, saying, “There’s that guy fromMotherland.”Once, I was ina soft-play ball pit with my daughter when she was a toddler. This dad, with a slightly crazed look in his eye, held on to the netting next to me with both hands, looked in and said, “I’m Kevin.” I had sympathy.Skiing nearly killed me.It was my first time on a harder run. Within a matter of minutes I’d gone off-piste and ended up throwing myself to the ground, looking over a sheer drop. I’m 90% sure I wouldn’t have survived the fall. I wasn’t injured, but there was a lot of swearing.My fear of ageingis more about life disappearing – but I find that valuable. The paradox is to be more present, more grateful – then it becomes a gift. I’ve taken loads for granted, but the older I get, the more precious life feels to me.I opened the doorto a small sauna in a hotel in Santa Monica and a very naked Harvey Keitel was there. I stood in the doorway like: “Is this cool?” I was allowed to sit down. No conversation – I just let him stretch out. I’m unsure if I was starstruck or just struck.“He bished,he bashed, he boshed.” That’ll do for my headstone. I’d love my kid to remember me as a good dad, and to be remembered as a brilliant actor, but part of me is happy to be forgotten. Let’s not worry about that.Paul Ready isin Three Sisters at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, Shakespeare’s Globe until 19 April (shakespearesglobe.com)Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis much I knowActingTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Look around you’: life amid the cocaine cartels of the French RivieraNice may be at the heart of France’s upmarket Mediterranean coast, but violent drug gangs making €1.5m a month are colonising part of itRichard Assheton in NiceSat 1 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 17.00 ESTShareThe sight of the gun tucked into the man’s trousers told us it was time to go. We had been in one of France’s most notorious estates for several hours, trying to understand life on the frontline of the country’s spiralling drug war.Seeing three people he did not know and a camera, he decided enough was enough. “You, where do you live?” he said, rushing towards us from the foot of a tower block where he had parked his scooter. “Don’t talk back to me, I’ll break your head in. Get out of here.”It was a chastening exit, but one that showed us the violence we had only seen signs of was all too real.I had been given a rare chance to visit by Siam Spencer, a freelance journalist who until recently lived here, in Les Moulins estate on the edge of sun-kissed, touristy Nice.When she got a job in the city in 2023, Spencer asked a charity to house her, because coming from a deprived family she had no guarantor. What she did not know was the flat it provided was in an estate that had been a byword for drug violence for decades. “I looked it up on the internet,” she said. “But honestly, I thought, there would be three gunshots per month. It’s still Nice. It’s a small estate, so I didn’t mind.”Instead, as well as rats, cockroaches, bedbugs and squatters who once broke down her door, she had to contend with the sound of Kalashnikovs outside her window. “In the first three weeks things got really hot,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe perennial blue skies of Nice, which have inspired painters from Matisse to Chagall, are in stark contrast to the grittiness of Les Moulins estate.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesOn one side, Nice is the pearl of the French Riviera, a moneyed Mediterranean haven famous for the perennial blue skies that have inspired painters from Matisse to Chagall. The other side is Les Moulins. The estate of roughly 12,000 residents was built in the 1960s to house those returning from Algeria’s war of independence from France. It sits beside the beach and the airport. But few here do much sunbathing and even fewer fly out.Living inside for eight months, Spencer discovered she looked out on to the most prolific drug dealing point on the Riviera, where up to €20,000 changes hands every day. She has written a book about the experience,La Laverie(The Launderette), named after the building outside which dealers worked. The launderette was knocked down last year, but the dealers remain. As we entered the estate in the early afternoon, they sat over its common areas, smoking joints, playing music and scanning for customers. Men drinking coffee ignored them, used to the sight.View image in fullscreenSiam Spencer has written a book about her time living on the estate.Photograph: Richard Assheton/The Observer“It’s packed with dealers. Look around you,” said Nourrédine Debbari, who was born on the estate and runs a charity supporting residents. She said the estate had five main dealing points, shared between two or three rival gang networks. Together they make about €1.5m a month, he said. “Everyone in the neighbourhood is affected by drug trafficking. They live with it. There’s no choice.”The terrorised majority have got used to periodic killings as gangs settle scores and mark their territory. The estate has been a designated “priority security zone” for French authorities since 2013, while the then prime minister Jean Castex visited in 2020 after a spate of shootings.But the threat is becoming scarier. Last July, seven members of one family including three children were burned to death in their flat in Les Moulins. Residents said the father was a drug dealer who was in prison, and rivals targeted his family to settle a score. Three of the arrested suspects were from the Paris region.locator mapAcross France, sophisticated international drug gangs are spreading out from Paris and the crime hotspot of Marseille to towns and smaller ­cities. Armed with guns flooding into the country through Marseille, and mimicking the extreme violence of their counterparts in South America, they make billions of euros every year in sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrest in Romania last week of Mohamed Amra, France’s public enemy number one, known as “The Fly”, underscored the strength of the gangs: he escaped from a police van in northern France last year when accomplices ambushed it.The French Riviera is an obvious target for business, being close to Marseille and famed for its wealth and hedonism. “Cocaine use is not reserved for party circles,” Damien Martinelli, the public prosecutor of Nice, told French media in January. “It’s not reserved for executives and upper-level professionals. It’s everyone.”The Riviera has never seen such quantities of drugs and weapons washing around, customs officers and police say. Nearly 350kg of cocaine were seized in the local department last year, a record. That is probably a fraction of the amount in circulation.Last week in Marseille, the trial began of an alleged drug ring of 22 people with links to the Italian mafia and stretching across the Mediterranean. Its alleged kingpin, named by police as Patrick V, stayed in luxury hotels in Thailand, Greece and Brazil as well as the Côte d’Azur, according to court papers. He spent an estimated €26,000 renting luxury cars from an agency in Cannes, while his wife gambled thousands in casinos around the Riviera.Some drugs arrive in cars and speedboats from Italy, Spain and Morocco, via what are known in France as “go fasts”. “We are seeing that traffickers are taking more and more financial risks, with vehicles transporting larger quantities than before,” Éric Antonetti, head of the interdepartmental service of the region’s judicial police, said recently.Most of the drugs go through the port of Marseille, a Nice police source, who did not want to give his name out of fear of the gangs, told theObserver. The cartels have deep connections. “These are families who know each other because they have villas in Tunisia or elsewhere,” he said. “And then they implant themselves everywhere. That is to say, links are made between Marseille, Toulon and Nice.”At the moment Marseille’s gangs appear to be taking over from local groups. During our visit to Les Moulins, we were told that two Mercedes cars and two Yamaha TMax scooters we saw were DZ Mafia, France’s most powerful drug gang, from Marseille, arriving in the estate to take over its business. “I’m afraid things are going to heat up a little,” Debbari said. “It will heat up for a day or two. That’s all. Once they get the [dealing] network, it’s over [for their lower-level Nice rivals].”Kingpins such as these often operate from prison, directing teams of dealers down to street level. The lowest in the pyramid are known aschoufs, Arabic for lookouts.Debbari said in Les Moulins they used to earn about €30 a day. Now it is 80 or 100. At one dealing point in particular, the dealers looked younger than teenagers.Rudy Manna, spokesman for the police syndicate National Police Alliance, said gangs had taken to recruiting illegal child migrants for these roles. “It is meat. They know that it is going to be an absolutely horrible job, that there will be acts of torture or barbarism,” he said.View image in fullscreenAbdelhakim Madi grew up in Les Moulins and founded Partage Ton Talent, a charity for young people.Photograph: Richard Assheton/The ObserverEven for children growing up in estates such as this, the temptation can be too strong to resist. Spencer said: “You have a deep anger and your parents don’t make money, and you’re fed up, and you live in Nice, where you have the Negresco, the biggest five-star hotel in France, or at least one of the most expensive, 15 minutes away.”Abdelhakim Madi, 24, knows what it is like. He grew up in Les Moulins, dreaming of becoming a comedian. He has become a celebrity among the estate’s young people after founding a charity six years ago that does everything from giving sports and drama lessons to helping match them to jobs.Partage Ton Talent [Share Your Talent] has touched more than 600 young people so far, and has 50 volunteers. In his brightly painted, newly renovated centre, where teenagers enjoyed the tranquility of a safe place, he said: “It’s a fight to have hope for this society, because it scares me. I only see people divided, divided. I don’t have that spirit, I don’t.”Robert Songhor, from Association Adam, another estate charity, takes children on trips to the beach and mountains. “They are going to the snow next week,” he said. “Some of them have already been. It’s about showing them you are not ‘a youth from the estate’. You are a citizen of Nice.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverEuropeDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

We all want answers.”Those answers may take a while to emerge.The couple were found on Wednesday afternoon after a maintenance worker, concerned when no one answered the door, contacted neighborhood security, who spotted their bodies through a window and called the police. One of their three dogs was also found dead. They had been dead for “quite a while” before they were found, according to the Santa Fe county sheriff, Adan Mendoza.They both appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor in different areas of the house, officials say. Hackman was found near an entryway with a cane nearby, while Arakawa was found in a bathroom with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a nearby countertop. The deceased dog was found in a bathroom closet. Two other dogs were found alive, Mendoza said, and were able to come in and out of the house using a pet door. There were no signs of foul play.View image in fullscreenSanta Fe county sheriff answers questions about the investigation into the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife.Photograph: Susan Montoya Bryan/AP“There was no indication of a struggle,” Mendoza said. “There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed … you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.”The sheriff said on Friday afternoon that Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide and that there were no indications of trauma to their bodies. The last recorded activity on Hackman’s pacemaker was on 17 February – Mendoza said it was a “good assumption” that was his last day of life.Investigators are trying to piece together a timeline around the couple’s death. But officials are waiting for the autopsy and toxicology results, which could take three months or longer, Mendoza said.Meanwhile, inside coffee shops and art stores in Santa Fe, people ask:what do you think happened?“Everyone is shocked. None of it matches up,” said Barbara Simpson, a longtime Santa Fe resident who owns an antique shop in the city. “There’s still a lot that has to come out in the investigation.”Simpson recalled seeing Hackman in the area for many years – he once owned a business near her store. In Santa Fe, he could go about his life without being bothered and was accepted as part of the community, Simpson said.“People in Santa Fe liked them a lot. They were really involved,” she said.New Mexico’s state senate held a moment of silence at the state capitol in the historic city after news of their deaths broke, with one lawmaker stating: “We were lucky to call him a New Mexican.”As residents of Santa Fe, the couple opened local businesses such as an interior design store and invested in restaurants – Hackman even painted the mural that adorns one eatery. The actor served on the board of trustees with the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum for nearly a decade. In a statement, the museum said he played “a vital role in shaping the museum’s early years” and contributed in “meaningful” ways, including narrating a film for the museum.View image in fullscreenGene Hackman with his wife Betsy Arakwa in June 1993.Photograph: APSanta Fe, the oldest capital city in the US, has long drawn artists as well as famous writers and Hollywood celebrities from Robert Redford to Shirley MacLaine. Simpson, who previously worked in the film industry, said many people become acquainted with the area that way and find they enjoy the small town vibe and cultural scene.Hackman once said he had become taken “with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place”.It’s the light that draws people here, Gürler, a photographer, mused, and then they find a deeply inclusive and welcoming community. Hackman and Arakawa fitted right in, she said.“He was the kindest man. He would smile at everyone,” she said. “Everyone I’ve talked to since yesterday is genuinely sad.”For many years, people would see the couple walking around downtown, visiting the library or eating at local restaurants. Some residents have begun sharing stories online about their interactions over the years. One man described how he helped Hackman as a library worker, and how the actor later invited him to join him and Arakawa for dinner. Now the community waits to learn what happened.“Something is missing. I hope we get closure, but I’m hoping [their] family get closure even if we don’t,” Gürler said.Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoGene HackmannewsShareReuse this content"

The prophetic plea was met with applause, a rare event in the security council chamber. It led to the career diplomat’s inclusion as a character in David Hare’s 2004 anti-war play,Stuff Happens.Now the veteran statesman, who warned about the risks of Europe’s over-reliance on the US many years before it became a mainstream opinion in Paris or Berlin, is back with advice on how to respond to the most serious breakdown in Europe’s relationship with the US in 80 years.AsDonald Trumpalienates America’s oldest allies at alarming speed, European leaders are scrambling to adjust to the new, chaotic world order. But De Villepin believes there is also an opportunity for Europe to unite behind liberal democracy and fill the vacuum left behind by the Trump administration. He is convinced that there is an urgent need for European independence in defence, national security and technology.It is a reflection of the alarm in Europe that Paris, for the last month, has been bustling with visiting diplomats, premiers and heads of state. On Monday Emmanuel Macron became the first European leader to be welcomed to the White House since Trump’s return to power. But Macron has alsoconvenedworld leaders to discuss potential new coalitions of countries willing to step in to blunt the consequences of Trump’s realignment on Ukraine and his apparent readiness to abandon liberal democracy.Trump’s foreign policy is unpredictable, but he appears now toside with Russia over Ukraine. Even as Macron was at the White House attempting to salvage transatlantic ties, the USvoted with Russiaagainst a UN resolution condemning Vladimir Putin’s war. North Korea and Belarus were among only a handful of other nations that followed the US.“We now have three illiberal superpowers:Russia, China and the US,” De Villepin says. “America can no longer be considered an ally of Europe.” But he warns that the US will not prosper in this disordered, survival-of-the-fittest world it is creating, “because they will be completely isolated”.He sees Trump’s authoritarian turn as both a crisis and an opportunity for Europe to unite behind a new common purpose. “The consequence of this will be a European awakening of democracy. We’re going to fight for liberal democracy more than ever. Because the question now is really: sovereignty or submission.”Achieving European sovereignty sounds logical, but how do we get there? De Villepin suggests a three-point plan for a more assertive and independent continent. The first step is to develop a common defence pact in Europe, with a significant boost to the European defence industry. “We urgently need to develop our own systems, and not just buy from the US.” The second is to increase investment in innovation and tech, as outlined in theDraghi reportlast year, which warned of an “agonising decline” for Europe in the absence of an €800bn annual spending boost. The third step is to strengthen Franco-British collaboration on defence, intelligence, nuclear issues and Ukraine, where De Villepin wants to seeclear security guarantees in the event of a treaty and ceasefire.“We have to take our destiny in our own hands,” he says. “Stop believing in illusions. Trump is abandoningUkraineand [Elon] Musk is supporting extremist movements in Europe because they want a weaker EU. They understand that Europe is now the main obstacle for their vision. And this is, of course, not acceptable.”Does he support Ukraine’s European – including French – allies putting boots on the ground to protect against a future Russian attack? “As part of an agreed peacekeeping plan by the international community, I would support a French contribution.”View image in fullscreenDominique de Villepin speaks to reporters after a UN security council meeting on 7 March 2003 – less than two weeks before the Iraq war began.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/REUTERSBack in 2003, De Villepin’s impassioned UN speech was delivered during a similar low point in transatlantic relations, with American neoconservatives renaming French fries “freedom fries” while rightwing news organisations labelled France and other European countries opposing the Iraq invasion an “axis of weasels”.His challenge to George Bush’s US, which drew on the painful wartime history underpinning the transatlantic alliance, remains acutely relevant in 2025. “This message comes to you today from an old country,France, from an old continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity,” he told the security council in 2003. “A country that does not forget and knows everything it owes to the freedom fighters who came from America and elsewhere. And yet has never ceased to stand upright in the face of history and before mankind. Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community.”Rumours of a De Villepin run for the Élysée in 2027 have been circulating in the French media. He remains coy about a presidential ambition. What is clear, however, is that he thinks the next wave of national elections across Europe will be decided as much by national security and foreign affairs as by domestic issues. “National security will be the most important issue for voters, because it’s about liberty, values, whether we believe in sovereignty or submission.”This seems to be the rationale behind his return to public life – not just as a potential presidential candidate in France, but as the unofficial spokesperson for what he calls “European sovereignty”. He used the phrase six times during our 90-minute conversation. “With my background, my opposition to the Iraq war and all my experience of dealing with geopolitical crises, I felt that there were missing voices speaking up for the defence of Europe, the defence of our values, so it was my duty to speak up.”De Villepin belongs to a long tradition of French politicians sceptical of America’s global supremacy, and now feels vindicated. But he’s not pushing a dogmatic anti-Americanism. He has close ties to the US,studied there, and emphasises his respect for America’s soft power, its universities, its culture of innovation. “They are giving that up for this absurd idea of full power. They are ignoring history. You can never win with fire alone.”He forecasts that mass protests against Trump will emerge across the US as soon as the failures of his policies become evident. He predicts, like most economists, that the trade tariffs will lead to exploding inflation and layoffs, and that Trump’s “reckless” foreign policy will make the country much weaker. “This is always the problem for the nationalists and populists. What I call the principle of reality.”The problem, I suggest, is that the far right is waging war on reality, and it seems to be winning – at least in the US. In the presidential election last year, Trump won the popular vote with a small margin of 1.5 percentage points nationwide, but he won by an average of54 points in “news deserts”, where few serious local media outlets are available, according to a study from Northwestern University.Elon Musk wants a complete vassalisation of Europe and European mediaDe Villepin sees this as an urgent call to build up the European tech industry and encourage independence from US platforms. “Elon Musk wants a complete vassalisation of Europe and European media. So this is a question of our fundamental liberties, and our freedom to think what we want to think. We need to build our own tools, whether it’s LLMs [large language models], social platforms or cloud tech. We have to understand that this is a state of emergency.”Before Germany’s general election on 23 February, Musk campaigned frenetically for the far right AfD, but to less effect than he might have hoped for. The party was polling at about 20% when Musk embraced it and ended up with20.8% of the vote. De Villepin does not believe that a Musk intervention in favour of the far right would be particularly successful in France, either. “Oh, it would be the surest way for Le Pen to lose, if Elon Musk came here to campaign with her.”Jordan Bardella, the youthful president of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party,cancelled a tripto a rightwing conference in the US after the former Trump aide Steve Bannon made what appeared to be a Nazi salute at the event.De Villepin predicts that Le Pen will try to keep some distance between herself and Trump’s Maga movement, but he insists they are ideological twins. “She’s very close to Russia. Close to these ideas. Anti-globalisation, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism. So they’re completely linked.”His own path to a potential presidential candidacy might be filled with obstacles and contradictions. As a pro-Palestinian, moderate conservative Gaullist, he could struggle to get past the first round. But he clearly sees a political future where his foreign policy experience will top most immediate domestic concerns.For now, he says, European nationalists can gather,as they did recentlyin Madrid, laud Trump and pledge to “make Europe great again” – but soon, he believes, Trump will be a toxic brand in Europe. “This is an opportunity for Europe to be the voice of stability,” he says. “Because here, we know the consequences of authoritarian nationalism.”Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens NyheterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Like the candidate whose CV falsely boasted of a second-dan black belt in taekwondo, only to discover his interviewer was an aficionado of the sport. “An interview that should have been an hour lasted 15 minutes,” said Collingwood, the managing director of the IT recruitment agency Viqu.Or the candidate who claimed he had attended a certain private school, which his interviewer had also attended and would have been in the year above. But when asked for teachers’ names, the school motto, even where the sports field was, “he was clueless. Didn’t get the job.”CV falsification, even on seemingly trivial points, can have serious consequences, yet Collingwood said it was “ridiculously common”.Recruitment fraud is another term for it. According to the UK fraud prevention service Cifas, it is one of the most frequent “first-party frauds”, when an individual knowingly misrepresents their identity or provides false information for financial or material gain.The recent travails of thechancellor, Rachel Reeves, whose career history came under scrutiny again after a BBC investigation revealed her time working at the Bank of England wasnine months shorter than she claimed, and thebusiness secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, who is being reinvestigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over accusations he never qualified as solicitor, despite listing job on LinkedIn profile, have highlighted a growing problem for recruiters.A Cifas survey earlier this month found that nearly one in five UK individuals (18%) had lied on their CVs and job applications in order to land a role, or knew someone who had, in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, one in seven (14%) felt it was “reasonable” to say they had achieved a 2:1 degree when they had failed their final year.The most common falsehoods are reasons given for leaving a previous job and manipulating employment dates to cover gaps or to extend or completely erase previous jobs, according toresearch by the business credit card company Capital on Tap. Then, there are those inflated job titles – CVs liberally, and unjustifiably, seasoned with the words “senior” and “manager”.Such is the problem that Reed, Britain’s biggest recruiter, has set upReed Screening: a 100-strong workforce devoted to screening hundreds of thousands of CVs each year and checking references for clients.James Reed, the chair and CEO of Reed, said: “This is a growing problem. Sixty per cent of the CVs we look at have some form of error, and 20% of those are what you might call malicious error, when somebody is literally making something up to seek some form of gain.“From the applicant’s point of view, why is this happening? It might be because people are using AI to help do their CVs. And AI can make stuff up. It might be because the labour market has become more difficult, and it is tougher to get a job. Or it might be because they think they can get away with it and there’s some sort of change in the culture. But it’s a silly thing to do, because as some recent examples have made clear, this can bubble up sometime afterwards, to your detriment.”He added: “It ranges from someone who might have got a date wrong, or might have exaggerated a job title, to someone who is making up qualifications that they don’t have, or fabricating an entire career record.”Reed Screening uses specially designed software. “You can forensically examine a CV. The AI technology that candidates might use to create CVs can also be used increasingly to check them. Qualification databases, that’s another thing; if they say they got better grades than they did, that can be checked automatically.“You have these reference houses. They are illegal. They are scams where people pay so you ring them up, and someone answers the phone and says: ‘Yeah, I remember James.’ That’s all fake. So we have to check it, the company history, and whether the people giving the references are real.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is also this implied obligation of trust and confidence between the employer and employee. So if an employer later finds out that the employee has fabricated their CV, or not told the truth about why they left a previous employer, that could be grounds for dismissal, because it would be breach of the trust and confidence.”Often people don’t see such actions as potentially having criminal consequences, said Simon Miller, the director of policy, strategy and communications at Cifas, “when in fact they can have” and a person who has displayed such dishonesty “might be vulnerable and susceptible to further dishonesty” once hired.He added: “We know that people who are mostly younger and starting on their careers are more likely to falsify CV information.” When the job market is tight “there’s a catch-22 where you haven’t got the experience but you can’t get the experience”. Or they want to reach the next rung above entry level.Hayley Paterson, who co-commissioned the Cifas research, said the 800-strong membership organisation offered training on “insider threat” fraud, and advice on using vetting services and checking for the use of reference houses.Collingwood highlighted a basic error by would-be fraudsters who tweaked their LinkedIn profiles to change dates or inflate job titles: many forgot their posts were in the public domain, and these might not tally with the dates on their private CVs. “There are HR people, and their job is just to do social media diligence, and they’ll look through an individual’s footprint,” he said.“I’ve seen some horrendous examples of people losing their jobs, having job offers pulled when they have already resigned from their previous job, because the lies have come out.”Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawCareersArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Challenging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will mean dredging up potentially damaging allegations and having reams of correspondence paraded through an open courtroom for two weeks, as the regulator backs up its claims that Staleyhid how close he was to the late sex offender.Staley’s efforts to restore his credibility will also force some of the biggest names in the City to take the stand in one of the most high-profile hearings to take place at London’s Upper Tribunal in years.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey– who led the FCA during Staley’s tenure – and Barclays chair Nigel Higgins have been dragged into the matter, and are due to give evidence and face questioning before the media from next week.Staley – who ultimately lost £18m in bonuses and pay as a result of the FCA ruling – will also face three and a half days of questioning during the hearing, according to the two-week court schedule.The 68-year-old will be revisiting events that led to his resignation in 2021, when the FCA handed him a preliminary decision over its investigation into his relationship with Epstein. Epstein haddied in prison two years earlier,while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.In 2023, the regulator banned Staley from holding any senior role in the City, sayinghe had misled the regulator over his relationship. Staley immediately pledged to challenge the ruling.The FCA’s legal team is expected to defend its decision strongly. On top of evidence gathered during its own multi-year investigation, the regulator will draw on documents from Epstein’s estate, as well as Staley’s former employer JP Morgan, which battled separate legal hearings related to its dealings with Epstein in the US in recent years.That includes more than 1,200 emails and email chains, some of which the FCA is keen to stress “would not be exchanged between … individuals who were anything other than close friends”.Correspondence between the pair shows they shared messages about sex, women, and foreign holidays, with Staley referring to Epstein as “family”.One notorious exchange from 2010 saw the two discuss Disney princesses.Staley tells Epstein“that was fun. Say hi to Snow White.”“What character would you like next?” Epstein asks, to which Staley replies: “Beauty and the Beast.”The FCA will also try to prove that Epstein worked behind the scenes to help Staley’s career, liaising with UK government officials, including Lord Mandelson, as well as business leaders and royalty to support the banker.Meanwhile, it hopes to show that Staley shared confidential business information with Epstein, including about his own salary negotiations, unreleased shareholder letters, and legal action involving Epstein, even when this raised a conflict of interest with Staley’s then employer JP Morgan.That is in addition to allegations that Staley’s daughter Alexa was used as an “intermediary” to pass messages between the pair after Staley joined Barclays, between 2016 and 2017.Staley has claimed he cut ties with the disgraced financier before taking the reins at Barclays in late 2015. He issued a statement in 2023, saying: “If I had known who JE [Jeffrey Epstein] really was, there is absolutely no doubt that I wouldn’t be in the position I am in today. Prior to undertaking my former role, it was known that I had had a relationship with JE.”Other witnesses scheduled to give evidence include Sasha Wiggins, Barclays’ former chief of staff and head of public policy who now leads its private bank, and Bob Hoyt, who previously served as Barclays’ top lawyer until 2020, when he moved over to HSBC. Stephen Doherty, the bank’s former head of corporate relations, who has since moved to Aviva, is also due to face questioning.The FCA and representatives for Staley declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBankingObserver business agendaBarclaysJeffrey EpsteinFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsanalysisShareReuse this content"

As witha lawsuitthe same attorneys filed earlier this month for access to people already detained there, the latest case was filed in Washington and isbacked bythe American Civil Liberties Union.At least 50 people are known to have been transferred already toGuantánamo Bay, and the civil rights attorneys believe the number now may be about 200. They have said it is the first time in US history that the government has detained non-citizens on civil immigration charges there. For decades, the naval base was primarily used to detain foreigners associated with the 11 September 2001 attacks.Trump has said Guantánamo Bay, also known as “Gitmo”, has space for up to 30,000 people and that he plans to send “the worst” or high-risk “criminal aliens” there. The administration has not released specific information on who is being transferred, so it is not clear which crimes they are accused of committing in the US and whether they have been convicted, or merely charged or arrested.“The purpose of this second Guantánamo lawsuit is to prevent more people from being illegally sent to this notorious prison, where the conditions have now been revealed to be inhumane,” said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney and lead counsel on the case. “The lawsuit is not claiming they cannot be detained in US facilities, but only that they cannot be sent to Guantánamo.”The 10 men are from nations including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Venezuela, and their attorneys say they are neither high-risk criminals nor gang members. Ina 29 January executive orderexpanding operations at Guantánamo Bay, Trump said that one of his goals was to “dismantle criminal cartels”.Their attorneys described their latest lawsuit as an emergency filing to halt imminent transfers and challenge the Trump administration’s plans. They contend that the transfers violate the men’s right to due legal process, guaranteed by the fifth amendment to the US constitutionThe latest lawsuit also argues that federal immigration law bars the transfer of non-Cuban migrants from the US to Guantánamo Bay and that the US government has no authority to hold people outside its territory, and that the naval base remains part ofCubalegally. The transfers are also described as arbitrary.The men’s attorneys allege that many of the people who have been sent to Guantánamo Bay do not have serious criminal records or even any criminal history. Their first lawsuit, filed 12 February, said people sent to the naval base had “effectively disappeared into a black box” and could not contact attorneys or family. The US Department of Homeland Security, one of the agencies sued, said they could reach attorneys by phone.In another, separate federal lawsuit filed in New Mexico, a federal judge on 9 February blocked the transfer of three immigrants from Venezuela being held in that state to Guantánamo Bay. Their attorneys said they had been falsely accused of being gang members.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It once held nearly 800 people, but the number hasdwindled to 15, including accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, who was assigned to Guantánamo when he was on active duty, has called it a “perfect place” to house undocumented immigrants, and Trump has described the naval base as “a tough place to get out of”.A United Nations investigator who visited the military detention center in 2023 said conditions had improved, but that military detainees still faced near constant surveillance, forced removal from their cells and unjust use of restraints, resulting in “ongoing cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under international law”. The US said it disagreed “in significant respects” with her report.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGuantánamo BayTrump administrationUS politicsCubaLaw (US)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Maritime boundaries are recognised under international law, and this is a matter of grave concern … I assure you that my government is not acting precipitously; we are addressing this situation with seriousness and responsibility.”He added that he had summoned the Venezuelan ambassador to his office to register his strong protest and instructed Guyana’s embassy in Caracas to lodge a formal protest with the Venezuelan government.But he also made it clear he had triggered a military response, which included the deployment of air assets and the country’s coastguardHe said: “Guyana remains committed to peace and the rule of law. We will continue to pursue diplomatic solutions, but we will not tolerate threats to our territorial integrity.”The US and the Organisation of American States (OAS) have supported Guyana, condemning Venezuela’s actions.Describing the incident as a threat to ExxonMobil’s oil operations in Guyana’s internationally recognised maritime territory, the OAS statement said: “Such acts of intimidation constitute a clear violation of international law, undermine regional stability, and threaten the principles of peaceful coexistence between nations. The OAS reiterates its steadfast support for Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Venezuelan regime must immediately cease all aggressive manoeuvres that could escalate tensions in the region.”The US Department of State bureau of western hemisphere also reaffirmed its support for Guyana’s territorial integrity, adding that “further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime”.The incident is the latest development in atense, longstanding feudbetween the two neighbouring South American countries over land and maritime borders.In February,six soldiers in Guyana were injuredwhile on a resupply mission along the Cuyuni River after suspectedVenezuelangang members opened fire on them.Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commissioncheated it out ofthe mineral-rich Essequibo region, which represents two-thirds of Guyana’s territory and lies near big offshore oil deposits. The area, which was administered by Britain for more than a century, has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the UK.Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, has threatened toannex the regionby force.In late 2023, the leaders of both countries attended an emergency summit where theypromised not to use threats or force against each other. However, they did not reach a deal on the dispute over the Essequibo region.Explore more on these topicsGuyanaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

About 1,700 firefighters were being mobilised from across the country, the agency said.Aerial footage from the public broadcaster NHK showed white smoke billowing up and covering an entire mountain.Local police found the body of one person who had been burned, while more than 1,000 nearby residents have been evacuated and more than 80 buildings had been damaged as of Friday, according to the Ofunato authorities.The cause of the blaze remained unknown.View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to extinguish the fire.Photograph: Fire and Disaster Management Agency/ReutersTwo other fires were also burning on Saturday, one in Yamanashi and another elsewhere in Iwate.There were about 1,300 wildfires across Japan in 2023, concentrated in the February to April period when the air dries out and winds pick up.

live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastByDan Jervis-BardySat 1 Mar 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 17.58 ESTShareLabor is expected to flick the switch on a household battery incentive scheme in a dual cost-of-living and climate action pitch to voters.Guardian Australia understands the government is preparing a large residential energy efficiency package as part of Anthony Albanese’s re-election platform.The Coalition has signalled its own home battery plan is in the works, setting up competing policies to spark a household electrification revolution.Suburb-wide electrification trials to be rolled out across Australia in bid to fuel transition away from gasRead moreClean energy advocates and crossbench MPs have been urging the federal government to do more to subsidise the upfront cost of solar panels, electric appliances and household batteries to slash power bills while cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Switching from gas to electric appliances would be a permanent solution to cut household bills, compared to the temporary relief of energy rebates.Industry and government sources confirmed a wide range of policy options have been examined in the past three years, including tax rebates for appliances and a Hecs-style loan scheme advocated bySaul Griffith’s Rewiring Australia.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut sources said the most likely offering was an expansion of the small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES) to include home batteries.The SRES – which is due to end in 2030 – is limited to solar panels, heat pumps, water heaters, wind turbines and hydro systems.More than 300,000 solar systems have been installed each year since 2020 under the scheme, saving households more than $1,500 annually, according to figures from theClean Energy Regulator published in December.Severalstateandterritorygovernments already offer subsidies for home batteries, with the WA premier, Roger Cook,promising rebates of $5,000 and $7,500 for household batteriesif his Labor government is re-elected on 8 March.The Albanese government has already allocated $800m to upgrade more than 100,000 social housing properties with energy efficient appliances, and directed the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to fund more suburb-wideelectrification trials.View image in fullscreenWith so many people installing solar panels on their roofs, electrification advocates say there’s no better time for a national battery booster program.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThe chief executive of the SmartEnergyCouncil, John Grimes, said there was “never a better time for a national battery booster program”.“The best way to address cost of living pressures is by helping families to get solar and batteries,” Grimes said.The independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, last week declared household electrification would be a priority in a hung parliament as she announced a plan to upgrade more than 800,000 homes and rental properties through a combination of loans, tax write-offs and direct funding.Fellow crossbencher Helen Haines is also promoting a loan scheme for household batteries and electric appliances.The Coalition has for months signalled it is open to adding a battery scheme to its energy platform, which so far revolves around a plan to build nuclear reactors from 2035.Why are some Australian households about to be charged for generating too much solar power?Read moreThe shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O’Brien, indicated the policy was still on the agenda.“The Coalition understands the importance of practical solutions like household batteries to improve energy resilience and affordability, and we’ll have more to say about this closer to the election,” O’Brien said.The chief executive of Rewiring Australia, Francis Vierboom, said whichever party or politician put forward the most ambitious electrification policy would be “politically rewarded”.Vierboom again made the case for a loan scheme for households, which he said would be “economically efficient, inexpensive to administer and could equitably target the biggest benefits to the households that deserve it most”.“This is the election when consumers should win policies that accelerate the shift to solar, electrification and EVs, slashing hundreds of billions off bills over the next two decades,” he said.Household batteries can help people with solar panels avoidbeing charged for surplus powerthey generate if it would otherwise have to be fed back into the grid.The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Energy (Australia

Yes, this is the second hottest summer on record, but it will be one of the coolest in the 21st century.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailShe said the heat had come despite La Niña-like conditions in the tropical Pacific which have in the past been associated with cooler conditions.Data released by the BoM shows the heat was well-spread around the country, with all regions seeing average daily temperatures in the top six on record.Last summer ranked second for the hottest daytime temperatures, and fourth-warmest for night-time heat.On a state-by-state basis, all mainland states had average temperatures in their 10 highest on record for summer. Western Australia had its hottest summer on record, and also its hottest summer for night-time temperatures.Summer rainfall across the country was only slightly below average, with South Australia and the NT particularly dry.“I don’t think we should need convincing about climate change any more in Australia because we can feel it,” said Ashcroft.“We see it in our plants, our weather observations, in our moods and in the decisions that we make. This heat affects people, but we do have the ingredients to stop it.”The bureau’s long-range forecast covering autumn and released this week, showed that most of Australia should expect typical rainfall levels, but north, east and central Queensland could be drier and it could be wetter in the north-west of the country.For temperatures, there was an increased chance of unusually high daytime and night-time temperatures across the whole of the country.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t.”Dozens of police had gathered at a mobile command unit outside the main gate early on Saturday.Some 12 festivals will offer the service as part of a year-long, $1m government-run pilot.Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said there was a risk to people’s safety at music festivals when there was high-visibility policing, including drug dogs.“If people are going to take drugs, we want them to do so as safely as possible and that is not what a highly visible police presence leads to,” Faehrmann told AAP.Alexandra Ross-Kingdied at a music festival in 2019after consuming three MDMA capsules and multiple alcoholic drinks.A friend told her inquest the 19-year-old took two capsules at the festival gates when she became nervous she might be caught by sniffer dogs.'Never meant to happen': the fear and failure behind NSW's drug deathsRead moreSafety of festival goers was the top priority, Detective Acting Superintendent Glen Broadhead said.“Police will be targeting antisocial behaviour and alcohol-fuelled violence and any behaviour that puts yourself or others at risk will not be tolerated,” he said.“Prohibited drugs are illegal and potentially life-threatening, especially when combined with alcohol.“We urge anyone who feels unwell or needs medical assistance to attend one of the medical tents on site.”Inside the drug checking service, non-government peer workers presented users with the health and safety issues associated with illicit drugs.Up to six people at a time could have their drugs checked, with analysis taking about 10 minutes, followed by further discussion.An amnesty bin was also available.Some results can lead to broader warnings to attendees or feed into intelligence for peer workers and medical staff on the ground, the state’s chief health officer said.Drug checking is available in at least 28 countries, according to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation.Queensland’s new conservative government this week reiterated plans to shut down community drug checking services in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesDrugsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump, for once, had seemed genuinely lost for words. Starmer had at one point put his hand on Trump’s shoulder like a close friend or relative to emphasise their closeness as the UK delegation looked on, stony-faced but amazed.In the immediate, choreographed sense, Trump had given Starmer, who had prepared the ground well by committing to increase UK defence expenditure, everything that he could have wished for – and more.He had praised the PM’s strong negotiating stance on tariffs, lauded the special relationship, past, present and future, and even admired Starmer’s “beautiful accent.” “I would have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent,” Trump said.But some people with knowledge of Trump’s behaviour down the years, and how he veers from one mood andmodus operandito another within hours or even minutes, noted that some very important things had been left worryingly unclear and unresolved. All was not as well as it might on first impressions have appeared to be.There were areas where detail was obviously lacking. One was over Europe and Ukraine’s demands that the US must provide asecurity backstopin the event of any Trump-brokered peace deal. “There was nothing on that. Starmer got nothing,” said one UK source.It was this same glaring absence that would be exposed less than 24 hours later in another meeting in the Oval Office that went the very opposite of smoothly. This time it led to anexplosive rowbetween Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sitting on the same White House chairs where Starmer and Trump had bonded.That the British had immediately patted themselves on the back after their Trump meeting was understandable, a Foreign Office source said. “If Trump is in a ‘good host’ mood, being told everything he wants to hear, then it is inevitable that people will think it went well, but there may have been some optimism bias going on, just because it could have been so much worse.”And so it proved. On Sunday, just three days after having left the White House on such apparently good terms with the US president, Starmer is hosting European leaders in London – the same European leaders who on Friday night wasted no time in sending Zelenskyy strong messages of support after his brutal humiliation at the hands of Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer on apparently good terms with Donald Trump at the White House in Washington.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersAs the on-camera Oval Office meeting went off the rails – after Zelenskyy tried to put his points over security guarantees and Trump told him “you’re gambling with world war three” – Ukrainian ambassador Oksana Markarova buried her head in her hands. Once the media had left, Trump and his team reportedly remained while Zelenskyy and his entourage went to another room.Ukrainian efforts to get the talks back on track went nowhere. The White House cancelled a working lunch, joint press conference and signing of a deal that would give the US greater access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. Zelenskyy was asked to leave.More than 100 reporters then crammed shoulder to shoulder on a driveway outside the West Wing of the White House to watch the Ukrainian president depart in a black SUV. An Australian TV reporter yelled at departing officials: “How do you feel after that Oval Office meeting? Were you brought here for public humiliation?”Among the Europeans who rallied to Zelenskyy’s side were Friedrich Merz, the German CDU leader whose party won the largest vote share in federal elections in February. Heposted online: “We stand with #Ukraine in good and in testing times. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.” On Saturday, Starmer met a bruised Zelenskyy in London and his message was the same.“It is really hard to keep up. I think Keir is finding out just how hard being the bridge between Trump and Europe is going to be,” observed one British minister.Before Sunday’s meeting, which will be attended by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and Denmark among others, and non-EU countries including Canada, Turkey and Ukraine, Starmer put out a statement that leaned towards the Europeans on Ukraine. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Zelenskyy’s spokesperson also said that the Ukrainian president would be meeting the king while in the UK.Starmer said: “Three years on from Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we are at a turning point. Today I will reaffirm my unwavering support for Ukraine and double down on my commitment to provide capacity, training and aid to Ukraine, putting it in the strongest possible position.”In the tumultuous days after Trump won last year’s US election, Ukrainian officials had allowed themselves to hope. They knew Trump was mercurial and deeply unpredictable, but perhaps Trump’s famed deal-making qualities could work to their advantage, they reasoned, three years into a gruelling conflict with Russia.But any lingering hope that Trump might support their country, or even act as a fair-minded broker between Moscow and Kyiv, died before their eyes on Friday. Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House turned into arguably this century’s greatest diplomatic disaster. Ukraine’s president was the victim of what many observers suspect was not just a brutal but also a premeditated mugging, after meekly suggesting that a peace deal with Vladimir Putin had to come with guarantees.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy in London on Saturday.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersIn a joint onslaught, Trump and JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting America. Trump then let it be known he had booted Zelenskyy out of the building. On Saturday, Trump suggested all military assistance to Kyiv would swiftly cease.Many in Ukraine fear there may be worse to come. Ukrainian engineers are scrambling to find an alternative to Starlink, the satellite internet system owned by Trump’s adviser Elon Musk, which plays a crucial role on the battlefield. Without it, frontline units may lose real-time surveillance drone footage. Meanwhile, if the US turns off the flow of intelligence data, Ukraine will struggle to identify and destroy enemy targets, including those deep inside Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zelenskyy countered by pointing out that Putin had expected to seize his country in “three days”. Three years later, Russian troops are still fighting. They are advancing in the eastern Donbas region, village by broken village, but slowly and with enormous losses. Ukrainian forces continue to hold a small piece of enemy territory inside Russia’s western Kursk region.Zelenskyy acknowledged last week that Ukraine cannot win the war without US support. At the same time, the loss of American weapons may not be as critical as some observers have suggested – at least not in the short term. Ukraine now has the biggest army in Europe, with 800,000 capable soldiers. It is the world’s leading producer of drones, which both sides use extensively across a 600-mile frontline.But the daunting reality is that, in just a few weeks, the second Trump presidency has crushed eight decades of certainties about the transatlantic alliance. Today, as EU leaders come to London, capital of the Brexited UK, they are discussing how on earth to adapt to an international order that is changing day by day.“One of the other extraordinary thing about all this,” said a Whitehall source, “is that the UK, after Brexit and all the bad blood involved, really does have a leadership role to play again in Europe.”The most obvious sign of the shifting tectonic plates came when Merz, a staunch transatlanticist, said his “absolute priority” was strengthening Europe as quickly as possible “so that step by step we can really achieve independence from the USA”.Merz’s intervention and subsequent warning that it was “five minutes to midnight for Europe” have raised hopes of a revitalised Franco-German relationship, which has languished under Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who held broadly positive talks with Trump on Monday in the White House, said hours before that meeting that he anticipated “an unprecedented Franco-German agreement” could soon emerge.While Trump’s indifference to Europe was well known, Europeans have been genuinely shocked at the speed at which the alliance is unravelling. Last week, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, had a meeting with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, abruptly cancelled “due to scheduling issues”, raising speculation she had been snubbed for pointed comments directed at Trump. Two days before her arrival in Washington, Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister and noted Russia hawk, had said the Russian narrative was “very strongly represented” in statements coming from the US.Trump’s overtures to Putin and attack on Zelenskyy as a “dictator” have cut deep, especially for the countries of central and eastern Europe that were among the staunchest defenders of transatlantic ties. “What a betrayal,” said one senior diplomat.Another senior European diplomat said the EU was living through ‘an acceleration of historyAnother senior European diplomat said the EU was living through “an acceleration of history” where “the need to live up to our responsibilities is much more pressing”. The task is enormous: ensuring military aid for Ukraine while redesigning Europe’s security architecture and increasing defence spending at a time when budgets are under pressure.The UK and France still hope to persuade Trump to keep the US presence in Europe, while Europe prepares to take much greater responsibility to defend the continent against Russian aggression. But the direction of travel is clear. “We have to be prepared to be on our own,” said the senior diplomat. “The difficulty is that we have to be prepared to do that very quickly. You need to fix the plane while you are in the air.”“Independence from the US” is a phrase few frontline European politicians would have uttered even six months ago. But it is a concept the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking to reduce Europe’s dependencies, whether for defence (the US), raw materials (China) or energy (Russia, until 2022), is having to entertain more as every day passes. She has called for a surge in European defence spending and later this month will publish a defence white paper outlining how the EU can raise funds to meet an estimated €500bn (£412bn) spending uplift the European Commission says is needed over the next decade.On Thursday EU leaders, this time without Starmer, will gather for a special summit on defence and are expected to call for greater coordination to develop air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles, drones and equipment to protect “critical infrastructure”, according to a draft text seen by theObserver.Meanwhile, more than five years after Britain left the EU, a pledge to develop an EU-UK security and foreign policy agreement is seen as one of the most promising outcomes of a summit between Starmer and the heads of the EU institutions in May. Difficult choices lie ahead, however: some European diplomats say that if the UK wants to take part in any of the EU’s nascent common defence spending programmes, it will have to sign up to “buy European”, meaning eschewing US-made weapons.Another EU source told theObserverthat two huge issues would need to be addressed at meetings the Europeans will hold during the coming weeks. One was whether they really are prepared to stand with Ukraine and continue taking on Russia if the US pulls away. The second was how they keep Nato intact and strong if the US is playing a lesser role. “It really is a major moment in history,” said the source.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverDonald TrumpUkraine (World news)EuropeUkraine (Weather)newsShareReuse this content"

He had no fever and no signs of new infection, was feeding himself and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said.The 88-year-old pope had a good response in his blood gas levels even during the “long periods” he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen. But his prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger.“The Holy Father is always vigilant” and aware of what was going on around him, the statement said, adding that he received the Eucharist and spent time in prayer.The comparatively positive update came after Francis suffered a setback on Friday in his two-week battle against pneumonia.Francis had a coughing fit in which he also inhaled vomit. Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs. Doctors said episode resulted in a “sudden worsening of the respiratory picture”.The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the manoeuvres to help him recover.The fact that Francis on Saturday was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.TheVaticansaid the episode was different from the prolonged respiratory crisis on 22 February that was said to have caused Francis discomfort. Doctors not involved in Francis’s care said it was particularly alarming given his existing lung disease and fragility.Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can go back to using oxygen alone. Friday’s statement said Francis showed a “good response” to the gas exchange using the mechanical ventilation.Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in “critical condition”, which has been absent from their statements for four days now. But they said he was not out of danger, given the complexity of his case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some might agonise about whether Zelenskyy could have played things differently. It’s the wrong question. The point is that we can’t carry on being so dependent on every meeting at the White House. Until we start taking charge of our future, we will always be one heart palpitation away from dreading doomsday.Here are the steps to solve that.First:Europehas to show a united front. Britain can have its own side channels – there are some benefits of avoiding the coming EU-US trade war – but the most “special” relationship we have now is the one with our nearest neighbours.Second: If you want to be taken seriously, bring serious money. There are, for example, $300bn worth offrozen Russian assetssitting in Euroclear in Brussels. Use these to negotiate with America and other providers of weapons about actual deals, rather than relying on maddening meetings predicated on mood swings to hope for rhetorical ones.But we also have to be clear what we need from America. For the next few years, Europe is still dependent on the US for artillery supplies and for tech updates to Patriot missiles and other essentials.Nothing should be off the books: digital disruption, sabotage, the whole gamut of secret service tricksThird: Recognise that the only real “security guarantees” lie in having armed forces that can defend you. So build a real European defence industry. That sounds terribly grandiose – but it’s possible.Start thinking like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who took moribund American arms production in the 1930s and built it up to out-compete Germany’s. Don’t fall for any pauses in the fighting that Putin might sell Trump. Russia is continuing its military build-up all the time, preparing for many decades of conflicts. We are fortunate there is already one serious army in Europe – Ukraine’s.Fourth: Disrupt Russia’s military supply chains. We usually think about this in terms of sanctions, but that’s just one tool. Nothing should be off the books: digital disruption, sabotage, the whole gamut of secret service tricks.Fifth: Learn how to fight hybrid and information wars. We already know that Russia is waging relentless campaigns of covert disinformation and overt propaganda, cyber attacks, corruption and espionage across Europe. It’s about to get much worse. All the assets Russia has been using to subvert America will now be repurposed to attack Europe, and especially the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we will need a sword too. Here we can learn from countries like Moldova who are already developing the hard craft of fighting non-democratic enemies with democratic tools.But it’s also something the British excelled at in the past: the second world war Political Warfare Executive united the wittiest minds from the arts with spies and soldiers to create a communications force that was far more effective than the Nazis’.Once we show we have the will, and the wallet, to take these steps, then we can negotiate differently. Then we can speak of “mutual interests” as equals, not supplicants.But most importantly, we will no longer feel as if our destiny is decided by others. The propaganda campaign for Brexit was sold on the idea of “taking back control”. It turned out to be an empty promise. But the feelings it tapped into were real enough. In a chaotic world, people feel vulnerable. Now we have the chance to do it properly.Explore more on these topicsEuropeThe ObserverUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpJD VanceVladimir PutinDefence policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

We had been in one of France’s most notorious estates for several hours, trying to understand life on the frontline of the country’s spiralling drug war.Seeing three people he did not know and a camera, he decided enough was enough. “You, where do you live?” he said, rushing towards us from the foot of a tower block where he had parked his scooter. “Don’t talk back to me, I’ll break your head in. Get out of here.”It was a chastening exit, but one that showed us the violence we had only seen signs of was all too real.I had been given a rare chance to visit by Siam Spencer, a freelance journalist who until recently lived here, in Les Moulins estate on the edge of sun-kissed, touristy Nice.When she got a job in the city in 2023, Spencer asked a charity to house her, because coming from a deprived family she had no guarantor. What she did not know was the flat it provided was in an estate that had been a byword for drug violence for decades. “I looked it up on the internet,” she said. “But honestly, I thought, there would be three gunshots per month. It’s still Nice. It’s a small estate, so I didn’t mind.”Instead, as well as rats, cockroaches, bedbugs and squatters who once broke down her door, she had to contend with the sound of Kalashnikovs outside her window. “In the first three weeks things got really hot,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe perennial blue skies of Nice, which have inspired painters from Matisse to Chagall, are in stark contrast to the grittiness of Les Moulins estate.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesOn one side, Nice is the pearl of the French Riviera, a moneyed Mediterranean haven famous for the perennial blue skies that have inspired painters from Matisse to Chagall. The other side is Les Moulins. The estate of roughly 12,000 residents was built in the 1960s to house those returning from Algeria’s war of independence from France. It sits beside the beach and the airport. But few here do much sunbathing and even fewer fly out.Living inside for eight months, Spencer discovered she looked out on to the most prolific drug dealing point on the Riviera, where up to €20,000 changes hands every day. She has written a book about the experience,La Laverie(The Launderette), named after the building outside which dealers worked. The launderette was knocked down last year, but the dealers remain. As we entered the estate in the early afternoon, they sat over its common areas, smoking joints, playing music and scanning for customers. Men drinking coffee ignored them, used to the sight.View image in fullscreenSiam Spencer has written a book about her time living on the estate.Photograph: Richard Assheton/The Observer“It’s packed with dealers. Look around you,” said Nourrédine Debbari, who was born on the estate and runs a charity supporting residents. She said the estate had five main dealing points, shared between two or three rival gang networks. Together they make about €1.5m a month, he said. “Everyone in the neighbourhood is affected by drug trafficking. They live with it. There’s no choice.”The terrorised majority have got used to periodic killings as gangs settle scores and mark their territory. The estate has been a designated “priority security zone” for French authorities since 2013, while the then prime minister Jean Castex visited in 2020 after a spate of shootings.But the threat is becoming scarier. Last July, seven members of one family including three children were burned to death in their flat in Les Moulins. Residents said the father was a drug dealer who was in prison, and rivals targeted his family to settle a score. Three of the arrested suspects were from the Paris region.locator mapAcross France, sophisticated international drug gangs are spreading out from Paris and the crime hotspot of Marseille to towns and smaller ­cities. Armed with guns flooding into the country through Marseille, and mimicking the extreme violence of their counterparts in South America, they make billions of euros every year in sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrest in Romania last week of Mohamed Amra, France’s public enemy number one, known as “The Fly”, underscored the strength of the gangs: he escaped from a police van in northern France last year when accomplices ambushed it.The French Riviera is an obvious target for business, being close to Marseille and famed for its wealth and hedonism. “Cocaine use is not reserved for party circles,” Damien Martinelli, the public prosecutor of Nice, told French media in January. “It’s not reserved for executives and upper-level professionals. It’s everyone.”The Riviera has never seen such quantities of drugs and weapons washing around, customs officers and police say. Nearly 350kg of cocaine were seized in the local department last year, a record. That is probably a fraction of the amount in circulation.Last week in Marseille, the trial began of an alleged drug ring of 22 people with links to the Italian mafia and stretching across the Mediterranean. Its alleged kingpin, named by police as Patrick V, stayed in luxury hotels in Thailand, Greece and Brazil as well as the Côte d’Azur, according to court papers. He spent an estimated €26,000 renting luxury cars from an agency in Cannes, while his wife gambled thousands in casinos around the Riviera.Some drugs arrive in cars and speedboats from Italy, Spain and Morocco, via what are known in France as “go fasts”. “We are seeing that traffickers are taking more and more financial risks, with vehicles transporting larger quantities than before,” Éric Antonetti, head of the interdepartmental service of the region’s judicial police, said recently.Most of the drugs go through the port of Marseille, a Nice police source, who did not want to give his name out of fear of the gangs, told theObserver. The cartels have deep connections. “These are families who know each other because they have villas in Tunisia or elsewhere,” he said. “And then they implant themselves everywhere. That is to say, links are made between Marseille, Toulon and Nice.”At the moment Marseille’s gangs appear to be taking over from local groups. During our visit to Les Moulins, we were told that two Mercedes cars and two Yamaha TMax scooters we saw were DZ Mafia, France’s most powerful drug gang, from Marseille, arriving in the estate to take over its business. “I’m afraid things are going to heat up a little,” Debbari said. “It will heat up for a day or two. That’s all. Once they get the [dealing] network, it’s over [for their lower-level Nice rivals].”Kingpins such as these often operate from prison, directing teams of dealers down to street level. The lowest in the pyramid are known aschoufs, Arabic for lookouts.Debbari said in Les Moulins they used to earn about €30 a day. Now it is 80 or 100. At one dealing point in particular, the dealers looked younger than teenagers.Rudy Manna, spokesman for the police syndicate National Police Alliance, said gangs had taken to recruiting illegal child migrants for these roles. “It is meat. They know that it is going to be an absolutely horrible job, that there will be acts of torture or barbarism,” he said.View image in fullscreenAbdelhakim Madi grew up in Les Moulins and founded Partage Ton Talent, a charity for young people.Photograph: Richard Assheton/The ObserverEven for children growing up in estates such as this, the temptation can be too strong to resist. Spencer said: “You have a deep anger and your parents don’t make money, and you’re fed up, and you live in Nice, where you have the Negresco, the biggest five-star hotel in France, or at least one of the most expensive, 15 minutes away.”Abdelhakim Madi, 24, knows what it is like. He grew up in Les Moulins, dreaming of becoming a comedian. He has become a celebrity among the estate’s young people after founding a charity six years ago that does everything from giving sports and drama lessons to helping match them to jobs.Partage Ton Talent [Share Your Talent] has touched more than 600 young people so far, and has 50 volunteers. In his brightly painted, newly renovated centre, where teenagers enjoyed the tranquility of a safe place, he said: “It’s a fight to have hope for this society, because it scares me. I only see people divided, divided. I don’t have that spirit, I don’t.”Robert Songhor, from Association Adam, another estate charity, takes children on trips to the beach and mountains. “They are going to the snow next week,” he said. “Some of them have already been. It’s about showing them you are not ‘a youth from the estate’. You are a citizen of Nice.”Explore more on these topicsFranceThe ObserverEuropeDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

The negotiators left Cairo on Friday night, and there was no sign of them reconvening late on Saturday.Israeli negotiators came to Cairo with a proposal to extend the first phase by another six weeks, but Hamas said it rejected that “formulation”.While the first phase chiefly involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, an increase in aid deliveries and a retreat of Israeli troops from some positions, the second phase requires a complete Israeli withdrawal and a more enduring cessation of hostilities.The withdrawal would first involve a pullback from thePhiladelphi corridoralong Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called control of the buffer zone a strategic necessity but agreed in January to complete the withdrawal from Philadelphi by the 50th day of the ceasefire agreement, 9 March.Such a retreat could however trigger the collapse of his rightwing coalition which would in turn force new elections, in which Netanyahu’s political future would be uncertain.Israeli political analysts have suggested that Netanyahu agreed to the ceasefire under pressure from Donald Trump, confident that the agreement would never reach a second phase. Trump’s Middle East special envoy,Steve Witkoff, has however insisted that a second phase of the ceasefire deal should be implemented, to ensure the release of theremaining 59 hostages, only 25 of whom are thought to be still alive. Most Israelis also want the government to make a priority of freeing the hostages, but that position is opposed by the Israeli far right, without whom the coalition could not stay in power. The rightist parties argue Israel’s priority should be the destruction of Hamas.In the truce agreement in January there is provision for the ceasefire to hold even if the first phase ends without agreement on a second, as long as good faith negotiations are continuing. Earlier last week,Witkoff said he would returnto the region on Sunday if the talks went well. It was unclear on Saturday whether he still intended to make the trip.There remains no agreement on who should run Gaza once an enduring end to the war can be agreed. Trump caused consternation and bewilderment early in February with the shock suggestion that theUS should “own” Gaza, which would be somehow emptied of its more than two million Palestinian inhabitants to make way for a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, Israeli military officers presented UN officials with a plan by which Israelwould tighten its controlover the administration of aid supplies to Gaza, through logistical hubs in areas under military control.The states of the Arab League are due to meet on Tuesday to discuss anEgyptian-designed alternative planinvolving a phased three- to five-year reconstruction plan, beginning with the creation of temporary camps for Gazans to live while their home districts are rebuilt.One of the key issues in contention in the “day-after” plans for Gaza, is who should be in control. Europe and the previous US administration backed an administration by a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority (PA), which currently runs part of the West Bank. But Netanyahu has insisted the PA should have no part in the governance of Gaza, and the body has little credibility among Palestinians.“The Palestinian Authority is neither willing nor able to govern Gaza in the near future. Israeli occupation is neither possible nor desirable, and a constant state of chaos is both a security threat to Israel and an ongoing humanitarian disaster for Gaza,” Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, arguedin a column in theHaaretznewspaper.He suggested Cairo be given the job.“Egypt will take responsibility for the management of the Gaza Strip for eight years, which could be extended to 15 years,” Lapid wrote. “Gaza would be under temporary Egyptian control. During this period, Gaza would be rebuilt and the long-term conditions for independent government would be created.”Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelEgyptTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas’s attack, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.Hamas, for its part, has pushed hard for phase two to begin, after it suffered staggering losses in the devastating war.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Friday that the Israel-Hamas ceasefire “must hold”.“The coming days are critical. The parties must spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal,” Guterres said in New York.The truce enabled more aid to flow into the Gaza Strip, where more than 69% of buildings were damaged or destroyed, almost the entire population was displaced, and widespread hunger occurred because of the war, according to the UN.In Gaza and throughout much of the Muslim world, Saturday also marked the first day of the month of Ramadan, during which the faithful observe a dawn-to-dusk fast.Among the rubble of Gaza’s war-wrecked neighbourhoods, traditional Ramadan lanterns hung and people performed nightly prayers on the eve of the holy month.“Ramadan has come this year, and we are on the streets with no shelter, no work, no money, nothing,” said Ali Rajih, a resident of the hard-hit Jabaliya camp in north Gaza. “My eight children and I are homeless, we’re living on the streets of Jabaliya camp, with nothing but God’s mercy.”The Gaza war began with Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.The Israeli retaliation has killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures the UN has deemed reliable.Although the truce has in effect held, there have been a number of Israeli strikes, including on Friday when the military said it targeted two “suspects” approaching troops in southern Gaza. A hospital in Khan Younis said it had received the body of one person killed in a strike.In return for the release of the captives held in Gaza, Israel released nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Gaza militants also released five Thai hostages outside the truce deal’s terms.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

Two cameras recorded the circumstances of one such deathJulian BorgerandSufian Tahain Hebron andHarrison TaylorSat 1 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTShareThe last time Nassar al-Hammouni talked to his son, Ayman, it was by telephone and the 12-year-old was overflowing with plans for the coming weekend, and for the rest of his life. He had joined a local football team and planned to register at a karate club that weekend. When he grew up, he told Nassar, he was going to become a doctor, or better still an engineer to help his father in the construction job that took him away from their home in Hebron every week.None of that – the football, the karate or his imagined future career – will happen now. Last Friday, two days after the call to his father, Ayman was killed, shot by Israeli fire, video footage seen by the Guardian suggests.The killing of children on theWest Bankis no longer out of the ordinary, particularly since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stepped up operations in the occupied territory after the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023 and the beginning of the Gaza war. The intensity has increased since the January ceasefire in the strip.So far this year about two children a week have been killed, slightly over the average rate for 2024 when 93 children were killed. Human rights workers fear the numbers may continue to increase as the IDF brings Gaza techniques to the West Bank, ejecting tens of thousands of people from their homes, flattening districts andloosening furtherthe “rules of engagement” covering when a soldier is permitted to open fire.They are calling it “Gazafication” and it is becoming the new normal. But what sets Ayman al-Hammouni’s case apart is the clarity of the evidence, illustrated by footage from two security cameras, that tells the story of the child’s last moments.Ayman and his 10-year-old brother, Aysar, had gone with their mother, Anwar, to visit their grandfather and their uncles who lived in another part of Hebron, Jabal Jawhar. The trip across town took an hour in Hebron’s grinding traffic and involved crossing from Palestinian-controlled Hebron to an area run by the IDF, part of the complex patchwork of territorial division imposed on the West Bank.Jabal Jawhar is not far from the Tomb of the Patriarchs, where Abraham and his biblical family are supposedly buried, a site sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. On Friday nights before Jewish settlers come to pray there, the IDF has been conducting aggressive patrols in the surrounding Palestinian districts. The army, increasingly staffed and led by Israelis from thenational religious right, is widely perceived on the West Bank to be acting as the armed wing of the settler movement.At about 6.30pm, Ayman had just run an errand to his grandfather’s flat and returned to his uncle Tariq’s house when there was a commotion on the main road, 60 metres away down a sloping paved alleyway.A shot was heard and people began to run, and a young man from the neighbourhood whose uncle lived next door drove up the alley in a white car, its windscreen pierced by a bullet. He parked outside Tariq’s house and got out, examining a wound where a fragment of glass had nicked his shoulder.The scene was recorded by two security cameras, one at the corner of Tariq’s courtyard pointing down the alley, and the other perched outside the top-floor flat of Ayman’s grandfather, Mohammad Bader al-Ajlouni, looking over the cars in front of Tariq’s house and across the alley, at 90 degrees to the other camera angle.Both sets of footage show Ayman and two of his cousins coming out of Tariq’s house along with another of his uncles, Nadeem al-Ajlouni, who gives the injured man a tissue for the cut in his shoulder. Ayman looks on, a slight figure leaning on the back of the white car, a brown bag slung around his shoulder.Then there is more commotion from the alleyway and another shot, sending the small knot of people scurrying for cover, including Ayman and his cousins. Ayman runs inside the gate of Tariq’s house and out of view of the cameras, and then another shot rings out from down the alleyway. This was the bullet that is believed to have hit Ayman. The footage does not prove beyond question who fired it, but it does make clear it came from the direction of Israeli soldiers who were advancing on the house and who arrived at the scene seconds later.In the confusion, it seems to take a few seconds before Ayman is noticed. It was Nadeem, his young uncle, who saw him first. “He was lying on the steps of the house, just inside the gate. I went to pick him up but I could tell he was already gone,” Nadeem said.Then the cameras show another surge of panic and the silhouettes of three soldiers advancing up the alley, guns pointed, one with a bright torch shining along the barrel. The injured neighbour, Ayman’s cousin, and his little brother Aysar, who by now had come down from his grandfather’s flat, all scramble away between the parked cars. Nadeem runs out of Tariq’s front gate carrying Ayman but drops his jacket and then Ayman in his desperation to get away.The boy’s body is left lying on the ground between a car and Tariq’s garden wall as the soldiers reach the house. They look around for a few seconds and then spot the body, and at that point they turn around and calmly walk away, the screams of Ayman’s mother at their backs after she stumbles on the body of her son.Nadeem scoops Ayman’s limp body up once more and he and Tariq head off down the alley in the footsteps of the retreating soldiers, in the direction of a nearby hospital.It was already too late. The family have yet to receive the medical report but an advocacy group, Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), drawing on its contacts in the Hebron hospital where Ayman was taken, said the bullet entered his back and lodged in his lungs.Nassar and Nadeem also said Ayman was shot in the back, while Mohammad, the grandfather, said the wound was to the upper abdomen.Nassar got the call in Ramallah, where he works in a construction and a security job for the Palestinian Authority. First a relative told him Ayman had been shot, but Nassar demanded the truth and by the time he was on the road he already knew his son was dead.A friend drove him through the night, navigating the army checkpoints along the way. At one spot north of Bethlehem, known as the “container checkpoint”, Nassar was told to get out of the car with a gun pointed at him.The bereaved father said that on hearing of what had happened in Hebron, an Arabic-speaking soldier began to taunt him, claiming to have been the one who shot Ayman, telling Nassar: “Convince me that I shot him for nothing.“We hope that you will follow your son,” he recalled the soldier adding.The IDF did not respond to questions about Ayman’s death. In some previous cases, under media pressure an investigation is announced, although it rarely results in substantive action. In 2019 a soldier was sentenced to one month of community service for shooting dead a 14-year-old boy in Gaza. But even such trivial accountability is vanishingly rare.An Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din, hascalculated the probabilityof an Israeli soldier facing prosecution for killing Palestinians to be just 0.4% – one prosecution in 219 fatalities brought to the military’s attention.On Wednesday, Aysar went back to school for the first time since the shooting, but he could not face seeing his older brother’s classroom across the corridor from his own. Nassar asked the teacher if he could be moved.Ayman was a premature baby and was in a hospital incubator for more than a month, Nassar recalled. But being a child is not much of a protection on the West Bank.“It is about rage and revenge,” Nassar said. “They don’t care if it’s a child, or a woman, or an old person. No one’s safe any more.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Charli xcx wins five Brits for zeitgeist-conquering albumDance-pop artist picks up album and artist of the year prizes, while Ezra Collective see off big names to become first jazz artists to win British groupThe Brit awards – in picturesThe full list of winnersBen Beaumont-ThomasSat 1 Mar 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 18.57 ESTShareCharli xcx has won fiveBrit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat.At the ceremony in London’s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year.The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: “Brat summer”, plus various things being declared “brat”. It was nebulously defined – Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat – but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool.Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli’s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys.She thanked some of her dance music heroes – resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards – as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: “Not all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.” On winning album of the year, she said: “I’ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven’t made any sacrifices.” She told her fellow artists: “You don’t need to compromise your vision.”The chief architect of Brat’s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards’ eligibility period, entitled Britpop.Charli – real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 – first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year:Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&B act for the second year in a row.Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK’s best live acts.Bassist Georgia Davies said they “wouldn’t be a band without the UK’s incredible independent venues – they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying”. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to “keep going, because that’s the best kind of art there is”.View image in fullscreenJoe Armon-Jones, Ife Ogunjobi, Femi Koleoso, James Mollison and TJ Koleoso of Ezra Collective.Photograph: John Phillips/Getty ImagesThe Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon.Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London’s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London’s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They’re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize.After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: “So many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we’re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone – because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.”In the genre categories – which were voted for by the public –Sam Fenderpicked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022.Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as “a man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist”, Fender also performed his new album’s title track.View image in fullscreenJade performing Angel of My Dreams.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageFormerLittle Mixmember Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories.He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, butStormzywas something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country’s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can’t Rush Greatness isn’t eligible until next year’s Brits).As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, “I don’t entirely think this award should be fan-voted … sometimes I think it doesn’t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.”The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that theoutcry at Stormzy’s recent McDonald’s campaigndid not affect his votes.This year’s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You.Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: “If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?”“We have to protect the foundations that make it,” he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: “Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments … please stick with artists past a viral hit.”It was a sentiment shared byChappell Roan, who called for artists to “not be pressured into making music based off what is trending” as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to “trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sinéad O’Connor.”Irish rockersFontaines DCpicked up international group, their second win in that category.View image in fullscreenSabrina Carpenter performing at the Brit awards.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockIntroduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown,Sabrina Carpenterwas given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: “In a primarily tea-drinking country, you’ve streamed the shit out of Espresso … cheerio!”Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, andEzra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith.Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (“the public school Nickelback”) and even the previous day’s “cringe” Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade’s live performance, saying: “I really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme”, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor – all of it casting the Brits as the award season’s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an “incredibly kind soul”.Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.Brit awards 2025: full list of winnersAlbum of the year:Charli xcx– BratArtist of the year: Charli xcxBritish group: Ezra CollectiveBest new artist: The Last Dinner PartySong of the year: Charli xcx – Guess (ft Billie Eilish)International artist: Chappell RoanInternational group: Fontaines DCInternational song: Chappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!Alternative/rock act: Sam FenderHip-hop/grime/rap act: StormzyDance act: Charli xcxPop act: JadeR&B act: RayeProducer of the year: AG CookSongwriter of the year: Charli xcxGlobal success: Sabrina CarpenterRising star: Myles SmithExplore more on these topicsBrit awardsCharli xcxPop and rockAwards and prizesRayeThe Last Dinner PartyEzra CollectivenewsShareReuse this content"

Having sold out its three-month run at the 180-seat London venue before first night, it is set to move to the Garrick theatre. But according to its original creatorMel Brooks, the musical might never have happened at all.The 98-year-old Brooks has told the Guardian he was initially reluctant to adapt his 1967 movie for the stage. Only through the persistence of a producer did he relent.“David Geffen called me every day. I said, ‘David, it’s a perfectly good little movie. I won the Academy Award for my screenplay. It’s been honoured and saluted enough. There’s no reason to make it a musical.’ Then the next day, he called me again. He never stopped calling me. And finally, I said, ‘Well, he’s not a dumb guy, so maybe there is something.’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan’ … Mel Brooks.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Peabody awardsOpeningon Broadway in 2001, The Producers went on to win 12 Tonys. The New York Times called it a “sublimely ridiculous spectacle” – a sentiment echoed by UK criticsin 2004and again when director Patrick Marber staged the first major London revivallast year.“Marber is a terrific director and is perfect for it,” said Brooks, who co-wrote the show with the late Thomas Meehan. Brooks also wrote the score, featuring Springtime for Hitler.“Tom was sweet as sugar and very proper as opposed to me who was very improper. In jokes and language, I was the bad boy. I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan – I’m spilling the beans!”The production will transfer to the Garrick theatre, where the author’s horror spoof, Young Frankenstein, picked upfive-star reviewsin 2017. Staying with the show are key cast members Marc Antolin, Trevor Ashley, Raj Ghatak, Andy Nyman, Harry Morrison and Joanna Woodward.“I’m very proud of that production at the Chocolate Factory and I’m so happy we’re going back to the Garrick,” said Brooks.In Marber’s production, Nyman plays Max Bialystock, a failing impresario who sets out to stage a Broadway flop. He and his accountant, Leopold Bloom (Antolin), hire a neo-Nazi playwright, an incompetent director and a useless lead actor in the hope of closing the show and keeping their investors’ money. They assume no audience would tolerate a sympathetic paean to Hitler and would have it shut down, clearing the way for them to make their fortune.View image in fullscreenDianne Pilkington, centre, in Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks at the Garrick theatre, London, in 2017Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBrooks, who was born in 1926 and served as a combat engineer in the second world war (“I mostly ducked”), has seen nearly a century’s worth of authoritarian rulers come and go. “I like the ‘come and go’ – especially the go,” he joked.Now he lives in a country where Nazi salutes appear to have been given at large political rallies. “It’s something we hope will pass and go its way, just like Hitler and his people did go their way.”He said he believes laughter is a powerful weapon against tyranny. “They’re gifted with a kind of flagrant rhetoric, but once you make fun of them and you drag them down with comedy, you win. When you can get people to laugh at them, you win.”It is an attitude shaped by his experience as a young man performing comedy routines at Jewish resorts in the Catskill mountains. “We who have worked in the borscht belt know that comedy is the answer. It’s magical, it pays the rent and also we learn stealing because we steal jokes from each other – recklessly, not even thinking about it.”Public booking for The Producers opens on 5 March.

TheSunday Timesclaimed Rachel Reeves would divert money earmarked for green investment in the UK to the defence industry. It would be the first time that money from frozen Russian assets would contribute towards military spending.The irate exchanges between Trump and Vance, on the US side, and Zelenskyy, which led to the Ukrainian president being told to leave the White House before any formal talks took place, led to fears among European and other world leaders of irreparable damage to the western alliance, and to the hopes of peace in Ukraine’s war withRussia. At today’s defence summit, which demonstrates the increasingly central role being played by the UK in Europe’s defence and security, Starmer will be clear that Europe must stand united against President Putin.Starmer said last night: “Three years on from Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we are at a turning point. Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security and secure our collective future.”View image in fullscreenThe heated exchange between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office on Friday.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersYesterday, as Zelenskyy touched down in the UK on his way back from the US, he appeared intent on trying to repair the damage caused by the diplomatic showdown in the Oval Office. He posted on social media that he was “thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and the American people”, adding that Trump’s support was “crucial”.On Friday evening, Trump and Vance had accused him of not being grateful to the US for the huge sums they had spent on helping Ukraine to defend itself following the Russian invasion in 2022.In stark contrast to the White House meeting, Zelenskyy arrived at Downing Street to be met with cheers from crowds standing on Whitehall.And in a clear sign that Starmer wanted to demonstrate his ­sympathy for Zelenskyy, the prime minister took the unusual step of walking along the pavement to greet him. The two men then embraced before the prime minister gestured towards the crowds.Inside No 10, Starmer told his guest that the cheering outside was “the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine”.Starmer said he had “absolute determination … to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace – a lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine, so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom”.Zelenskyy replied: “We count on your support, and we’re really happy that we have such partners and such friends.”Among the key issues to be discussed at today’s defence summit will be the extent to which Europe can beef up its military support for Ukraine, and maintain the strength of Nato if the US is seen to be reducing its involvement in European defence.The leaders will also discuss how to increase economic pressure on Russia in order to hit Putin’s military machine. Many western experts say that the weakness of the Russian economy means that it has, at most, a year of being able to sustain its operations on the borders of Ukraine.King Charles met Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s surprise visit to the UK in February 2023, when the king told him: “We’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.”Zelenskyy also used his address to parliament during that visit to thank the UK for its steadfast support, finishing by saying: “God bless Great Britain and long live the king.”View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meets King Charles at Buckingham Palace during a visit to the UK in 2023.Photograph: EyePress News/REX/ShutterstockOn Friday, in their curtailed meeting, Trump had claimed Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” as he became increasingly angry with what he thought was Zelenskyy’s resistance to his plans for peace with Russia. The meeting ended with a proposed deal on exchanging Ukrainian mineral rights for American arms being put on ice.After Starmer’s meeting with Zelenskyy, which lasted an hour, the prime minister escorted the Ukrainian president to the motorcade outside No 10 and waited to wave him off – in contrast to his lonely departure from the White House 24 hours earlier.With European leaders believing the rift with the US over issues from security to trade could present an existential threat to the bloc, they will meet on Thursday, aiming to reinsert themselves into the US-led peace efforts on Ukraine. But they will insist that Ukraine be at the heart of any talks, something that the Trump administration has remained equivocal about.“There can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine,” states the draft summit text seen by theObserver. “There can be no negotiations that affect European security without Europe’s involvement. Ukraine and Europe’s security are united.”Summing up the sense of crisis, one EU diplomat said: “If this is not a wake-up call, then I don’t know what is. It is extremely important that the EU now moves from talking the talk, to also walking the walk in a much more focused and diligent way.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverKeir StarmerRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyKing Charles IIIDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Many are “around cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Sunderland and Newcastle – as well other post-industrial regions like the West Midlands (including Birmingham)”, it says.A briefing document to government ministers, based on the report’s findings and seen by The Observer, says that even since the general election last summer there is evidence that Reform has deepened its support in these most deprived areas.The note, written ahead of the report’s publication on Wednesday, says: “The number of highly disadvantaged neighbourhoods based in seats demonstrating high support for Reform (30%-40% vote share) has increased significantly since the election, from just 4.8% of these neighbourhoods to 26.2%. The number of those based in ‘Reform stronghold’ areas (those polling above 40%) has also risen from 1.4% to 4.8%. All existing Reform MPs have some of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in their seats.”Polling carried out for the commission, which will also be published on Wednesday, shows support for the Reform party is driven by voter concerns about issues such as antisocial behaviour, crime and litter on the streets.View image in fullscreenHilary Armstrong says Reform has deepened its support in deprived areas since Labour took office.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The ObserverThe commission identified the UK’s areas most in need by analysing local attitudes to crime, health, energy, jobs and educational achievement, alongside publicly available data. As part of the in-depth investigation it used that data to compile an index of areas that score poorly when measured against the government’s five “missions”.The accompanying briefing adds: “Constituencies containing neighbourhoods that are furthest behind on the government’s missions tend to be those that are demonstrating greater support for Reform.”Starmer’s government set out the missions ahead of July’s general election to focus minds on Labour’s policy offering. The missions promised to deliver safer streets, economic growth, green energy, better education and NHS reform.The report argues that a “trickledown” approach – the idea that the most in need will benefit over time from a policy delivered nationally rather than in a more targeted way – is destined to fail.The polling, carried out by Public First, found that “highest need” neighbourhoods were more concerned about litter (53%), antisocial behaviour (49%) and illegal drugs (48%) than “lowest need” neighbourhoods.The report will urge ministers to “transform places street by street, estate by estate” through public investment in “social infrastructure” and by supporting economic development. With focusing support on areas most in need it risks “wasting billions of pounds in higher public spending while failing to transform the places that need it most”.ICON was launched in September 2024 to address the challenges faced in England’s most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.The government is understood to be looking closely at its work and ministers are meeting regularly with the commission. Others on the commission include the mayor of the North East, Kim McGuinness, and former government advisor Dr David Halpern.Last month YouGov published the first national opinion poll to suggest thatReform UKhad overtaken Labour, placing it on 25%, one point ahead of Labour and four ahead of the Conservatives.Explore more on these topicsPovertyThe ObserverLabourReform UKNigel FarageKeir StarmerCommunitiesOpinion pollsnewsShareReuse this content"

They were told they had to buy their portfolio photographs from the studio in order to join an agency and become a model.Some of them used credit deals arranged by the fraudsters, or expensive payday loans to make the upfront payment.In return, the victims got poor quality digital photographs that stood no real chance of landing them professional jobs and most did not get paid modelling work.Foster bought high-end watches and cars with his share of the proceeds, while many victims said they had been left financially and emotionally devastated and felt humiliated and betrayed.The sham agencies, which paid no tax, existed for short periods before being dissolved and repeatedly rebranded.Money from the scam was laundered through UK bank accounts before being transferred to Spain or carried in cash on commercial flights by co-conspirators, the NTS said.North Yorkshire councillor Greg White said: “Foster and his fellow scammers cruelly exploited young hopefuls trying to break into one of the most competitive industries. In some cases, parents borrowed money or sacrificed savings, believing they were investing in their children’s futures.“I urge anyone searching online for modelling opportunities to remember that legitimate agencies don’t ask for money upfront, it’s often only scam agencies who push expensive photoshoots as a prerequisite to getting work.”Foster’s associates were also convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced. Michael Foster, 27, of Liverpool, was jailed for three and a half years, while Jamie Peters, 52, of Warrington, received a suspended 24-month prison sentence.View image in fullscreenLeft to right top row: Michael Foster, Jamie Peters, Lisa Foster, Emily Newall.

Paul Fleury, 57, of Swinton, Manchester, received an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.Meanwhile, Aslihan Foster, 39, of Coventry, received a suspended 18-month prison sentence, and Paul Evans, 39, of no known address, got a three-and-a-half year suspended prison sentence after they were both convicted of offences related to money laundering.Jenny Kent, of City of York council, said: “Mr Foster and his associates made millions by exploiting the hopes of young people, leaving a trail of broken dreams and financial hardship.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeSoap operaTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

She had reportedly been on her way home from a show and was the only person who died in the crash.Her daughter Diamond Stonewroteonline: “My mommy is gone.”Stone has been a founding member of groundbreaking female hip-hop trio the Sequence in the late 70s at the age of 16. They scored a hit with Funk You Up, a song that was later sampled by Dr Dre for his single Keep Their Heads Ringin and Bruno Mars in Uptown Funk.“I think that being the first female rap group to actually come out and have an authentic original rap record is an accomplishment that no one else has been able to top,” shesaidin 2023.After the group disbanded in the mid-80s, Stone worked as a vocalist for Vertical Hold and then Devox before she later provided songwriting credits to D’Angelo for his first two studio albums. She was also a backing vocalist for the singer on tour before providing vocals for Lenny Kravitz on his album 5 in 1998.In 1999, Stone released her first solo album, Black Diamond, which contained the hits No More Rain (In This Cloud) and Life Story. She went on to record the theme to the hit sitcom Girlfriends in 2000 and released her second album, MahoganySoul, the following year.That album featured the hit Wish I Didn’t Miss You, which became her biggest international success.Her third album, Stone Love, featured the song I Wanna Thank Ya with Snoop Dogg, which became a big hit in Europe. The video also featured a young Idris Elba.Stone went on to record a further seven albums, the most recent of which was 2023’s Love Language, which featured Musiq Soulchild and Stone’s son Swayvo Twain.She was nominated for three Grammys in her career and also wrote songs for Erykah Badu and Raphael Saadiq. “There is a deep sad feeling that as a songwriter – something such a gift – you never get acknowledged for it,” shesaidin 2011. “People think that’s how I eat because I make records but I make far more money as songwriter than from being a singer.”Stone also worked as an actor, with roles in big screen comedies like The Hot Chick and The Fighting Temptations and on stage in Chicago playing Big Mama Morton.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BnewsShareReuse this content"

He appeared to interpret Zelenskyy’s remarks to him as an insult to the US.But the fury with which Vance castigated Zelenskyy for being ungrateful appears to have been the moment when Vance and his team’s personal views about the Ukraine conflict came to the fore.On Thursday, when the prospect of completing the minerals deal was considered more of a probability, Trump had played down his comment calling Zelenskyy a dictator last week. “Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question,” Trump told reporters.That brief moment of levity masked the reality that Trump had workshopped the “dictator” post on Truth Social with Vance before it was sent out last week, according to two people briefed on the matter.Vance had settled on the insult on the basis that Zelenskyy had suspended elections, the two people said, apparently ignoring the fact that Ukraine’s constitution decrees that elections cannot be held during a period of martial law, like the one Zelenskyy declared whenRussialaunched its full-scale invasion in 2022.While other US allies, such as the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, effusively praised Trump in the Oval Office this week, Zelenskyy took a different approach and perhaps unknowingly careened headfirst into Vance’s personal skepticism of him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Trump officials declined the offer, according to two people familiar with the matter.Trump’s view immediately after the meeting was that it was unproductive to engage in further talks because, to him, Zelenskyy was unwilling to sign a peace agreement with Russia.In the end, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, informed the members of the Ukrainian delegation, who were waiting in the Roosevelt Room, that they needed to leave. Minutes later, Zelenskyy stepped into a black SUV that drove off the White House grounds.Appearing on Fox News that evening, Zelenskyy referred to Ronald Reagan’sdictumthat “peace is more than just an absence of war” and suggested that because Putin had broken dozens of ceasefire agreements already, more work was needed to reach “a just and lasting peace”. Trump appeared unimpressed when he boarded Marine One en route to Palm Beach, telling reporters that Zelenskyy needed to say publicly that he wanted to make peace and stop saying “negative things” about Putin.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyJD VanceUkraineRussiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But he was forced toresignin August of his final year as governor when an investigation commissioned by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, found he had sexually harassed at least 11 women during his time in office.The former governor, a Democrat, is aiming to unseat incumbent the New York City mayor,Eric Adams, who has been grappling with criminal corruption charges that the US justice department is seeking to have lifted – pending a judicial sign-off – at the behest of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.Ina campaign videoannouncing his mayoral candidacy, Cuomo verbally painted the so-called Big Apple as a city in crisis.“The first to solving a problem is having the strength, having the courage, to recognize it, and we know that today ourNew YorkCity is in trouble,” he said, pointing to empty stores fronts, graffiti, grime, an influx of migrants that has taxed municipal infrastructure, and violent crime in some instances carried out by people who are mentally ill and lack access to treatment.“The city just feels threatening, out of control,”Cuomo said in his more than 17-minute announcement video. “These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely the lack of intelligent action by our political leaders.”The city faces a ranked-choice Democratic primary in April now dominated by two political figures with tarnished reputations, both betting that voters will overlook claims against them as politically motivated – or, in Cuomo’s case, that sexual harassment allegations which he vigorously denied have lost their power to derail political careers several years since the dawn of the #MeToo era.“How can you have a report that says 11 cases [of sexual harassment], and then it goes through law enforcement and they find no cases?” Cuomosaid at a South Bronx churchin March 2022, calling the report “a fraud”.A former staffer, Charlotte Bennett, later dropped her sexual harassment lawsuit against Cuomo, shortly before she was set to give her deposition in the case.A former Cuomo top aide who claims Cuomo made unwanted sexual advances towards her in 2000 told the New York Post that “women’s rights” will suffer if he is elected NYC’s next mayor.“Women haven’t done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical and what should be illegal behavior by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo,” Karen Hinton said Saturday, adding that the mayoral election “should be an opportunity ... to give women a strong, powerful voice” in city government that it “won’t get it if Adams or Cuomo is elected”.In his statement, Cuomo briefly addressed the end of his governorship, which included claims that he had allowed Covid-19 to fatally tear through state nursing homes and then attempted to cover it up.“Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,” he said. “Would I do some things differently knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully. Definitely. And I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for. And I hope to show you that every day.”He added: “I will fight Washington and Albany to make sure we get our fair share of funding, and to protect the rights and values that New Yorkers hold dear: that we believe that any discrimination by race, color or creed is anti-American.”Adams, a Democratic star when elected in 2021, has seen his support dwindle amid a swirl of scandals that ensnared some of his closest confidantes.Four deputy mayors recently resigned after it was claimed that the justice department’s request to drop its criminal indictment against Adams amounted to a “quid pro quo” with the Trump administration leaning on the mayor to help with federal deportation efforts.In a crowded field of mayoral candidates, Cuomo benefits from high name recognition, with 32% of those polled picking him as their favorite candidate. Other candidates – including former city comptroller Scott Stringer, incumbent city comptroller Brad Lander, state senator Jessica Ramos and Adams – are at 10% or less.There’s a dynastic component to Cuomo’s entry into the race. His father, Mario Cuomo, also served as New York governor, but he failed to win a bid for New York City mayor in 1977.Since stepping down as governor, the younger Cuomo has maintained his public profile, visiting Black churches and Jewish community groups. Both are constituencies where Adams and Cuomo are bound to seek key voter support.“Leading in practically every public poll so far, even before announcing his candidacy, Cuomo appears poised to prove that he has managed to overcome scandals that may have felled other politicians after his yearslong dedication to staying in politics and a series of legal victories that he has framed as vindication,”the journal City and State recently opined.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkAndrew CuomoUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as being straightforwardly thrilling, it proved to be hugely influential, pointing the way from glam to the punk music that was beginning to brew in New York City. They never broke the Top 100 of either the US or UK charts, but critics have deemed songs such as Personality Crisis – sung by Johansen with a throaty, lung-busting howl – some of the greatest rock of the 1970s.View image in fullscreenThe New York Dolls performing at the Waldorf Halloween Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in 1973: guitarist Sylvain Sylvain plays alongside David Johansen.Photograph: Richard Drew/APJohansen was born and raised in Staten Island, and fronted local band the Vagabond Missionaries before he joined the nascent New York Dolls in 1971, and became the heart of an irreverent scene centred around Manhattan’s Mercer Art Center. They were signed to Mercury Records, who released their 1973 debut and the follow-up Too Much Too Soon the following year. The latter title felt prescient: the often debauched band broke up in 1975, with Johansen fronting a version that continued until 1976.Johansen began a solo career, releasing his self-titled debut album in 1978, and released three more before taking on a new pseudonym: Buster Poindexter. This was as theatrical as his New York Dolls days but pointed in a very different direction, performing classic R&B, blues and pop as a tuxedoed crooner. He had a hit with his cover of Arrow’s holiday anthem Hot Hot Hot, and his self-titled 1987 debut took him to the US Top 40 for the first time. Three more Poindexter albums followed over the next decade.View image in fullscreenJohansen as his alter ego Buster Poindexter at the Grammy Awards in New York in 1988.Photograph: Anonymous/APIn 2004, Morrissey induced the New York Dolls – Johansen, along with bandmates Sylvain Sylvain and Arthur Kane – to reform for the Meltdown festival he was curating. Kane died weeks later, but Johansen and Sylvain kept the band going, releasing three more studio albums and touring until 2011.Johansen had an acting career, including opposite Bill Murray as the Ghost of Christmas Past in 1988’s Scrooged. He also worked as a radio host and was a painter. Among his admirers was Martin Scorsese, who co-directed the 2023 documentary Personality Crisis: One Night Only, centred on Johansen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Bystanders captured the incident from multiple angles, in one instance shouting in shock and swearing as the plane returned to the runway.FedEx flight on fire near Newark airport NJ.

On 30 January, an American Airlines planecollidedwith an US army helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington DC, killing all 67 people onboard both aircraft.The Washington collision was the deadliest US aviation disaster since 2009, when a Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people onboard and one person on the ground.Two days after the crash in Washington, seven people were killed after a medical transport plane collided into a north-eastPhiladelphianeighborhood. Meanwhile, a plane carrying 80 people crashed atTorontoPearson airport in mid-February, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured.Amid rising concerns, Google searches for “is flying safe” have surged. A recent AP-Norc poll, released in February, found that 64% of Americans consider air travel very or somewhat safe,down from 71% last year.Donald Trump’s second presidential administrationescalated tensions further by beginning tofire hundreds of employeesat the Federal Aviation Administration in mid-February, including some who maintain critical air traffic control infrastructure.Still, data indicates that2025 has been a relatively safe year for air travel– at least in terms of total accidents. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, January and February typically see about 20 fatal aviation accidents each month, most of which usually involve small airplanes that operate in a less regulated space.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyPlane crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

What could go wrong?The high-stakesWhite House showdownthat unfolded on Friday after the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded US security guarantees was deemed a damaging setback toDonald Trump’s goal of forging a peace deal – and a win for Russian dictatorVladimir Putin– by some US political commentators.And others in the US who are closely aligned with Trump cast the president’s meeting with Zelenskyy as a win for his “America first” realignment goals.“It is bewildering to see Mr Trump’s allies defending this debacle as some show of American strength,” the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial board said on Saturday, noting that US aims of limiting Russian expansionism without the use of US forces was now “harder to achieve”.The outlet warned that “turningUkraineover to Mr Putin would be catastrophic for that country and Europe, but it would be a political calamity for Mr Trump too.“Friday’s spectacle won’t make [Putin] any more willing to stop his onslaught” after invading Ukraine in 2022.The New York Times assessed that the derailed Oval Office meeting pointed to Trump’s “determination to scrap America’s traditional sources of power – its alliances among like-minded democracies – and return the country to an era of raw great-power negotiations.”“The three-year wartime partnership between Washington and Kyiv was shattered,” the paper added.Some conservative political figures also hit out at their fellow Republicans Trump and Vance for their handling over the meeting. “I hate to say this … but the United States right now is not the good guys in this,” said Adam Kinzinger, the former Republican congressman from Illinois who once served on a House committee that investigated Trump supporters’ attack on the US Capitol in early 2021.Whether diplomatic relations between Ukraine and the US can be repaired remained an open question Saturday. But the dispute points to the dangers of conducting diplomacy in public, despite the assessment from Trump – a former reality-TV host – that the clash with his Ukrainian counterpart, an ex-actor, made “great television”.“It is going to be incredibly hard to walk back from the kind of animosity we saw in that room today and to walk back some of those statements,” Republican strategist Karl Rove told Fox News. “It could have been done if cameras had not been running, but the only winner out of today is Vladimir Putin.”The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, revealed after the showdown that his meeting with Zelenskyy in Kviv days earlier resulted in a similar outburst. After Friday’s meltdown, BessentcalledZelenskyy’s approach “one of the great diplomatic own goals in history”.“Clearly it very difficult to do an economic deal with a leader that doesn’t want to do a peace deal,” Bessent told Bloomberg.“I’m not sure what he was thinking,” Bessent said of Zelenskyy, who was ultimately asked to leave the White House by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, after Ukrainian diplomatic aides texted that they were prepared to sign the agreed economic rare earth minerals deal.The White House deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, called out what he termed Zelenskyy’s “impertinence” and described the showdown as “one of the great moments in the history of American diplomacy”.“Millions of American hearts swelled with overflowing pride today to watch President Trump put Zelenskyy in his place,” Miller said, without elaborating on what public opinion information he had to justify that belief.Foreign Policy’s Ravi Agrawal wrote: “For a former comedian used to the cameras, it was strange that Zelensky got the script wrong.” Agawal noted that Trump had been testing the boundaries of press attention all week with “freewheeling” discussions in front of the world’s cameras.Such commentary came as Fox News host Bret Baier asked Zelenskyy whether he wanted to apologize to Trump, to which the Ukraine president said: “I’m not sure we did something bad.”“I respect [the] president and I respect [the] American people, and … I think that we have to be very open and very honest,” Zelenskyy told Baier.But arriving in London on Saturday ahead of a summit of British and European leaders, Zelenskyy thanked the US and its leadership while voicing hope for strong relations. “We want only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them,” he said.European leaders have stood behind Zelenskyy, with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, saying he “would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said if someone is gambling with the third world war – as Trump accused Zelenskyy of doing on Friday – it was not Zelenskyy.“If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,” said Macron, after Trump complained that Zelenskyy had been overly negative about the Russian dictator.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationUS politicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

He began by demonstrating to James how ChatGPT can create games using photos of toys on the floor of their house. Later, White exposed him to AI’s hallucinatory flaws by having his son debunk ChatGPT-generated world record claims with verified information from the Guinness Book of World Records. After more than two years of experimentation, White’s son, now in fifth grade, has learned how to integrate AI into a range of everyday activities, from crafting study materials to determining the cost of shoes without a price tag.“My goal isn’t to make him a generative AI wizard,” White said. “It’s to give him a foundation for using AI to be creative, build, explore perspectives and enrich his learning.”White is part of a growing number of parents teaching their young children how to use AI chatbots so they are prepared to deploy the tools responsibly as personal assistants for school, work and daily life when they’re older.View image in fullscreenJames, Jules White’s son.Photograph: Courtesy Jules WhiteParents are curious how the proliferation of generative AI will affect their kids’ personal growth. Nearly a third of parents say AI tools such as ChatGPT should be banned in schools to avoidcheating, according to a2023 Ipsos poll, as a growing number of young students lean on chatbots to do their homework. Despite limited research on AI’s impact on kids’ critical thinking skills,Unicefand other child health organizations are questioning how a dependency on chatbots for classwork can affect cognitive development.AI’s rapid evolution could also make it harder for less tech-savvy parents to intervene when children misuse it. According to a 2023National Parents Unionpoll, only 16% of parents with kids in kindergarten to 12th grade say they have a firm grasp on AI’s capabilities.While OpenAI andGoogle’s terms of service say their AI models are for users 13 and older, some parents are bending the rules, introducing AI to their young kids anyway, albeit with caution. These parents hope to help their children see AI as an imperfect tool that can expand rather than hamper human abilities.“This is going to take over everything,” White said. “I want him to be prepared.”Parents who spoke to the Guardian believe exposing kids to AI early can enhance creativity, hone critical thinking and improve communication skills.Ola Handford, an AI consultant, introducedChatGPTin her home in early 2023, when her kids were nine and 12 years old, through weekly Friday Fun Nights. Some nights focused on free exploration, while others were structured, such as rewriting the lyrics of Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off through the perspective of a squirrel. Her kids now use AI for research, recipes, debates and finding things to do when they travel.These activities serve as springboards for discussions about risks such as deepfakes and AI companions, the darker side of AI associated with tocrimes,emotional dependencyand, allegedly,suicide. Handford shows her kids AI tools including Character.ai, explaining that the avatars are computer-generated and not real people. She emphasizes that AI companions could have “serious consequences” if kids treat them as human.It didn’t matter what ChatGPT said. What mattered was that it created a bridge between my son and meKunal Dalal, AI administrator“Deepfakes and AI companions are high-priority concerns because they can influence my kids and be very damaging,” Handford said. “Playing around” with these tools raises awareness, she believes.White also emphasizes responsible AI use with his son. The professor’s activities are designed to show the 11-year-old how AI can unlock creative possibilities, such as building games that aid learning, rather than simply serving as a search engine or a way to skip writing something himself. Without guidance, the elder White said, kids could misuse ChatGPT to cheat on schoolwork, leading to “intellectual laziness”.“If your goal is to copy and paste ChatGPT’s answer, you’re not really contributing to society,” White said. He added that he wanted his son to see AI as a tool for reimagining processes in the workforce, where demand forAI skillsis growing.Beyond gaining a competitive edge in the job market, some parents see AI as a tool to help them enhance empathy and trust with their families.Kunal Dalal, administrator of AI at the Orange county department of education, uses AI daily with his four-year-old son to bond. They use ChatGPT to make music and use AI art generators such as Dall-E to produce personalized images, including illustrations of Dalal’s childhood in Bombay, India. The most compelling use case, he says, is to facilitate tough conversations with his son.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dalal calls this tactic the “triangle of communication”.If, say, Dalal notices his son is upset, Dalal may open ChatGPT’s voice feature, explain to the AI the situation, and ask the chatbot what he can do as a father to comfort his child. The AI would then validate his son’s emotions, suggest active listening techniques, and offer practical ways to reduce stress. ChatGPT’s response, he says, can help Dalal understand what his son needs when feeling agitated, leading to a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves them feeling closer.“It didn’t matter what ChatGPT said,” Dalal said. “What mattered was that it created a bridge between my son and me.”While some parents are embracing the tech with open arms, AI has the potential to drive a wedge between parents and children if the tech is misused, according to Ying Xu, an assistant professor at Harvard University who studies AI’s impact on children and families.Xu, who has herself introduced ChatGPT to her 10-year-old, warns that AI could erode children’s trust in their parents. If kids view AI’s knowledge as supreme, they may turn to it for guidance over their guardians. That’s especially true if parents do not know how often their children use AI, which Xu has frequently observed in her research. Companies that advertise their AI companions as child-friendly amplify this concern, she said, adding that overreliance on AI could blur the boundaries between real human interactions and AI-generated responses.My goal isn’t to make him a generative AI wizard. It’s to give him a foundation for using AIJules WhiteStill, Xu says there are benefits of introducing generative AI to kids. Access to the technology can expand the range of information sources and make its use increasingly seamless as they grow. But exposing AI to kids requires a controlled, intentional environment, she said.Parents who spoke to the Guardian said they prioritize supervision. White and Dalal only allow their kids to use ChatGPT on their devices with permission, and Handford says her kids don’t use AI during their personal time like they do social media,which she says is more dangerous as platforms such asTikTokmay expose kids to a cesspool of questionable content. Dalal even limits the number of ChatGPT queries his son can make to reduce environmental costs.Looking ahead, White and others said they plan to increase the complexity of AI activities as their kids grow older, with emerging tools like AI agents presenting new learning opportunities.“I’m excited about agentic AI,” the professor said. “We haven’t explored that yet, but it’s next on the list.”Share your experienceWe’d like to hear from parents and teachers about introducing AI to younger children and instructing them how to use it.

He’s now on pace to break the record in early April.“He’s obviously feeling it right now with the way he’s been scoring,” Tampa Bay captain Victor Hedman said. “Vasy did some unreal saves, but he’s going to get his chances. He’s arguably one of the best goal-scorers of all time, so he gets those chances in the slot, it’s tough to save those.”Despite the 39-year-old scoring, the Eastern Conference-leading Capitals lost a third consecutive game for the first time this season.“Finishing and getting on the board was huge, but I still think it’s going to get better,” coach Spencer Carbery said. “O is finishing at a real high rate coming out of the break. I think his play, chemistry and the whole product of our group – whether that’s his line or the power play – will continue to improve. I’m hopeful of that.”With Ovechkin closing in on passing Gretzky but still double digits away, Lightning coach Jon Cooper said before the game, “If he breaks the record tonight, then we did something wrong.”Ovechkin did not quite do that, but he still took another step closer to making hockey history.“That’s why he’s got 800-plus of them,” Cooper said afterward. “He knows what to do when he’s in that spot.”Explore more on these topicsWashington CapitalsNHLUS sportsTampa Bay LightningIce hockeyShareReuse this content"

The academy graduate Nico O’Reilly scored two headers before the club’s most-decorated outfield player, Kevin De Bruyne, ended the resistance.Plymouth could not have done more as they fought to contain City, even taking a shock lead through Maksym Talovierov but a happy ending never looked likely. The Premier League champions were made to toil by the well-drilled Pilgrims, who will rue conceding from two set pieces.Miron Muslic radiates optimism with Plymouth rising to the occasion | Simon BurntonRead moreDe Bruyne’s contract is up in the summer and the FA Cup provides perhaps the best opportunity, amid a difficult campaign, to add to the 16 winner’s medals he has earned inManchester City, though he is line to bow out at the Club World Cup. Paired with Ilkay Gündogan to provide experience in the middle of the park, the Belgian showed he still possesses the quality with delivery and offered constant endeavour even though he has physically diminished.Pep Guardiola’s side did not reach their optimum tempo, hindered by an extremely well-disciplined side. Plymouth made it this far thanks to a1-0 win over Premier League leaders Liverpool. On that afternoon they had a mere 25% possession and in the early stages reaching that milestone would be seen as a success. City controlled proceedings, passing the ball with precision in front of a green wall, doing what it could to keep the hosts at bay.Few were surprised that Plymouth’s box hosted plenty of action, considering they sit second from bottom in the Championship and have conceded 68 in 34 league matches. Conor Hazard’s first involvement was to get down smartly to save a Gündogan header going towards the bottom corner but the goalkeeper was a spectator as he watched James McAtee’s shot thudded off the inside of a post and away to safety.Everyone was waiting for City to take the lead as Plymouth rarely crossed the halfway line. Their own players looked somewhat surprised to be rewarded for their hard work when Matthew Sorinola swung a 38th-minute corner to the back post, where Talovierov rose highest to head past Stefan Ortega with what would be Plymouth’s solitary effort on or off target. It was only the third time Argyle had been ahead away from home in all competitions this season. Cue pandemonium from the 7,800 in the away end, able to dream for a few minutes.View image in fullscreenMaksym Talovierov (centre) gives Plymouth the lead.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockTaking the lead might have been ill-advised with so much of the game to play. City equalised in straightforward fashion in first-half injury time to change the dressing-room moods. De Bruyne whipped in a free-kick around 30 yards out, academy graduate O’Reilly made a smart run and flicked to the far post, Hazard got a hand to it but it was not sufficient. The celebrations were more muted on this occasion.“We can only be disappointed with the result, we are very proud of the performance,” Plymouth’s head coach, Miron Muslic, said. “We gave Manchester City a proper game. They are one of the best teams in the world with the best coach in the world. We did well, it is a bit of a pity we conceded with the final touch of the first half.”It might not have been a full panic but Erling Haaland was brought off the bench before the hour mark. The Norwegian and Bernardo Silva contrived to not convert chances in quick succession from inside the six-yard box as Hazard produced a number of fine saves to keep the score level. Unfortunately for the goalkeeper, the resulting corner found makeshift left-back O’Reilly at the back post from where he nodded home his second, calming the nerves of the majority. O’Reilly attracted interest from Chelsea in the winter transfer window and Guardiola’s decision to keep him is being rewarded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s not a typical player for the academy because all the players are small, skilful and good talent. But he has a big presence. Normally he’s an attacking midfielder, he’s a No 10. He’s another threat for our set pieces because we are not a tall team. He plays really well with the ball, without the ball and helps us with two fantastic goals.”Nathan Aké, meanwhile, had to be replaced at half-time by Rúben Dias because of injury and Guardiola intimated that the Dutchman would face a spell on the sidelines.With stamina diminished, Plymouth had little to offer and the search for an equaliser never began, comprehensively ended by De Bruyne’s late third. City still have a chance of silverware this season but they were made to labour to keep the opportunity alive.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverManchester CityPlymouth Argylematch reportsShareReuse this content"

While Emma Hayes probably wasn’t thrilled with her team’s performancein a 2-1 defeat to Japan, there were significantly more positives to take away from the competition than negatives.Central midfield was the area of the pitch where Hayes likely learned the most about her players, and came away with the most optimism for the future. That’s where 17-year-old Lily Yohannes and 19-year-old Claire Hutton both turned in excellent performances. And just as important as their individual level, they looked as if they could form a perfect partnership in the future.Despitewinning the Olympic gold medalin 2024, midfield has been a question mark for the US in recent years. It’s a testament to the quality of the team’s forward and defensive lines that they’ve been able to accomplish so much without control in the center of the park, but Hayes is clearly looking to develop new talent in that area to give the team more balance and a new dimension.The great 2019 World Cup winning team was anchored by holding midfielder Julie Ertz and box-to-box dynamo Samantha Mewis, who have both since retired. Expecting anyone to directly replace either player would be unreasonable. Ertz was one of the most athletic and aggressive ball-winners in the history of women’s soccer, while Mewis combined elite playmaking from deep with a 6ft frame and elite aerial presence.But in Hutton and Yohannes, the USWNT have a young duo with extremely complementary skillsets in midfield, and abilities that fit Hayes’ preferred system perfectly.For most of the tenures of the USWNT’s previous two permanent managers – Vlatko Andonovski and Jill Ellis – the team utilized a 4-3-3 formation with a single holding midfielder. Hayes has seemed to prefer a 4-2-3-1 setup with a double pivot. This can lead to the team getting one fewer player into the box in attack, but has a couple of positive tradeoffs. The center forward has had much more support from an attacking midfielder who starts closer to goal, and there’s an extra midfielder in a deep-lying position to slow down opposing counterattacks.Most coaches favor a midfield partnership with one player who is an excellent ball-winner and another who is an excellent passer in this setup, though it’s arguably more important for the midfielders to be well rounded in a double pivot shape than in the formation that Andonovski and Ellis favored. In Hutton and Yohannes, Hayes appears to have an ideal pairing of a defensive midfielder who’s solid on the ball, and a deep-lying playmaker who’s defensively proficient.View image in fullscreenLily Yohannes of the United States takes a selfie with fans after playing Australia at State Farm Stadium in February.Photograph: Brad Smith/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images for USSFHutton looked extremely composed and ready for a big role in her first career cap against Australia. It wasn’t particularly surprising given that she’s already got plenty of experience – Hutton logged 1,653 minutes in NWSL last season for Kansas City Current and started the playoff semi-final.And in her rookie season, Hutton was consistently one of NWSL’s best ball-winners. She averaged 5.23 tackles + interceptions per 90 minutes, good for 95th percentile among midfielders in the top nine competitions in FBRef’s database. These also aren’t empty challenges; Hutton is 95th percentile for defensive actions that lead to shots.While Hutton appears very technically solid, the available data suggests that she still has quite a bit of room for improvement as a passer. FBRef has her 41st percentile for pass completion percentage, and it’s not because she’s trying a lot of high-difficulty passes. She’s well above average as a short passer, but 53rd percentile for long pass completion percentage, 53rd percentile for progressive passes, and 54th percentile for passes completed into the final third. During the upcoming NWSL season, the thing Hayes will be watching for most from Hutton will be whether she can increase her range of passing.Yohannes has a completely different set of strengths and weaknesses. At 17, she’s remarkably already a world class passer, having gotten involved in two goals during SheBelieves Cup with excellent medium-length passes from the middle third of the pitch into the final third. FBRef doesn’t carry data on the Dutch Eredivise, where Yohannes currently plays with Ajax, but even the most dogmatic of statheads can watch Yohannes and concede that she’s already the most gifted playmaker in the USWNT setup.But Yohannes also went long spells without influencing the game against Japan, which is to be expected for a 17-year-old facing a top opponent. As Hayes put it in her post-match press conference:[Yui] Hasegawa in the middle of the park is probably the best pivot in the world at both the domestic and international level, and our pivot is 17 years of age and has played in three caps. So we have to be patient too, in our expectations.Certainly no one was disappointed in Yohannes’ performance against Japan, but it still highlighted what she needs to improve at to become one of the best midfielders in the world, and a player that Hayes picks for important competitive matches.At a listed height of 5ft 8in (and, admittedly an uneducated guess, but currently looking taller than when US Soccer put that number out a year ago), Yohannes clearly has the frame to develop into a physical presence in midfield. Her passing is good enough to justify her inclusion in the team even if she does not become a stronger defensive player, but that feels like an inevitable outcome from her maturing physically and likely moving from Ajax to a team in a more competitive league.If there was one slightly disappointing thing about the USWNT at SheBelieves Cup, it’s that we didn’t get the opportunity to see what Hutton and Yohannes can do together. It’s very understandable that Hayes wanted to partner each of her youngsters with another midfielder who’s older and more experienced, but it’s very easy to envision a future where they’re a starting partnership.Hayes already had a strong hypothesis about what she had in Hutton and Yohannes, but this tournament offered a massive data point in support. The USWNT learned that they have two excellent youngsters who can give their midfield something they’ve been missing.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen's footballEmma HayesanalysisShareReuse this content"

The MCL39 appears to have a genuine edge on a competitive field. Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were circumspect about their car and it did demonstrate a spot of instability in the rear but their confidence on track has been palpable. They look to have taken the stable platform of last season and improved it with the long-run race simulations presenting a fearsome pace, even given all the usual caveats of fuel loads, temperatures and card-holding in testing. When off the leash for a burst of potentially qualifying pace it was impressive on the brief occasions McLaren opted to show their hand, Norris aborting one flying lap that would have set tongues wagging. That early show of pace has not gone unnoticed by the other teams, withLewis Hamiltonamong others acknowledging that McLaren are set to be sharp from the off – the start Norris has long craved for a tilt at the title.Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton tells critics they give him ‘fuel’ to work even harderRead moreHamilton at home at FerrariHamilton has dismissed criticism from“older, white men” – Eddie Jordan and Bernie Ecclestone– who had questioned his move to Ferrari and certainly he has displayed nothing but enthusiasm and confidence in his new challenge.He has been effervescent in his approach to testing, a task he dislikes, throwing himself into it as he tries to make the most of every possible moment in a steep learning curve at the Scuderia. Intriguingly he seems to be making as fresh a start as he can, referring to his former team Mercedes as “the previous place” and “another place”. It’s a new journey for the 40-year-old Briton but one he insists has gone smoothly. “It’s felt seamless, easy in a sense of gelling with the team,” he said. “It’s not felt that we’ve had to force it and I feel at home.” He is then in a good place, his motivation is stronger than ever, even lightheartedly addressing one key detail with his new race engineer, Riccardo Adami. “Is hammer time still going to be hammer time? I haven’t spoken to my engineer about that,” he said. “I don’t know how it would sound with an Italian accent. So I have to find an Italian word. We’ll probably find something new.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton has cut a happy figure in his early days at Ferrari and seems determined to make an major impression.Photograph: Hasan Bratic/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockConvergence at the frontRed Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes have unsurprisingly remained tightly matched on their pre-season runs, with McLaren possibly having an edge. Mercedes may have taken their time to get to this point after three unpredictable seasons but it appears they have found consistency. The W16 looks well balanced and George Russell pronounced in Bahrain that it is the best Mercedes he has driven. Ferrari, too, are thereabouts. Hamilton, Charles Leclerc and the team principal, Frédéric Vasseur, are guarded but pleased. The SF-25 has been impressive, looking strong on corner turn-in, and the car has improved each day. More is likely to come given that Leclerc considered that it had given them no surprises and was ready to be exploited. Ferrari may yet still be a dark – prancing – horse at the front. Red Bull, meanwhile, had the task of addressing the issues that had plagued it in the second half of last season, a lack of balance leading to a testing, unpredictable ride thatMax Verstappen decried as a “monster”. Interestingly, the RB21 is strikingly similar to last year’s model but the team insist a raft of aero developments have been made and their motorsport consultant, Helmut Marko, was convinced the issues had been solved. That said, the test did not go entirely smoothly and Red Bull were putting in a lot of time experimenting and adapting setups, suggesting they are still not quite where they want to be.View image in fullscreenWilliams driver Alex Albon puts his car through its paces in testing in Bahrain, with hopes high that the team can improve on ninth last season.Photograph: David Davies/PAWilliams on the turnHaving struggled so hard of late and with 2026 targeted to reap the rewards of their rebuilding process,Williamsmight just be ahead of schedule and, whisper it, perhaps even with a nose in front of RB, Haas, Aston Martin and Alpine, with Sauber set to be very much in a field of one at the back. After finishing ninth last season, the early signs are that Williams may be a real player in the midfield. The Mercedes rear suspension has been integrated well, the car looks very planted on track, with the team able to find a better balance as testing progressed. Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were both quick and complimentary about their new ride. Indeed, Sainz set the fastest time of all the three days with a 1min 29.348sec lap, only a couple of tenths off the pole time from last year. The FW47 was consistent on long runs, with Sainz banging out 127 laps on Thursday and Albon 137 and the third-fastest time on Friday while, observed from trackside, it was at ease both in and out of the corners, an indicator of a robust race car. While a little unruly on the absolute limit, this is potentially the best car Williams have produced in years and for the teams in its proximity a real cause of concern. An enticing prospect not least with both Albon and Sainz being feisty competitors.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneThe ObserverMcLarenLando NorrisLewis HamiltonFerrariRed BullMercedes GPanalysisShareReuse this content"

When Liverpool lost, there was a predictable backlash and, from certain quarters, derision as Benítez explained his rotation policy and the need to manage the number of minutes each player played.Social media being in its infancy, it wasn’t quite the culture war that it would have become today, but certain old-school football men clearly felt that players should just get on with it: hard work never hurt anyone. But at the same time a piece of ancient wisdom kept surfacing, usually from elderly coaches who had spent a lifetime in the game: as a rule of thumb, however much they play, whatever age they start, a player has 500 games in them.Aston Villa’s Kirsty Hanson: ‘Dementia impacts so many people.

Sterling played in fewer games than he had in any previous Premier League season for City, but only just. He still scored 13 league goals. There were no great alarm bells ringing. But Pep Guardiola had evidently seen something, some diminution of the hunger, some fractional loss of acceleration, some infinitesimal leadening of the touch. At the end of that season,City sold him to Chelseafor £47.5m.Sterling was the first of the legions to sign forChelsea under Todd Boehly. Thomas Tuchel was still the manager. Goodness knows what sort of vision of the club was sold to his agent as negotiations were conducted via scribbled-on napkins in a members’ club in London. But it’s unlikely either Sterling or his agent realised there would be 41 further signings in the following two and a half years (a figure that includes João Félix twice).Sterling did not have an easy start but he did score twice in a win over Leicester. ThenTuchel was sackedafter a month and so the long, slow drift into confusion began, the hop from Graham Potter to Frank Lampard to Mauricio Pochettino to Enzo Maresca. Did any of them have a clear vision for Sterling as he moved into his late 20s, his notional peak?View image in fullscreenNot even being reunited at Arsenal with Mikel Arteta, who helped coach him at Manchester City, has revived Raheem Sterling’s form.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesHis indifferent form could at first be attributed to Chelsea’s struggles. It was only at the World Cup that winter that the extent of his drop-off became apparent. Sterling had been England’s most effective attacking player at the Euros in the summer of 2021. But in Qatar he was largely ineffective. He was withdrawn in the group games against Iran and the USA, rested against Wales and then missed the last-16 game against Senegal as hereturned to London after a break-inat the family home.What was remarkable was how, from a football point of view, it didn’t seem much to matter. Sterling returned but Phil Foden retained his place for the quarter-final. He came on for the final 12 minutes, but has never played forEnglandsince, the star of one tournament becoming obsolete within 18 months.Thereafter his club form has been, at best, indifferent. There was a persistent hamstring problem that ruined the months after the World Cup, since when there have been regular social media posts showing him training harder than ever, running up hills with the army to try to redevelop his sprinting speed. There has been no suggestion that his focus or commitment has waned at all. And yet results on the pitch have not been good.Maresca gave him some part in every pre-season match last summer and then left him out of the match‑day squad for the opening game of this season against Manchester City, promptingSterling’s statement expressing bewildermentabout how he had been treated. Which may not have been the best way to go about showing his dismay, but it’s easy to see why he was confused, why he felt let down by the continuing chaos at Chelsea, the constant changing of ideas, the flux of players and managers, the way he had even tried to play at wing-back to make it work, only to be ostracised as a new season began.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mikel Arteta had worked with Sterling at City, had helped refine and hone his talent, but he could not reawaken it. The idea of Sterling was good;Arsenalhave needed somebody to relieve the burden on Bukayo Saka for years. But it hasn’t worked: Sterling has managed only 310 minutes of league football this season.Even in the past two games, with four other forwards out, Sterling has been given a total of just 24 minutes off the bench. Arteta preferred to start at centre-forwarda midfielder who had not played the role since he was ninerather than risk Sterling for another full game on the flank to allow Leandro Trossard to play through the centre.There was something deeply uncomfortable when, in injury timeagainst West Ham last Saturday, Arsenal got a free-kick just outside the box and Sterling rather than Martin Ødegaard went to take it. His confidence is shot; it was inevitable that the opportunity would be wasted.His decline has been startling; when the body starts to go, everything else that sustains a player at the highest level tails off too. It’s a reminder of just how high a levelPremier Leaguefootballers habitually operate at, just how fragile their excellence often is, how quickly a small decline can become a huge one. Sterling is only 30, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, at the highest level, he is finished. The law of 500 has struck again.Explore more on these topicsRaheem SterlingInside footballArsenalChelseaEnglandPremier LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

The Portuguese took over in November and has overseen five victories in 16 Premier League matches, leaving them 14th.One of those wins wasat Fulham, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday in the FA Cup fifth round. The holders face a crucial week with a last-16 first leg trip to Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday with redundancies off the pitch and poor performances on it.Alejandro Garnacho will ‘buy dinner’ at United after substitution reactionRead more“Better is hard to say because I’m not winning games, so I don’t feel like I’m a better coach,” Amorim said when asked if he had improved since arriving at Old Trafford. “I lived here for three months, I lived certain things. I’m a more complete manager because sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow.“I felt that during these three months, I’m not going to die if I lose three games in a row. That is something that I learned here and I can cope to maintain the energy. I’m learning a lot about myself and the players, but I prefer to win games.”Amorim has stuck rigidly to his preferred 3-4-3 formation as he attempts to weed out those players incapable of fitting into the system. It is likely the club will attempt to overhaul the playing staff during the summer but Amorim accepts United need to sell first and has no qualms about telling players they are not wanted.“That is not a difficult situation because everybody understands that in football, sometimes you stay, sometimes you have to move on,” he said. “If I know how to explain, I can do it, and I like to do it because I want to be clear.“When I was a player, I tried to use all that experience. When you are honest with someone, they can take it. In the beginning it’s hard, but they will understand.“I’m quite honest with my players and they already know that sometimes they have to move on at the end of the season.”Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already implemented 250 redundancies and a further 200 are planned as part of the latest round of cost-cutting, which also involves the end of free lunches for staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will replace the current system whereby a keeper has six seconds to move the ball on and is punished with an indirect free-kick if they do not.“Goalkeepers holding on to the ball for too long have been a bane of many people’s lives for quite some time, so some action has been taken,” said Patrick Nelson, the chief executive of the Irish FA, who chaired Ifab’s AGM in Belfast on Saturday. “The results of the trials have been very, very positive, so we’re going to move forward and put that into the laws of the game as soon as possible.”Rage against the refs has become the norm but surely we can do better?  | Jonathan LiewRead moreIfab is to implement the change following trials at more than 400 matches, including in the academy competition Premier League 2, after a sense the previous law was not being properly enforced. Officials see the change as potentially revolutionary, as it will be the first time an infringement in live play will be punished by something other than a free-kick or penalty.David Elleray, the former Premier League referee and now Ifab’s technical director, citedBrighton’s victory at Manchester Unitedlast season as an example; whereas the United keeper held on to the ball for an average of 4.8sec, the Brighton goalkeeper’s average was 14.8sec.“Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears,” he said. “If it speeds up the game, if it’s more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.”A new approach to time-wasting was just one of several incremental but potentially transformative developments that were announced. Another is confirmation that trials of a new approach to offside are to continue, with the possibility that the law ends up finding an attacking player onside if any part of their torso is in line with a defending player.View image in fullscreenArsène Wenger says an attacking player should be onside if any part of their torso is in line with a defending player.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersCurrently a player is offside if any body part that can legally score a goal is in advance of a defender. Current trials, championed by Fifa’s chief of global development, Arsène Wenger, are flipping that approach and finding attackers onside if any part of their body is in line with a defender. But moving the line back, to where the player’s torso is in line, is gaining favour among lawmakers, with the rationale that not only would it be a more balanced cut off point, but that the torso is easier to capture using tracking software, potentially allowing for quicker decisions.A further change is a rule to allow referees to wear body cameras in Fifa competitions. Already successfully trialled at grassroots level in England, with the aim of pushing back against player abuse of officials, the system will be tried at the Club World Cup this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will now rest and recuperate over the following days where his progress will be monitored by our club doctor.“Thank you to the medical staff at both Selhurst Park and the hospital for their help and professionalism, and for all the wishes of support that JP and the club have received today.”Speaking to the BBC at half-time, the Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, described the foul as the worst he had ever seen in football. “In all the time I’ve watched football, I’ve never seen a challenge like it,” he said. “It is the most reckless challenge on a football pitch I think I’ve ever seen.”Glasner was more conciliatory, however. “I’m pretty sure he did not want to injure JP in this situation, but I also think you have to decide when you make such an impact, that you just can’t do it in this way – the risk of a very serious injury is just too high. It was the wrong decision that the goalkeeper took in this moment, but I always believe all the sportsmen I know they never want to injure the opposition players, he didn’t want to injure him in this way, but the decision to go to the ball with his foot at this height, with this intensity, was the completely wrong decision.”As Mateta was being treated, some Millwall fans could be heard chanting “let him die”. It is understood the FA cannot investigate the offensive chants directed at Mateta – which do not breach regulations – but will be investigating homophobic chants directed by Millwall fans at the Palace defender Ben Chilwell.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta feels the full force of Liam Roberts’ challenge, although Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, insisted the goalkeeper did not intend to harm his player.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersGlasner was satisfied his team hadprogressed to the quarter-finals, and praised his players’ resilience in seeing out the game. “I don’t feel happiness, still sadness and doubt, because of how serious JP’s injury is.

Only after Boubacar Traoré smashed his penalty against the crossbar did substitute Luis Sinisterra wrap things up, converting for a 5-4 shootout win after the game was deadlocked at 1-1 after extra-time.Despite attempting 31 shots over the course of 120 minutes, Bournemouth’s only goal – that was allowed to stand – came from Evanilson, whose tap-in was cancelled out by a wondrous Matheus Cunha long-range strike.It may well be the Brazilian’s last action for some time, with a lengthy ban expected for his sending-off in the final minute of extra time after a clash with Milos Kerkez. He is certain to miss crucial Premier League games against Everton, Southampton and West Ham, with fixtures against Ipswich and others in jeopardy if his suspension is extended.“After this game the emotional side was very high,” said his manager Vítor Pereira. “A lot of pressure. In the end [Cunha’s reaction] is what can happen. It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football and we must deal with the situation.”Given their superiority, Bournemouth should have put the game to bed long before spot-kicks.“I don’t remember a game where we’ve been the best as clear as today,” said manager Andoni Iraola. “It’s difficult to explain that we didn’t win the game in 90 minutes or extra time. But sometimes that happens.”View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha cannot believe it as he is shown a red card by referee Chris Kavanagh after losing his cool in extra time.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCentre-half James Hill was the unlikely creator of their goal, threading a wonderful ball to Antoine Semenyo to bear down on goal. Sam Johnstone saved well, but his firm hand pushed the ball straight to Evanilson, who was gifted a first goal of the calendar year.Five minutes later, Bournemouth thought they had doubled their lead, only for it to be ruled out after a protracted video assistant referee delay that sucked the life out of an otherwise invigorating afternoon.A deep Bournemouth cross was bundled over the line from close range by a puzzling combination of Kerkez and Dean Huijsen. A laborious check for a potential handball from both men determined neither had definitively committed that offence, before attention then turned to a possible offside.With the six-yard box too congested to employ the semi-automated offside technology that was meant to be in use for the first time this weekend, the referee, Sam Barrott, called both managers over to explain that the officials would need to take their time drawing their own lines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This time there was no controversy, with Alex Scott obviously palming the ball in.As on so many occasions this season, Wolves’s attacking threat could be neatly summed up as Cunha and Cunha alone. The architect of almost every move, the Brazilian decided on the hour to forgo his ­team-mates and shoot himself. The result was a glorious dipping, swerving strike into the top corner from close to 30 yards.Shocked into action by that unexpected equaliser, Bournemouth’s dominance grew with every minute, placing Johnstone’s goal under near-permanent siege. But, through a combination of last-ditch blocks, superb saves and goalline clearances, the visitors somehow took the game to penalties.That Cunha was not on the pitch for them cost his side dear.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverBournemouthWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The scoring spree was capped off in the 33rd minute when Patrik Schick calmly slotted the ball home from inside the box after latching on to a pass from the byline.However, Leverkusen’s confidence led to a lapse in concentration, allowing Frankfurt to capitalise. Seven minutes before the break, Hugo Ekitike seized on a misplaced back-pass, rounded the goalkeeper, Lukas Hradecky, and slotted the ball into an empty net.Leverkusen maintained their dominance in the second half, with Aleix García delivering a low long shot in the 62nd minute, following a clearance, that nestled into the far lower corner to seal the fourth and final goal of the night.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaReal MadridReal BetisSerie ANapoliInternazionalenewsShareReuse this content"

No Preston fan has heard that line since 1966 but a dominant display made it a reality. Milutin Osmajic, almost inevitability, was central to the dismantling ofBurnley.Osmajicwas accused of racially abusing the Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbriwhen the teams met here a fortnight ago. He scored Preston’s second and repaid the taunts from the away fans by cupping his ears in celebration in front of them. Robbie Brady had ignited the tie with a superb free-kick and Will Keane sealed a deserved victory after a fine team move.Crystal Palace through after Millwall keeper’s red for head-high tackle on MatetaRead moreBurnley, fielding nine changes to their last outing, conceded more goals in one afternoon against their Lancashire rivals than they had done all year. Scott Parker’s sadness, however, went beyond a cup exit. “It makes me sad that Hannibal missed out today,” said the Burnley manager, who decided to leave the former Manchester United player out of his matchday squad due to the ongoing investigation into his allegations against Osmajic, which the Preston striker denies.“I kept asking myself whether it was the right thing to do but the decision was fundamentally about protecting a young boy.” Chants from the home crowd asking whether Hannibal was watching Burnley’s first defeat in 24 games backed up the call.Burnley’s players refused to shake the Montenegro international’s hand before kick-off while the away fans in the Bill Shankly Stand booed his every touch. “The players decided that was the stance they would take and I was fully supportive when I found out,” said Parker.Two league games this season between Preston and Burnley, 15th and third in the Championship respectively, had ended in goalless stalemates and for 30 minutes they appeared on course for another. Preston were the more determined, cohesive unit as Burnley failed to establish any rhythm. But neither keeper had been tested before Brady struck.View image in fullscreenMilutin Osmajic gives Preston a 2-0 lead just before half-time.Photograph: Lee Durkin/Action Plus/ShutterstockThe hosts were awarded a free-kick 25 yards out after the Burnley left-back, Lucas Pires, collected a booking for clattering into Brad Potts. Perfect territory for the cultured left foot of Brady. The Republic of Ireland international swept an exquisite free-kick over the wall and into the top corner of Vaclav Hladky’s goal. Brady declined to celebrate against his former club but his firstFA Cupgoal was one to savour.Luca Koleosho had two decent chances in the first half for Burnley but dragged one wide and saw the other deflected wide after Freddie Woodman had missed Jonjo Shelvey’s free-kick into a crowded area. By then Preston had the cushion of a second goal and Osmajic the moment he craved.The referee, John Brooks, played a good advantage when Ryan Ledson went down holding his face after being caught by a Maxime Estève clearance. Potts threaded the loose ball behind an exposed defence and Osmajic ran clear to drill a clinical finish under Hladky.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Preston deservedly extinguished any hope of a recovery for the Premier League promotion contenders in style. Stefan Thordarson played a superb ball out of defence to Andrew Hughes, surging forward on the left. The substitute steered a first-time cross along the six-yard box and Keane was perfectly placed to convert from close range.

A VAR check confirmed he was not offside.Rangers almost conceded another with 23 minutes played but Sparrow hit the side-netting after being played in by Callum Slattery. When the same two Motherwell players combined in a similar situation on the half-hour mark, theRangerscaptain James Tavernier the culprit for losing possession, Sparrow showed composure to strike the ball low past Butland.The Rangers interim manager, Barry Ferguson, brought on three substitutes at half-time and, with increased momentum, Dessers countered nine minutes into the second half when the defender Casey misjudged a ball into the box. This allowed the forward to capitalise with a strike past Ellery Balcombe in the Motherwell goal for 2-1. Dessers believed he had added a second when he clipped the ball over Balcombe but the finish was disallowed by VAR for offside.It is the first time that Rangers have lost three consecutive matches at home since 2012 and a blow in the buildup to their match against José Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday.The Motherwell manager, Michael Wimmer, said: “It was very important in the first half that we were ready at the beginning. To start the first half well and to win the duals and change the atmosphere in the stadium.“This is something I want to see from the guys on the pitch; that we are brave, that we have courage on the ball, that we find the right balance in possession.

An emotive saga that has caused severe ructions concluded at the Norwegian Football Federation’s general assembly with 321 votes in favour of VAR and 129 against.The outcomewas effectively decidedby grassroots clubs who do not use VAR. Those in the top two divisions had already formally recommended that it be discontinued.Grassroots clubs hold key as Norway prepares for historic vote to scrap VARRead moreThe outcome spells victory for the NFF and its president, Lise Klaveness, who had argued vigorously to keep using VAR in the face of widespread protests at Eliteserien games. The federation had backed its retention despite a vote in January, passed by 19-13, by the country’s top 32 clubs to cease its deployment.A long and impassioned debate at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo, which rumbled for more than two hours, was followed by the vote. It fell to those present among Norway’s lower-division and amateur clubs, who traditionally have tended to vote in line with the NFF’s recommendations, to swing the balance in either direction. Before the discussion, the leaders of the NFF’s influential 18 district associations had all come out in favour of the status quo.It means Norway, which adopted VAR in 2023, will not become the first country to approve its abolition. Questions will rage about the process behind Saturday’s vote and particularly the fact that it overrules those to whom VAR holds most relevance.Many of VAR’s opponents feel the NFF should have acted in accordance with the leading clubs, who made their decisions after internal votes by their members. Klaveness said in August that their stance would “carry weight” in the NFF’s recommendation to the general assembly.Klaveness has previously acknowledged the VAR process requires improvement, while arguing that Norway’s referees may be hamstrung in their ambitions to work in Uefa competitions if they are not using it at home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His review will also mean identifying a successor to Jos Buttler as white-ball captain.Jos Buttler’s England reign ends in painful defeat by South AfricaRead moreHarry Brook, the vice-captain, has endured a tough start to the year and, as a three-format player, his stepping up could leave the 26‑year‑old overburdened. Other candidates may not even be in the squad that has flopped, with McCullum ruling nothing out when asked about proven domestic leaders such as Sam Billings, Sam Curran and James Vince.“If it is the same person [for ODIs and Twenty20], great, if it’s two, that’s great too,” said the head coach, who has struck up a strong alliance with Ben Stokes in the Test setup. “Give me a couple of weeks to work it out and get this thing back on track.”The notion of three captains – last occurring between 2011 and 2012 when Andrew Strauss (Tests), Alastair Cook (ODIs) and Stuart Broad (T20s) were briefly a triumvirate – would be a messy one. It would cut across McCullum’s belief that the best cricketers should be able to transfer across squads, with England’s schedule now starting to ease.In that respect McCullum was unrepentant about merging the 50-over team with the more successful Test side for this Champions Trophy, noting that Ben Duckett (227 runs) and Joe Root (225) were England’s two highest scorers. The same went for banking on high pace in the bowling attack at the expense of greater variety, even if this failed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not hard to see this is a slightly different task and we’ve got to put plans in place for the demands of white-ball.“But I still have tremendous confidence in the talent that is across English cricket, not just in the dressing room right now, but also guys around the domestic scene at the moment or have played for England before. We’ve got to find ways to make sure that our team walks out there a lot more confident than we are at the moment.”On Buttler, who has no intention of retiring from international duty, McCullum added: “We still see him as a big player within that and he’s still got a huge role to play.

Franz also did not mention the Russia-based LockBit ransomware group, which the US has previously said is the most prolific ransomware group in the world and has been called out in UN forums in the past. The treasury last year said LockBit operates on a ransomeware-as-service model, in which the group licenses its ransomware software to criminals in exchange for a portion of the paid ransoms.In contrast to Franz’s statement, representatives for US allies in the European Union and the UK focused their remarks on the threat posed by Moscow, with the UK pointing out that Russia was using offensive and malicious cyber-attacks against Ukraine alongside its illegal invasion.“It’s incomprehensible to give a speech about threats in cyberspace and not mention Russia and it’s delusional to think this will turn Russia and the FSB [the Russian security agency] into our friends,” said James Lewis, a veteran cyber expert formerly of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. “They hate the US and are still mad about losing the cold war. Pretending otherwise won’t change this.”The US policy change has also been established behind closed doors.A recent memo at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) set out new priorities for the agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and monitors cyber threats against US critical infrastructure. The new directive set out priorities that included China and protecting local systems. It did not mention Russia.A person familiar with the matter who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said analysts at the agency were verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.The person said work that was being done on something “Russia-related” was in effect “nixed”.“Russia and China are ourbiggest adversaries. With all the cuts being made to different agencies, a lot of cybersecurity personnel have been fired. Our systems are not going to be protected and our adversaries know this,” the person said.The person added: “People are saying Russia is winning. Putin is on the inside now.”TheNew York Times has separately reportedthat the Trump administration has also reassigned officials at Cisa who were focused on safeguarding elections from cyber-attacks and other attempts to disrupt voting.Another person who previously worked on US joint task forces operating at elevated classification levels to track and combat Russian cyber threats said the development was “truly shocking”.“There are thousands of US government employees and military working daily on the massive threat Russia poses as possibly the most significant nation state threat actor. Not to diminish the significance of China, Iran or North Korea, but Russia is at least on par with China as the most significant cyber threat,” the person said.The person added:“There are dozens of discrete Russia state-sponsored hacker teams dedicated to either producing damage to US government, infrastructure and commercial interests or conducting information theft with a key goal of maintaining persistent access to computer systems.”Cisa did not initially respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Hours after publication of this article, it denied the memo was “from the Trump administration”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There has been no change in our posture or priority on this front,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.The state department did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.The change is not entirely surprising, given that the Trump administration has made it clear that it is seeking to make amends with Moscow. Earlier this week at the United Nations, theUS voted with Russia against an EU-Ukrainian resolutionthat condemned Russia on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“The US has long assessed Russia, China and Iran as leaders in cyber threats. To see a US representative in an international setting erase Russia’s role altogether comes as a bit of a shock – though consistent with the sudden US alignment with Russia and its satellites on the global stage,” said Scott Horton, an American lawyer who previously worked in Moscow and advised Russian human rights advocates.The US has long warned that Russia posed a cyber threat to US infrastructure, includingin the annual threat assessmentpublished by US intelligence agencies last year. The report stated that Russia posed an “enduring global cyber threat” even as it has prioritized cyber operations against Ukraine. Moscow, the report concluded, “views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries’ decisions and continuously refines and employs its espionage, influence and attack capabilities against a variety of targets”. Russia was able to target critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, in the US and in allied and partner countries.Few lawmakers have previously been as outspoken on the issue asMarco Rubiowhen he was still a Florida senator. In 2020, as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Rubio – who now serves as Trump’s secretary of state – said the USwould retaliatefor a massive and ongoing cyber-attack that had compromised companies and federal agencies, including the energy department’s National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time he said the attacks were “consistent with Russian cyber operations”.But there was no sign of that kind of rebuke fromFranz, who now reports to Rubio at the state department. The change in language at the recent UN speech was not only remarkable for omitting Russia and LockBit, said Valentin Weber, senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, but also for leaving out any mention of allies and partners.“For a quarter-century Putin’s Russia pushed an autocratic agenda in the UN cybersecurity negotiations, while engaging in nonstop cyber-attacks and information operations around the world, and the US and other democracies pushed back,” said William Drake, director of international studies at the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information in Columbia Business School. “But now the Trump administration has abandoned the liberal international order … [and] the US is no longer a global power trying to maintain an open and rules-based international system, it’s just a great power with narrower self-interests that happen to be impacted by China’s cyber-attacks.”Do you have a tip on this story?

This was connected to the rise of “mixed ideology” motives, which included “incel” culture, the “alt-right” and mass-killing manifestos. The problem was compounded by cuts to youth clubs and mental health provision, he said.Greg Stewart, a criminal lawyer and former youth justice lead for the Law Society, said successful reforms to the youth justice system picked up youngsters behaving badly in communities but missed “exceptional children”.“The escalator, which was the old way of looking at things, has been disabled, so you’re more likely to go from a low base to very high seriousness,” he said, adding that there was an overlap between autism, obsessive behaviour and becoming radicalised online.He recommended a Prevent-style response, in which teachers and lecturers picked up “thinking patterns and views”. For example, Nasen Saadi,who stabbed a woman, alarmed a lecturer by asking questions about murder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He began by demonstrating to James how ChatGPT can create games using photos of toys on the floor of their house. Later, White exposed him to AI’s hallucinatory flaws by having his son debunk ChatGPT-generated world record claims with verified information from the Guinness Book of World Records. After more than two years of experimentation, White’s son, now in fifth grade, has learned how to integrate AI into a range of everyday activities, from crafting study materials to determining the cost of shoes without a price tag.“My goal isn’t to make him a generative AI wizard,” White said. “It’s to give him a foundation for using AI to be creative, build, explore perspectives and enrich his learning.”White is part of a growing number of parents teaching their young children how to use AI chatbots so they are prepared to deploy the tools responsibly as personal assistants for school, work and daily life when they’re older.View image in fullscreenJames, Jules White’s son.Photograph: Courtesy Jules WhiteParents are curious how the proliferation of generative AI will affect their kids’ personal growth. Nearly a third of parents say AI tools such as ChatGPT should be banned in schools to avoidcheating, according to a2023 Ipsos poll, as a growing number of young students lean on chatbots to do their homework. Despite limited research on AI’s impact on kids’ critical thinking skills,Unicefand other child health organizations are questioning how a dependency on chatbots for classwork can affect cognitive development.AI’s rapid evolution could also make it harder for less tech-savvy parents to intervene when children misuse it. According to a 2023National Parents Unionpoll, only 16% of parents with kids in kindergarten to 12th grade say they have a firm grasp on AI’s capabilities.While OpenAI andGoogle’s terms of service say their AI models are for users 13 and older, some parents are bending the rules, introducing AI to their young kids anyway, albeit with caution. These parents hope to help their children see AI as an imperfect tool that can expand rather than hamper human abilities.“This is going to take over everything,” White said. “I want him to be prepared.”Parents who spoke to the Guardian believe exposing kids to AI early can enhance creativity, hone critical thinking and improve communication skills.Ola Handford, an AI consultant, introducedChatGPTin her home in early 2023, when her kids were nine and 12 years old, through weekly Friday Fun Nights. Some nights focused on free exploration, while others were structured, such as rewriting the lyrics of Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off through the perspective of a squirrel. Her kids now use AI for research, recipes, debates and finding things to do when they travel.These activities serve as springboards for discussions about risks such as deepfakes and AI companions, the darker side of AI associated with tocrimes,emotional dependencyand, allegedly,suicide. Handford shows her kids AI tools including Character.ai, explaining that the avatars are computer-generated and not real people. She emphasizes that AI companions could have “serious consequences” if kids treat them as human.It didn’t matter what ChatGPT said. What mattered was that it created a bridge between my son and meKunal Dalal, AI administrator“Deepfakes and AI companions are high-priority concerns because they can influence my kids and be very damaging,” Handford said. “Playing around” with these tools raises awareness, she believes.White also emphasizes responsible AI use with his son. The professor’s activities are designed to show the 11-year-old how AI can unlock creative possibilities, such as building games that aid learning, rather than simply serving as a search engine or a way to skip writing something himself. Without guidance, the elder White said, kids could misuse ChatGPT to cheat on schoolwork, leading to “intellectual laziness”.“If your goal is to copy and paste ChatGPT’s answer, you’re not really contributing to society,” White said. He added that he wanted his son to see AI as a tool for reimagining processes in the workforce, where demand forAI skillsis growing.Beyond gaining a competitive edge in the job market, some parents see AI as a tool to help them enhance empathy and trust with their families.Kunal Dalal, administrator of AI at the Orange county department of education, uses AI daily with his four-year-old son to bond. They use ChatGPT to make music and use AI art generators such as Dall-E to produce personalized images, including illustrations of Dalal’s childhood in Bombay, India. The most compelling use case, he says, is to facilitate tough conversations with his son.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dalal calls this tactic the “triangle of communication”.If, say, Dalal notices his son is upset, Dalal may open ChatGPT’s voice feature, explain to the AI the situation, and ask the chatbot what he can do as a father to comfort his child. The AI would then validate his son’s emotions, suggest active listening techniques, and offer practical ways to reduce stress. ChatGPT’s response, he says, can help Dalal understand what his son needs when feeling agitated, leading to a heart-to-heart conversation that leaves them feeling closer.“It didn’t matter what ChatGPT said,” Dalal said. “What mattered was that it created a bridge between my son and me.”While some parents are embracing the tech with open arms, AI has the potential to drive a wedge between parents and children if the tech is misused, according to Ying Xu, an assistant professor at Harvard University who studies AI’s impact on children and families.Xu, who has herself introduced ChatGPT to her 10-year-old, warns that AI could erode children’s trust in their parents. If kids view AI’s knowledge as supreme, they may turn to it for guidance over their guardians. That’s especially true if parents do not know how often their children use AI, which Xu has frequently observed in her research. Companies that advertise their AI companions as child-friendly amplify this concern, she said, adding that overreliance on AI could blur the boundaries between real human interactions and AI-generated responses.My goal isn’t to make him a generative AI wizard. It’s to give him a foundation for using AIJules WhiteStill, Xu says there are benefits of introducing generative AI to kids. Access to the technology can expand the range of information sources and make its use increasingly seamless as they grow. But exposing AI to kids requires a controlled, intentional environment, she said.Parents who spoke to the Guardian said they prioritize supervision. White and Dalal only allow their kids to use ChatGPT on their devices with permission, and Handford says her kids don’t use AI during their personal time like they do social media,which she says is more dangerous as platforms such asTikTokmay expose kids to a cesspool of questionable content. Dalal even limits the number of ChatGPT queries his son can make to reduce environmental costs.Looking ahead, White and others said they plan to increase the complexity of AI activities as their kids grow older, with emerging tools like AI agents presenting new learning opportunities.“I’m excited about agentic AI,” the professor said. “We haven’t explored that yet, but it’s next on the list.”Share your experienceWe’d like to hear from parents and teachers about introducing AI to younger children and instructing them how to use it.

But the perennial problem facing the country is its sheer size, compared against its population size, and whether it is cost-effective to build towers for places with low populations, or places people briefly travel through, such as highways.Theuniversal outdoor mobile obligation, to be introduced by the Labor government as legislation if it wins the next election, would expand existing obligations for triple zero access across the nation to include outdoor voice and SMS coverage, and also aim to improve the availability of mobile services during disasters and power outages.The arrival of new satellite services could help fill the gap.New technology, an old problemLow-earth orbit (LEO) satellites fly between 500 and 2,000 kilometres above sea level, and rotate the Earth multiple times a day.While the world’s craving for a constant connection has led to these technologies being developed and used globally, the proliferation of a growing number of smaller satellites and service providers has caused concern among astronomers, around issues such aslight pollutionandspace junk.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsBut they are quickly filling the gap in telecommunications services for remote places where it is too cost-prohibitive to roll out fixed networks or mobile towers, and offer better quality service than geostationary satellites such as the National Broadband Network’s (NBN) Sky Muster satellites.NBN Co is in the advanced stages of selecting an LEO provider to eventually replace the ageing satellite service in operation now – but meanwhile, more than 200,000 people in Australia havesigned up to Elon Musk’s Starlink serviceas an alternative.From fixed to phoneSatellite services have initially been limited to fixed services. But advances in the technology are shifting, allowing people to have direct-to-device access to satellite connections. This means that – provided the person is standing outside – they could access satellite on their mobile phone for texting and calls.In the recent Los Angeles wildfires, T-Mobile used its direct-to-device service in partnership with Starlink to allow customers using existing 4G handsets to make calls and send text messages despite traditional mobile network outages.The Albanese government is banking on this advancement to plug black spots across Australia and make networks more resilient in the event of power outages or natural disasters.Scant detail – and the Elon factorThere is scant detail on how much it would cost. Officials in Senate estimates hearings last week could not put a price tag on the new universal outdoor mobile obligation, saying cost was “a matter for future budget consideration by government”. Current funding for the existing universal service obligations is $270m a year.The government plans to introduce legislation in 2025 after consultation – putting the timeline beyond the next election – and it would not be in place until late 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

The only commercial LEO operator in Australia right now is Starlink. While others, such asAmazon’s Project Kuiper, are planned for Australia, concerns were raised in Senate estimates by the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young as to whether sovereign risk analysis had been done.“If Starlink is the only company, US-owned, what does that mean if somebody – Elon Musk, somebody else, I don’t know – decides that it’s not a service to be offered to Australia?” Hanson-Young asked.James Chisholm, the infrastructure department deputy secretary, said extensive analysis had been conducted, and that despite Starlink playing an important role, the policy “is sending a clear signal” on welcoming other entrants into the market.‘Anything will help’David Howell, a resident of Mount Wilson in the Blue Mountains in NSW, says he estimates about 50% of the approximately 70 properties in his town do not get mobile coverage at home.“Any improvement we can get in mobile reception would be fantastic,” he says. What’s especially important, he adds, is for the community to be able to contact one another during emergency situations, when mobile towers may be down and landlines aren’t working.“Anything will help because it’s very important we be able to contact the community [about] what’s going on, and whether to evacuate or not.”Byrnes says improved coverage would give peace of mind, and make work more efficient.“The more that you can rely on technology, the more efficient that you can become,” he says. “If we’re waiting for a carrier to come and pick up stock or wool or whatever, if they’re running late, we rely on them to give us a heads up, or vice versa.“If we’re sitting around, it’s dead time for everyone.

In the cold light of the day that has followed, the world – and Europe in particular – has woken to the most uncomfortable of realities.The US, the country that has styled itself the indispensable nation, has aligned itself with the enemies of peace and democracy. If “America first” marks simply a shattering moment of US isolationism not seen since the run-up to America’s entry into the Second World War, this would be devastating enough. But, as they gather in London tomorrow, European leaders, Keir Starmer among them, must recognise that the contours of European and global security have been transformed.The first lesson should be acknowledgment of what has been obvious since Trump’s inauguration: the US cannot be relied on as a security, intelligence or trading partner. Washington’s underpinning of Nato, and international security, is no longer a given. By giving succour to a Russia already conductinghostile acts against European countriesbeyond Ukraine, including Britain, Trump has made common cause with the greatest threat facing Europe today.That was reflected in thecomment by Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, after Friday’s degrading White House spectacle, that the “free world needs a new leader”. In practical terms, that must mean an end to the pretence that Trump can be flattered and played.It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to seeThe almost unanimous outpouring of support from European leaders for Zelenskyy andUkraineafter the White House meeting needs to be swiftly followed by a show of unity at the London summit – and by concrete measures to support Ukraine and to preserve the wider peace on the European continent.All of which means hard decisions will need to be made, and quickly, in European capitals, not only on defence spending but in recognising and in communicating to the public that a wider conflict with Russia – and without US support – is not unthinkable but must be actively prepared for.For, while it is easy to see Trump’s actions as the petulant, theatrical and narcissistic reaction of a deeply insecure individual, the consequences go far beyond that. If there is a glimmer of hope, no matter how dim, it is that Trump’s poisonous bluster is underpinned by incoherence and weakness that is open to being challenged.It is important to take stock of the reality with which the world is confronted, not the fantasy some would wish to see. Washington’s abdication of leadership and support for Ukraine requires a rapid and united European response without caveats.As Kallas suggests, that requires European leaders to articulate the values to which they are committed and how they will practically back them, including material aid to Kyiv. Because the Trump administration’s often bizarre and self-harming view of foreign and trade policy, merging unilateralism, territorial expansion and isolationism, can only work in our deeply connected world if other countries allow it to.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAmerica, as Zelenskyy rightly observed, is as vulnerable to Putin’s acts as Ukraine and Europe. Starmer’s visit to Washington last week – following that of the French president, Emmanuel Macron – was a necessary attempt to influence Trump. That effort has failed and it should be clear that there are now red lines, the most obvious of which is the threat to end US aid to Kyiv. After Friday’s events, it is already highly questionable in many minds whether Trump should be granted astate visit to the UK.What should be clear to No 10 is that ending aid to Ukraine would be a step too far for the UK, even for this highly abnormal regime in Washington. Above all, Starmer and other European leaders must insist on the primacy of one of the key founding principles of the post Second World War order, enshrined in international law: territory may not be acquired through military aggression.The starting point for any peace in Ukraine must be to recognise the illegality of Putin’s aggressions, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine should have a seat at the table in all discussions, free from threats and extortion from Trump and his allies. The aim of those discussions should be to see both the full withdrawal of Russian forces and powerful guarantees for Kyiv’s security. At this moment of dark reckoning, we owe it not only to the people of Ukraine; we owe it to ourselves.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead, they wanted to look tough on TVSat 1 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 12.03 ESTShareThe last time Donald Trump did this, it was in secret, and he got impeached over it. In 2019, Donald Trump, on a phone call withVolodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded that the Ukrainian president produce – or fabricate – evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of Trump’s eventual opponent in the 2020 election, in exchange for continued US military aide.At the time,Russiahad already seized control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and was funding violent insurgent groups in the country’s east; it was increasingly clear that a full-scale Russian invasion was coming, as it finally did in 2022. Since the end of second world war, it has been America that checks Russian expansionist ambitions in Europe – America that provided the backstop to the Nato alliance, America that secured the independence of eastern Europe. Trump wanted to condition that longstanding role on Zelenskyy doing him a personal political favor. The international order could be ended, he suggested, if those who depended on him didn’t do enough to indulge his vanity, self-interest and impulsive whims.Something similar was already afoot earlier this week, when Trump summoned Zelenskyy to Washington at the last minute to pressure him to sign a mineral rights deal. Trump wanted to make continued American support for Ukraine’s military effort contingent on American involvement in the country’s mineral industry. But the deal that was offered to Zelenskyy in fact containedno security guarantees: it offered something less like a bilateral agreement and more like a shakedown. Nevertheless Zelenskyy, who is leading a besieged people in danger of losing their country, seemed willing to take it – even after Trump called him a “dictator” last week.But things went downhill from there. Trump seemed determined to antagonize Zelenksyy, making a passive aggressive remark about what the Ukrainian president was wearing when he arrived at the White House. (Sources close to Trumpleaked to Semaforthat the administration was also displeased with Zelenskyy’s “body language”.) In a meeting in the Oval Office, with film crews and reporters present, the US vice-president, JD Vance, began berating Zelenskyy for what he alleged was the Ukrainian president’s disinterest in diplomacy, by which he seems to have meant a Ukrainian surrender on Russia’s terms.When Zelenskyy countered that Russia has not been a reliable partner, breaking promises toUkrainerepeatedly in past ceasefires, Vance began berating him that he was not grateful enough for US support. “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” said Vance, who had initiated the confrontation with cameras in the room, in a practiced cadence. “Have you said thank you once?” Zelenskyy has in fact said “thank you” to the United States many times, including at the outset of the meeting. Both Trump and Vance began raising their voices, ignoring Zelenskyy’s attempts to speak and impugning both his leadership and his personal character. Zelenskyy was soon kicked out, and left the White House without signing the minerals agreement that Trump had nominally summoned him from Ukraine to conclude.It is clear that the post-second world war international order is over. It is clear that Europe will have to look elsewhere, and not to the United States, for its security, and that America will increasingly be isolated among nations, without allies to advance its interests abroad and without friends to share the benefits of science, culture and commerce. Few world leaders, after all, are willing to make deals with such a mercurial partner; fewer still are willing to try, if the attempt will be met with public humiliation in such brutish and bullying style.It is clear that other great powers, including those who do not share what were once America’s stated principles of justice, democracy and human dignity, will fill this vacuum, to America’s detriment. It is clear thatDonald Trumpdoes not intend to check Vladimir Putin’s expansionist ambitions – that he will force a deal in the Ukraine war on Russia’s terms, that Zelenskyy himself will likely be exiled or killed in the aftermath, and that other countries in Europe are in danger.In the hours after the meeting, many world leaders publicly voiced their support for Zelenskyy, including the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. Like him, they stand on the edge of an uncertain future. Russia is on the march, indifferent to borders, laws and freedoms, and the United States will no longer stop them. As an American, I was embarrassed by the display. I am also, now, very scared.Because what Trump did to Zelenskyy on Friday is not a departure from his style: it is entirely typical of his domineering approach to politics – one in which violence or harm is threatened to extort his preferred outcomes, and in which good faith negotiation or even basic dignity is shrugged off in favor of petty displays of domination and cruelty.Trump and Vance, I now think, never really intended to have a conversation with Zelenskky: they intended, instead, to try to make themselves look tough on TV by humiliating him.Jake Paul, a boxer, influencer and alleged crypto scammer who has been a booster of Donald Trump, said of the televised shouting match against a head of state, “This isn’t attacking. This is called being a MAN.”Manliness seems to be all that Trump aspires to: and he defines it, almost exclusively as cruelty. Both on the international stage and on the domestic one, Trump and the crowd of racist, misogynist and endlessly immature idiots who surround him will stop at nothing to prove what men they are – no matter how much America suffers, or how many people die, in the process. At the meeting, when Zelenskky tried to persuade Trump to feel differently about the prospect of Russian expansion, Trump cut him off. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he said. “We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.” Maybe he does.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS politicsUkraineRussiaJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

The onus must fall on ‘coalitions of the willing’ to stop a US-Putin carve-upSat 1 Mar 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 16.35 ESTShareAt moments of great crisis, national leaders and governments generally put their countries’ (and their own) interests first. Transnational geopolitical, economic and security alliances are all very well. But if such organisations do not or cannot rise to the urgent challenges of the day, they risk being bypassed, ignored or shunted aside. This is the predicament now facing theEuropean Union.After Donald Trump’s appalling treatment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in full view of the watching world on Friday night, all agree that the US president’sbetrayal of Ukraine, sickening embrace of Russia and his blunt demand that Europe henceforth defend itself represent just such an extraordinary challenge, and one that must be swiftly addressed.Three developments stand out. One is that Europe’s national leaders are taking charge of crisis management, pushing the EU Commission and, to a lesser degree, US-led Nato to one side.A second phenomenon is the Trump administration’s unprecedented hostility to the EU as an institution. Trump says the EU was created to “screw” the US – a bizarre claim even by his semi-deranged standards. Now he is threatening25% tariffs on EU imports. He is determined to exclude Brussels from talks on Ukraine. Yet he insists Europe must guarantee any future peace.The third, linked, development is the way Britain is unexpectedly being drawn back into the centre of European affairs after nearly a decade of self-imposed estrangement. The need to repair the dangerous folly of Brexit has never been so glaringly obvious. At the same time, Trump wants to use the UK not as a bridge,as Keir Starmer would like, but as a wedge to weaken and divide Europe.Among national leaders, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is in the van. After Trump’s volte-face, he convened an emergency summit in Paris. Then he hot-footed it last week to the White House, where he spoke for Europe in seeking a continuation of US security guarantees, not only for Ukraine butfor the continent as a whole.Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor-elect, is busy urging fellow leaders to “strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieveindependence from the US”. He doubts Nato’s usefulness “in its current form”. Donald Tusk is also taking a prominent role – as Poland’s prime minister, not as the holder of the EU’s rotating presidency.Capitulation to Putin is unacceptable, he says, rebuking Trump. He wants others to match Poland’s above-average defence spending.Where is the EU in this fast-moving crisis? Plodding slowly along. The presence of Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, in Kyiv for last week’s anniversary of Russia’s invasion was largely symbolic. She and the other top Brussels luminary, António Costa, have been ghosted by Trump & co. It appears that no one in Washington sees any need to talk to the EU aboutUkraineor anything else.Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, is trying her best. She flew to the US last week, having finally secured an audience with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. While she was in the air,Rubio cancelled the meeting. It was a deeply offensive, calculated snub, intended to convey contempt for all things EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another “emergency” EU summit isdue this week, where a €20bn Ukraine aid package will be discussed. But as usual, consensus is lacking. Italy, Spain and Portugal are reportedly not keen. And pro-Putin Hungary may play its customary spoiler role, after trying to veto the EU’s latest round of Russia sanctions.Important decisions may be put off again, to 19 March, whenyet another summitwill discuss pooled defence manufacturing, procurement and financing. The fact that an agreed plan to meet Trump’s challenge may prove elusive even then illustrates the bigger problem: in a crisis, the 27-country EU is not nimble enough, too easily paralysed. The need for majority voting on key foreign and security issues and curbs on national vetoes grows urgent.This crisis will not wait. In the meantime, the onus is on national governments and mooted “coalitions of the willing” to keep Ukraine in the fight and prevent a Trump-Putin carve-up. And this is where Britain comes in. Starmer is coordinating closely with Macron on a “reassurance force” for Ukraine. And he is holding his own European leaders’ summit in London tobrief them on his talks with Trump.The wider political significance of a central UK role in boosting and re-organising Europe’s post-Trump defence, outside the confines and constraints of the EU, is plain. Closer cooperation on security and intelligence could in time generate goodwill – and consequently, more non-EU, ad hoc government-to-government cooperation on UK-Europe trade, borders, free movement and other noisome Brexit hangovers.Nato is another multilateral organisation adrift in a world turned upside down. Ukraine aside, Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, hints atbig cuts in US troops in Europe. Does Nato’sarticle 5all-for-one guarantee still hold? Would Trump fight if, say, Poland were attacked? Has the US nuclear umbrella, Nato’s last resort, folded? These are genuine questions, unthinkable only months ago.Nato is traditionally led by a US general. But why have the Americans involved at all? Thirty of Nato’s 32 members are European. It would certainly cost a bomb, but an alliance liberated from Trump could eventually produce the “army of Europe” that Ukraine and leaders like Macron talk about. It could deterRussia. And the US, if need be.At a moment in history when autocratic hyper-nationalists are trying to divvy up the world, multilateral organisations such as the EU, the African Union and the Arab League are more vital than ever. But not if they don’t work. Many, including major UN agencies and the security council itself, need a wake-up call. Desperate times demand bold new thinking. The choice is clear: shape up – or be trumped.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs CommentatorExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionNatoUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

When the prime minister produced his invitation from King Charles – “This is unprecedented!” he said delightedly, of what will be Don’s second state visit to the UK – I half expected him to follow up with a Lego model of the White House, or a special Trump Pez dispenser and a year’s supply of cola-flavoured sweets for it.Alas, I’m unable to be equally scornful of Elon Musk’s edict to federal employees that they tell him in an email of five things they accomplished in the last week. Oh yes, it’s silly. Who’ll look through these, and how will they check the enclosed bullet points aren’t the work of the office satirist? But as a compulsive list-maker myself, my outrage is on the muted side. Sheepishly, I shuffle my notebooks, their closely written pages so replete with determination, wild ambition and pathos, I come off like some tragic hybrid of Adrian Mole and Martha Stewart.Oh, the striving. In terms of immediate action, I have three lists on the go at any one time: to do today; to do this week; to do at some point soon. But this is as nothing compared with my future achievement lists, of which I have dozens in play. These are floaty and nebulous, their headings along the lines of “ideas”, “thoughts” or (how embarrassing) “composers I should get into”. The most shaming of them is “things I want” (a painting by Ivon Hitchens or, failing that, a little bit of Chanel).As for year end lists, they take many guises, from praise (what did I do that anyone liked?) to all the new novels I read (old novels don’t count). Protestant autodidact that I am, I simply cannot function without lists: several days ago, this column began as one – “poss items for Notebook” – and when it’s complete, it’ll be crossed off yet another.The gas man comethView image in fullscreen‘Kids, it was colder back then, and our parents more stingy with the thermostat.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianLiving for three weeks without a boiler in a cold snap is an exercise in gratitude as well as stoicism. When the man from British Gas finally arrives to save us, I forgive him even when he accidentally smashes a favourite vase. I could kiss our fiercely hot radiators now, and may yet build some kind of household shrine in their honour.During this period of refrigeration, my fingers and toes began to burn and itch, which confused me at first. Perhaps our Captain Oates jokes were about to stop being funny. (“I’m just going outside, I may be some time,” we would say, on leaving the only heated room.)But then I remembered: I’d been here before as a teenager. Kids, it was colder then, and our parents were more stingy with the thermostat. I had chilblains, a paradoxical Dickensian ailment that only becomes the more agonising when your extremities begin to warm up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Money has always talked, especially in the US. Years ago, Lawrence Lessig, the great legal scholar, calculated that most of the campaign funding for members of Congress and aspiring politicians came from one-twentieth of the richest 1% of Americans – about 150,000 people. This is about the same number as those who are named “Lester”and explains the title of his book:The USAIs Lesterland.But that particular corruption of American politics only involved billionaires like the Koch brothers playing organ-grinders to congressional monkeys. The obscene wealth generated by the tech industry has catapulted a new organ-grinder into the heart of the machine. He was able to pay his way in with a spare quarter of a billion dollars that he happened to have lying around. And now the wretched citizens of the US find themselves living in Muskland.At the time he made the decision to ensure that Trump got elected, Musk wasestimated to be worth $244bn. That didn’t mean, of course, that he had that amount of hard cash in his possession, just that he owned millions of shares in a number of companies that he had founded which were judged by investors to be valuable liquid assets that could be sold if necessary.Hold on to that thought: it may come in useful.How did Musk become so rich? It started, really, with PayPal, of which he was one of the founders, and from the sale of which he emerged with enough money ($175.8m) to become an early investor inTeslaand chair of its board. In 2002, he founded the rocket company SpaceX and, later, Starlink – which has launched thousands of low-orbit satellites for providing internet connectivity to remote regions. In 2015, he founded a solar power company, Tesla Energy, and Neuralink, a company aiming to integrate the human brain with AI the following year. In 2017, he founded The Boring Company, which did what it said on the tin, namely digging tunnels.At the moment, Musk looks unstoppable because he hasn’t yet triggered Trump’s narcissistic envyAnd then in October 2022 he lost his mind, bought Twitter, and renamed it X. This last decision was a commercial disaster, but it gave him a huge megaphone which he deployed to support Trump’s campaign. It also got him a place right at the heart of the US government, with a mandate to dig deep into the machine, find out how it worked and – allegedly – to detect fraud and eliminate waste.As his goons were rooting through the innards of the federal payment system, one wonders if they came across some of the disbursements that the government has made to his companies. Payments from Nasa to SpaceX, for example, for launching stuff into orbit – or eventually bringing home astronauts from the International Space Station. Or subsidies and tax refunds to Tesla, whose early survival was ensured by government loans.There are some rich ironies to be found here. Could the Elon Musk who ranted that the US should“get rid of all subsidies”be the same Elon Musk who decided to build SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and Starlink in the US rather than in his native South Africa? For, as the tech punditScott Galloway puts it: “There would be no SpaceX without Nasa, its largest customer. Tesla built its Fremont factory with a $465m DoE loan in 2010, and its first 200,000 cars benefited from tax credit subsidies of up to $7,500. For years the company was able to report profits thanks to the ‘sale’ of emissions credits to other carmakers. All told, the company has accepted an estimated $2.5bn in government support.” And all of those subsidies went through the federal payments machine.At the moment, Musk looks unstoppable because he hasn’t yet triggered Trump’s narcissistic envy, and his wealth isolates from the consequences of his actions. But nothing lasts for ever and there are some encouraging straws in the wind. One is that Tesla is no longer looking as good as it once did. Sales of its carsare down 45%in Europe – at a time when EV sales there are generally up by 37%. And Muskwagens are losing ground to increasingly more attractive EVs from Kia and the Chinese challenger BYD.And then there’s what Tesla owners are ruefully calling “the Musk factor”. Owners of the company’s hideous Cybertruck, for example are finding red swastikas spray-painted on them in car parks. One sometimes sees Tesla saloons with embarrassed notices on their side windows saying “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy”. There’s even a postershowing Muskstanding in a Tesla giving a Nazi salute with the caption “0 to 1939 in 3 Seconds”. And Tesla stock is now on a downward track, which means that Musk’s net worth is not what it was. Who knows, maybe one day Trump will be richer than him after he’s finished looting Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After years of speculation that powerful people have been concealing information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender, the Trump administration said earlier this week that it would release unseen details about the case.“Breaking news right now, you’re going to see some Epstein information being released by my office,” Pam Bondi, the attorney general, told Fox Newson Wednesday night. “This will make you sick.”Apparently intent on treating this “new” Epstein information like an album drop rather than a horrific sex-trafficking case involving the abuse of young girls, the White House gave a bunch of influencers a first look at the information. On Thursday, Bondi’s team handed out big white binders labelled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “The Most Transparent Administration in History” to a group of 15 rightwing activists and self-styled “citizen journalists” visiting the White House. Grinning gleefully, these influencers proceeded to pose for the press with the binders like they were trophies from a school sports day.So what was in those binders? A whole lot of heavily redacted nothing, basically. A bunch of people at Bondi’s office appear to have hastily printed out Epstein’scontact book, which was published by the (now shuttered) website Gawker a decade ago, along with other information that has been in the public domain for years. They then shoved 200 pages of printouts into binders and gave them to a handpicked collection of useful idiots. Being as they’re the most transparent administration in American history,the justice department also made the information available on its website later that day – along with a note acknowledging that there wasn’t actually much to see. “The first phase of declassified files largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government,” the note said.“This isn’t a news story, it’s a publicity stunt,” the Palm Beach lawyer Spencer Kuvin, who has worked on the case since 2005, representing nine victims,told the Miami Herald. He added that he feared that the Trump administration was using Epstein’s victims for political purposes. But then what do you expect from Trump – a guy who, in 2002 said of Epstein: “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It’s even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do. And many of them are on the younger side.”In short, this whole big “reveal” was an embarrassing flop – so much so that it was mocked by people on the right. Even Laura Loomer, a white nationalist conspiracy theorist, thought the stunt was distasteful.“I hate to say it, but the American people can’t trust the validity of the Epstein files released today. It was released in an unprofessional manner with paid, partisan social media influencers to curate their binders for us,” Loomertweeted on Thursday. She later added: “Sorry I won’t celebrate dancing like a school girl with a binder full of pedophile names.” When even Loomer thinks you’ve gone low, you’ve gone very low indeed.Ultimately, however, while nothing new may have been revealed in Bondi’s “Epstein files”, this grotesque stunt was very revealing. It was yet another reminder that there is nothing – not even the sex trafficking of minors – that Donald Trump and his associates won’t cynically turn into a self-serving photo opportunity. Or, I should add, an opportunity to “Rickroll” people: midday Thursday, while people were waiting for the documents to be published online, the House judiciary GOP account on Xposted in all-caps: “#BREAKING: EPSTEIN FILES RELEASED.” This thenredirected usersto the YouTube music video for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit Never Gonna Give You Up. Classy.Also revealing was who the White House thought should get a first look at documents involving sex trafficking. Among the influencers assembled was Mike Cernovich. Who is he? Just a rightwing manosphere influencer whohas said things like“rape via an alpha male is different from other forms of rape” and told men that women exist “for your sexual pleasure”.The reaction to the backlash over the Epstein files fiasco also shows how, when anything goes wrong, people in Trump’s orbit are quick to point fingers and turn on each other rather than take responsibility. Bondi, for example, responded to all the criticism byaccusing the FBIof withholding information from her. Meanwhile, some of the conservative influencers who got the binders full of nothing accused the southern district of New York of hiding information.“These swamp creatures at SDNY deceived Bondi, Kash, and YOU,” the conservative media personalityLiz Wheeler tweeted. “Be outraged that the binder is boring. You should be. Because the evil deep state LIED TO YOUR FACE.”Perhaps what is most revealing about this fiasco, however, is that it is a stark reminder of how justice still hasn’t been served when it comes to Epstein’s many victims. Apart from Ghislaine Maxwell, none of Epstein’s manyenablersand associates have faced any real consequences. A lot of rich and powerful people have got away with disgraceful things. And that’s not a conspiracy theory; that’s just our legal system.Andrew Tate and brother land in US from Romania after travel ban liftedSpeaking of predators evading accountability, theTate brothers, who are charged with human trafficking in Romania,landed in the US on Thursday. This comes after it was reported last week that the Trump administration had asked Romanian authorities to lift travel restrictions on the pair.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate (foreground) with brother Tristan outside the court in Bucharest, Romania, on 9 January 2025.Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP‘Pro-lifers’ are demanding women face the death penaltySelf-described “abortion abolitionists” – who oppose all abortions without any exceptions and want to criminalize the procedure and ban IVF – used to be at the fringes of the anti-abortion movement. Now, people who believe that the death penalty should be considered for women who have abortions are slowly moving into the US mainstream.Mother Jones looks at howsome of these abolitionist men have turned on women in the anti-abortion movement. “We need Christian men leading the fight against abortion, not feminist women,” one of those “TheoBros” recently wrote.At least six children die of hypothermia amid freezing conditions in GazaI haven’t heard any pro-lifersget upset about this.Jeff Bezos is sending Katy Perry to spaceLast year, Perry came out with Woman’s World, her first solo single in three years and, she said, “the first contribution I have given since becoming a mother and since feeling really connected to my feminine divine”. Unfortunately, her contribution waspanned so mercilesslythat Perry is now taking her feminine divine as far away from the world as possible: the singer willfly to spaceduring Blue Origin’s next (all-female) crewed mission, the Jeff Bezos-owned space companyhas announced. Rumour has it that if you work at the Washington Post and have any opinions that have thetemerity to clash with Bezos’s, then you’ll get shot into space, too.The pill hasn’t been improved in years – no wonder women are giving up on itMisinformation from wellness influencers along with a conservative backlash against birth control is causing more people to stop taking the pill. “But there’s another, underlying problem when it comes to contraception,”writes Martha Gill. “It needs to improve … It’s common for women to be using the same methods as their mothers – or even their grandmothers. Why aren’t contraceptives getting better?”The week in porktriarchyBig news for anyone with a small child:Peppa Pig’s mother(Mummy Pig) is having a new little piglet. Not sure how they can afford three children in this day and age but maybe Mummy Pig has been trading meme coins. While I’m sure Elon “have more babies” Musk is thrilled by the baby announcement, it is not clear how Cardi B feels.

This is the traditional point when one is supposed to muse, baffled, over youth vernacular, perhaps balk at theClockwork Orange-esque strangenessof it all.Sure enough, there are some I don’t know: “poggers” (enthusiasm); “drip” (stylish clothes/accessories); “touch grass” (time outside). However, others I’ve heard of: “finsta” (fake Instagram account to fool parents); “NPC” (non-player character; a nobody); “clout” (influence); “rizz” (charisma); “brat” (confident, rebellious). In fact, there are quite a few on the list I already know. Too many.First, it should be acknowledged that it is a modern parent’s inalienable human right to wind their children up by deploying their slang back at them. After picking up the phrase fromLove Island, I had months of fun telling my youngest daughter not to “deep it” (overthink something). The good news: it appears that I am not the 21st-century equivalent of the 20th-centuryjudge who hadn’t heard of the Beatles. The bad news: I could be something far worse. A pan-cultural youth-vampire, sinking my old, greedy, generation X fangs deep into the young – their words, clothes, music, TV, films – and refusing to let go. What’s more, look around, and it’s clear I’m not alone.You’ll have heard of cultural appropriation: the hijacking of the culture of others by a dominant people or society without recognition or permission. Perhaps there’s a form of generational appropriation that involves older people commandeering youth-signifiers, to the point they leave nothing that actual young people can identify as just their own.What music do you listen to? Is it that different from young people? Do you feel you have the full, non-embarrassed run of Spotify? What programmes do you watch? What food do you eat? Do you buy your clothes from strictly demarcated grownup shops, or do you end up online looking at jackets, shoes and tops aimed at younger people, rationalising that they won’t look like that on you, so that’s completely fine and normal?If the urban myths are to be believed, young people can barely go to gigs or festivals without their parents trying to tag along (well, they did have to buy the tickets). They can’t rebelliously get tiny ankle tattoos because their parents have made them an uncool, middle-aged quirk. And so it goes on. For some time now, older generations haven’t just observed youth, as they have always done – they have taken from it, filleted it, sucked it dry and nourished themselves.It’s not as if there is anything new per se about older people invading youth culture. As far back as the 1990s, tax-paying, property-owning adult men riding skateboards, and grownup professional women modelling Little Miss Naughty T-shirts, were being observed out in the wild. And, after all, where is the harm – why should people have to stiffly keep to their own age brackets, or be made to feel old before their time?Moreover, it’s understandable that people are fascinated by younger generations, as well as, at times, alarmed and saddened. All those reports about young people shirking sex and alcohol (laudable and smart, in many ways). The pernicious effect of online porn and mobile phones (only last week,Denmark banned themfrom classrooms and after-school clubs). The cyclical concern aboutmental health(last year, one in three in the 18-24 bracket had reported mental health issues such as anxiety or depression). Hasgen Z struggleda lot more than previous cohorts, or just refused to be stigmatised and silent about it?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which is hardly surprising, considering all the other factors making young lives dark and difficult: climate change; the pandemic; tuition fees plunging them into sinkholes of debt; war; injustice… the list sprawls on.Still, older people being concerned about younger generations is one thing; gatecrashing their culture quite another. In all the debates that periodically ignite about gen Z, amid the constant scrutiny and conjecture, are we guilty of forgetting that they’ve been deprived all along of the one thing most older people could take for granted: a youth-scape to call their own? As for “Where’s the harm?”, are we kidding ourselves?In the realm of music alone, older generations might have inadvertently helped to hike up the costs, and price young people out. If older people weren’t involved in elite big-ticket pop concerts and music festivals (paying for their children, or actually attending), would there be any justification (or market) for thempreposterously costinghundreds of pounds? Beyond mere student discounts, should there be official age-tested sharply reduced tickets so that actual young people can afford them?Similarly, concern over mobile phones in classrooms is reasonable, but perhaps phones are one of the few spaces where young people achieve a modicum of generational privacy and agency. And what is slang if not an attempt to have a private, secret language (likePolariwas back when it was illegal and dangerous to be gay). Is that why teenagers update it so often – they want to keep it just for themselves, locking out nosy fogies like me?At this late stage of what could be termed generational osmosis, there is no stuffing the genie back into the bottle, but we could at least be aware. Listen, fam, no need to deep it. Just sometimes, back off, and let the young have some cultural space to themselves.Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I stopped by to help a friend close up, the bell ringing as I opened the door, flipped the sign and started on a familiar path. I would eye the spines of the books, gaze at the dark folds of menswear and squat over milk crates of vinyl. I didn’t always know what I needed from that shop. It was a ritual, and I was searching.I was a student, working as a janitor, living in a crowded house. The op shop ritual helped with things I couldn’t otherwise afford: clothes for an interview, a toolkit, the bag I took to class.

There are for-profit international thrift store chains and the not-for-profit secondhand retailers seem increasingly modernised. It feels like there’s less stock available, and it’s more selective.I think of the darkened op shops of old – the church basements, the sheds, the tip shops. I found useful things there, but I also found the weird, the joyful. I bought a record collection for a dollar a piece and a century-old edition of Little Women. I found creepy antique dolls. I step into a newer store and see orderly rows of common items, resellers scanning the racks with image-recognition technology on their phones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have buried milk-teeth in pillows, faced my father’s funeralThose old shops felt chaotic, outside time and liminal spaces for liminal phases of life. There, I found the women’s costume jewellery I wore in goth night clubs as a teen, the jacket I wore to look professional as a writer in a new city and toys for my baby after I moved back home. Op shops supply for rite-of-passage, and I wasn’t just looking for old things to use but finding new ways to live. We use things to make meaning. Op shops sell us possibility.It has been a year of growing pains and grief. I have buried milk-teeth in pillows, faced my father’s funeral. There are friends I no longer know, parts of myself I can never be. I have reached that strange age when fewer things are possible, when life isn’t just about finding things, but losing them.The fact is that disruptive times have affected secondhand retailers, too. Peopledon’t donate as they once did, increasinglyreselling or swapping their valuable items. Op shops can face increasing overheads, not to mention the cost of moving unsellable donations. Many also rely on volunteers, a demographic that hasdeclined during the cost-of-living crisis.Many secondhand retailers fundraise for social services, from food insecurity to animal welfare. They serve a purpose and build community (not just provide bargain dopamine hits for members of the consumer class in existential crisis). Op shops are cleaner now and more accessible. I see people walking out of these places with boxes of useful things, things they need. Things I already have.Are op shops ruined, or have they just changed with the times? As all things do, as perhaps I should as well? I take some things I no longer use and bury them in a box: clothes that no longer fit, books I won’t finish (though not my century-old Little Women). Whatever I’m looking for, it’s time to let old things go. I can’t make my way forward while still holding on.The op shop of my younger years is still there, though things have changed. I lay my box at the counter but decide against the old ritual of searching. I have everything I need. Perhaps making our way through adult life isn’t just about the grief of losing things but the joy of giving them away too.When we’re young, we search for who we are. We can lose that with the passing of time - when the path becomes less familiar. The bell rings as the door closes behind me. Sometimes, new meaning comes from letting go.Anthony N Castleis a writer living on Kaurna land, AdelaideExplore more on these topicsShopping tripsOpinionAgeingcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s the end of the line for soft, middle-class authors. Lefty-baiting headteacherKatharine Birbalsinghhas declared that “gentle parenting” advice books by middle-class writers are sabotaging families by insisting adults become friends with their children.She’s probably got a point – most mums and dads have watched with a cocked eyebrow as a Boden-clad parent has tranquilly informed little Johnny that punching another child in the face while playing in the sandpit “might not be what they like” – but I say Birbalsingh is not going far enough. Why stop with the parenting books? Why not fillet the whole damn bookcase of toxically middle-class ideas? Visionaries such as Chairman Mao have tried it before – with, admittedly, mixed results – but this time we’ll do it right.Let’s face it, the bookshelf in every Victorian terrace house with a side return extension isn’t there to be read, it’s there to be seen. Your copy ofYuval Noah Harari’sSapienshas been avidly absorbed right up to the second chapter; the Jilly Cooper hidden in your bedside cabinet, on the other hand, is so well used that some of those pages have been torn to shreds. Why the disparity? Crippling middle-class literary competitiveness.It’s hard to say why books ever became objects of show, rather than functional items, though we can probably blame the monks who spent their years copying out and beautifying volumes for nothing more than the aggrandisement of their order and the prospect of centuries-later inclusion in Umberto Eco mysteries. The Reformation thankfully put paid to that game. So now a domestic Reformation may be called for.How best to clean up that toxically middling bookcase? First off, there’s the low-hanging fruit. Any textbook on parenting that sports a soft-focus cover image of a child happily walking hand in hand with a grownup, written by anyone with a double-barrelled surname, is straight into the recycling bin. Ditto for anything recommended by an ethereally calm Instagram influencer or a member of the Green party. Burn before reading. Protect yourself. Protect your family.After that, we’re on to the fiction. The golden rule is: nothing in translation. If it was written by anyone who lives more than 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, it’s out. Keep in mind, too, that anything described as “vital” or “necessary” by a newspaper critic is to be viewed with the deepest suspicion. No book is “vital” or “necessary”. Not one.After disposing of the wrong’uns, you’ll want to replace them with the sort of book that Nigel Farage likes to read:Scouting for Boys,The Dangerous Book for Boys,The Boy’s Own Annual 1948. Something about a loyal dog, perhaps.If you’re looking for a literary classic,Nicholas Nicklebyis a solid choice in the family home, due to a depiction of Victorian schooling that will scare the bejeezus out of any child; hopefully terrifying them into doing something at school other than vaping and recording violent drill rap TikToks. Immerse your offspring in these reliable works and they’ll thank you one day.At the very least, if you make these changes there will no longer be any danger of being “friends” with children; and anyone who has heard the drivel they come out with will appreciate the value of this.Reading, like the curious American phenomenon the spelling bee, has too often become divorced from its primary literary function and turned into a method of social place-staking: leave boxing to the working class, polo to the aristocrats, the middling folk have novels by Salman Rushdie to be paraded in conversation. It’s time we thought about how to reset that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead of displaying your books like Ernest Hemingway showing off the head of some rhino he’s blasted to kingdom come, shut them away to be enjoyed privately, perhaps by candlelight.Then we can drop all the pretence. If you like a felon-bashing Jack Reacher story, fill yer boots and be proud of it. If you secretly want to binge the latest Dan Brown romp, then why not? Anyone judging you for doing so is really only jealous. Just think how much more space you will have on your bookshelf forThe Da Vinci CodeorJack Reacher: Killing Floorwhen you’ve ditched Sally Rooney’s latest navel-gazing drear.Once the novels are gone, keep checking along the shelf and decide what you actually look through. All those Yotam Ottolenghi cookbooks that leave you searching for herbs hand-plucked from the slopes of the Judaean mountains, when the children would be happier with chicken nuggets, can go; and the same for all those biographies of Nelson Mandela thatsoundreally interesting but have never been opened. If you don’t use or read them, they’re ballast to be dropped.Once we stop treating books as relics for show and veneration, we can also stop treating their authors as prophets. Like football players commenting on international relations, the fact that someone has been handed a megaphone really doesn’t mean they have the first clue what they’re shouting about. Yet, social mores seem to weigh on middle-class parents to largely outsource the raising of their young to books. This is despite that fact that doing so devolves all moral instruction to Peppa Pig.We can end on positive news, though: it was revealed last week that many childrenhave stopped reading almost entirelyand now prefer to have the words spoon-fed to them by audiobook. That will make it easier to conceal from your finger-wagging middle-class peers the fact that they like Enid Blyton books.Holmes and Moriarty, the new authorised Sherlock Holmes novel by Gareth Rubin, is out nowExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

It has since regressedThe cost of pessimistic individualism was measured in tens of thousands of livesStephen ReicherProfessor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British AcademyGreat calamities often provoke reflections about the human condition.The Lisbon earthquake of 1755led people to reconsider their relationship with God, and compelledVoltaire to viciously lampoon Leibniz’s notionthat we live in the best of all possible worlds.The 1918-19 influenza pandemicforced people to rethink how they relate to the natural world, inspiring a new style of architecture, a new appreciation of the outdoors, and a range of back-to-nature movements. And Covid … ?Well, judging by the coverage of the inquiry so far, the big issues seem to behow government figures used WhatsAppandwho uttered which obscenity about whom.But despite this masterclass in trivialisation, Covid did have something profound to teach us about the relationship of individuals to society. For nearly two centuries, since the spectacular growth of cities sparked by the advent of industrialisation, western social thought has been obsessed with how to maintain control.Once people were concentrated together and physically separated from their erstwhile masters, would they still respect the old hierarchies? Or would they join together to dismantle them?This was reflected ina profound fear of the masses, particularly ofcrowds. The social elites lived in perpetual fear of the howling mobs. The outcome was a pervasive pessimism about the popular psyche and an entrenched anti-collectivism. This still dominates my discipline, psychology. It is reflected in the notion that human reasoning, at best, is inherently flawed, and that the flaws are accentuated when we act in groups. Such viewsare popular in government, and they shaped the initial response to Covid – with disastrous consequences.Remember “behavioural fatigue” – the notion that people would lack the psychological resilience to cope with stringent measures? This contributed to the delay of the first lockdown. Yet concerns that the masses wouldn’t measure up were ill-founded. The common threat of Covid led people to develop a shared identity based around community. People became more concerned about the fate of others, which was reflected in enduring levels of adherence to stringent restrictions – even though, by following the lockdown rules, many suffered considerable hardships. Resilience, it turned out, was not something people lacked, but something that arises when people think and act as a group.For many, though, that realisation came too late.It has been estimatedthat, had Britain locked down a week earlier, it could have saved more than 30,000 people. Two weeks, and up to 40,000 more people would have survived. The cost of pessimistic individualism was ultimately measured in tens of thousands of lives.The Covid response of the UK government was shot through with the notion that we, the people, were very much part of the problem. Disdain was the defining feature of the Johnson government’s approach, visible in his refusal to be candid about the challenges we faced, in the policy of blame and punishment for those breaking the rules, and in the government’s refusal to engage with communities and provide them with the resources they needed to comply with the rules. It was perhaps best encapsulated by Matt Hancock’s explanation for why the government repeatedly refused calls to increase support for self-isolation: becausepeople would game the system.The story of Covid is one of an opportunity missed through ideological myopia. Far from being a problem, the public were the best asset the government had in dealing with the pandemic. Rather than harnessing that asset, ministers ignored and undermined it. They did so precisely because of their fear of the masses. So, for me, the big issue to come out of Covid is the need to rethink the relationship between the individual and the collective. Far from eroding our rationality, the group empowers us, makes us agents of our own fate and provides resilience in hard times. If we don’t understand that, we will have learned nothing from Covid, and the next pandemic response will be as much of a shambles as the last.Is it time for the big Covid novel?Sophie MackintoshAuthor whose debut novel, The Water Cure, was longlisted for the 2018 Booker prizeIt’s been five years since the start of the Covid pandemic, and yet there have been few novels grappling explicitly with its impact. Earlier this year I was speaking to the Norwegian author Helga Flatland about her novelToxic, at the Kerala literature festival.It struck me that hers was one of the few books I’ve read that firmly locates itself in that specific era. The events are set in motion by the first lockdowns: the protagonist moves from Oslo to the countryside, and the novel is punctuated with Zoom calls, bubbles and online classes.In Toxicthe pandemic is present, rather than viewed from a distance. But then, where are the big novels reflecting on what the experience has taught us, shown us? Has it even taught us anything, seeing as it seems our position, as a society, is mostly one of denial? Talking about “pandemic literature” as a concept also makes it seem as if it’s over, when the lives of many people continue to be irrevocably altered by Covid. There’s a clear beginning, but no definitive ending. Five years, in this context, seems like no time at all.I spoke to my editor, Hermione Thompson, editorial director at Hamish Hamilton, who agreed that it just still might be too soon. “We start trying to make sense of an event from the moment it kicks off, and art which comes out of that white heat of experience can be incredibly powerful,” she said. “But you have to wait a bit longer – often a lot longer – for the wider picture to come into focus. And once you can see it, perhaps you have to wait a while more before you can bear to actually look at it.” Her submission pile is full of escapist stories. Readers, she told me, perhaps want “to be taken as far away as possible from the frightening prospect of reality”.Perhaps it makes sense to think of Covid’s impact on fiction as something more abstract. I’ve come to see my third novel,Cursed Bread, as a pandemic novel of sorts, though it’s set in 1950s France, against the background of a mass poisoning. This appealed at the time, allowing me to escape as I wrote it in a frantic burst of energy between January 2020 and January 2021. But you can’t shut out the world entirely, and it was only afterwards that I saw obvious influences: a novel about desire in which the protagonist is hardly touched, the impact of collective trauma, a feverish claustrophobia.Thompson singled out Ali Smith’sCompanion Piece, and last year’sBooker prize winner, Orbital, as standout novels inspired by the experience of lockdown. But my favourite Covid novel isBurntcoatby Sarah Hall – released in October 2021, a mere 18 months after that first lockdown. Eerily prescient in its portrayal of a virus that lingers in the body, it’s also expansive, asking questions about art, love and creation in the face of disaster. Written in that aforementioned “white heat”, it didn’t wait for the event to feel distant, but captured that strange time as it happened – and perhaps in that state of rawness yielded something that felt more true and significant.Partygate was the perfect scandal to mobilise resentment of a remote and arrogant political classRafael BehrGuardian columnist and leader writerWhat politicians do is generally more important than where they do it. But the pandemic brought an unusual focus on the spaces where power is wielded – the rooms where stuff happened; how many people were there; whether what they were doing counted as work under lockdown regulations. Those questions, and Boris Johnson’s inability to give straight answers, ended up being more consequential for politics than the deadly effects of the virus itself.It was not the cost of bad decisions made in No 10 that brought down the prime minister, but theafter-hours partiesin the same building. Both failings were twin expressions of Johnson’s disorderly character. A leader with an ethical compass who exuded professional discipline by day would not have generated a workplace culture that licensed rowdy piss-ups by night.Partygate was explosive because it made a mockery of millions of sacrifices by law-abiding citizens who had answered the call of duty to suspend their own needs, to forgo weddings, birthdays, funerals, in a communal struggle against the virus. It was the perfect scandal to mobilise resentment of a remote and arrogant political class that doesn’t feel bound by rules it imposes on everyone else.This was hardly a new sentiment. But it was intensified by feelings of betrayal after the initial phase of the pandemic, which had been marked by a spirit of national solidarity. The prime minister benefited from that mood. His poll ratings were not dented by fatal early policy vacillations. His popularity peaked around the time that he was personally incapacitated by Covid.Johnson’s landslide victory in the 2019 general election, on a pledge to “get Brexit done”, conveyed a strong public appetite for calmer, less ferociously partisan politics. The first lockdown effectively delivered just that. Theenabling law– monumentally draconian for a democracy – was bundled through parliament in four days. The famously raucous Commons chamber was muted by social distancing strictures. Chronic dysfunction at the centre, wasteful misallocation of resources, lethal hesitation and divisions over strategy – these didn’t go unreported. There were intimations of the coming unravelling, not least in the furore around Dominic Cummings’snotorious excursionto Barnard Castle. Politics was not suspended. But it was muted for months. With Partygate, the staggering degeneracy of Johnson’s regime was vomited before the public gaze.The scale of administrative dysfunction and the deficit of accountability were functions of a political culture that resists modernisation, venerates dilettantism and conflates rhetorical dexterity with judgment. When Britain needed serious, sober leadership, it found itself at the mercy of inadequate, clownish whimsy. That was a tragedy but not an accident; a feature of the system, not a bug.The debauching of Downing Street during lockdown was unlawful and the prime minister’s dishonest denials put him in contempt of parliament. Those were the technical offences that finished his career. But the true penalty is still being paid by everyone else. It is measured in heightened cynicism and depleted trust in governing institutions that need to command public confidence for democracy to function.As Chinese factories closed, the fragility of global trade was revealedLaleh KhaliliProfessor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian PeninsulaSuzhou, a city in eastern China, is where the world’s technology is made. Its factories produce products for companies such as Foxconn and Samsung, and are staffed by millions of labourers, mostly migrant workers from rural China. In late January 2020, Suzhou’s municipal government,following Beijing’s orders,took the unprecedented step of extending the lunar new year holidays and delaying the return of migrant workers. Transport in and out of China slowed to a crawl. Factory towns, including Suzhou, closed. While media coverage of lockdowns focused on their human impact, the pandemic transformed supply chains, and had a huge impact on global trade.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Eleanor Shakespeare/The GuardianAt sea, ships were in effect stranded; with ports closed, there was nowhere to dock their cargo. International maritime treaties dictate that seafarers shouldn’t spend more than 11 continuous months at sea. According to the International Maritime Organization, the number of sailors working long after the end of their contractsrose to 400,000. Some remained on their ships for more than 22 months, wandering the world’s seas with no end in sight. On land, last-mile logistics drivers delivering food and groceries were designated as frontline workers. In Britain, along with nurses and bus drivers, they were among the largest group of workers who became ill with Covid.Not everyone suffered from the effects of the virus. Shipping companies sought subsidies from governments, even as increased demand for goods meant their rates rose totheir highest in history, netting them eye-watering profits. Because Chinese trade slowed, so too did the production, sale and export of personal protective equipment (PPE) beyond the Chinese border. Spying an opportunity, charlatans with excellent connections to the British government set up companies to provide PPE, and cleaned up on lucrative contracts for often defective or even nonexistent products.The week-long closure of the Suez canal in March 2021 by a ship run aground had little to do with Covid-19, but only confirmed the fragility of the ostensibly efficient and frictionless global logistical routes that defined our world. This realisation compelled some European and US corporations to shift their factories nearer to home, to the peripheries of Europe or the Mexican borderlands. The US had already been threatening a trade war with China long before the slowdown, and“nearshoring”neatly fitted with this new strategic posture.During his first term as president, Donald Trump blamed the pandemic on alleged biological warfare by the Chinese government. In his second term, some of the stories he spun back then can be marshalled for a new purpose. Capitalism’s common features – the offshoring of industry, the outsourcing of labour and the skyrocketing costs of shipping – can now be blamed on a nefarious Chinese agenda. As Trump effects a flurry of executive orders implementing tariffs against China and many other trading partners, we’re seeing the new era of trade that Covid helped to accelerate.The pandemic unmasked denial and resentment towards disabled peopleFrances RyanGuardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled PeopleMy earliest memory is the tins of peas. A couple of weeks into the first Covid lockdown, I was getting used to being stuck at home 24/7. Like millions of other clinically vulnerable people,the shielding programmemeant I wasn’t even supposed to go to the shops for fruit and veg (or gin). In the back of the cupboard, I wasrelieved to findsome vitamins and, with them, a shred of hope.It was a hard time for many, of course, but a few things made it easier. With theatres and the pub closed, entertainment was beamed remotely to our front rooms – access many disabled people hadlong dreamed of. At the same time, the public were taking Covid protections – from masks to testing – that helped keep those of us at high risk as safe as we could be.Five years on, I would like to say such progress continued but I think we all know that would be a lie. Remote access to social and cultural events has largely been revoked now non-disabled people no longer need it. While WFH has been normalised, it’s repeatedly dismissed as anexcuse to skive.Since the last legal Covid protections wereremoved in 2022, clinically vulnerable people have been left with the “choice” of in effect shielding indefinitely orrisking our liveseach time we go out. Many disabled readers have told me they no longer feel able to do simple things like have a pint with a friend. Others with long Covid have lost jobs and relationships. The “return to normal” did not include everyone.It isn’t simply that the things that helped clinically vulnerable people to stay safe have gone – there’s pushback to the idea that we even deserve them. Simply wearing a mask ourselves in 2025 – let alone asking someone else to – is enough to get yelled at by a stranger in Tesco. It feels at times as if the pandemic unmasked (no pun intended) a blend of denial and resentment towards disabled people, as if our needs are simultaneously a reminder of a time society would rather forget, and evidence of a sense of entitlement from an uppity minority. As one district nurse told me last year when I asked if she would mind testing for Covid before she came to my home if I gave her a lateral flow test: “It isn’t for people like you to tell us what to do.”Whether it’s anger over the benefits bill or a bus having apriority wheelchair space, there’s a longstanding prejudice that disabled people are costly and demanding when all we are asking is to be able to live. In that way, the pandemic didn’t change negative attitudes towards disability – it just exacerbated them.It’s natural to want to gain from a bad situation, as if all the pain wasn’t for nothing. Perhaps, though, real progress comes in being honest: in saying we tried for equality and solidarity but fell short. It is only in admitting our shortcomings as a country that we will ever do better for disabled people – to figuratively dig in the back of the cupboard together and find the peas.Online teaching has made education more atomised and mechanicalWilliam DaviesSociologist and political economist. His latest book is Unprecedented? How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our EconomyFrom time to time, a student contacts me having found a relic from the 2020-2021 academic year. Not some social distancing tool, although campuses still have plastic screens that haven’t yet been disposed of, or the bits of gaffer tape on carpet that students were instructed not to cross.No, these students have come across some actual treasure: alecture video, still stored in the cloud, but no longer accessible. The question is: since they can’t attend a lecture, can I release the video instead?There are usually practical reasons why not. Lectures change from year to year. But the bigger question this poses is what is the case for in-person attendance in the first place? Universities made it through the pandemic thanks to digital platforms and “edtech”. The difficulty is how to put the genie back in the bottle, and resuscitate what made a campus a valuable space of congregation in the first place. As in schools, falling studentattendance levelsare one of the many scars left by Covid-19.Putting the other mental-health legacies of lockdowns to one side for a moment, they also triggered a social crisis: for a period of time, it became possible, necessary and – to some extent –convenientto live your life from your bedroom. With that option established, busy corridors, lecture halls and conversational seminars may seem confusing and sometimes even threatening.What’s more, there is no question that for a generation raised with YouTube and smartphones it makes perfect sense to “consume” a lecture at the time, place and even speed of one’s choosing. Note-taking can become verbatim with the availability of closed captioning. How does a university or individual lecturer stand in the way of this without merely seeming conservative or obstructive?There are plenty of valid benefits of a thriving campus and classroom, such as forging identities, making friends or participating in sports and political campaigns. Universities are now at pains to emphasise these, seeking to make their campuses more “sticky” via the introduction of additional cafes, social spaces and gyms.But at some point, the pedagogical question needs to be confronted: whycan’twe just release a load of content? Profit-hungry edtech providers and the consultants hoovering up fees in the current maelstrom of cost-cutting won’t want the question to die. The answer ultimately lies in cultivating in students a tolerance for ambiguity – the ambiguity of social space, the ambiguity of exactly what a lecturer (or text) meant, and the ambiguity of what counts as a “good” argument or essay.At risk of romanticising the experience of in-person teaching and learning, it offers at its best a kind of collective holding environment in which it is OK to be uncertain or ignorant about things, safe in the knowledge that this uncertainty and ignorance will gradually recede. A teaching space contains all sorts of relationships, both tacit and formal, that ensure learning is never a simple transaction or transmission of information. In such communities, not everything is divided into “correct” and “incorrect” answers.For a period of time, Covid inserted a digital interface into billions of social relations, turning educational exchange into a type of game, in which there are “moves”, “scores” and “results”, but no productive ambiguity. This was a disaster for the young people who became trapped in bedrooms, with their education reduced to mechanical inputs and outputs. The struggle to reverse this continues.We want to forget it ever happened. Instead, we should be preparing for the next oneDevi SridharChair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author of How Not to Die (Too Soon)I recently had to teach master’s students about the pandemic and could feel my heart rate quicken at the prospect. “Collective amnesia” is the best way to describe how the world has since decided to approach Covid. We’d rather forget the initial fears about the disease, the trauma of hearing the daily death toll, the rainbow signs in windows and the lockdowns.If you survived, it’s easy to look back and think it wasn’t that bad. Those who died aren’t around to contribute their views, although their loved ones have made powerful interventions. A colleague who lost his 34-year-old son in 2021 reminded me that these voices aren’t heard enough. More than230,000 people in the UKhave lost their lives to the disease.This is how I narrate what occurred during the pandemic. In 2020, governments that had a consistent message and coherent plan – such as Sweden and South Korea – used public health measures such as mass testing, masks and awareness campaigns, and didn’t have to resort to severe interventions, or even lockdowns. In the summer of 2020, trial data indicated we would soon have vaccines. At this point, every country should have been trying to buy time before the vaccines could be rolled out, using tests to identify cases and stop chains of infection. Doing this without causing significant disruption to education, society and the economy was a huge challenge. Some countries and regions managed to strike the right balance. Others did not.Once vaccines arrived inDecember 2020, the objective shifted. Instead of just containing the spread of Covid-19, health authorities began trying to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. Countries that pivoted quickly to this strategy, such as New Zealand and South Korea, managed to avoid major loss of life. Those that continued trying tocontain the virus without promoting vaccinesacross their populations, such as China and Hong Kong, suffered a delayed wave of Covid cases and a high death toll.As a public health expert, a lingering question I now ask myself is whether something like this could happen again, within our lifetimes. Avian flu isspreading across the USand infecting birds and cows. Meanwhile, an unidentified illness found in bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has alreadykilled more than 50 people. Both of these examples show that outbreaks are inevitable and unpredictable. It would be over simplistic to claim that, as a society, we overreacted to Covid. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can prevent a similar pandemic from occurring again.Avian flu is currently one of the most concerning diseases. If it begins to spread among humans, and carries a high fatality rate, governments won’t need to ask people to stay home. Those people will look around at their loved ones, hear what’s happening to families and in hospitals, and make decisions about their safety for themselves. That’s why collective amnesia is the wrong response to Covid. No matter how much we might wish to forget it ever happened, we should now be focusing on building resilience for the next pandemic, and investing in science, particularly vaccine programmes. That would be a far better way to honour the legacy of those who died from this disease.Mutual aid groups thrived in the face of state indifference – and many still doRachel ShabiAuthor of Not the Enemy – Israel’s Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About AntisemitismThe stats alone show us the significance of Covid mutual aid groups. By April 2020, a month after Britain’s first national lockdown was announced, a network of about 4,000 mutual aid groups was up and running. One survey in May that year reported that10 million people in the UKwere involved in some form of volunteering in response to the pandemic. Analysis of the impact of these groups has appraised them as having beenessential in keeping society’s most vulnerable afloatduring the Covid crisis. Mutual aid plugged a giant hole left by a seemingly indifferent and incompetent government, whether by providing food deliveries, prescription-runs and dog-walks, or casting a mental safety net to the lonely and isolated, with regular check-ins across a (socially distanced) doorstep.Mutual aid, a term coined by the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, is a hyperlocal system of support premised on the slogan “solidarity not charity”. It is about horizontal, two-way support: the idea that we all gain from helping each other because humans are wired to collaborate and connect; to participate and to share. It is fundamentally a political idea, even if not always articulated that way by those involved. When I interviewed mutual aiders across the country, volunteers often described it as providing meaning and purpose in a way that regular paid work did not.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Eleanor Shakespeare/The GuardianWhile these groups were at their peak, there was talk of society being rebuilt from the bottom up, the process itself creating a new collective push for a different kind of party politics. It didn’t really turn out that way, even though mutual aid itself did not go away when the worst of the pandemic died down. A report in 2022 suggested thatfour in 10of the mutual aid groups set up during the pandemic were still going, with many focused on helping communities cope with the cost of living crisis. Today, we still see versions of mutual aid everywhere, from disaster-relief groups dealing with the fires that raged across Los Angeles, to thenetworks providing food, medical relief and safe zonesin response the humanitarian catastrophe of Sudan’s war. It springs up whenever a crisis meets an inadequate state response.In other words, mutual aid still thrives precisely because it is a way for people to connect and do something in response to multiple, spiralling global crises, even as they grow increasingly disengaged from party politics. It is both the failure of and alienation from big “P” politics that drives support for mutual aid, as governments do not meaningfully address the climate emergency or redress terrible social iniquities. It’s hard to see how the dots between community organising and political pressure might connect. But perhaps that is to miss the point of mutual aid. The shift is in the tissue of the relationships forged, the practice of accountability to each other. Amid a global surge in far-right politics premised on competitive individualism, mutual aid builds awareness that societies can instead be founded on collectivism – and those that do will thrive.Working from home was supposed to be a revolution – but it mostly benefited menHelen McCarthyHistorian and author ofDouble Lives: A History of Working MotherhoodWomen’s working lives changed after March 2020 in complicated ways. Many found themselves on the frontline of the NHS. In other sectors historically dominated by women, such as retail and hospitality, workers were imperilled by restrictions, and millions were furloughed. Meanwhile, school and nursery closures meant that frazzled mothers now had to juggle Zoom calls with round-the-clock childcare.Five years on, how does the picture look for working women? As a historian, it is hard to resist comparisons with an earlier crisis, the second world war, which mobilised millionsof women and helped kickstart the dramatic growth in their employment that swept the second half of the 20th century. Covid hasn’t done anything like that. On the eve of the virus, the female employment rate was high – 72% – and it hasbarely changedsince.But that headline figure may mask the effects of the pandemic on older women, thousands of whom have moved out of the workforce into early retirement, or are now classed as “economically inactive”. This trend has also affected men, but women’s reasons for not being in work are more likely to include caring for family or long-term illness, includinglong Covid, of which there are more female sufferers than male.These numbers also conceal the pressures experienced by mothers who are barely hanging on to their jobs owing to the lack of affordable childcare. The UK’s problems with childcare did not start in 2020, but the chaos of lockdowns exacerbated staff shortages. Many workers left the sector for more stable and less stressful jobs, and costs have continued to spiral.At the start of the pandemic, there were hopes that the pivot to remote working would help working parents achieve a better balance by cutting out the commute and giving them more control over their time. Before 2020,only one in eightworkers reported working from home. That figure has now risen totwo in five. Here, there’s an echo of the second world war, when part-time shifts were promoted to sceptical employers as a means of recruiting housewives to munitions factories that desperately needed labour. By the 1980s, about a third of working-age women wereemployed part-time.Those jobs were typically low-skilled, low-paid and carried fewer rights than full-time jobs. Today’s hybrid workers, by contrast, are more likely to be well-paid professionals. They are also more likely to be men. Initially, there was a sense that fathers would embraceequal, hands-on parenting stylesif they spent more time at home. If anything, workplace inequalities have persisted. True, some mothers in white-collar occupations have undoubtedly benefited from hybrid working. But much larger numbers of women remain in jobs that are less amenable to home-based work, including those in hospitals, care homes and supermarkets. It is cruelly ironic that one of the few positive legacies of the pandemic is mostly unavailable to those whose essential labour got Britain through the crisis.Conspiracy theories have moved from the fringes of society to the centres of powerSamira ShackleJournalist and the author of Karachi ViceIn July 2023, the US politicianRobert Kennedy Jr was filmedsaying that “Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and that the US “put hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes”. Now, in February 2025, Kennedy is US health secretary. It is a stark example of a much broader phenomenon: in the five years since the Covid pandemic began, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringes of society to the centres of power.During the pandemic, more people began to doubt authorities, expertise and elites. Populist movements, including some explicitly rooted in conspiracies, already existed before Covid – but the pandemic significantly broadened their appeal. QAnon began in 2017, as a response to (false) claims that Hillary Clinton was the leader of an elite cabal of paedophiles, but by 2020, its supporters werecampaigning against masks and vaccines. This is indicative of the way in which conspiracy movements adapt and cross-pollinate; during the pandemic, we also saw longtime conspiracy grifters such as David Icke and Piers Corbyn taking on Covid as a cause, as that’s where a new audience lay.When I reported onthe rise of Covid conspiraciesin the miserable locked-down spring of 2021, it struck me that many of the people I spoke to had started with reasonable concerns. They were isolated, angry, and suffering financially and emotionally as a result of lockdowns. They had a sense that something wasn’t right, and the idea that the pandemic was being exaggerated, or was cover for something more sinister, provided an explanation. (As the writer Naomi Kleinhas said: “Conspiracy culture gets the facts wrong, but the feeling is right.”) I spoke to some people over the course of a few months, and as they became more immersed in the online world of conspiracies, their initial views became more extreme – perhaps a shift from questioning the origins of the pandemic to full-blown vaccine scepticism. “I’ve definitely fallen out with the government, and I will never, ever trust them again,” one woman told me.The pandemic vastly expanded the number of people who feel this way. As a general rule, once someone has engaged fully in one set of conspiracy theories, investing time and energy in them, and probably losing real-world friends in the process, they become more receptive to other conspiracies too. And those who peddle these theories online adapt their views according to what is most popular or expedient. People who came to prominence talking about the pandemic have since moved on to other issues, taking their audience with them. A number of British Telegram groups set up during the pandemic to oppose lockdowns and vaccinations haveswitched to far-right messaging, for instance.The pandemic and associated lockdowns may have receded from the public imagination, but people who really bought into the conspiracies swirling around it haven’t gone back to thinking how they did before. In an increasingly fragmented media environment, and with conspiracists sitting in positions of huge political power in the US, this is a problem for us all.The NHS transformed for the better. It has since regressedRachel ClarkePalliative care doctor and the author ofBreathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of PandemicAlmost exactly five years ago, Dave Jones, an ICU consultant in Wales, posted a tweet that made NHS colleagues cheer. “The NHS reminds me of a hippopotamus. It might sometimes appear slow, maybe a bit bloated and somewhat unresponsive. But my god, this last week or so has shown that like a hippo, it can move bloody fast and have some awesome power when it needs to.”He had captured brilliantly the breakneck transformation – unprecedented in NHS history – of every inch of the health service to cope with the onslaught of Covid. Hospitals ripped up the rules and demolished conventions to double or treble their ICU capacities. In under a month,33,000 extra patient bedswere created – the equivalent of building 53 new district general hospitals across the country. Barriers dissolved, silos vanished. Red tape – this time of the literal kind – suddenly reconfigured our A&E into “hot” and “cold” zones – the kind of thing that in the NHS normally takes 26 committees and two years to achieve. Money and bureaucracy, for once, were no object. We all worked together to do what was right.What shocks me today is how little of that mind-blowing dynamism remains. Then, staff were unleashed to transform our systems to help patients. Now, we’re back in the old quagmire of inertia, bureaucracy and system-says-no because there’s no money to do anything differently. A new government has promised an NHS revolution, but patients are stilldying on trolleys in corridors. Social care – yet again – isn’t a government priority. Trusts still can’t, or won’t, pay for doctors to fill the rota gaps to keep patients safe at night. Staff struggle against the system to give patients the care they deserve.In particular, it astounds me that five years after an airborne virus wreaked such deadly havoc, NHS England has failed to act on all the lessons learned. This winter, NHS leaders loudly blamed aviral “quad-demic”for the appalling crisis conditions in our hospitals, as though somehow natural forces had tied the government’s hands. Yet three of those four viruses – influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Covid-19 – are spread through the air.Why haven’t Hepa filters been installed in all our hospitals and GP surgeries when we know they effectively remove the virus particles breathed in by staff and patients? Where were the universal mask mandates for staff to help reduce the spread? Why was the default mask for staff the flimsy paper variety, not the significantly more protective FFP2 kind? It is surely the falsest of economies to stick to cheap paper when you know this will lead to higher rates of staff infection, endangering patients and causing staff to be too unwell to work.As theCovid inquiry creaks on, I have been unnerved to find myself agreeing with Dominic Cummings’s testimony. Cummings has excoriated the groupthink, inertia and monolithic assumptions that dominate the actions of government, the civil service and the NHS. He’s right. We often talk about those electrifying months, five years ago, when we were liberated – and supported – to make the radical changes our patients needed. If only the same were true now.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusThe panelInternational tradeDisabilityWomenWork & careersPsychologyNHScommentShareReuse this content"

But some can’t even spell ‘iftar’Nadeine AsbaliThe religious festival is a month of fasting, prayer and community – not consuming and comparing ourselves with one anotherNadeine Asbali is the author of Veiled Threat: On being visibly Muslim in BritainSat 1 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 06.10 ESTShareSupermarkets have wheeled out the 20kg bags of rice. High-street stores have popped hijabs on mannequins. Cosmetic companies are churning out products scented with pomegranate, cardamom, saffron and “sticky date” – at Lushyou can buySalam shower gel, Noor lip butter and a massage bar that apparently smells like a turmeric latte. All this can only mean one thing in our modern, consumerist world: Ramadan is upon us.Ramadan, the holiest month in the Muslim calendar, begins this weekend. Like many Muslims, I findit is my favourite time of the year (and not because I can bulk-buy rice for the entire year in my local Tesco). It is a time of spiritual growth and reflection, of turning away from our own desires and egos to focus on God, and of letting go of the trappings of the earthly world – including food and drink in daylight hours.Over the past few years,perhaps thanks to social media, Ramadan has become increasingly commercialised as major companies wake up to how lucrative the so-called Muslim pound is – estimated to be worthmore than £20.5bn. But this year things feel more unabashedly consumerist than ever. For weeks now, my social media feeds have been inundated with influencers (sponsored by major corporations – one of which even manages to misspell iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal, on its website) telling us that getting ready for Ramadan means a new decor theme in every room, brand new personalised prayer mats for the entire family or a whole new wardrobe for visits to the mosque.Of course, there has always been the concept ofpreparing aheadfor Ramadan. Muslim mothers and grandmothers have spent the days before mass-producing samosas since time immemorial. But traditionally this has been about getting ahead of tasks such as cooking to maximise time spent on worship during the holy month. In the past, getting ready for Ramadan has never meant changing all the bedding to something more vaguely ethnic looking orrestocking our lipstick collectionin desert hues. We can thank capitalism for that one.OK, you could argue that this is nothing new. We are used to what capitalism has done to anything with meaning in our superficial world. Look at what has become of Christmas. But it feels as though things are getting worse: as though spirituality itself – the cornerstone of the holy month – has become commodified.It’s not only the push to be a better consumer that detracts from the spiritual meaning of Ramadan for me; it’s that I feel as though I am being turned into a product to sell. The fast-paced, goals-driven world we live in has turned productivity into the end goal. We are constantly tracking everything in our lives – our steps, our calorie intakes, our career wins – so that we can share our progress on social media for the world to consume. We are bombarded with the idea that we must constantly strive, always be improving. And this has seeped into Ramadan too. Instead of approaching the month with a focus on introspection and on our personal relationship with our faith, productivity culture is telling us we should track our prayer goals, map our fasting progress and be in constant competition (with ourselves, they say, but really with each other).The concept of a quiet month spent escaping the trappings of our modern world is completely lost when we are being assaulted from all angles with the idea that we can productivity-hack a connection with God. And for Muslims like me, whose Ramadan can’t be about smashing targets (this will be my first as a mother of two, with a lively toddler and a newborn baby in tow), it can feel intimidating and isolating. Feeling as though I have failed before it has even started, I have had to remind myself that the holy month isn’t about buying new things or praying more than someone on Instagram – but it’s hard when the algorithms tell me otherwise.It could be said that visibility is a form of progress. But all of these apparent celebrations of Islam come against a background of surging Islamophobia, with assaultsrising by 73%in 2024. Since last summer’s riots, being Muslim in Britain feels more precarious than ever. And while the Ramadan ranges in stores may look like progress, they ultimately do nothing to challenge the Islamophobia thatis embedded in the systems that govern our lives.There was once a time when it seemed refreshing to see ourselves represented in supermarkets and high-street brands. Seeing a hijabi mannequin in Primark would have once stopped me in my tracks, and “Ramadan Mubarak” signs in Sainsbury’s used to make me smile. But now it feels devoid of meaning – and, if anything, disingenuous and even sinister. Even when I do finally see myself represented in mainstream culture, do I then have to worry about how that will enrage racists and certain sections of the media?There is a difference between tick-box diversity on the shelf and genuine diversity and inclusion in a country. Meaningful change would be acknowledging the ways British Muslims remain disfranchised and afraid, rather than pacifying us with date-scented goods and vats of oil at discount prices.Nadeine Asbali is the author of Veiled Threat: On being visibly Muslim in Britain, and a secondary school teacher in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Charli xcx wins five Brits for zeitgeist-conquering albumDance-pop artist picks up album and artist of the year prizes, while Ezra Collective see off big names to become first jazz artists to win British groupThe Brit awards – in picturesThe full list of winnersBen Beaumont-ThomasSat 1 Mar 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 1 Mar 2025 18.57 ESTShareCharli xcx has won fiveBrit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat.At the ceremony in London’s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year.The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: “Brat summer”, plus various things being declared “brat”. It was nebulously defined – Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat – but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool.Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli’s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys.She thanked some of her dance music heroes – resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards – as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: “Not all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.” On winning album of the year, she said: “I’ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven’t made any sacrifices.” She told her fellow artists: “You don’t need to compromise your vision.”The chief architect of Brat’s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards’ eligibility period, entitled Britpop.Charli – real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 – first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year:Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&B act for the second year in a row.Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK’s best live acts.Bassist Georgia Davies said they “wouldn’t be a band without the UK’s incredible independent venues – they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying”. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to “keep going, because that’s the best kind of art there is”.View image in fullscreenJoe Armon-Jones, Ife Ogunjobi, Femi Koleoso, James Mollison and TJ Koleoso of Ezra Collective.Photograph: John Phillips/Getty ImagesThe Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon.Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London’s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London’s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They’re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize.After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: “So many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we’re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone – because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.”In the genre categories – which were voted for by the public –Sam Fenderpicked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022.Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as “a man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist”, Fender also performed his new album’s title track.View image in fullscreenJade performing Angel of My Dreams.Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImageFormerLittle Mixmember Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories.He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, butStormzywas something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country’s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can’t Rush Greatness isn’t eligible until next year’s Brits).As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, “I don’t entirely think this award should be fan-voted … sometimes I think it doesn’t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.”The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that theoutcry at Stormzy’s recent McDonald’s campaigndid not affect his votes.This year’s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You.Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: “If British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?”“We have to protect the foundations that make it,” he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: “Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments … please stick with artists past a viral hit.”It was a sentiment shared byChappell Roan, who called for artists to “not be pressured into making music based off what is trending” as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to “trans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sinéad O’Connor.”Irish rockersFontaines DCpicked up international group, their second win in that category.View image in fullscreenSabrina Carpenter performing at the Brit awards.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockIntroduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown,Sabrina Carpenterwas given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: “In a primarily tea-drinking country, you’ve streamed the shit out of Espresso … cheerio!”Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, andEzra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith.Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (“the public school Nickelback”) and even the previous day’s “cringe” Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade’s live performance, saying: “I really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme”, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor – all of it casting the Brits as the award season’s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an “incredibly kind soul”.Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.Brit awards 2025: full list of winnersAlbum of the year:Charli xcx– BratArtist of the year: Charli xcxBritish group: Ezra CollectiveBest new artist: The Last Dinner PartySong of the year: Charli xcx – Guess (ft Billie Eilish)International artist: Chappell RoanInternational group: Fontaines DCInternational song: Chappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!Alternative/rock act: Sam FenderHip-hop/grime/rap act: StormzyDance act: Charli xcxPop act: JadeR&B act: RayeProducer of the year: AG CookSongwriter of the year: Charli xcxGlobal success: Sabrina CarpenterRising star: Myles SmithExplore more on these topicsBrit awardsCharli xcxPop and rockAwards and prizesRayeThe Last Dinner PartyEzra CollectivenewsShareReuse this content"

The band have arrived in France after a showcase gig at London boutique Biba, marred by various members getting caught while attempting to shoplift from the store. Their famously dissolute guitarist Johnny Thunders vomits copiously in front of the assembled press at a record company reception to welcome the band to France, then pukes again midway through a “horrendous, tuneless” Dolls gig at Paris’s prestigious Olympia theatre. Bassist Arthur Kane, a large man clad in a ballerina’s tutu who apparently looks “like he’d just been run over by a truck load of Valium” confides that he’s in fear of his life: the last groupie he slept with tied him up in his sleep and attempted to cut off his thumb with a knife.And yet, even in such exalted company, there’s no doubt who the star of the show is. Frontman David Johansen never appears to stop talking throughout, an endless, wildly entertaining source of tall tales – at one juncture, he claims to have been an underage star of gay porn films – hysterical bitching about other artists (John Lennon is an “asshole hypocrite”, Keith Richards is “past it”, Mott the Hoople’s Ian Hunter has “terrible piggy eyes”) and eminently quotable statements: “We attract only degenerates to our concerts”; “We want to be known as the tackiest boys in New York.” Whatever you made of New York Dolls’ music – and, as the evident distaste with which host Bob Harris greeted their appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test proved, it was nothing if not divisive – you would have a hard time arguing that Johansen wasn’t fantastically good at the business of being a rock star.He was also very much the right man to front New York Dolls. He was good-looking, charismatic and the press loved him – Johansen always provided great copy – and he sang in a brash, snotty yowl, the perfect complement to the band’s punk-inspiring edge-of-chaos sound. A former participant in the confrontational avant garde Theatre of the Ridiculous shows put on by directors John Vaccaro and Charles Ludlam – big on drag queens, outrage and cast members covered in glitter – Johansen applied their techniques to New York Dolls’ image, helping make the band an instant underground sensation in early 70s New York. Their early residency at the Lower East Side’s Mercer Arts Centre attracted not just an equally flamboyant crowd of followers, but celebrities including David Bowie, Elton John, Lou Reed and Bette Midler, while Rod Stewart invited them to support Faces in London before they’d even released a note of music.View image in fullscreenJohansen and Johnny Thunders of New York Dolls play Biba's Rainbow Room, London, in 1973.Photograph: Ian Dickson/ShutterstockJohansen wrote or co-wrote every original song that appeared on New York Dolls’ eponymous 1973 debut and its follow-up Too Much Too Soon bar one, minting a raunchy, trashy style. Flying in the face of rock’s increasing seriousness and grandeur, his songs were as in love with 60s girl group pop as they were the Rolling Stones: Looking for a Kiss opened with a steal from the Shangri-Las’ 1964 hit Give Him a Great Big Kiss. They made a virtue of the band’s rudimentary musicianship, but for all Johansen claimed “there wasn’t a lot of intellectualising going on”, they were always far sharper and deeper than the band’s detractors gave them credit for. Vietnamese Baby pondered the effects of the Vietnam war and collective guilt on attitudes to hedonism (“everything connects,” it suggests); Frankenstein was a garbled hymn to the alternately glitzy and grubby allure of New York; Subway Train quoted the lyrics of the 19th-century folk song I’ve Been Working on the Railroad.The music press understandably thought New York Dolls were going to be huge, but perhaps they were too polarising for their own good. A degree of homophobia provoked by their appearance – every member of the band was straight – undoubtedly hampered their progress in the US; a sound that seemed incredibly prescient when punk arrived was easy to dismiss as sloppy, semi-competent flailing in 1973: “the worst high-school band I ever saw”, sniffed the Rolling Stones’ Mick Taylor. Even the producer of their debut album, Todd Rundgren, thought they couldn’t play and treated them with a degree of disdain.Certainly, everything that could go wrong for New York Dolls did go wrong: drug addiction, a disastrous hook-up with the alcoholic former Shangri-Las’ producer Shadow Morton on 1974’s Too Much Too Soon, a dalliance with Malcolm McLaren as their manager who convinced them to take up a new Marxist-inspired image that succeeded only in alienating even the New York hipsters who had flocked to their gigs in the first place. They lost their record deal, and most of the band quit: Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain soldiered on until late 1976, finally giving up just as the seeds New York Dolls had sown began to bloom: their last gigs featured a support act called Blondie.View image in fullscreenJohansen in 2015.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianJohansen’s first eponymous post-Dolls solo album and 1979’s In Style – the latter featuring a guest appearance by Ian Hunter, who’d presumably forgiven him for the “piggy eyes” jibe – should theoretically have capitalised on punk, a genre he’d done more than most to inspire, but both flopped. A pity, because they were packed with smart, impactful, witty songs: Funky But Chic’s brilliant defence of the Dolls’ image (“mama says I look fruity, but in jeans I feel rotten”), Girls’ surprisingly pro-feminist rallying call; the gleeful Wreckless Crazy. He finally scored an American hit with a medley of British Invasion classics in 1982, and finally became the star he’d always threatened to be by adopting the character of Buster Poindexter: a dinner-suit clad lounge singer performing old jump blues, swing and R&B numbers. His cover of Arrow’s Hot Hot Hot ended up all over MTV (Johansen later called its success “the bane of my life”) and he regularly turned up on Saturday Night Live before tiring of his alter ego in the early 00s, returning to his own name and making a couple of blues albums that revealed his deep knowledge and understanding of the genre: New York Dolls had covered Bo Diddley and Sonny Boy Williamson.‘They were inventing a new definition of sexy’: stars and scenesters on the New York Dolls’ riotous rockRead moreThe surviving members of New York Dolls reformed at the behest of super-fan Morrissey when he curated the 2004 Meltdown festival: bassist Arthur Kane died shortly after the gig, but Johansen and Sylvain carried on under the name. You could hardly blame them for basking in the glow of belated glory, moreover the new albums they then made as New York Dolls were far better than anyone might reasonably have expected them to be. They evoked the band’s past without seeming like a wan facsimile, they addressed latter-day topics – the “war on drugs”, mobile phones, online surveillance – with enough wit to avoid sounding like old-man-shouts-at-cloud moaning. And they occasionally boasted an affecting air of reflective melancholy. Implausible as the very idea of a grownup New York Dolls seemed, here it was, sounding oddly moving as it looked back at their glory days, “jumping around the stage like teenage girls, casting our swine before the pearls,” as Johansen put it on We’re All in Love, a song from 2006’s One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This.On their final album, 2011’s Dancing Backwards in High Heels, there was a song called I’m So Fabulous, a paean to the band’s good looks and sense of style, filled with snorting disgust at what passed for fashion in “nebulous” 21st-century Manhattan. “I’m so fabulous, you arriviste … The way you dress is so insidious – how do they even let you on the subway? … you’re so Cincinnati … I don’t even want to look at you,” sang Johansen, to a backdrop of raging guitar and wailing harmonica, sounding just like the guy who’d boasted to Nick Kent about New York Dolls’ tackiness and degenerate audience nearly 40 years before. In its own cocky, swaggering, outspoken way, it’s the perfect epitaph.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockPunkcommentShareReuse this content"

What’s more, he wrote his own officialBond novel,Solo, in 2013.NowAmazonhas picked up the rights to the character, Boyd foresees a succession of 007 spin-off products and entertainments. Perhaps even be new AI-generated novels? “Certainly wait for Bond aftershave – and for the theme park and the dinner jackets,” he said. “The new owners will have to commodify everything about their billion-dollar purchase, so there will be nightclubs and vodkas.”But the novelist and screenwriter does not regard this as fresh treachery. The true defilers of the authentic Bond have been at work for decades, making films that bear little relation to creatorIan Fleming’s original.View image in fullscreenA scene from Spectre … ‘the films have nothing to do with the novels,’ says William Boyd.Photograph: United Artists/Allstar“It is too late. The great schism is that the films have nothing to do with the novels,” said Boyd. “The films are preposterous action movies that have to sell globally and so cannot have too much dialogue.”Fleming’s novels from the 1950s were already old-fashioned by the time the first film,Dr No, came out in 1962, Boyd argues. “Since then the film have got further and further away from the stories and the gulf is now so wide, it doesn’t really matter.”Anyone who wonders how Fleming’s Bond behaved should go to his own book, he suggests. “I took Fleming’s character and then ran with it, so if anyone is interested, all the information is inSolo; from Bond’s book-lined study to his favourite marmalade.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His novels remain the Bond mother lode, with all their imperfections and their political incorrectness.”Is franchise writing, then, akin to the process of creating fiction with AI, by “scraping” past data? After all, Boyd scoured Fleming’s 14 books, “pen in hand”, before he wroteSolo. “It is true that everything in that novel that seems unusual is actually sourced from Fleming – for example, that Bond was a nervous flyer. He gave Bond all his own foibles.”But AI, Boyd hopes, could only work to generate strict very formulaic fiction. “It might work for romcoms, but it was absolutely useless when I tried it a year or so ago. I needed someone to fake their own death for a screenplay I was writing and I asked it how. AI will become more efficient, of course. I think, though, you will always only be able to get something ‘quite good’. Serious literature is incredibly idiosyncratic and AI will find that hard to match. The only straw to clutch at is the sheer complexity and randomness of human individuality.”View image in fullscreenBoyd’s latest novel, Gabriel’s Moon – the first part of a cold war trilogy – is released in AprilPhotograph: no creditOn Boyd’s mind this weekend is not just espionage, but literary franchises and sequels in general, as his new 10-part mystery,The Jura Affair, featuring his regular fictional heroine, Bethany Mellmoth, comes to BBC Radio 4 this Monday. MeanwhileGabriel’s Moon, the first of his new trilogy of cold war novels, is set for publication in early April.The radio story, read by Ruth Everett, will see Mellmoth, now about 26, turn detective after she picks up a packet left on a tube train that seems to contain a valuable first edition of George Orwell’s book1984. “She is like a young Miss Marple in a way, because she becomes a sleuth,” said Boyd, admitting he is open to offers to make Mellmoth into a refreshing Bond-style franchise. “Bethany is a character I’ve been writing about for years now. She is ambitious, but she can’t make a decision about her life. We once made a short film about her starring Lucy Boynton andJack Lowden, before they were both so famous. We’d hoped it would spin off into a series.”Boyd’s interest in Jura was piqued by the time Orwell spent on the Scottish island as he wrote his dystopian novel. “It was the strange fact of Orwell going to live in this unbelievably remote house on the island, just with his adopted son and his sister helping out. There was no water or electricity, so this public intellectual, who was very ill, was living this peasant life as he wrote1984.” InThe Jura AffairMellmoth “stumbles across an elaborate scam”, Boyd explains, and even wonders if Orwell is haunting her.The shape of a thriller like this one, but more particularly of a spy novel, is a distillation of the basic function of a novel, the author believes. “I think a strong narrative is fundamental to writing fiction. If you decline compelling story, then you had better be a terribly good to keep entertaining the reader.”The new cold war trilogy is Boyd’s first attempt at full-length sequels, a bigger kind of literary franchise. “I have nearly finished book number two. They are about a travel writer, Gabriel Dax, who is inveigled into the world of espionage.”In previous novels, such asAny Human HeartorRestless, spies are often present. “I just feel it chimes with us,” Boyd explains. “We get the themes of betrayal, duplicity, or changed identity. After all, we have all been lied to and all lied.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondThe ObserverWilliam BoydIan FlemingAmazonFictionThrillersFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t often – despite what films and television would have you believe – cause you to act massively out of character. Like motherhood or any other huge life upheaval, its actual effect is to strip away the nonsense and leave your essential nature, your core, not just intact but now unobscured by everyday concerns and frivolities.So it was no real surprise to find myself, in the immediate weeks after the death of my beloved dad in 2023, flinging myself into books. I would have done so literally, if I could. I wanted to gather my physical books into a wall – or better yet, a cave – around me that would both protect me from this new reality and let me cry in peace within it. Failing that, I took mental refuge in them instead.I read like I had never read before. I read like a chain smoker smokes, turning the last page of one book and immediately opening up the cover of another. I had books lined up before me to make sure I didn’t go a moment without. None of my usual leisurely picking and choosing, reading blurbs and reviews, feeling my way into what would best suit my mood. Because my mood was simple, uniform and deeply miserable, and what I needed was new stories and characters ceaselessly streaming into my cortex and banishing, for as many seconds at a time as they could, the fact that outside those pages the unforgiving real world no longer had the gentle, wry, witty form of my dad in it.Every moment that I was not inescapably occupied (with work, with Mum, with making sure life carried on as normally as possible for my son), I was reading. And when I was vitally occupied, I was longing to read, burning to in a way I hadn’t properly felt since I was a child. It felt so odd to have arrived at the same place via sorrow, rather than joy. Adulthood sure can be the pits sometimes.Anyway it was all odd, and difficult, and my heart goes out to people grieving harder and more complicated losses than that of an elderly father who went peacefully, and on his own terms, when it was absolutely time to go.Novels with light, bright covers promised a distraction, an uplift and – above all – a happy endingThe retreat from the world didn’t last as long as I had expected. I felt at first like I would be floored for ever. But now – and I’m writing this six months later – I spend a lot of the time feeling bad that I don’t feel worse in the absence of this man whom I, quietly but unreservedly, loved so much, who knew me so well and who loved me, even more quietly but just as unreservedly, right back. But it’s because I still feel him with me – which, as someone with no religious faith and no goddamn spiritual side either, I really did not expect. But he’s there. Or it’s there; or something’s there anyway. I do really feel,as the poem has it, that he has only gone into the next room. Mum says it’s because we are so much alike. This evolution of the exasperated cry “You’re exactly like your father!”, when she found me next to some set chore abandoned because I’d been distracted by a book, which pursued me throughout my childhood, both charms and aggrieves me. But I hold on to the idea that it’s true.And I have discovered romance. Not in real life, obviously. Yuck. But the genre, once forsworn, is now very necessary to me. Once I stopped feeling quite like I would be floored for ever, I started being drawn towards books with light, bright covers that promised distraction, an uplift and – above all – a happy ending. I realise this is not a psychologically complex phenomenon. But however obvious the route, the comfort they offered was real and wonderful. Especially as the first three I came across –Emily Henry’s Book Lovers, Stephanie Butland’s Lost for Words and Harriet Evans’s Happily Ever After – were all about the world of books, bookworms and bookshops, and formed the perfect bridge to cross into this new, unexplored region.There also seemed to have been, in the 20-odd years since I had last surveyed the landscape, a move away from the ditsy/hot-mess heroines that sprang up post-Bridget Jones. The new generation of protagonists all had their problems – particularly Loveday Cardew, whose emotional withdrawal after her repeated battering by life is carefully and compassionately depicted by Butland and further explored, with great consistency and credibility, in the sequelFound in a Bookshop– but they weren’t chaotic collections of neediness and neuroses held together by the offices of devoted friends, who in real life would have been well within their rights to have deleted these succubi from their phones years ago. They were properly funny, properly thoughtful, capable – often even maintaining professional standards day in, day out at the office! – and generally life-affirming, rather than life-depleting, people to hang out with. I felt like introducing them to some of the longsuffering best friends in earlier books. “Look, this is what you deserve! Enjoy!”It was a reminder – though I do try to stay aware of it anyway – never to write off any field, any genre, for ever, for the simple reason that even if it doesn’t evolve (and sometimes, as with the hot messes above, it does), you do. You toughen up a bit here, break down a bit there, learn this, rediscover that, have children, have cancer, move jobs, move countries, are opened up to more experiences, more possibilities, live through more world events, governments, relationships, McDonald’s menus, Kardashian exploits and iterations of the Strictly Come Dancing panel – all these things change you and change what you need, what you want and what you bring to previously discarded books, when you pick them up again.Romantic/popular/commercial fiction, whatever you want to call it, picked me up on bad days, brushed me down and sent me off again with a loving pat to get through the next few hours, days, weeks until I collapsed back into its arms. It’s a trust fall. The writers of commercial fiction know their audience, are often part of that audience (Evans is a lifelong fan ofGeorgette Heyer, for example, and I suspect none has come to the job without an early affinity with the genre and an absorption of its rules, both the obvious and the ineffable, into their bones) and consider it their duty to deliver. I think of them now like a quieter, more studious version of the A-Team, except that if you have a problem, if no one else can help (or if you have soaked all the available shoulders with tears and need to give them a bit of time to dry out), you can always find them, these soldiers of romantic fortune.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Not just the children’s section, though of course that is where any number of my strongest and favourite memories of Dad reside.But Dad is there in adult books too. Murphy’s Boy by Torey Hayden was my first ever true-life tale. I tried to buy it after seeing the film based on it (Trapped in Silence, starring Marsha Mason and a very young Kiefer Sutherland, fact-fans), about a neglected child who refused to speak or communicate via other means in the wake of his abuse and was eventually “saved” by psychologist Hayden, who specialised in the phenomenon of elective mutism. It could be seen as a forerunner of the misery memoir, but, like most forerunners of popular trends, it is much better than the thing it became. It wasn’t available in England at the time, so Dad asked one of his American friends to buy it for me and, when she handed it over next time she visited, I literally could not believe it.There’s also Grace Metalious’s proto-bonkbuster Peyton Place, reminding me of when I was seven or eight and first heard Jeannie C Reilly sing Harper Valley PTA. I had to take the line “Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you’re all Harper Valley hypocrites” to Dad for elucidation, and he told me all about this very famous and bestselling book, which I pledged to myself I would read as soon as I was old enough. I forgot about it until I came across a battered copy in The Brazen Head bookshop in Norfolk and pounced. It was even better than the song.The run ofPhilip Rothreminds me of one of our rare disagreements. I was home for the university holiday and Dad came across me reading the newly published American Pastoral. This was just after he had read Claire Bloom’s memoir Leaving a Doll’s House, in which she details her long relationship with the volatile, controlling and verbally abusive author. Dad felt that, at the very least, I should read his books in the light of this knowledge; or, maybe, choose not to read them at all. I, at 20, felt that I could – and should – separate the man from the art.More upliftingly, I spySarah Perry’s The Essex Serpent– a complex, gentle, yet sinuous story about a woman freed by her violent older husband’s death to start life anew. She moves to the Essex marshes to follow her long-denied interest in palaeontology and give her autistic son the peace and freedom he needs. Her scientific mind finds a strange resonance with the local rector’s attempts to stop the village community turning from God to the supernatural when it appears that the monstrous folkloric serpent has returned to the marshes. I read it, loved it and passed it to Dad. It’s a book about all the different forms of love there can be, and how they enrich a life in different ways. When he returned it, he said he had thought it as wonderful as I did. I told him that some reviewers – perhaps because you don’t at any point actually get a scene in which a giant sea monster rises out of the waters and lays waste to a village – had dismissed it as a bit of a book about nothing. “But,” he said, frowning, “it’s about everything.” And that is why I loved him, and that is how he enriched my life too.This is an extract from Bookish: How Reading Shapes Our Lives by Lucy Mangan, published by Square Peg on 13 March.

She is known among her fellow cast members for capsizing so completely into a role that they can’t tell who they’re talking to: Wood or her character. (This probably wasn’t helped by the fact that her standout debut role inSex Educationwas also called Aimee.)Suranne Jones, who plays alongside her in forthcoming dramedy Film Club, even bought her a bag with a big A on it: “And she said to me,” Wood says, “‘You can put things in there, and that’s Aimee’s bag, so you don’t lose who you are.’ My imagination and my reality can get scarily blurred.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Wood has been searching for more clarity recently. “I’ve noticed more and more that I’m thinking: what do I actually want? Where can I be the driver and not the passenger?” I meet the 30-year-old in a kind of yoga-adjacent cafe in London. She’s got aShelley Duvallthing going on, where you can’t tell whether her face – wide open eyes like a Disney fawn, tentative smile – is what makes her seem honest yet mysterious, or whether those qualities created her face. Either way, she looks both very film star, in leather blazer, Dr Martens and miniskirt, yet also not out of place in this hippyish restaurant.This year is massive for the star from Stockport, though her career has seemed pretty charmed since she broke through in Netflix’s smash hit teen comedy in 2019 – her first job out of drama school. The actor won a Bafta for her portrayal of teenager Aimee Gibbs, on a quest to try to orgasm. The four seasons of the show – starringAsa Butterfieldas a teenager who starts giving his school mates sex therapy – have been watched by more than55 million householdsaround the world. “We had no idea how big it was going to be,” she says.Since then, she’s appeared alongsideBill Nighy in Living, an acclaimed and mournful film about a dying bureaucrat and a sparky youngling who brings meaning to his final days, and got brilliant reviews for her fierce, chaotic take onSally Bowles in the award-winning West End revival of Cabaret. By the time you read this, she’ll be stealing scenes inseason three of The White Lotus– the Thai instalment of Mike White’s compelling comedy-murder series in which super-rich holidaymakers destroy themselves and each other, and which nearly subsumed her entirely (more of this later).View image in fullscreenWith Jodie Whittaker in Toxic Town …Photograph: Ben Blackall/Netflix © 2024View image in fullscreen… and Bill Nighy in Living.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis week, we will see her in something totally different:Toxic Town, a powerful, quintessentially British drama, produced by Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones’s company Broke and Bones, that follows the horrific tragedy of theCorby toxic waste scandal. The case has been dubbed the British equivalent of the groundwater contamination in Hinkley, US (the one that inspired themovie Erin Brockovich). The decommissioning of a steelworks, and a combination of public and private sector corruption, released dust into the Northamptonshire town that caused birth defects for a staggering 12 years, between 1985 and 1997. If at the start this was due to the Thatcherite degradation of the industrial heartlands and all pursuant safety standards, by the end it was waved through and covered up by councillors desperate not to stick a spoke in the wheels of New Labour’s bold future of regeneration.The result was devastating: rates of upper limb defects were 10 times higher than a town that size should expect. And so a group of furious parents hired lawyer Des Collins to take on the government and make it stop.Wood called her mum as soon as she was cast in Toxic Town. “I was so sure she’d have heard about it, but she hadn’t – the scandal was so contained within the area. National news was never interested. And pregnant women just passing through the area could have been affected and still not know.”The mothers are the heroines in this telling,written by Jack Thorne, and their solidarity is the animating force, in the tradition ofBrassed OfforThe Full Monty.Jodie Whittakerand Wood are the central and unlikely pair; Whittaker, full of swagger, Wood meeker and her case tragic. They’re united by tenacity, then start liking each other, which is beautifully told. Wood’s character, Tracey Taylor, who worked on an industrial estate in Corby, “is literally an angel”, Wood says. “We didn’t meet the real people until the end;Minkie [Spiro, the director]wanted us to come at it cold. But Jack is so good at capturing characters that when Tracey walked towards me, I knew who she was. She’s very righteous. All the other mums love her. She doesn’t see it as heroism, just, ‘That was the right thing, so I did it.’ The only thing I was nervous about was Tracey seeing it.”Telling the story was tough. In one anguished scene – which Wood had to shoot multiple times – Taylor has just had her daughter, Shelby, and, knowing something is terribly wrong, drags herself from her hospital bed and across the floor, covering everything in blood, in a bid to get help. If it hadn’t been a true story, she says, “there would have been moments when I’d have thought, ‘I can’t do that again.’ But to leave the grief space felt disloyal to Tracey, doing her story a disservice.”View image in fullscreen‘Don’t search yourself on Twitter.

It was more like … amazing – ” she flashes a fleeting look of worry that I might have misinterpreted that “ – in the true sense, I wasamazedby what was happening. How am I in Thailand? Living in a hotel, that we also film in? It was like a social experiment.” In a good way? She thinks hard. “In a way I will never, ever forget. I will never have an experience like that again. It was so extreme. So the fun bits were unbelievable, so special. The ocean, the landscape, it was majestic. Mike [White, the director] is a genius. Everyone involved is amazing, it’s just the circumstances are quite extreme.”Those circumstances, for Wood, involved living, eating and sleeping at the Four Seasons resort, all regular guests evacuated, for seven months continuously. The crew, cast and staff were the only people she saw for that entire period. It’s a shooting technique producers developed because the first season of The White Lotus was shot during Covid and had to be done in quarantine conditions. I wonder, though, if it wasn’t also informed by the fact that White was a runner-up on reality show Survivor in 2018 and might have got a taste for putting people in socially claustrophobic conditions, to see the things it brings out in them.‘Sometimes it’s fabulous, sometimes it’s Lord of the Flies’: behind the scenes of The White Lotus season threeRead more“Some people were doing a lot of darting, going home a few times, because their schedule allowed it,” Wood says. “For some reason, my character, where I was in the story, meant I never had a big chunk of time.” This is a very modest way of putting it – she never got any time off because she has a huge role. She plays Chelsea, the sunny, yoga-teacher girlfriend to her much older, irascible boyfriend played byWalton Goggins, whose barbs and put-downs she bats off or skates over, as if nothing can touch her. Yet at the same time, you can see she isn’t daft or insensitive;something’s touching her, just maybe not him. The lightest, most throwaway lines of hers are loaded and mysterious – she’s magnetic in it.The intensity of the shoot took its toll, though. “There’s something about Mike’s writing,” Wood says, “everyone always seems on the edge.” Her friendLeo Woodall, star of One Day and The White Lotus season two, called a lot to check in. “He knew what it was like.” She looks up to thank a waitress intently for bringing over a flat white. (You can’t imagine ever getting a casual “cheers” from Wood.)“One day, I was having my hair done and Miia [Kovero, the hair and makeup artist] was, like, ‘You need to go home. I don’t know who I’m talking to any more, Aimee or Chelsea.’ I’d completely abstracted. Everyone becomes their character to an extent, but I didn’t even know who I was.” When she got home to London, she remembers seeing her street and thinking, “Oh my God, that’s the most beautiful bit of litter I’ve ever seen. I’m a person. I’m real.”Something similar happened while shooting the traumatic scenes of Toxic Town. (“Your body doesn’t know it’s not real,” is Wood’s explanation.) It also happened when her character Aimee, inSex Education, was depicted going through a sexual assault and its aftermath. “It was so embarrassing. Someone asked, ‘What was it like doing the scenes with Gillian [Anderson, who plays her screen therapist after the assault]?’ And I started talking about it, then all of a sudden I was in tears. It wasn’t like I was actually sad, but it’s almost like muscle memory.” It happened, too, while she was working on Cabaret; playing Sally Bowles like “she’s having a fucking nervous breakdown”.View image in fullscreenWith Walton Goggins in The White Lotus …Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOView image in fullscreen… and Chris Jenks and Emma Mackey in Sex Education.Photograph: Sam Taylor/NetflixIt’s always been like this, Wood says. “So many times, after a certain scene, I felt like something was seriously wrong in my life, and I’d have to remind myself that those feelings belong to the character.” She’d come off stage and people in the audience would check that she was all right. “One person said, ‘That’s the first time I’ve ever watched the bows and thought, ‘Is that person going to be OK?’ Because I looked so fragile. And I’d try to go, ‘It’s fine, I was only acting’ but I’d end up going, ‘I don’t think I am going to be OK.’” In the end, the choreographer gave her a pep talk about bowing – you have to show them it’s over; that it was just a story. “It’s fair enough. They want to leave their troubles behind. And there I was, going, ‘This is real, and I’m not letting go of it, so why should you?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She has a disarming frankness about her vulnerability, in a way that’s almost incongruous – because she’s a very warm, relaxing presence, you could sit having coffee for hours, shooting the breeze about meal deals and discussing astrological moon signs, yet what you’re actually talking about is a life spent lurching from one near-nervous breakdown to another.She grew up in Greater Manchester, going to school in Cheadle. Her mum worked for Childline and her father was a car dealer. She had an eating disorder when she was at school, and wasn’t really over it when she went to drama school and suffered the slings and arrows people so often describe: being told she’d have to drop her Mancunian accent and work on an RP one, feeling like her stance would never be right becauseshe has scoliosis, which she’s said in the past contributed to herbody dysmorphia. Cast in Sex Education straight after, she found the sudden exposure and scrutiny, physical and general, hard to take.“I’d always felt a little like I had to be what people needed me to be, so fame was like that but blown up. It was weird. It was familiar, it was just bigger. But there was this pressure to be the sunshine. That’s who people wanted when they saw me as Aimee Gibbs. And I’m not the sunshine, I’m scared that I’m just sad and shy.”I did a lot of, I’m kooky and I’m going to hide. I went through the world like that, behind a persona I thought would keep me safeShe’s been thinking very deeply about that whole journey, she says, especially the aftermath of the first series featuring so much nudity. She appears in the opening scene naked, having sex. “I went in, thinking, this is my first TV job, just under a year out of Rada. I didn’t know it was going to be so big, but that opening scene – me, without any clothes on, and all of my stuff in season one was very sex-related – after that, I felt like I had to apologise, I didn’t even know what for. In the pub, most experiences were lovely, but also I’d get people telling me they’d seen my boobs. Even now, don’t search yourself on Twitter. I’ve learned that lesson.”On social media, still, six years on, accounts keep reposting that first scene. “I don’t have regrets about doing it, but I have regrets about apologising for it,” Wood says, “just in a sideways manner, maybe not owning myself, or covering myself up. I did quite a lot of, I’m kooky and I’m going to hide. I went through the world like that for a while.”It was worse after the second series, when Aimee Gibbs had a bigger role, andConnor Swindells– her co-star in that first scene – was, for a few months, her boyfriend in real life. It larded on extra tabloid scrutiny, as well as blurring all those lines further; who she was, who her character was, which one people were expecting when they saw her. “I used to hide a lot, behind a persona that I thought would keep me safe. But it actually doesn’t, it just makes you more fearful. I was always so scared, the madness is going to come back, and it’s going to get me. I didn’t realise I had a lot of say in that.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hollie Fernando/The Guardian. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson, assisted by Sam Deaman. Hair: Halley Brisker.

Blazer, shirt and pin (seen in top image):ErdemThese days she’s building herself a more grounded life. It’s been a ride, her main concern going from “What am I afraid of?” to “What do I actually want?” “The big things never feel as good as the small things,” she says. “Like the things people tell you are the dream, the snazzy things, never feel as good as when you think, ‘I did my laundry today, folded it, put it away, ate three meals. I feel really proud of myself.’”She’s found a sage in the form of Bill Nighy. He sounds like a fount of life skills, but the one she mentions as a real revelation was “when people say hello to you in the street, you don’t have to stop! Say hello back, don’t be rude. But just keep moving. It’s a small thing, but if you’re trying to please the entire world by reflecting a character back to them and you don’t even know which one they want, it’s also quite a big thing.”Recently, Wood moved to be nearer to her best friend from drama school, and “within a week I felt more at home than I have for years. Just that sense of having a community. I know everyone. I know the people in the coffee shop, I know my neighbours.” She’s also started writing. Her next project is Film Club, her screenwriting debut, which she’s co-created withRalph Davis, coming out later this year on BBC. “It’s about a girl called Evie who’s gotten overwhelmed with life, become fearful of the world, back home living with her mum. She’s rejecting reality, hosting a film club in a garage, escaping into cinema.” It’s described as a romcom but is quite an extreme one: its heroine is pretty much housebound with agoraphobia. “Evie isn’t me,” she says, “but I sometimes need to be forced to go out of the house.”She’s also come to accept she’s not a person who deals well with chaos. “I am someone who is a bit fragile around madnesses, and it’s not my fault. My responsibility is looking after myself, and I’ve done so much that has been the opposite of that. Stupidly, in Thailand, I stopped going to therapy. I could have done it by Zoom. The time I needed to do it the most religiously, I stopped doing it. I know what works now, to keep the madness at bay. I have to go into therapy. Accepting who I actually am, I need therapy, stability, consistency. Maybe I can’t do jobs that take me away from home for seven months. And maybe that’s OK. I want to be the girl who can go to Thailand and not go mad,” she says, with an ironic, faux-childlike, yeah right kind of look, “but I’m not that girl.”Toxic Town is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsAimee Lou WoodTelevisionDrama filmsSex EducationThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had reportedly been on her way home from a show and was the only person who died in the crash.Her daughter Diamond Stonewroteonline: “My mommy is gone.”Stone has been a founding member of groundbreaking female hip-hop trio the Sequence in the late 70s at the age of 16. They scored a hit with Funk You Up, a song that was later sampled by Dr Dre for his single Keep Their Heads Ringin and Bruno Mars in Uptown Funk.“I think that being the first female rap group to actually come out and have an authentic original rap record is an accomplishment that no one else has been able to top,” shesaidin 2023.After the group disbanded in the mid-80s, Stone worked as a vocalist for Vertical Hold and then Devox before she later provided songwriting credits to D’Angelo for his first two studio albums. She was also a backing vocalist for the singer on tour before providing vocals for Lenny Kravitz on his album 5 in 1998.In 1999, Stone released her first solo album, Black Diamond, which contained the hits No More Rain (In This Cloud) and Life Story. She went on to record the theme to the hit sitcom Girlfriends in 2000 and released her second album, MahoganySoul, the following year.That album featured the hit Wish I Didn’t Miss You, which became her biggest international success.Her third album, Stone Love, featured the song I Wanna Thank Ya with Snoop Dogg, which became a big hit in Europe. The video also featured a young Idris Elba.Stone went on to record a further seven albums, the most recent of which was 2023’s Love Language, which featured Musiq Soulchild and Stone’s son Swayvo Twain.She was nominated for three Grammys in her career and also wrote songs for Erykah Badu and Raphael Saadiq. “There is a deep sad feeling that as a songwriter – something such a gift – you never get acknowledged for it,” shesaidin 2011. “People think that’s how I eat because I make records but I make far more money as songwriter than from being a singer.”Stone also worked as an actor, with roles in big screen comedies like The Hot Chick and The Fighting Temptations and on stage in Chicago playing Big Mama Morton.Explore more on these topicsMusicSoulR&BnewsShareReuse this content"

Various other operators come and go in William Friedkin’s gritty and unsettling procedural – based on a real heroin sting – before Hackman’s Detective Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle emerges from behind an ill-fitting undercover Santa Claus outfit, like a background player busting into his first lead role. It’s as fitting an entrance as ever for Hackman, leveling up after his supporting work on TV and films like Bonnie and Clyde. And he gives a performance that sets the tone for his whole career, playing the brutal and racist cop, a morally murky figure who just doesn’t sit right as the hero of the story. Many of the qualities that made Hackman so great in later villainous roles – the way he moves like a menace with a devilishly charming grin, slipping so easily from comforting to antagonizing – are in Doyle. That detective’s infamous query, repeatedly grilling suspects about picking their feet in Poughkeepsie, is as mischievously disorienting as Hackman’s onscreen presence.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe Poseidon AdventureAs an 11-year-old of a nervous disposition, The Poseidon Adventure was a sight to behold. Possibly the first disaster movie I saw, and certainly the firstGene Hackmanfilm, it went straight to the heart of those pre-adolescent terrors: Would the cross-channel ferry stay upright? Was there a priest about who could save everyone’s skins? Was there an Olympic swimming champion concealed inside someone’s unlikely looking mum? Hackman would of course make much better films, both before (Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith, The French Connection) and after (take your pick), but for sheer messianic fervour there’s nothing to match it. The amazing scene where he yells at the Almighty while trying to turn off a steam valve is one of the all time greats, Gene Hackman at his Gene Hackmanest. His character – a hip, muscular clergyman – was an outdated trope even then (and probably was when Karl Malden did one in On the Waterfront 20 years earlier) but I personally prefer it to sax-tootler Harry Caul, his generally lauded performance of a similar vintage. “Keep going. Rogo!”Andrew PulverThe ConversationI was embarrassingly late toThe Conversation, despite a youth in which Gene Hackman played an important part, and like many films one only consumes through references and iconography, I developed an impression of what I thought it would be. I was partly right (there is a great deal of both paranoia and the granular details of early 70s surveillance tech) but I was mostly wrong. I had assumed a grander tale of a more complex conspiracy but what I found was something smaller and sadder, a thriller second and a character study first, one of a low-key everyman wrecked by guilt and cursed by loneliness. Hackman’s Harry Caul is a man whose greatest skill – the “best bugger on the west coast” – is something that will never bring him peace, just permanent anxiety. He knows how unsafe the world can increasingly be – it’s his job to further make it that way, and this distrust leads him away from potential relationships and toward an internal unravelling. Hackman plays this with poignance, carrying the visible, shoulder-crippling weight of what he’s been forced to live with, avoiding the cheap, nervy mannerisms many others would lazily employ. The ending is one of dramatic combustion but there’s also a calm in Harry realising that his overbearing control was just an illusion. It’s not about giving up, it’s more about accepting life’s limitations and trying to find peace within them.Benjamin LeeNight MovesGene Hackman’s second collaboration with director Arthur Penn revolves around some convoluted business with illegally imported indigenous artifacts from the Yucatán peninsula, but the ne plus ultra of New Hollywood downers is really the story of a beaten-down man working his way to the end of his rope. Introduced in decline as past-his-prime former football player turned PI turned cuckold Harry Moseby, Hackman spends the film on defense, the substance of his performance resting in his efforts to stave off undesirable parts of himself: his physical deterioration following a recklessly spent youth, his bitterness toward women, his cynicism amplified by the cruelty and greed and statutory incest all around him. We leave him on a dour note, bleeding out and spinning in impotent circles, but Hackman shines in the asides of sardonic wit delivered with a hangdog almost-smirk, which now cement his legacy with a dozen classic soundbites. Of a night at the movies: “I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kind of like watching paint dry.” When asked who’s winning an anemic football game: “Nobody. One side is just losing slower than the other.” Offering cold comfort to a wayward teen: “I know it doesn’t make much sense when you’re 16. Don’t worry. When you get to be 40, it isn’t any better.” We could go on.Charles BramescoHoosiersNo film has done more to shape American sportswriting than Hoosiers. Scribes of my generation in particular proudly boast of wearing out VHS copies of the film in adolescence, and how those ad infinitum replays destined them to a future of sweating out press deadlines from some of the best seats in the house. But Hickory High’s unlikely march to the Indiana state basketball championship doesn’t become the too-good-to-be-true story that sportswriters look for in every gym without Hackman bringing it home as Normal Dale, the disgraced college coach tasked with turning around the team. When sportswriters take note of actual coaches sermonizing about playing the game ”the right way”, it’s because we can’t help quoting Coach Brown when we hear him. And though the character may take inspiration from flesh-and-blood Hoosier state personalities – Indiana coach Bobby Knight, not least – it was Hackman who ultimately made Coach Dale complex, compassionate and imminently worth rooting for. Coach Dale’s disciplined, team-first approach may have gone out of style decades ago (“There’s more to the game than shooting!” he famously groaned), but Hackman at the top of this acting game lives for all time.Andrew LawrenceUnforgivenHackman’s shady sheriff is the lawman in the small town of Big Whiskey, where the ladies of the saloon demand justice after one of them is assaulted by a passing cowpoke. He’s entirely the low-key psychopath Eastwood’s antiheroic western deserves, a man capable of plausible affability but then, with a sudden darkening of his mood, callous rough justice. First he outrages the sex workers by attempting to appease them with horse-trading, then he applies his boots to the faces of elderly mercenaries like Richard Harris’s English Bob who come to collect the bounty. In one chilling scene, Bill sneers as he forces Eastwood’s feverish Will Munny to slither out of the saloon on his belly into the mud. Disarmingly, he’s often quite likable. He’s an inept amateur housebuilder, ham-handedly manufacturing himself a porch where he can pass his retirement admiring the sunset, or a vivid raconteur, impressing a hack writer with by factchecking some overcooked yarns of the good old days. Similarly, Hackman resists the temptation to overplay this double-sided character, and this Oscar-winning performance is all the more unsettling for it.Pamela HutchinsonThe FirmAs Avery Tolar, a senior partner at a sinister Memphis law practice in The Firm, Hackman haunts Mitch McDeere, the idealistic young recruit played by Tom Cruise, like the ghost of his own corrupt future, when boozing and womanizing will be his only means of muting his guilty conscience. In order to survive at the firm – quite literally, Mitch will learn – he must embrace its rogue culture of mobbed-up criminality and Avery is Mitch’s mentor through the process, walking him through the legal shortcuts he’ll need to master in order to serve his wealthy clients. He also has an eye on Mitch’s wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn), despite their age difference, which speaks to a life where he’s constantly rewarded for his ethical compromise. Yet Hackman plays Avery with an unmistakable world-weariness that’s fully revealed in a moment when he seems to remember the man he used to be and willingly pays the toll for his sins.Scott TobiasThe Royal TenenbaumsIt’s become a bit of a naysayer cliche to claim that Gene Hackman was the last actor to really bring a Wes Anderson character to life within the writer-director’s hermetically sealed, tightly controlled environment. But while I don’t agree with all that, there is inarguably something special about Hackman’s performance in The Royal Tenenbaums as the shifty, irascible patriarch of a genius family he doesn’t seem to understand (at least not at first). As Royal Tenenbaum, a deeply flawed man who is nonetheless – unlike his depressive adult children – unburdened by faded memories of prodigious achievement, Hackman’s unfussy, straight-ahead acting style perfectly cuts through the movie’s deadpan melancholy and enhances it at every turn. Though he was great in plenty of comedies, Hackman was rarely pitched this many comic fastballs, every one of which he knocks out of the park with a crisp crack, helping to make Tenenbaums Anderson’s most quotable film. (“I’m very sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” “It’s still frowned upon, but then, what isn’t these days, right?” “That’s the last time you put a knife in me!” – and so on.) And though Royal is more two-bit conman than precocious prodigy, he’s still a deeply Andersonian creation: a man so fixated on his vision that he will self-consciously engineer his own redemption arc, even if it means faking a cancer diagnosis. When Hackman shows that shamelessness giving way to tenderness at the end of the film, demonstrating gentle empathy to his distraught son Chas (Ben Stiller), The Royal Tenenbaums becomes not just Anderson’s funniest film, but one of his most moving, too.Jesse HassengerExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanThe ConversationClint EastwoodFrancis Ford  CoppolaWilliam FriedkinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having sold out its three-month run at the 180-seat London venue before first night, it is set to move to the Garrick theatre. But according to its original creatorMel Brooks, the musical might never have happened at all.The 98-year-old Brooks has told the Guardian he was initially reluctant to adapt his 1967 movie for the stage. Only through the persistence of a producer did he relent.“David Geffen called me every day. I said, ‘David, it’s a perfectly good little movie. I won the Academy Award for my screenplay. It’s been honoured and saluted enough. There’s no reason to make it a musical.’ Then the next day, he called me again. He never stopped calling me. And finally, I said, ‘Well, he’s not a dumb guy, so maybe there is something.’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan’ … Mel Brooks.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Peabody awardsOpeningon Broadway in 2001, The Producers went on to win 12 Tonys. The New York Times called it a “sublimely ridiculous spectacle” – a sentiment echoed by UK criticsin 2004and again when director Patrick Marber staged the first major London revivallast year.“Marber is a terrific director and is perfect for it,” said Brooks, who co-wrote the show with the late Thomas Meehan. Brooks also wrote the score, featuring Springtime for Hitler.“Tom was sweet as sugar and very proper as opposed to me who was very improper. In jokes and language, I was the bad boy. I’m blamed for all that semi-dirty stuff, but that was really secretly Tom Meehan – I’m spilling the beans!”The production will transfer to the Garrick theatre, where the author’s horror spoof, Young Frankenstein, picked upfive-star reviewsin 2017. Staying with the show are key cast members Marc Antolin, Trevor Ashley, Raj Ghatak, Andy Nyman, Harry Morrison and Joanna Woodward.“I’m very proud of that production at the Chocolate Factory and I’m so happy we’re going back to the Garrick,” said Brooks.In Marber’s production, Nyman plays Max Bialystock, a failing impresario who sets out to stage a Broadway flop. He and his accountant, Leopold Bloom (Antolin), hire a neo-Nazi playwright, an incompetent director and a useless lead actor in the hope of closing the show and keeping their investors’ money. They assume no audience would tolerate a sympathetic paean to Hitler and would have it shut down, clearing the way for them to make their fortune.View image in fullscreenDianne Pilkington, centre, in Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks at the Garrick theatre, London, in 2017Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBrooks, who was born in 1926 and served as a combat engineer in the second world war (“I mostly ducked”), has seen nearly a century’s worth of authoritarian rulers come and go. “I like the ‘come and go’ – especially the go,” he joked.Now he lives in a country where Nazi salutes appear to have been given at large political rallies. “It’s something we hope will pass and go its way, just like Hitler and his people did go their way.”He said he believes laughter is a powerful weapon against tyranny. “They’re gifted with a kind of flagrant rhetoric, but once you make fun of them and you drag them down with comedy, you win. When you can get people to laugh at them, you win.”It is an attitude shaped by his experience as a young man performing comedy routines at Jewish resorts in the Catskill mountains. “We who have worked in the borscht belt know that comedy is the answer. It’s magical, it pays the rent and also we learn stealing because we steal jokes from each other – recklessly, not even thinking about it.”Public booking for The Producers opens on 5 March. Previews run from 30 August and booking will run to 21 February 2026.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMel BrooksWest EndMusicalsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

You and your fellow escaper have the use of a tiny spaceship, the Rig, which, with your pursuer always close behind, cannot linger on any asteroid or space station for long. This is rickety, dust-blown sci-fi, where the ships are chaotic tangles of wire and accumulated parts, and most of the freelance work available involves salvaging parts from wrecks launched in some earlier, more moneyed period in galactic history. Each excursion must be carefully planned, and turning the key on the Rig’s engine feels like a roll of the dice which, in this game, everything is.Each day – the equivalent of a turn in a traditional boardgame – you are presented with five dice rolls. These numbers represent a currency that can be spent on dozens of activities: taking on odd jobs, farming resources, making friends or enemies, laying traps, perhaps establishing a mushroom colony in an isolated bay of your ship. The higher the roll, the more quickly you achieve your goals, with setbacks and penalties for small numbers (and the risk of permanent damage to the dice themselves, depending on your luck and choices). Through these tasks you can gather new specialised crew members, discover new locations and, day by day, try to put distance between you and your pursuer, while undoing the damage he did to you.The people you meet often have their own needs and wants too, which you can choose to accommodate or ignore. The game is text-heavy, yet has a tensely kinetic quality. As the stakes raise, every choice becomes more consequential, while the capriciousness of the dice remains constant, providing ongoing moments of bliss and frustration. An intricate, wonderfully balanced game, that feels both familiar, yet entirely unique.Watch a trailer for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector.Explore more on these topicsGamesSimon Parkin on gamesAdventure gamesRole playing gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing is comfortable in the Royal Opera’s staging ofIl Trovatore. That front curtain hell-mouth acts as a grim, faintly comic warning: Adele Thomas’s2023 production, back for the first time (revival director Simon Iorio), exposes Verdi’s 1853 opera in all its anarchy. Naturalism, doubtful anyway with a plot that includes sinister curses and a mother mistakenly throwing her baby on the fire, is out. Beneath the convention of set-piece choruses and magnificent coloratura arias, transgression holds sway. In Annemarie Woods’s designs, the 15th-century Dutch artist Hieronymus Bosch provides a touchstone. No surprise to see humans in animal skulls, cavorting and thwacking to that famous, harmonically slithering melody we call the Anvil chorus (Coro di Zingari). Horned goblins pop through trap doors, squirming up and down the stairs, which, fixed within three large frames, fill an otherwise empty stage. Chorus and cast (choreography by Emma Woods) must deliver every detail of the story in sharp focus.View image in fullscreen‘Pulsating energy’: Michael Fabiano and Rachel Willis-Sørensen in Il Trovatore.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/GuardianOn first night, momentum was elusive initially, the conductor Giacomo Sagripanti pausing for applause that might not automatically have come, and with some dropped stitches in ensemble between stage and pit. Once Agnieszka Rehlis appeared, as the vengeful Azucena, the pace quickened, uncertainty receded. The Polish mezzo soprano, fearless in urgency and despair, held histrionics in tight rein (a contrast to Jamie Barton’s no-holds-barred Azucena in 2023, equally compelling but different). As Count di Luna, the Russian baritone Aleksei Isaev, sometimes overshadowed in ensembles, shone in his big aria “Il balen”, in which Luna’s thwarted love for the noble Leonora shows Verdi at his most compassionate. The American soprano Rachel Willis-Sørensen was rich-toned and assured in negotiating the taxing range, vocally and emotionally, of Leonora, in love with the troubadour-rebel of the title, Manrico. The star American tenor Michael Fabiano excels in this Italian repertoire, silky toned and ardent. Manrico’s battle cry aria “Di quella pira”, full of high-note risk, had exciting, pulsating energy, in the orchestra, too. His final duet with Azucena was lyrical and intense. This is brave and powerful theatre, easy neither for performers or audience. It leaves you rattled: surely what Verdi wanted.TheBBC Symphony Orchestra’s latest all-day Total Immersion, calledSymphonic Electronics, was an exploration of music using electronics old and new, with a glimpse at an AI future. Since the greatest work featured, Tristan Murail’s “spectral” classicGondwana(1980), is for large orchestra with no electronics, there’s a challenge in summing up the porous boundaries of this extravaganza. A UK premiere by Steven Daverson (b 1985),Figures Outside a Dacha, with Snowfall, and an Abbey in the Background, used live electronics to pay homage to the film-maker Andrei Tarkovsky.I was ready to apologise to the friend I persuaded to go – but they loved the whole thingDaverson’s inspiration was the final shot of Tarkovsky’s 1983 filmNostalgia, which shows a man, a dog, a pool, an abbey, then snow starts falling. It would not be true to say this was immediately clear on listening, though the spatial effects of synthesised bells, mournful brass refrains and amplified saxophone, guitar and other instruments created a haunting, slow-moving avalanche of sound. The other premiere,Bab-Khaneh: Gatehouse of Memory, was a BBC commission by the British-Iranian composer Shiva Feshareki (b 1987). Its starting point was theBarbicanitself: a sonic survey of the building’s acoustics and design. At the same time, her piece required a complete reinvention of the hall’s natural sound through the positioning of an orchestra of loudspeakers – her words – to make a 360-degree surround sound system.Positioned behind her turntable deck, she plays the hall as an instrument, “sculpting my spatial turntable performance” live in the moment. The BBC Symphony Orchestra played mainly sustained, slow notes, which may have tested their patience. Whether you respond to boulders of sound blasting around the hall at high volume, with a lighting design in winking colours, now like glow-worms, now orbs, now searchlights, is a matter of sensory resilience. I was ready to apologise to the friend I persuaded to go – 50 minutes begins to feel epic, in any medium, even Mahler – but they loved the whole thing. It certainly acts as a “web of memory”, as Feshareki intends. Out of the electroacoustic edifices, songs flickered to the fore, evocative shreds of aural balm: from Purcell’sDido and Aeneas, Paul McCartney and Wings’s My Love, Foreigner’s 80s hit Waiting for a Girl Like You and the Iranian songGole Sangam. Listen out for the broadcast on a future edition ofRadio 3’sNew Music Show. A mono smart speaker may not have the same effect as the entire, multi-channelled Barbican hall, but there’s time to re-rig your house in preparation.View image in fullscreenShiva Feshareki ‘playing the hall as an instrument’ at the Barbican.Photograph: Mark AllanOn a small scale, in overlapping spectral territory, I must mention the newish, six-strong ensembleMad Song, who gave an enterprising programme at the October Gallery: two premieres – by Thomas Metcalf (b 1996) and Jean-Louis Agobet (b 1968) – and two 20th-century works, by Elliott Carter and Gérard Grisey. Metcalf’sPhotogenialooks back to a photographic process pioneered by William Henry Fox Talbot in the 1830s: delicate whirrings and tappings fade or grow like Talbot’s ghostly silhouettes on light-sensitive paper. To say it left an impression is not intended as clever wordplay: it did. These expert young players deserve to reach a wider audience.The 50th anniversary of the death of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) is in spate, as demonstrated by cycles of his 15 string quartets, at Milton Court and Wigmore Hall, running in near parallel. In the second of theJersualem Quartet’s Wigmore series (they return in June), the group played the fourth, fifth and sixth quartets. The cellist’s twice-broken string notwithstanding, these were brilliantly detailed performances, at once acidic and melancholy. Founded in 1993, the ensemble is characterised by a viola player capable, in resonance and volume, of creating a true bridge between the two violins and the cello. Ori Kam plays a modern instrument by the famed American makerHiroshi Iizuka. Kam has likened its response to putting your foot down on a Maserati.

The show is one of the last vaguely monocultural products that seems to exist right now, making instant stars of its cast; not that Lisa, government name Lalisa Manobal, necessarily needed the profile boost. As a member of behemoth K-pop four-piece Blackpink – perhaps the most successful girl group of all time, with billions of streams and a trail of sold-out stadiums left in their wake – she is already one of the most famous people in the world. But a show such asThe White Lotus, which everyone and their grandmother watches, brings with it a different kind of fame.Alter Egois the kind of debut album seemingly designed to capitalise on that newfound attention – it’s a brash, high-octane pop-rap record that clearly wants to cover all bases. Opener Born Again, featuring Raye and Doja Cat, taps into 80s disco sleaze, landing somewhere between the Weeknd and Dua Lipa. A collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion is a would-be bad bitch anthem; one with Future is begging for placement in the trailer for an edgy mainstream action film. There’s a song with Rosalía – perfect for insertion into one of Spotify’s many well-streamedmusica urbanaplaylists – as well as a gratuitous 90s sample (on Moonlit Floor) and a collaboration with nascent Afrobeats star Tyla for good measure.In many ways, this feels like the kind of major label debut album that proliferated through the 2010s: it’s polished, professional and packed to the gills with au courant guest spots. And – perhaps because of these reasons – it feels less like a distinctive statement by a soloist looking to assert individual identity than a focus group-tested attempt at megastar success.Tyla’s lithe, soft vocal on When I’m With You is a welcome change of pace compared with the metallic sheen often applied to Lisa’s voiceSquint and it’s hard to work out what exactly Lisa stands for, emotionally or conceptually. She is fond of name-checking brands and flexing her wealth, but never in a way that feels revealing or idiosyncratic. A hook such as “When I walk by, I hear them say / That’s money / That’s motherfuckin’ money” on Rapunzel, feels like the kind of shallow regurgitation of American hip-hop tropes that proliferated on Miley Cyrus’s infamousBangerzalbum, which already felt outdated when it came out 12 years ago. When she raps, Lisa is only ever flexing, or issuing threats, to the point that when, on the late-album ballad Dream, she sings lovingly about an ex, it feels laughably out of character. The track reveals a surprisingly blunt view of genre: ballads are for soft emotions, while rap is for aggression. We’re in the midst of an era in whichSabrina Carpenteris using her ballads to issue venomous kiss-offs andDoechiiis rapping about depression and addiction, making a viewpoint like Lisa’s feel woefully out of date.Despite claiming to be “walking, causin’ havoc” on Fuck Up the World, the beats onAlter Ego, while always loud and busy, never feel abrasive or boundary-pushing in any material way. At worst, a song such as Elastigirl, with its “la-la-la-la-la-la” motif, feels like a less challenging reheat of Blackpink’s enduring early hit Ddu-Du Ddu-Du. Elastigirl lacks that song’s taut, borderline shocking militaristic edge (and it arrives some seven years later).Watch a video for Born Again by Lisa ft Doja Cat and Raye.Alter Egosupposedly explores Lisa’s five distinct personae – Vixi, Sunni, Roxi, Kiki and Speedi – a concept somewhat neutered by the fact that it is only the guest artists who really stand out on the album. Future, growling and grunting, tears through his guest verse on Fuck Up the World; Tyla’s lithe, soft vocal on When I’m With You is a welcome change of pace compared with the metallic sheen often applied to Lisa’s voice. Not always, though: Rosalía and Doja Cat, generally two of pop’s most distinctive figures, are underserved by these cookie-cutter productions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A playfully meta Greek-language film about film-making, set largely on a gay nudist beach near Athens,The Summer With Carmenis so breezily sun-kissed and adorable that you could prescribe it as a cure for seasonal affective disorder. Or you could, were it not for all the full-frontal male nudity and cottaging. As the waves lazily lap against the buttocks of hopeful strangers checking each other out, best friends Demosthenes (Yorgos Tsiantoulas) and Nikitas (Andreas Labropoulos) have other things on their minds. Nikitas, a former actor turned aspiring writer-director has been approached by a producer looking for a new project. The criteria – fun, sexy, Greek, queer, low budget – seems like a perfect fit. Nikitas just needs to come up with an idea. Demosthenes suggests the events of a past summer – with a break-up; a hook-up or 10; and a small, worried-looking stray dog named Carmen. And through a series of deft flashbacks and some peppy, irreverent on-screen inter-titles, the tale unfolds and Nikitas’s screenplay takes shape.The story itself is fairly insubstantial – some bickering, plenty of family drama and just a hint of personal growth for self-absorbed beefcake Demosthenes. But the lively telling of it is where the considerable charm of the film lies. Director Zacharias Mavroeidis strikes a deft balance, between gently mocking his two central characters and celebrating their enduring bond; between sentiment and saltiness; between adhering to the rules of screenwriting and skewering them. But for something as frothy and seemingly frivolous as it is, the film also delivers crisply observed characters and fully lived-in relationships: Demosthenes’s scenes with his impossible-to-please, drama queen of a mother are so stingingly perceptive, they make your eyes smart.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for The Summer With Carmen.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsThe ObserverWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re introduced to an Australian geologist, who is travelling in the pristine Swiss Alps of the late 1950s. Against an idyllic backdrop of “chalets, cows, ice-blue lakes, hillsides of coloured flowers”, he considers the beginnings of an infatuation with a Spanish music teacher, and recalls a childhood visit to his grandmother’s farm, during which his theft of a ring was blamed on a “native” housemaid. There’s a strong sense of place; of character and character flaws; of a plot that’s pleasurably thickening. The stage is lullingly set.And then, abruptly, De Kretser marches out and dismantles it. Fictional mid-20th century Switzerland gives way to something close to factual present day; De Kretser shifts into the first person, and launches into a crisp description of her critical engagement with a 2021 London Review of Books essay on the application of situationist theory to an Israeli military raid that killed 70 people. After reading that essay, she explains, “experiences I’d had, over time, with theory and practice came into my mind … As I recalled thrashing about in the messy gap between the two, I began to see that my novel had stalled because it wasn’t the book I needed to write. The book I needed to write concerned the breakdowns between theory and practice.”And this is the book she gives us. Our newly installed narrator, whose biography mirrors De Kretser’s own, carries us back to 1980s Melbourne, where she’s embarking on an MA on Virginia Woolf while renting a “run-down one-bedder” in the rackety suburb of St Kilda: a place that is “violent, and violently policed”, but open to sea and sky; bathed in “carbolic summer light”. The focus switches between the university’s English department, which, in 1986, is busily fortifying itself with the fashionable abstractions of literary theory, and St Kilda’s gaudy and chaotic social scene: parties and cafes; film, fashion, gossip, and art. In these invigorating contexts, the narrator finds that her “undergraduate years had taken on the aspect of a wasteland”. Intellectually and socially, the “foundations on which [she’d] expected to build” turn out to be “mere rubble underfoot”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The novels of the “Woolfmother” have inspired her, and a poster presides over her desk, but she finds Woolf’s cavalier racism – in particular her diary entry describing a famed Sri Lankan anti-colonialist as “a poor little mahogany-coloured wretch” – increasingly unpalatable. Away from the page, meanwhile, she grapples with her relationship with her actual mother, whose persistent letters and calls trammel her in different, more personal ways. Finally, and most urgently, she finds herself caught up in a vivid love affair with Kit, an engineer in his final year who, at the same time as sleeping with our narrator, is unapologetically involved in a “deconstructed” relationship with Olivia, an elegant Law student who “wore her yellow hair in plaits woven around her head like a fairytale girl”. The physical insistence of this real-world affair cuts across and through both her work and her perception of her self: she is, she believes, a “modern woman”, fully committed to feminism; but this self-construction turns out to offer no defence against a flood of unsisterly feelings towards Olivia, whom she envies, obsesses over, pities and despises in equal measure. The practice of life, it turns out, refuses to fit neatly into her theories of it.“I no longer wanted to write novels that read like novels,” De Kretser says, early on, of her abortive sojourn in the Alps. “Instead of shapeliness and disguise, I wanted a form that allowed for formlessness and mess. It occurred to me that one way to find that form might be to tell the truth.” Her rejection of historical fiction in favour of apparently autobiographical descriptions of the tangle of human relationships – and the tangle of contradictory, often irrational feelings that surround them – appears, at first glance, to do just that. But De Kretser, and her book, are too alive to the slipperiness and instability of narrative – all narrative – to leave it at that. Fiction lies, for sure; but memoir, in which the author sets to work on her own life, sifting it, sorting it, and making it shapely, lies in its own way, too. In Theory & Practice, De Kretser gradually, delicately, picks and plucks at the notion of “truth” in literature – questioning first the trustworthiness of the novel and then the trustworthiness of autobiography – until, by her book’s end, all certainties have been dismantled, and it’s hard to know what it is, exactly, we have read. Her excellence as a writer lies in the fact that she manages to make a novel that effectively acts as a deconstruction of the novel form feel like a pleasure, rather than a chore. She offers us the theory, while revelling in the practice; she exposes the lie to us, but permits us to love it anyway.Theory and Practice by Michelle de Kretser is published by Sort Of (£12.99).

But do we really start from a place of innocence or are we always somehow complicit in acts of violence? Do perpetrators attack from without, or are they an expression of something abominable within the community, its monstrous id? These questions haunt the halls of Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho’s extraordinary contemporary opera as surely as they’ll disturb the dreams of its audience.Innocence opens with a deeply ominous series of chords from the lowest keys on the piano, as swirling strings and smirking bassoons mix with the trills and runs from the higher woodwinds, punctuated by the occasional crash of percussion. Atmospheric doesn’t begin to cover it. The music has shades of Bartók and Górecki, with more than a little of that master of dread, György Ligeti. The singers slink on as the curtain rises, explaining that they “can’t go to work any more”, that they “can’t have my back to the door”. Trauma animates every flinch; these people have clearly been exposed to unspeakable horror.The Australian Ballet: Nijinsky review - riveting, defiant portrait of madness ain’t prettyRead moreWe soon learn we’re at a wedding celebration, 10 years after a mass school shooting that implicates the groom’s family but has been kept from the bride.

But all that has been suppressed will rise up to wreak havoc, and the effects of violence can’t be simply willed away.As the events of the wedding begin to merge with the tragedy itself, so the polyphony in the score shifts in and out of harmony and dissonance. Saariaho’s ability to conjure vocal lines of startling originality is matched by the psychological precision of Sofi Oksanen and Aleksi Barrière’s libretto. Various languages – Finnish, English, French, Spanish and German – are used not just to vary the sonic palette but to broaden the implications. The result is a work of staggering depth and multiplicity of the kind you rarely find in opera.View image in fullscreen‘The set, designed with stylistic virtuosity by Chloe Lamford and cleverly lit by James Farncombe, is partitioned into separate but connecting rooms that completely transform as the opera progresses.’Photograph: Jean-Louis FernandezDirector Simon Stone builds and sustains a vision for this piece that is frequently astonishing; it’s certainly impossible to imagine it being done in any other way. His set – designed with stylistic virtuosity by Chloe Lamford and cleverly lit by James Farncombe – is a mid-century building on a slow revolve, partitioned into separate but connecting rooms that completely transform as the opera progresses. A restaurant becomes a classroom in the time it takes for a single rotation. It’s a marvel of stagecraft, but it never overwhelms the narrative or falls victim to gimmickry.Rooms are vital in Innocence, their tendency to entrap and isolate the very people they’re designed to protect. Spaces alter not just physically but psychologically before our eyes, and the characters who creep through them seem simultaneously solid and spectral. It could easily devolve into abstraction, become confusing or abstruse, but Stone never loses sight of the characters’ mental states or emotional stakes. For all the blending of timelines, the clarity and verisimilitude doesn’t waver.Thirteen individual characters make up the cast, and each is perfectly delineated (and beautifully sung). Faustine de Monès and Sean Panikkar are the bride and groom, achingly compromised by looming revelations, desperately holding to an idea of love that looks increasingly like denial. Claire de Sévigné and Jenny Carlstedt are both excellent as the two brittle but stalwart mothers, carrying the dreadful burdens of loss and guilt. Teddy Tahu Rhodes is a wonderfully resigned local priest, and Lucy Shelton is heartbreaking as the teacher who couldn’t save her charges and knows she’ll never teach again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rowan Kievits is a jittery mess, and Julie Hega makes a terrifyingly articulate accomplice, blowing massive holes in the idea of the victims as guileless innocents. Best of all, for the ambiguity of her motivations, the strength of her presence and the beguiling eccentricity and ethereal purity of her voice, is Erika Hammarberg as the key victim, Markéta. It’s virtually impossible to take your eyes off her.Innocence is a monumental achievement, bold and profoundly responsive to contemporary life. Its characters are deeply felt and frighteningly accessible, adrift in a revolving nightmare they can’t escape. The score is wondrously strange, capable of blending euphony and discord into an integrated, almost sacred whole; it is magnificently conducted by Clément Mao-Takacs and luminously played by the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra.Operais often considered a moribund art form, but this shows how essential it can be. You may lose any vestige of innocence you had going in, but you’ll emerge more fully human from the experience.Innocence is on now as part of the Adelaide festival, at the Festival theatre until 5 March.Explore more on these topicsOperaAdelaide festivalAustralian theatreTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

And crowds still gather, here and there. At theTrotting Races, for example, in the Sant Rafael hippodrome in the centre of the island. A peculiar island tradition that supposedly began with charioteers during Ibiza’s Roman occupation, the sport requires jockeys to ride on little wheeled carts harnessed to horses that keep a briskish, semi-hurried pace, as if slightly late for an appointment. Kids and old boys seem to love it, the latter laying small bets on the races and dropping shots of brandy in their coffee. My horse, Maldiva des Puig, comes a distant third.View image in fullscreenOver the same weekend, I also visitMercadillo Sant Jordi, just outside Ibiza Town, a busy flea market in a cycling velodrome where the mood and music are unexpectedly vibrant. The resident DJ plays a judicious early afternoon set of trance and disco that fills a racing pit with daytime dancers.Then there is the Sunday “hippy” market in the tiny northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja. Morning mass has just ended at the parish church and the congregation merges with shoppers and pedlars around the main square. A band is playing Bob Marley covers and a few wizened flower people are smiling and swaying like it’s 1969.Jean-Michel Fueter, an elder statesman of the island’s creative community, has been standing in for the band’s regular guitarist. “I first came to Ibiza in 1970 as one of those long-hairs,” he says when the band takes a break. “LSD and all that. I later realised that what I loved about the place was not just the people and culture, it was the energy of the land itself. It’s tellurgical, magical, peaceful and feminine, and, if you’re sensitive, you can tune into it.”View image in fullscreenThe Cave of Light.Photograph: Ibiza HikeIn summer, Fueter helps people do this at his long-running, mind-expanding club night Namaste, held in Ibiza’s other landmark hippy market,Las Dalias. But winter may be a better time to pick up the signal he’s talking about, when there is, frankly, less interference.“People always ask about the hidden gems of Ibiza,” says Boris Buono, who makes it his business to feed the Sunday multitudes with plant-based pizzas at his garden restaurant. “To me, the real hidden gem is the winter.”Unlike most chefs and owners, Buono keeps his establishment open all year round. “I live here, I work here, my kids are in school – what else am I going to do?”I certainly think it’s an island for artists, and hanging out when it’s quiet is part of the artistic process“I prefer the winter,” agrees Behzad Behpour, an Iranian-born painter who works out of a second-floor studio overlooking the market. “You can clear your mind a bit, and make time to create.” Around us hang Behpour’s signature large canvases, rendering Ibizan icons (club owners, big-name DJs, regular celebrity visitors) as writhing servants of the island’s presiding deities – principally the ancient Phoenician moon goddess, Tanit. “I certainly think it’s an island for artists, and hanging out when it’s quiet is part of the artistic process.”His Kurdish friend Bahram Pourmand, better known as Bahramji, is also a painter, a new age musician, and another veteran of the Ibizan scene. “You don’t get a winter like this anywhere else,” says Bahramji. He agrees too on the magnetic pull of the place, but reminds me that magnets also repel. “If the island doesn’t want you she will push you away,” he says, the kohl around his eyes making his gaze that bit more intense.View image in fullscreenThe hippy market in the northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja.Photograph: Album/AlamyThe island is not immune to market forces and rent hikes have been squeezing artists off Ibiza, as Bahramji says: “Finding €2,000 a month is very difficult, but I’m going to stay here, playing music until I die on stage.” The summer glamour of the island, the recent upscaling of its club culture, the building and buying of luxe villas and condos, all have knock-on effects that linger when the VIP crowd clears out when summer ends.“Locals end up paying tourist prices for everything, even for toast and coffee,” says Martina Greef, on her sailboat off the eastern port of Santa Eulària des Riu. Greef is a lifelong islander whose German parents came to Ibiza with that original influx of hippies. She owns a share in her vessel, named the Al Mar, and covers the exorbitant mooring fees by running charter services in peak season.For a short spell, I feel as if I’m flying the boat over open water, while the low sun drops behind an ancient altarMost clients just want to sail across to the island of Formentera, she says, “because that’s what they’ve seen on Instagram”. The strait between the sister islands is akin to a highway for yachts and ferries in summer, and the short voyage not very inspiring for a mariner. “But in winter we can go where we want,” Greef says, turning us 60 degrees to the wind before giving me the wheel.Sailing lessons provide her livelihood in the quieter months, and even as a landlubber I can see the appeal. Get the angles right and the boat just takes off. For a short spell, I feel as if I’m flying the boat over open water, while the low sun drops behind an ancient altar to Tanit above Cap des Llibrell.Back inland, Lucas Prats puts me up at one of the villas on what used to be his grandfather’s property, Can Lluc, looking out to sea from a hillside of orchards and olive groves. Agroturismo is a competitive business these days, drawing visitors away from coastal hotels to converted farmsteads. To Prats, there’s no reason why Ibiza can’t build up its off-peak profile, in the same manner as Mallorca. “We have better weather than they do at this time of year,” he claims.View image in fullscreenOne of the villas at Can Lluc, near San Rafael.“Visitors who come in winter love it – we just need more promotion.”Next morning, I descend on foot through steep cliffside forests with Manuel Ehrensperger ofIbiza Hike Station. A Swiss-born former CEO of luxury fashion brands, he now leads “holistic” hikes in the wildest parts of the island, where pines grow over long-abandoned stone terraces once used for growing and drying figs. “People say I changed my life, but this is luxury too,” he tells me.A true believer in the healing power of nature, and silence, Ehrensperger invites me to spend seven minutes in hushed contemplation above the Cave of Light, where the water glows a deep, cosmic blue. It’s too dangerous to jump here, he says, but I can drop into the sea from the rocks at the other side, and have the whole cove to myself – another pleasure of winter.Well, not quite to myself. While I’m thinking about it, two dolphins breach the surface below. It’s a little chilly up here to be honest, and a bit higher than I’d like. I’m not one for mysticism either, for talk of energies or vibrations. But I feel like those dolphins are telling me to jump. The goddess Tanit wants me to – the spirit of the island herself.

Once upon a time, eating chestnuts in season, from October to December, made sense, because, unlike other nuts, they have a short shelf life. But, thanks to fancy new packaging, we can now enjoy these crumbly, creamy nuts all year round. Being robust and buttery, rich and sweet, they’re an excellent addition to vegan dishes, such as in these lentils. Here, I’ve braised some chestnuts with lentils in wine until deeply delicious, then hard-fried some others until they’re like crumbly sweet breadcrumbs.Lentils with chestnuts, red wine and cavolo neroThese lentils are quite rich, so I like to eat them by themselves, but you might like some good bread, toasted and drizzled with olive oil, alongside. If you’re using dried lentils, rinse them first under cold water, then put in a pan and cover with 300ml cold water. Bring to a boil, simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, then drain and rinse under cold water.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4250g ready-cooked chestnuts7½ tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 large onion, peeled and finely diced2 leeks(220g), greens and whites finely sliced and washed well2 celery stalks(100g), trimmed and finely diced2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced300ml red wineFine sea salt and black pepper250gcooked puy lentils(or 100g dried lentils – see recipe introduction)200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped and cut into 2cm stripsFirst, prepare the chestnuts. Cut half of them into small chunks and finely chop the other half into breadcrumb-sized pieces. Put both in separate small bowls and set to one side.Heat six tablespoons of the oil in a wide saute pan for which you have a lid, then add the onion, leeks and celery, and cook, stirring regularly, for 10 minutes. Add the minced garlic, cook for two minutes until the raw smell disappears, then pour in the wine and a teaspoon and a half of salt, and leave to cook for five minutes, until the liquid evaporates.Stir in the cooked lentils, cavolo nero and chunky-cut chestnuts, pop on the lid, and cook for 12 or so minutes, until the cabbage is tender.In a separate frying pan, heat the remaining tablespoon and a half of oil over the highest heat, then tip in the chestnut crumbs and fry hard, stirring regularly, for two to three minutes. Stir in a couple of big pinches each of salt and ground black pepper.Transfer the lentil mix to a platter, scatter the chestnut crumbs all over the top and serve.Explore more on these topicsBeans, pulses and legumesThe new veganVegan food and drinkVegetablesFoodWinter food and drinkMain courseStewrecipesShareReuse this content"

Shredding the filo and mixing it with the filling gives a cake-like effect and a great rise, and creates the magic of multiple layers without really having to do any work. Yoghurt is a staple in Kurdish and Turkish meals; the acidity cuts through dishes and works so well in soups, which is why one of the most classic soups in our regions isyayla çorbası, simply made with yoghurt and cracked white rice and topped with a mint butter. There are many different regional iterations but this is mine, with chickpeas and spinach, and topped with bulgur köfte in mint butter.Yoghurt soup with sizzling bulgur dumplings (pictured top)You only need two ingredients to make yoghurt at home: milk and a little of your existing yoghurt as your starter, which is why you always start making a new batch of yoghurt before you run out. The process is not exact but honed over time with experience and practice. Bring your milk to a slow, rolling simmer for about 20 minutes, never allowing it to come to a boil. Take off the heat and allow it to cool slightly (so your little finger can withstand the heat for five seconds). At this point, stir in a small amount of yoghurt before covering with many layers of cloth to ensure it cools very slowly overnight. The longer you leave the yoghurt to set before placing it in the fridge, the firmer and more sour your yoghurt will be.I’m excited to share these bulgur dumplings – they are easy to make, forgiving and hardy. They can be boiled and tossed in sauces and eaten like gnocchi, or added to soups and stews. You can also freeze them, ready to boil straight from frozen.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes4-6400g strained yoghurt45g plain flour1 egg2 tbsp flaky sea salt400g tin chickpeas, drained1 garlic clove, peeled and grated1 bunchlong-stem or large-leaf spinach, or Swiss chard, finely chopped, stems and allFor the dumplings150g fine bulgur2 tsp salt1 tsp aleppo chilli, or pul biber50g flour2 tsptomato paste, or salçaA little olive oilFor the mint butter50g butter3 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp dried mintPut the bulgur, salt and chilli in a large bowl, then pour over enough just-boiled water to cover the bulgur by half a centimetre. Give it a good mix, then cover and set aside to soak for 10 minutes. Once the water is fully absorbed, add the flour and tomato paste, and mix thoroughly. Slowly add 100ml water in three batches, kneading the mix with your hands as you go, then knead for at least 15 minutes – the mixture will slowly start turning into a dough. Once the dough starts easily coming away from the bowl and forms a smooth ball, it’s ready.Roll the dough into a 2cm-thick sausage, then cut it into 1cm-wide pieces, and roll between your palms until smooth. Cook the dough balls in a pan of boiling water for seven minutes, or until they float to the surface, then drain and toss in a drizzle of olive oil so they don’t stick to each other. Set aside in a bowl and cover.To make the soup, put the yoghurt, flour, egg and salt in a large pot (preferably one with a heavy base) then whisk until smooth. Slowly add a litre of cold water bit by bit, whisking constantly until it’s all fully incorporated. Set the pot over a medium heat, and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes to a simmer – this will take about 10 minutes, but keep stirring, otherwise the soup mixture might split.Stir in the chickpeas and garlic, then add 250ml just-boiled water and stir again until the mix comes back to a simmer. Keep on a low simmer for 20 minutes, then stir through the chopped spinach or chard. Keep the soup warm on the lowest heat while you make the mint butter.Melt the butter in a frying pan, then add the olive oil and dried mint. Once bubbling, toss the dumplings into the hot fat, give them a good stir to coat, then tip the lot into the soup. Serve immediately.Shredded filo börekView image in fullscreenMelek Erdal’s shredded filo börek.Experiment with the filling by using whatever you have in the fridge – mix up the cheese by adding grated halloumi to the feta, or top with grated cheddar or mozzarella. If you leave out the spring onion, serve with a drizzle of honey on top. This is a forgiving recipe that, much like a frittata, will absorb just about whatever you decide to throw in.Prep10 minCook1 hrRest1 hrServes4-6270g filo pastry1 courgette4 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped100g spinach, cut into 2cm-wide slices200g feta4 eggs200ml milk80ml olive oil1 tbspnigellaseeds1 tbspsesameseeds1 tsppul biberHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Take the filo out of the packet; keep it in a roll (it usually comes in one) and cut into 1cm-wide shreds. Separate the shreds like noodles on to a tray and leave to dry while you make the filling.Grate the courgette, then strain off the excess liquid by squeezing it between your hands . Put the courgette in a bowl, add the spring onions and spinach, crumble in the feta, then mix thoroughly.Beat the eggs in another bowl, then add the milk and oil, and mix thoroughly. Combine the courgette and egg mixtures, then start stirring the filling into the filo a handful at a time, making sure each addition has been absorbed before stirring in the next.Tip the filo mix into a 23cm round nonstick ovenproof dish (you could also use a cake tin or any oven dish really, so long as it’s roughly the same size and the mix is roughly 5cm thick). Sprinkle the sesame and nigella seeds and pul biber over the top, then bake for 30-40 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Remove, then leave to cool and rest for at least an hour before slicing and serving.Melek Erdalis a Kurdish chef and food writerExplore more on these topicsFoodGreek food and drinkSnacksCheeseEggsVegetablesSouprecipesShareReuse this content"

Sadly, it’s closed now, but the memory of that lardy cake lives on.Lardy cakeLardy cake is not for the faint-hearted: it’s rich, indulgent and unapologetically full of fat, making it a great filler after some really hard graft. It’s a hugely nostalgic British pastry that turns the humblest of ingredients into the ultimate, satiating treat. Traditionally made with rendered pork fat, sugar and dried fruit, it’s a great way to use up lard, an ingredient that has fallen out of favour but has long been prized for its flavour and versatility. I see lardy cake as a mix between a currant bun, eccles cake and pain au raisin, but just a whole lot more rustic.Lard was once a staple in British baking, used for its crisping qualities in everything from pastry to yorkshire puddings. If you roast a joint of pork, don’t let the rendered fat go to waste. Instead, pour it into a jar, then carefully pass it through a fine sieve, to remove any bits and pieces. Seal and store in the fridge until needed.This method for making lardy cake follows a similar technique to laminated doughs such as puff pastry by layering lard, sugar and fruit into a yeasted dough. The result is sticky, golden and deeply caramelised, and best enjoyed in thick slices with a strong cup of tea.250g strong white flour, or wholemeal bread flour, plus extra for dusting1 tsp fast-action dried yeast125g lard, plus extra for greasing100g soft light brown sugar150g mixed dried fruit(currants, sultanas, candied peel)1 tsp mixed spice(optional)In a large bowl, combine flour and yeast. Melt 25g of lard, then mix it into the flour with 150g water to make a dough. Knead for 10 minutes, until smooth, then cover and set aside to rise for an hour.Meanwhile, get ready the filling ingredients – that is, the remaining lard, the sugar and dried fruit, plus the mixed spice, if using. The lard should be soft but not warm. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Dab half the lard over two-thirds of the dough, smear it on to the dough, then sprinkle with half of the sugar, dried fruit and mixed spice, if using. Fold the clean third of dough over half of the filled section, then fold the remaining filled section up and over the top. Chill for 15 minutes, then roll out into a large rectangle again and repeat with the remaining fillings.Grease a 20cm tin or enamel dish with lard, put the dough inside, cover and leave to prove in a warm place for about two hours, or until almost doubled in size.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Set the tin directly over a medium heat on the hob and leave to cook for five minutes, until the base starts to bubble and brown. Transfer to the hot oven and bake for 40 minutes, until golden brown and caramelised. Leave to cool in the tin before serving.Explore more on these topicsCakeWaste notFoodFood wasteBritish food and drinkBakingPastryFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hot cross bun, a spiced bun traditionally served with butter and a cup of tea, around the time of Good Friday, is modernising.This year, a quick whip round the supermarkets will find you an embarrassment of alternative hot cross buns, flavoured with lemon curd, salted caramel or tiramisu. There are buns spiked with rhubarb and custard or Red Leicester. Head to Asda for a tiramisu version, Co-op for one cross-germinated with apple crumble.Away from the aisle, things become even more experimental. There are hot cross bun doughnuts at doughnut specialist Cross Town. Fancy bakery Pophams has a croissant/hot cross bun hybrid. The Laundry in Brixton developed its ownfejoa, ginger, stuffed honeycomb butter and crispy baconone last year – “What’s not to love about something that’s kind of salty, crispy, merging with the sweetness?” saidexecutive chef Sami Harvey. And it will be back on the menu soon. On TikTok, things are even more creative: thechef Nathaniel Smith, for example, conjures up a minted, smoked jerk lamb iteration with wild garlic ajo verde.According to Meg Palmer, a cultural analyst at consumer insights company Verve: “For the past few years, there’s definitely been an emergence of the ‘basic’ elevations of the usual hot cross buns”. But things have “really ramped up” this year.M&S arguably started this hybridisation, with apple in 2009. According to Sandy Tchilinguirian, M&S food’s hot cross buns product developer: “M&S has led the market on hot cross innovation and, due to customer demand, the range increases each year.” They are, for instance, introducing buns riffing on millionaire’s shortbread.But hot cross buns are supposed to be old faithfuls – flavoured simply with citrus zest, cardamom, nutmeg and the like – aren’t they? In terms of all the new flavours, food historian and author of Leftovers: A History ofFoodWaste and Preservation, Dr Eleanor Barnett, thinks: “Why not! While Hot cross buns as we would recognise them date back to the 18th century … recipes are always evolving and this just adds to the fascinating long history of hot cross buns.”Plus, adding cheddar isn’t the strangest thing that has happened to them: “Miraculous powers have long been attributed to them,” said Barnett. “They were hung from ceilings for a whole year under the folk belief that they could not go mouldy; others thought that they could heal stomach upsets.”Harvey thinks its yearly short lifespan gives permission for the hot cross bun 2.0 to be extra-indulgent – and food culture in the past few years has been hot on that. According to Palmer: “The dial for what we consider a treat has had to shift massively”. She links it to the trend for viral baked goods,for instance with croissant hybrids, such as the cronut, the cruffin and the crookie, drawing snaking queues outside bakeries savvy enough to offer them.While a hot cross bun loaded with chocolate orange has newness, so important in today’s food culture, the bun itself is a known quantity. Hybridising it is, according to Jacqui Parr, the editor of The Grocer online magazine, “a safer bet for bringing out a new range or developing new products than if you’re doing something completely new.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Snacks £6.50-£11; small plates £15.50-£27, large plates £20-£36, desserts £11-£16, wines from £32A midweek night and the restaurant is completely empty. Music thrums and staff drift about looking purposeful, despite being a little short on purpose until we show up. This has nothing to do with Nord and everything to do with football. At the exact time of our booking, Everton are kicking off against Liverpool, two miles away at Goodison Park, for what has been described to me as not just a game, butthegame. As well as being a local derby, it’s also the last ever match to be played between the two at the stadium before Everton move to their new home atBramley-Moore Dock. Even a blithering football ignoramus like me can recognise the significance of such a game to a city like Liverpool and why that might suppress bookings.View image in fullscreen‘Magnificently engineered’: quail scotch egg.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverOn the upside, the emptiness provides a serious opportunity to perv over the design of the restaurant, tucked into the ground floor of one of Liverpool’s most famous buildings. Now called the Plaza, it’s a vast 60s block twice as long as it is high, which was once the headquarters of clothing catalogue company Littlewoods. The foyer has been given a sleek polished marble makeover to play up its 60s origins, with a few appropriate swirls of colour. The bar and dining room behind takes all that a little further. There are olive-green banquettes and bucket chairs, huge upside-down bowl-shaped ceiling lamps, peach-coloured fascias and, along one side, booths tucked into smooth, curving caves. It’s partAustin Powersshag palace, partMos Eisley CantinafromStar Wars. It really is groovy, baby.ForGSG Hospitality, owners of various businesses across the northwest, the design has adaptability. It could become almost anything they want it to be. For now, however, it very much suits the cooking of Liverpool-born Daniel Heffy, who returned here in 2022 after years in Stockholm, including a lengthy stint at the three Michelin-starred Frantzen. At Nord, he insists he looks northwards for inspiration, hence the name, but if so, he does that without being annoyingly doctrinaire or earnest. Or especially northern. The imperative to feed clearly trumps geography every time.View image in fullscreen‘Extra beefy’: steak tartare.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverAmong the snacks, many a raucous celebration of the deep-fat fryer, there are shredded-duck croquettes with a lip-smackingly sour plum sauce. It’s a butch riff on crispy duck with pancakes. There’s a bowl of deep-fried olives flavoured with rosemary and lemon, which rustle against each other when you shake the bowl. A magnificently engineered quail Scotch egg, the meaty casing flecked with green herbs, comes with a smooth, sweet aïoli of roasted garlic. You could get kicked out of the New Nordic clubhouse for daring to allow racy, sunkissed things like olives, lemons and that wantonly promiscuous bulb garlic into your kitchen. And yet here they are, amid culinary ideas from higher latitudes; the sort that have watched the gloomy films of Ingmar Bergman and have opinions on them.View image in fullscreen‘Stutters a little’: chawamushi with king crab and smoked eel.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverThe result is a restaurant that manages to be ambitious without being overbearing. Ambition, of course, is risky because it may not always be realised. That’s the case here. But I’d much prefer Heffy’s slight misses than the unambitious hits of safer cooks. Because when he gets it right, my heart simply beats faster. His steak tartare is made extra beefy with the addition of what he calls a “tallow emulsion”, as against an olive oil-based dressing from southern climes. Give him extra points for employing the word tallow, associated with the harsh soaps used to clean up filthy Dickensian urchins, rather than for dinner. The beef-fat dressing does boost the flavour. But it’s the inclusion of squeaky macadamia nuts from that bit of the north called Australia which are the gamechanger, adding texture. The tartare is topped with a generous fall of microplaned parmesan, and on top of that are rounds of pickled vegetables. We are back in the north, and here, pickling rules. Against that a warmchawamushior set savoury custard, topped with king crab and smoked eel, stutters a little. It works texturally, but it’s a tricky dish to get right, as this one proves. It is simply oversalted.View image in fullscreen‘Guaranteed to make a lachrymose Finn weep gently with joy’: monkfish with roe and chive sauce.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverToday, the larger plates include a slab of seared monkfish on a glossy fish roe and chive cream sauce of a sort guaranteed to make a lachrymose Finn weep gently with joy. But it’s completely overshadowed by a plate of chicken, both roasted and deep fried, with quenelles of mushroom duxelles on a fermented mushroom sauce tasting intensely of itself. The monkfish is pretty. The mushroom and chicken dish just elbows its way to the front of the crowd, waving and hollering. It’s dinner with a capital D. Alongside that, for carbs, there are new potatoes, crisply roasted and squished until bursting from their skins, then drenched in garlic butter. There are also roasted baby carrots, which would have been terrific by themselves. But they come with bouquets of greens which, in a Nordic manner, have been seasoned with vinegar, just a little too stridently. The carrots are sweet. The greens demand we pucker up. That’s fine. Let’s just eat the carrots.View image in fullscreen‘It’s dinner with a capital D’: chicken and mushroom duxelles.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverAt the bottom of the dessert menu, after the blood-orange tart with chocolate ice-cream and the almond, cardamom and vanilla millefeuille, there’s a sour cherry and pistachio baked Alaska. If your eye does not drift downwards lasciviously to that listing, then you are completely dead inside. It arrives pert and proud: a spectacular ridged whorl of torched Italian meringue, enclosing a heart not just of the advertised cherry and pistachio, but also of frangipane. We attack it from each side, my companion and I, until the plate is emptied and we are required to lay down our spoons, sadly. It is enthusiastically priced at £16. We don’t begrudge a penny.View image in fullscreen‘We don’t begrudge a penny’: sour cherry and pistachio baked Alaska.Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/The ObserverBy now a clutch of other tables are occupied and there is the gentle hum of a restaurant engaging fully with its purpose. The service is relaxed without being annoyingly chummy although there is the sense that, given the encouragement to do so, Nord could become a little more serious and a little more formal. For £110 they will create a tasting menu, wine flight extra, which would make it a different type of restaurant but, I suspect, still a very good one. Over at Goodison Park the last ever local derby there has ended in a draw. Here at Nord, even allowing for the occasional missed shot on goal, it’s very much a win. And that’s the best stab at a football metaphor I have for you.News bitesThe company behind Covent Garden restaurants The Petersham and La Goccia has announced their closure, citing the combined impacts of Brexit, Covid and last year’s budget. In particular a spokesperson for the company said Brexit had resulted in an “inability to recruit people with the right experience and skills”. The original Petersham Nurseries restaurant in Richmond is unaffected, as is the garden centre of which it is a part.Sandwich chain Subway has announced it is diversifying into jacket potatoes, with a range under the Spudway sub-brand being trialled across 170 of its UK stores. The baked potatoes will be fully customisable through a range of toppings, including tuna mayo, chicken tikka and taco beef. The baked potato market has seen a number of ups and downs over the years. Spudulike, originally founded in Edinburgh in the 1970s, eventually became a 40-strong chain, but the last one closed in 2019. Potato merchant Albert Bartlett then went into partnership with chef James Martin to revive Spudulike, but that also failed (subway.com).Chef Richard Turner, associated with meaty restaurant groups including Hawksmoor, Pitt Cue and Blacklock has stayed on brand with his latest appointment. He has become chef director of venerable American BBQ chain Bodean’s, and will be relaunching the menu for the group on 20 March, with the introduction of pork and beef rib platters, Texas toast and what he’s calling his “bone suckin’ sauce”. The original branch in London’s Soho is also being refurbished (bodeansbbq.com).Email Jay atjay.rayner@observer.co.ukor follow him on Instagram@jayrayner1Explore more on these topicsFoodJay Rayner on restaurantsRestaurants (Food)Restaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is true that pesto is an incredibly useful jar to have in the cupboard. It is also true that pesto is a hard thing to preserve in a jar in a way that tastes nice. This is especially true if you are working to keep costs down – as consumers, we can all do ballpark sums for the cost of herbs, nuts, cheese and olive oil. I think one of the problems lies with the herbs’ tendency to get a bit muggy during processing, though some makers are doing quite a good job.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Just to be clear about nomenclature: pesto, from the Latinpestare, meaning to pound, is a generic word for a whole group of similar mixtures, the general guidelines being to mix any herb with any nut and with any cheese, then pour oil over the top. All the pestos I tasted fall into this general category, and they are called green pesto, Italian pesto or basil pesto.Pesto alla Genovese, on the other hand, is a specific mixture of basil, pine nuts, garlic, parmesan, pecorino and olive oil.The best blenders to blitz like a pro, tried and tested, from Ninja to NutribulletRead moreI am a fan of pesto both generic and specific, and make it all the time; I also like to have a jar in the cupboard. So I found this comparative tasting fascinating, not least for the ingredients lists. I tasted the pestos straight from the jar and stirred through hot pasta, because heat and a splash of the pasta cooking water play a major role: they melt the cheese, awaken the aromas (good and not so good) and change the pesto’s consistency. And remember, jarred pesto can also be spruced up with fresh herbs, more olive oil and, the saviour of so many things, an extra shower of cheese.The best supermarket pestoBestall-rounderM&S green basil pestoView image in fullscreen£2.20 for 190g at Ocado★★★★☆Has both pine nuts and cashews, and the sweet smell of cheese gives way to grass and herbs, which is a good start. I was only let down slightly by its sweetness. Good mixed with pasta, too; the heat brings out the herbs, but also more of that sweetness, sadly. That said, it stays well-balanced and free of the muggy and metallic taste that haunts many jarred pestos. I like this.BestsplurgeFilippo Berio classic pestoView image in fullscreen£2.80 for 190g at Tesco★★★★☆I am always happy to see olive oil in the ingredients list, as well as a mix of grana padano and pecorino. This has a nice aspect and an appealing colour. It’s quite salty, but the basil is also very present and nicely spicy, and I like the rustic consistency. It improves when mixed with pasta, with the heat waking up the basil almost aggressively; you can also really taste the cheese. Very decent.BestbargainLidl Baresa green pestoView image in fullscreen99p for 190g at Lidl★★★★☆The first impression is oily, but the pea-green colour, herbal smell, consistency and rounded flavour make for a well-balanced pesto. It’s even better with pasta – the balance maintained as the heat warmed the oil, including a lemon note that I quite liked.And the rest …Tesco green pestoView image in fullscreen99p for 190g at Tesco★★★☆☆When tasting this pesto with a spoon, the first flavour I get is peas, which is explained in the ingredients list: pea fibre! It actually turns out to be quite nice – vegetal and grassy – plus there’s a good balance of ingredients, especially the cheeses (pecorino and parmesan). Once mixed with pasta, the flavours stay balanced, but they’re a bit subdued: the basil emerges, but the cheese struggles to keep up – I added more.Sacla classic basil pestoView image in fullscreen£3.35 for 190g at Sacla£3.35 for 190g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Leads with cheese – pecorino and parmesan – and so much so that it smells a bit honky. Beyond that is the scent of olive oil and a faint herbal note. Cheese dominates the flavour, too, and overwhelms everything else. I did not add more when I had this on pasta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I like cashews in pesto and also appreciated the slightly spicy note. Same observations apply when added to pasta.Waitrose basil pestoView image in fullscreen£1.90 for 190g at Waitrose★★☆☆☆Just a few ingredients, a pleasing, vivid green and, with no added sugar, a startling contrast to the sweet pestos I tasted. No sign of basil, or indeed anything green or herbal, and a gritty, sandy texture. Things improve when this is mixed with pasta and heat: the herbs arrive and, although it comes out a bit milky, the flavour stays rounded. Good for kids, maybe, and would be helped along by cheese.Sainsbury’s green pestoView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 190g at Sainsbury’s★☆☆☆☆Dull green and not too pleasing a smell. The taste is overwhelmed by a pappy consistency – explained, maybe, by the use of potato flakes (don’t get me wrong: potato can be great in pesto). At first, I thought the flavour was absent – neither sweet nor savoury – but then it arrived in a metallic aftertaste. Not improved by pasta or heat, but helped by loads of grated cheese.Co-op green pestoView image in fullscreen£1.40 for 190g at Co-op★☆☆☆☆Despite the fat in the cashews, vegetable oil and cheese, this is a strangely fatless pesto; it’s a bit weedy, and that goes for its colour, too. But I am an optimist, so hoped that heat and pasta might help. They did not, and may have made things even worse. Maybe I should have spruced it all up with a bit of butter,extra-virgin olive oilor loads of cheese.Rodolfi pesto alla GenoveseView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 190g at Iceland★☆☆☆☆An oily aspect, but it at least smelled of basil, which made me hopeful. I was disappointed, however, by the sweet, slightly pappy flavour and oily aftertaste. I hoped the basil scent would come out with heat, and that cheese would wake it up, but no such luck. Mixed well with the pasta, though, and I helped it out by adding grated cheese and black pepper.Cook up a storm with our guide tothe best blendersExplore more on these topicsSauces and graviesThe FilterFoodPastaItalian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
