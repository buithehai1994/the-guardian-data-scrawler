The hem of my stretchy top has got rolled up round my ribs before my head has popped out of the neck hole, and with my hands still stuck in the sleeves, I cannot reach round to pull it down. I wriggle helplessly for a minute, but the situation doesn’t improve; the band of rolled-up fabric is taut across my chest, immovable. That’s when I feel the first tingle of rising alarm – so familiar from early childhood – that comes of being trapped in your clothes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am trying, for the first time, to put on an item of shapewear for men – an ordinary-looking, highly elasticated long-sleeved workout top that will, I hope, give me the instant slim profile of someone who goes to the gym regularly, instead of not since the pandemic started.Eventually, after a few breathtaking contortions, I find myself dressed and, shall we say, gathered. On forums where men discuss ways to reduce your silhouette through the application of shapewear, people often suggest buying this sort of top, only one size too small. If I had done that I’d still be lying on the bedroom floor with it stuck halfway over my head.Technically, the top I’m wearing doesn’t even qualify as shapewear – it’s popularly known as “compression wear”, an elasticated sub-genre of athletic clothing that is meant to enhance performance by improving blood flow to your muscles, or something. There is very little evidence for this –a recent studyshowed no significant performance improvement in runners wearing compression garments – but they can also be very slimming, which may well be the actual source of their popularity. It’s certainly not because they’re comfortable.View image in fullscreen‘I spend the rest of the day slightly short of breath.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianMale shapewear has been the next big thing for a long time. Back in 2010, Marks & Spencer started selling Bodymax pants with a stretchy frontal area that was said to offer subtle enhancement, like a codpiece. In the same year the shapewear giantSpanxlaunched Spanx for Men.Spanx relaunched its men’s shapewear line in 2021, and again in 2024, but today their website offers no male shapewear at all. Meanwhile, M&S has just launcheda new line of enhancing men’s pantswith a trademarked feature called Secret Support. This turns out to be a front pouch akin to a little bra cup, and it’s secret enough that I wore the pants for a whole day without realising it was there. The marketing for men’s shapewear is sometimes characterised by a suffocating coyness.View image in fullscreenSecret Support pants from M&S.Photograph: M&SIn 2023, Kim Kardashian’s brandSkims– the biggest name in shapewear – launched a men’s line of its own, but it contained nothing you could really describe as shapewear. In fact, it was mostly the opposite: slouchy trousers, loose T-shirts and hoodies. Back then, Kardashian told GQ that Skims shapewear for men was on the way, “but we’re not launching with that”. Almost three years later, it still hasn’t arrived. It’s tempting to draw the conclusion that while it’s easy to generate publicity around men’s shapewear, it’s rather harder to sell it to men.“I don’t think shapewear for men really exists yet,” says Zak Maoui, UK Esquire magazine’s style director, although he’s not including compression wear like my top in his definition.“When I think of shapewear I think of specific clothing that is designed to bring elements of the body in,” he says. But when it comes to making it for men, he’s also not sure what everybody’s waiting for. “I think anything that helps people feel better about themselves is good.”By 4pm, I can’t stand it any more. This is perhaps the best thing I can say about shapewear: it feels good to take it offThere are, for the moment, plenty of smaller players out there. According to the commerce intelligence publisher ShelfTrend, several niche brands – includingEsteem Apparel,TAILONGandQORE Logiq– have built seven-figure businesses selling their wares through Amazon, as online searches for “male shapewear” increased 40% from 2024 to 2025.The idea of male shapewear as a market still waiting its turn for takeoff is based largely on its enormous potential for growth. Shapewear itself is huge – a $3bn (£2.2bn) annual market that isprojected to reach $4.3bn by 2030– Skims alone expects to top $1bn in sales this year, and the company isnow valued at $5bn. But male shapewear accounted forless than 7% of the overall marketin 2024.For one UK online retailer, however, that percentage is now more like 30%. “We’ve gone from say, four years ago, when we may have had two products in a couple of colours, to where we’ve now got six or eight,” says Shane Rogers, head of creative atThe London Corset Company. “We’re thinking about manufacturing our own, because we can’t get the quantities we want, or get what we want in the styles we want.” The London Corset Company imports male shapewear products from all over the world, including from South America, a centre of innovation for modern shapewear (the Colombian shapewear brand Leonisa has its own men’s collection, called Leo).To be fair, it does seem that a lot of men’s shapewear is still masquerading – or at least performing double service – as compression wear. Projections that include both shapewear and compression wear estimatethe market will reach $8bn by 2030, so the distinction may soon become meaningless. As Rogers says: “Anything that squeezes you is compression, basically.”Whatever the name, we’re talking about the same technology: the extreme and persistent stretchiness found in female shapewear and male compression wear results from the strategic application of elastane, the polyether-polyurea copolymer invented by DuPont in 1958 and better known as either Lycra – a brand name – or spandex, which sounds like a brand name but isn’t. If there’s a true difference between compression wear and shapewear it probably lies in amounts: my panic-inducing compression top is 16% elastane. A Skims core sculpt waist cincher for women is 39%.If you search for it online you will soon find plenty of male shapewear that goes beyond snug-fitting gym clothes – there are high-waisted girdles and thigh-reducing leggings. There are pants with discreet padding in the rear, and compression tops designed to correct your posture as well as your belly. There are shirts with big biceps already sewn in to them, and all-in-one girdles that look like shortie wetsuits.View image in fullscreenA men’s top from Spanx in 2010 designed to ‘firm and flatten’.Photograph: Lindsey Dowell/PAOn the second morning of my shapewear journey I try on a very tight tank top with an additional panel that pulls across your belly and is fastened with a row of hooks and eyes. Again, the day begins with a struggle – it takes a long time and a fair bit of strength to do up all 10 hooks. Once I’m in, I feel not so much sculpted as encased, like sausage meat in a skin. I spend the rest of the day slightly short of breath. By 4pm, I can’t stand it any more. This is perhaps the best thing I can say about shapewear: it feels good to take it off.Shapewear for men is nothing new – the US brand Underworks has been selling it for almost three decades – in fact, the idea has been with us from long before the advent of elastane.“People have been wearing corrective devices for centuries,” says Dr Alun Withey, the author ofTechnology, Self-Fashioning and Politeness in Eighteenth-Century Britain: Refined Bodies. “But I would argue that the 18th century is the first time it’s not just about, for want of a better term, curing deformity. It’s about trying to force your body into a shape that is socially desirable.”The ideal form was a “natural” one, although this had little to do with the muscular figure of those living close to the land.“The body of the polite gentleman is slighter – it’s about showing that you don’t work,” says Withey. “You are delicate, but that’s not to say skinny and weak. The ideal posture would be that of a dancer or a fencer.” Things are not so different today – shapewear isn’t trying to fix you, but make your body conform to a shifting stereotype.In the 18th century, the big technological innovation in male foundational garments was steel. “One group of products are steel backs,” says Withey. “You’d strap it to yourself before you put your shirt on, and because it’s got a steel plate, it forces you to stand straight.” Other devices included a hidden steel collar to keep your chin from dropping. “So above and beyond corrective, that’s forcing you into a socially pleasing form.”With practice, climbing in and out of my compression top gets a bit easier, but I don’t think I could bring myself to wear it out on its own – certainly not to the gym – and I don’t think it’s doing me any favours hidden under my regular clothes. In any case, I’m not sure I’d ever get used to going about my daily business while shrink-wrapped.But while compression wear is basically a jogging top with side benefits, actual shapewear has any number of specific applications: some of it is post-surgical; some men who’ve lost a lot of weight use it to keep excess skin supported during exercise; others use it to minimise gynaecomastia (man boobs). Increasingly, however, it is for men who just want to look slimmer, if only for a night.View image in fullscreenMarks & Spencer’s ‘front enhancement’ boxers were part of its Bodymax range.Photograph: Marks and Spencer/PA“I can’t make a 20 stone guy look 10 stone or anything,” says Rogers. “But if you go to a wedding and you want your suit to look good – as long as your suit fitted you originally – they are effective.”It remains a bit of a mystery why the bigger players, including Skims, haven’t jumped into the market with both feet. “What do they know about the shapewear for men industry that we don’t, that’s stopping them?” says Maoui.There could also be a simple explanation why the explosion in men’s shapewear, so often heralded, never quite seems to arrive.“Nobody wants to admit to wearing it, really, do they?” says Withey. “If the purpose is to hide your protruding belly, you don’t want to tell people you’re doing it.”Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionMenHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of Berlin’s most renowned clubs have long insisted that the camera lenses on their clientele’s phones must be covered up using this simple method, to ensure that everyone is present in the moment and people can let go without fear of their image suddenly appearing on some online platform. As one DJputs it, “Do you really want to be in someone’s picture in your jockstrap?”Venues in London, Manchester and New York now enforce the same rules. Last week brought news ofthe return of Sankeys, the famous Mancunian club that closed nearly a decade ago, and is reopening in a 500-capacity space in the heart of the city. The aim, it seems, is to fly in the face of the massed closures of such venues, and revive the idea that our metropolises should host the kind of nights that stretch into the following morning. But there is another basic principle at work: phones will reportedly either be stickered or forbidden. “People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,”said one of the club’s original founders.He is right, but it seems that the zeitgeist might be aligning in that direction anyway. If 2025 has had any kind of defining cultural theme, it perhaps boils down to people’s increasing sense that a life completely beholden to screens is no life at all. To this, add two connected trends: a drop in millions of people’s use of social media, and a rising yearning for experiences that are more authentic. This is not, just to be clear, any kind of suggestion that we are about to reject digital technology and wind the clock back 30 years. But something is definitely up, and it is worth tentatively celebrating.If your interest in posting what you had for lunch seems to be waning and you now look back at a habit of doing so with mild horror, you are not alone. According toanalysiscommissioned earlier this year by the Financial Times, time spent on social media worldwide peaked back in 2022, and fell by almost 10% by the end of 2024. There are notable exceptions to this trend, not least in North America, where growth in use has slowed rather than going into reverse. But that does not quite detract from what the figures tell us. The decline they highlight is most pronounced among people in their teens and 20s. Other data suggests that since 2014, the shares of people who use such platforms to “stay in touch with friends, express themselves or meet new people” have declined by more than a quarter.Some of this, it seems, is driven by the new domination of platforms by high-profile influencers and AI-created “slop”. The bitter, polarised atmosphere of so many online spaces is also relevant. Over the summer, the New Yorker writer Kyle Chayka held out the prospect of what he calledPosting Zero: “a point at which normal people – the unprofessionalized, uncommodified, unrefined masses – stop sharing things on social media as they tire of the noise, the friction, and the exposure.” This, perhaps, is the overlooked context for Australia’sban on social mediafor people under 16: rather than being some authoritarian bolt from the blue, it looks like it may have arrived at a point when people were already changing their habits – and so, rather like modern smoking bans, it may simply end up accelerating a trend that was quietly kicking in anyway.Or look at internet dating, the ultimate example of an attempt to replace the magical and often random nature of human interactions with cold digital logic. Thanks to Ofcom, we know that between 2023 and 2024, Tinderlost 594,000 UK users, while Hinge dropped by 131,000, and Bumble by 368,000. The value of shares in Match Group, the company that owns Tinder and Hinge, has dropped by nearly 80% since the highs they reached during the pandemic. Over the same period, Bumble stock is reckoned to have dropped by 92%. In a letter to its shareholders, Match acknowledged that younger people were seeking “a lower-pressure, more authentic way to find connections”.For some people, that might eventually involve going to a club, putting the obligatory sticker on their phone and seeing what happens. That leads in turn to a somewhat dreamy, utopian suggestion: might some of the people whose chronic internet use has left them isolated and introverted – and sometimes angry and paranoid – sooner or later dance and socialise themselves into something better? That’s pretty much what happened at the end of the 1980s, when the combination of ecstasy and dance music quickly known asacid housebegan to change the cold, atomised country created by Thatcherism with profound consequences. So you never know.As that last observation shows, I am in my 50s, so my nocturnal experiences now tend to involve watching musicians rather than gyrating until 4am. Three years ago, I had the wondrous experience of seeing Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan play live, within months of each other, in very different venues – respectively, a 600-capacity venue in my Somerset home town where McCartney played awarmup gigbefore his headline appearance at Glastonbury, and at a huge indoor arena in Oslo that hosted the first date of Dylan’s latest European tour. At both shows, the audience’s phones were placed in sealed pouches and returned once the show was over. What that resulted in was amazing: the first was full of a shared euphoria that brought tears to my eyes, and the second was gripped by such an awed silence that it felt almost otherworldly.At most other gigs, by contrast, phones and the behaviour they encourage can be a menace. Three weeks ago, I went with my 16-year-old daughter to the Beacon Hall in Bristol to see the Isle of Wight-based sensation Wet Leg, who were brilliant. When they play live, their big hit Chaise Longue is an invitation to everyone present to go nuts. But one woman next to us spent its entire three minutes acrobatically shooting phone footage from every conceivable angle, which entailed repeatedly reaching over those around her, while remaining completely oblivious to how much she was spoiling people’s fun.When people do such things, I sometimes wonder: do they go home and look at what they filmed, and post it somewhere? Or does it just sit on their phones, pointless and unwatched? And will they therefore arrive at the conclusion that seems to be hitting more and more people: that it’s good to stop, to go offline more often, and rediscover the joys of being in the moment with other human beings? A lot more hangs on that question than we might think.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

He talks magic, trampoline mayhem and finally getting behind the wheel of a carEmine SanerSun 14 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareIt’s time for a father to have an awkward conversation with his teenage son. No, not that one. This is far worse – Chris is 16 and still believes in Father Christmas. He needs to know the truth: all the presents, the fake snow on the roof, the soot in the grate, it was all his dad. “You’re Father Christmas?” says Chris, astonished. “You bring joy and happiness to billions of children all over the world?”In Finding Father Christmas, Channel 4’s funny and moving comedy, Chris, played byLenny Rush, bunks off school and sets out on a mission with his older cousin Holly (Ele McKenzie) to prove to his sceptic dad that Santa is real. Poring over a photograph taken at a celebrity party, Chris thinks he has identified four people who may have secret links to Santa – Stephen Fry, mathematician Prof Hannah Fry, the space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and SAS: Who Dares Wins star Jason Fox. Finally, he follows clues to a secret secure facility in Milton Keynes and breaks in with the help of a mini trampoline and the magic of television (a bungee cord). “It was terrifying, but so much fun,” says Rush of the stunt. “I feel like if I was offered [to do it] and I said no, I’d kick myself on the way home. I wanted to give it a go and I’m happy I did. But there was an element of fear.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m surrounded by some of the UK’s best comedians – I don’t feel like I have the weight on my shoulders’ … Lenny Rush.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianFar harder to get to grips with were the explanations from the scientists. Explaining how Father Christmas and his presents can pass through solid walls (when there’s no chimney) Fry says “it’s macroscopic quantum tunnelling”. Aderin-Pocock says something about the Alcubierre drive, and the concertina of space and time, to explain how he can do it all in one night. Did Rush understand what they were on about? “Honestly, no clue,” he says, laughing. “But the way they explained things, it was like a story, just mesmerising!”Rush – irrepressibly cheerful, polite and blessed with impeccable comic timing – is speaking over Zoom from a hotel room, where he’s staying while filming the forthcoming BBC comedy The Reluctant Vampire, based on the Eric Morecambe books. Does it feel a pressure, leading a show? “I think because I’m surrounded by some of the UK’s best comedians, I don’t feel like I have the weight on my shoulders. And it’s always a laugh on set.” His first experience of playing the lead role was on Finding Father Christmas, which, being a relatively short shoot, proved a good introduction to being number one on the call sheet. “It was like a taster. I feel like I’m not as tired as I would have been, because of the Christmas film.”Christmas films have always been a big part of his life, and this is “a proper feelgood” one. Not like his brilliant but harrowing roles as Tiny Tim Cratchit in two productions of A Christmas Carol – at the Old Vic in London and in the 2019 BBC adaptation from Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight. In the Channel 4 show, once he found out his dad would be played by James Buckley, one of the Inbetweeners, he was “raring to go”. The Inbetweeners being, of course, essential watching for any teenager. “I’ve been lucky to work with some amazing people, but as soon as I said to my friends ‘James Buckley’, they were: ‘Oh my God.’”When he read the script, was he devastated to read his fictional father admitting the “truth” about Father Christmas? Was it a spoiler to 16-year-old Rush? A perfect comic pause. “It wasn’t.” But he is worried about his young cousin watching it. “I’m not sure if he still believes or not. But to be fair, even if he does watch it, if anything, it proves that Father Christmas is real.”Rush found out the “truth” when he was “nine or 10”, he thinks. He, his dad and younger brother were watching a film downstairs, when he wandered off in search of his mum. “I’ve gone upstairs, and Mum’s on the bed with wrapping paper everywhere, and all these presents.” Rush already had an inkling, “but the devastating part of it was that it was sealed, and I knew. I saw it with my own eyes.” He does a great impression of his mum, who is off camera in the hotel with him – I can hear her laughing. “She goes: ‘Steve, I told you to not let them come up!’ I was a good brother – I didn’t spoil it for Bobby.” He understands Chris’s need to cling on to that belief in magic. “I think the big heart around the show is that in recent years, his mum has passed away, and she just loved Christmas.”View image in fullscreen‘I was raring to go’ … Rush as Chris in Finding Father Christmas.Photograph: Big Talk StudiosWhen I spoke to Rush two years ago, he wasn’t so much a rising star as a dazzling one – that year, he won a TV Bafta for best male comedy performance in the BBC’sAm I Being Unreasonable?and two Royal Television Society awards. Now, he has left school – he passed all his exams, he says, “luckily” – and is a full-time actor. “It’s nice to just be able to focus on what I love. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still shattered.” He laughs. “But I’m having so much fun.”As well as The Reluctant Vampire, Rush has parts in the Apple TV seriesSlow Horses, and in the forthcoming Channel 4 Barbara Taylor Bradford adaptation, A Woman of Substance. “It’s good to be able to show people that I can do different things,” says Rush, who is mainly known for comedy, including performing in sketches and presenting Children in Need. “I love comedy, but I don’t necessarily want to be a comedian or even a comedy actor. I just want to be an actor.” Although Slow Horses is a dark comedy, he points out, “A Woman of Substance was just …” He makes a mock troubled face. “You’d come off set and want to put Finding Nemo on.”In it, Rush plays the younger brother of the younger version of the main character, Emma Harte. His disability – Rush has spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a form of dwarfism – is not part of the plot, which he’s grateful for. “I guess you could say they draw from it a bit, in the sense that it’s about a poor, working-class family [and] it does help to show that struggle, but even then it’s never mentioned. It’s not Frank Harte with a disability or with dwarfism. It’s just Frank Harte.”View image in fullscreen‘I love comedy’ … Rush.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn dramas, especially, he says, “when there is a role for a person with disability, usually it’ll be focused round that. I think it’s changing, definitely, but I don’t really think there’s enough. I don’t mind at all doing a [disabled] role where it helps raise awareness, they’re amazing, but it’s great to have other opportunities. That’s something I’ve been lucky with.” Almost none of his roles were written specifically for a disabled actor; Rush was just the best for the job. But what he brings to TV means a lot, both to him and those who contact him, glad to see themselves represented. “I get loads of people reach out to me. It’s always so lovely and any help I can give, I love to.”Every year seems to get bigger and better for Rush, and 2026 looks to continue the trajectory. If Slow Horses brings the prestige, The Reluctant Vampire, written by Rob and Neil Gibbons (the writing duo behind recent Alan Partridge shows) showcases Rush as a lead actor, among a starry cast, including Asim Chaudhry and Bill Bailey. He will also be learning to drive. “So watch out everyone in Essex,” he says with a laugh. “It will definitely help with independence. A lot of the time, having a disability, you’re told by other people: ‘You can’t do this, can’t do that,’ and I think it’s further proving that I can do. I’m very excited.”It’s nice to just be able to focus on what I love. Don’t get me wrong – I’m still shattered!At home, Rush’s friends are still suitably unimpressed with his stellar career, “not in a bad way. They’re supportive of me, but I’ll go: ‘Guess what I’m doing next?’ I’ll tell them, and they go: ‘Oh, right.’” He likes to get home at weekends during filming. “It’s just nice to have that normality and seeing the dogs.” He smiles. “That sounds bad. I’ve put the dogs before my dad and my brother.” Another perfect pause. “Yeah, seeing the dogs.”It’s time for Rush to get to work – they’re filming outside today, and he won’t be done until 10pm. He’s working right up until the break, so the Rush family Christmas will be quieter this year. “We’re going to have more of a chilled one, just us four.” The tradition that will be observed is the family sitting down to watch a festive film together on Christmas Eve. This year, it will be the one with Rush in it. It must be nice to think of other people, excitement mounting for the big day, tuning in at the same time in cosy, fairy-lighted living rooms across the country. “It’s really lovely,” agrees Rush, all merry and bright.Finding Father Christmas is on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 7.30pm."

A gen-Z trainee takes on the Guardian’s ‘scribbler-in-chief’As the exam regulator consults about introducing onscreen exams amid complaints of hand fatigue, a young aspiring journalist goes head-to-head with a self-professed expertZoe WilliamsandGeorge Francis LeeSun 14 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareThis week it was reported thatstudents could soon be sitting their end-of-year exams on laptopsafter pupils complained of hand fatigue, saying their muscles “are not strong enough”.WithOfqualpreparing to launch a public consultation on the introduction of onscreen exams, we decided to conduct a test of our own, pitting the Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, a seasoned hack of the pen-and-paper generation, against George Francis Lee, our gen-Z journalist in training.Armed with only a pad, pen and a media law textbook to copy from – we set out to discover who could scribble the longest before cramp set in. It’s a write-off!Zoe Williams, Guardian columnistI take enormous pride in my ability to use a pen and paper. Though perhaps it’s the most absurd thing to show off about, like flexing that you know how to desalinate sea water using only two spoons, when you have fresh running water throughout the house.I’ve been pretending to “have” shorthand – it is so dumb, I even like the slightly archaic “have” rather than the less affected “can do” – for so long I can’t even remember whether it was a boast when I started lying about it. Maybe in the 90s everyone could do shorthand, the way everyone could remember their landline number. In fact, I never learned it; what I learned instead is how to write very fast, forever, in the most adverse settings.This write-off, in its climate-controlled conditions – a desk, a pen that worked, good light, a spotless notepad – should have been a personal best. I’ve knelt on wet municipal paving bricks outside magistrates courts, I’ve written a quote on my own hand. One time I was interviewing at an Australian speed-dating night in Alexandra Palace, ran out of paper, ripped some from the hands of a guy who’d just finished snogging and as I walked off, he said “but that had her phone number … ” Only I can ever decipher what I’ve written, which is fine, because only I need to. In that sense, it’s a lot like shorthand.View image in fullscreenZoe Williams: ‘It holds so much meaning for me, this writing with a pen.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIt holds so much meaning for me, this writing with a pen, and I’ve been doing it so long, that naturally I am incredibly fast and good at it, except it turns out I’m not. I’m no faster than George, from the “what’s this thing? Which end do you use?” generation; I’m just much more flamboyant and triumphant when I turn the page.It’s true that I don’t get hand strain, or any of the other shooting pains that digital natives complain of, but that could equally be because all the associations I have with fast handwriting are very adrenalised: sitting exams; writing emotional letters; taking notes in my resistance-movement meetings in order to memorise then eat them. Maybe the pain happened afterwards, and I didn’t notice because my elbow hurts anyway.Longhand differs from a recording device, not in accuracy but in the intercession of this quaint little thing called “your brain”. It can pick out immediately the interesting and unusual thing in a sea of ums and ahs and cliches. It will hear the words that make that person unlike any other person (unless they’re a politician, they don’t really do idiosyncrasy). As disappointed as I am, that I’ve pinned my identity to handwriting only to be the same as a gen Z except messier, I will not stop doing it.View image in fullscreenFrancis Lee and Williams, eyes down.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianGeorge Francis Lee, Guardian traineeThe ballpoint pen feels spindly in my hand and the blank, lined paper in front of me conjures up the primal fear ofGCSEs. I swallow hard. It’s the irrational “my entire life hinges on whatever falls upon the A4 sheet” sort of dread that you don’t expect to be subjected to on a random weekday afternoon.I’m being tested on my handwriting – to see how much I can write and how long for. Just pen and paper, old-school style – no big deal. But this feels different from pitting my wits against an exam paper. I’ve been tasked with taking on a seasoned industry hack with more experience of note-taking than I do of breathing. Me, a spritely gen-Z journalist in the making, versus Guardian legend and scribbler-in-chief, Zoe Williams.With the news that students in the near future may sit certain GCSE and A-level exams on a laptop because young people are losing the ability to write for long periods, a generational scribing match has been arranged to test our mettle and our hand muscles.Speaking of hands, we shake ours before starting a 10-minute timer. I zoom into the preface of the 27th edition of McNae’s Essential Law for Journalists and begin. Seconds pass and I can’t help but see my opponent scrawling in long, bending roulettes. She moves with the speed of a 10th-century scrivener, in a script that looks as unfamiliar as Beowulf. Then I look to my page, words still on the first line, tightly formed letters distributed equally for maximum legibility.View image in fullscreenGeorge Francis Lee: ‘She moves with the speed of a 10th-century scrivener.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianI hear a page turn. Somehow, I’m barely a few sentences in and my foe is on a clean sheet. I shift into gear, legibility be damned. I write with reckless abandon, spilling across lines. It’s probably three minutes before my hand starts to ache, not much later until it starts to properly cramp – right at that fleshy bit at the base of the thumb.Another page turns. I curse McNae’s, I curse not journaling more, I curse the invention of the notes app on my iPhone. I curse it all. But I push on, though not without a meek admission that my hand, indeed, hurts.The timer finally rings, and I drop the pen like it’s hot iron. I’m surprised to find that, by the end, I’d nearly caught Zoe. Still, I have lost – the competition but not the respect of my adversary, who is magnanimous in victory. Perhaps we should arrange a rematch on a smartphone, I think – or maybe I should have squeezed a bit harder during that handshake.Explore more on these topicsExamsRegulatorsOfqualGCSEsA-levelsSchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Louisa’s side was that she comes from an immigrant background. But I think immigration is used as a political tool, because there is contention and emotion wrapped around it.

Liz Truss? Inside the former PM’s audition for MagaHer delivery might be stilted – but Truss’ new YouTube show has grand ambitions: a ‘Trump revolution’ in Britain with the help of an influential US conservative ecosystemMichael SavageSun 14 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 14.50 ESTShareLiz Truss, Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister, began the first edition of her YouTube show with a vow to unmask “the evil-doers” attempting to bring down Britain, the US and Europe. She would, she explained, reveal how an “international network of leftists work to subvert democracy and the will of the people”.Despite her bleak monologue, Truss pointed to hope from across the Atlantic. “We’re going to look at the Trump revolution and see how this can be achieved in Britain,” she said. “We’ll be talking to the leading lights of the Maga movement.”Before the show’s launch, there was one particularly enthusiastic supporter. “This is the beginning of a kind of revolution,” said John Solomon, a controversial veteran US journalist. His conservative Just the News platform will host the former prime minister’s new podcasts.British fellow travellers, including a pro-Reform adviser who has appeared on Maga media outlets, have also helped her set up the Liz Truss Show. Its staging is competent, if basic. Truss has amassed 10,000 subscribers in her first week and across the same period her debut had 67,000 views.It is a modest start, but in making common cause with Solomon, Truss is being thrust into a well-developed conservative ecosystem producing and amplifying Maga talking points. Its obsessions include alleged censorship by the mainstream media and a desire to remove a conspiratorial “deep state” – whichTruss blames for the swift end of her calamitous premiership.View image in fullscreenTruss at the Conservative party conference in October 2022 during her short stint as British prime minister.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA“Just the News is not well-known beyond the Maga-verse, but it does have gravitas there, mostly due to Solomon, who gives commentary on Maga platforms like [Steve] Bannon’s War Room and has even interviewed Trump,” said Alex Hinton, a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University who has closely studied the Maga movement.Truss’s attempt to import Maga media to Britain has pushed her closer to controversial figures such as Solomon.He set up Just the News following criticism after he was accused of pushing false stories about Joe Biden’s anticorruption effort in Ukraine, as well as controversial stories aboutthe former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.His claims were amplified across the pro-Trump media, with Solomon appearing as a regular guest on Sean Hannity’s influential Fox News show.Trump himself boosted Solomon’s reporting.Solomon made the Ukraine claims in a series of columns for the political newspaper the Hill, where he had already been re-labelled as a columnistafter colleagues complained about his work. His claims were central in Trump’s demand for the Ukrainians toinvestigate the Bidens in 2019. Those demands led to impeachment charges against Trump. The Senate later acquitted the president.Weeks after Solomon left the Hill in October 2019, the outlet announced it was carrying out a review of his work relating to Ukraine. ItconcludedSolomon had used unreliable sources and said he “failed to identify important details about key Ukrainian sources, including the fact that they had been indicted or were under investigation”.Solomon did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment on the Hill’s findings or his support for Truss’s new show. However,he has previously said: “I stand by each and every one of the columns that I wrote.”View image in fullscreenTruss is entering the same conservative ecosystem as Maga influencers such as Steve Bannon.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/ReutersSolomon’s own media appearances are a sign of the conservative ecosystem Truss is entering. He discussed his support for Truss’s project on a show he co-hosts on Real America’s Voice, a rightwing cable channel that is home to the Maga influencerSteve Bannonand on which Tucker Carlson also appears. Truss has already interviewed Bannon on one of her first podcasts.In linking up with Solomon and Just the News, Truss has become a minor player in a much wider network of conservative media outlets that often amplify each other’s content.Solomon’s own podcast and Real America’s Voice show have repeatedly hosted figures such as Mike Benz, a rightwing influencer whose criticism of USAID was cited by Elon Musk as justification for shutting down the foreign aid agency.Benz talks aboutconspiracies involving George Sorosand USAID and states there is an “industrial censorship complex” opposing conservative voices. He popularised the false idea thatTaylor Swift was a “psychological operation” asset for the Pentagon.Earlier this year, Benz was given an exclusive interview with Marco Rubio, in which the secretary of state announced he wasclosing the Global Engagement Center, which focused on combating foreign disinformation. Benz had accused it of anti-conservative censorship. Benz did not respond to requests for comment.The Liz Truss Show review – hapless ravings from a cupboardRead moreWhile Truss’s stilted style and political travailshave invited ridicule in Britain, some US observers do not dismiss her attempts to reinvent herself as a British branch of the Maga media.“You have to take folks like that seriously, even if you may not want to take them literally,” said Rob Flaherty, a deputy campaign manager on Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign who served in the Biden White House.“You saw how in 2024 President Trump leveraged that ecosystem to get his message out there. Certainly that ecosystem exports and influences conversation abroad. It seems relatively clear to me that the conditions in the UK are similar to what allowed this alternative media ecosystem to thrive here.”Alan Finlayson, a professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia, said the online conservative ecosystem was already having an impact in Britain.“Digital media knows no borders,” he said. “There’s a kind milieu within which stuff flows – sometimes taking an extreme form and sometimes less so – but which is connected.”Hinton said the growth of the online right in the UK recently meant the “potential to have a growing impact is significant”.View image in fullscreenTruss speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, US, in February 2024.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA“Both Truss and [the Reform UK leader, Nigel] Farage recentlyappeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where I watched as they hit Maga talking points ahead of the king of Maga, Trump,” he said. “Maga, the professed anti-globalist movement, has become a global hegemon.”Truss’s first show contained signs that she hopes to appeal to an American audience, too, with references unlikely to chime with a British viewer: “We’re now poorer than Mississippi,” she said at one point. “It’s like Huckleberry Finn without the steamboats.”Solomon has been involved in attempts to build an alternative conservative media network for years. He was instrumental in the setting up of theInforming America Foundation (IAF), a little-known non-profit group that hands millions to conservative media across the US.IAF has also funded Bentley Media Group, the parent company of Just the News,according to 2023 tax filings. It funds an array of local US conservativemedia, including in key swing states. IAF and Just the News did not respond to requests for comment on whether they financially supported Truss’s new show. A representative for Truss also did not respond to requests for comment.Solomon said last year that the IAF now had “an ecosystem that [reaches] more than 120 million Americans a month”. He has said he has no formal role at the IAF, but that it shares office space with Just the News.View image in fullscreenTruss is following the US journalist John Solomon’s advice on bringing Maga media to the UK.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesHinton said Truss’s arrival was a “media marriage of convenience” for both parties. “It gives Just the News an international and UK foot in the door – and her British stature will bring the network a degree of cosmopolitan prestige,” he said. “Truss, meanwhile, gets the opportunity to refurbish her image.”Advising Truss on the show is Joseph Robertson, a political strategist and Reform member who has spent time in the US. Appearing on a Real America’s Voice show last month, Robertson said Britain would effectively have “communist rule” should the government’s digital ID policy go ahead.Like Truss, Robertson backs the downfall of the “administrative deep state”. He has also advocated for Britain to become “Dubai on Thames”, with deregulation and stricter law and order.In setting up her show, Truss appears to be following Solomon’s advice on how to bring Maga media to the UK. He told her “one of the wisest things” done by major conservative funders such as the lateBernie Marcus, who co-founded Home Depot, andRichard Uihlein, a billionaire owner of an office supply company, was to develop an alternative “communication system” when Trump first came to office.“We created a communications infrastructure that could get around the legacy media and get the word out,” he told her.Some believe Truss’s bigger problem may be that she simply is not very good at the medium. “The people who are successful will have charisma and the ability to capture attention,” said Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former communications chief. “I would say that’s a strike against her.”“She has never been good at this,” said Finlayson. “When she tries to be dramatic and scary, it’s ludicrous.”Flaherty, however, said critics should be wary of writing off Truss’s chances of finding validation in the Maga universe. “The alternative media ecosystem has no shortage of comeback stories,” he said. “It is always possible to rebrand yourself when you give in to a rabid political fanbase.”"

He claimed Albanese had “replaced weakness with weakness and appeasement with more appeasement”.“Your government did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia. You did nothing to curb the cancer cells that were growing inside your country. You took no action. You let the disease spread and the result is the horrific attacks on Jews we saw today.”Albanese declined to respond directly when asked about Netanyahu’s comments at a media conference on Monday morning.Timeline: Bondi beach terror attack becomes Australia’s worst mass shooting in three decadesRead more“This is a moment for national unity,” Albanese said in response. “This is a moment for Australians to come together. That’s precisely what we’ll be doing.”Netanyahu praised the actions of abystander who wrestled the gun from one of the attackers, saying he saluted “a Muslim brave man” who prevented the death of “innocent Jews” (the man’s religion was unconfirmed as of Monday morning).“But we are worrying right now about our people, our safety, and we do not remain silent,” Netanyahu said. “We fight those who try to annihilate us.”The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, said in a video message posted online that “vile terrorists deliberately targeted innocent Jewish families celebrating the first night of Hanukah”.“The people of Israel stand together with all of you in this very dark and difficult moment … the Jewish people are strong, resilient and united, and our message is clear: the Hanukah lights must go on and will be lit all over the world, especially in Bondi beach, in Sydney and all over Australia.”0:59Surf camera in Australia shows beachgoers fleeing Bondi beach during shooting – videoThe US president,Donald Trump, said it was “a terrible attack” and “an antisemitic attack, obviously”. He said he wanted to pay his respects “to everybody”.The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the US strongly condemned the attack. “Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.”The former US president Barack Obama said he and his wife, Michelle, were praying for the families mourning victims of the attack. “For everyone lighting a candle tonight, may the glow of the menorah brighten your darkest moments,” he wrote on X.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the news was “deeply distressing”. “The United Kingdom sends our thoughts and condolences to everyone affected by the appalling ‍attack in Bondi beach.”King Charles said he and Camilla were “appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack”. “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully, including the police officers who were injured while protecting members of their community … In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve.

There is peace here.As the sun set on this idyllic weekend, members of Sydney’s Jewish community had gathered at a small park immediately behind the beach to light candles, to commune and to celebrate the beginning of Hanukah. To the Jewish festival of lights, terrorists brought darkness.View image in fullscreenPeople flee Bondi beach after gunmen opened fire.Photograph: Mike Ortiz/UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesJust after a quarter to seven, in the softening daylight, two gunmen bearing long weapons suddenly opened fire from a nearby elevated footbridge which connecting the boulevard of Campbell Parade with the Bondi Surf Club.Without pause, the men poured round after indiscriminate round into the crowd who had gathered in peace and in community.Eyewitnesses reported the shooting ran on and on – five minutes some said, others 10, some reported 50 rounds being fired – before the gunmen were silenced.One was killed, the other critically injured. Video showed two men pressed on to the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge, firearms on the ground nearby. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men.Finn Green – who arrived in Bondi Beach on Tuesday from Bristol in the UK – was directly across from the footbridge when the shooters opened fire. He was speaking to his family on FaceTime as the shooting began.“There were two of them [gunmen], one went to the right and hit a lady and the other went to the left and hit a man. I saw heaps of people running away. My family were screaming at me on the phone to find cover because they could hear the gunshots.”View image in fullscreenPolice at Bondi beach on Sunday night.Photograph: Mark Baker/APAbdullah Ashrof said he saw two shooters on the bridge as he drove down Campbell Parade.Ashrof, who still had blood on his hands from helping people in the aftermath of the shooting, parked to try to tell people to take cover and saw a police officer who had a gunshot wound. Others nearby appeared dead and injured.“He was very brave. He was trying to stay conscious,” Ashrof said of the officer. “We were trying to talk to him … Just trying to help him, hold his hand and there are other people who are trying to wrap his wound, put pressure on the wound.”Another woman with her children nearby had also been shot. “I think the worst thing was that two of her kids were right next to her,” Ashrof said. “She was … very brave, trying to stay conscious, trying to talk.”Another eyewitness said he saw people screaming as they ran, shouting “they’re reloading, they’re reloading”. Many ran carrying children.He said people barricaded themselves in toilet blocks, restaurants and surf clubs, seeking safety.View image in fullscreenAmbulance workers care for a victim of the shooting.Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom Icebergs restaurant at the other end of Bondi beach, diners say they initially thought they were hearing fireworks, before they saw “swarms of people, like a school of fish being attacked by a shark” fleeing from the scene.People fled up the beach – some into the water – falling over each to escape the gunmen.Late into the night at Bondi, people gathered on street corners, lit by the flashing blue-red of dozens of police vehicles, to seek solace in solidarity with their neighbours. From makeshift trauma centres set up in surf clubs, people walked up darkened streets still covered in blood.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, convened a late-night meeting of the national security council.“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith. [This attack is] an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation,” he said.“An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear: we will eradicate it.”Jillian Segal, the government’s special envoy to combat antisemitism in Australia, said the images emerging from the attack “echo the horrors Australians hoped they would never see here”.“An attack on a peaceful Jewish celebration is an attack on our national character and our way of life. Australia must defend both,” she said.“As Australian Jews light our Hanukah candles tonight, we do so with the heaviest of hearts.”Additional reporting by Anne DaviesExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least 11 people were killed and 29 injured in what police designated as a terrorist attack. One of the alleged gunman was also killed, bringing the total number of dead to 12.Alex Ryvchin, of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said in a statement: “I think this was very deliberate and very targeted.”The Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council said it was “horrified” by what had taken place. “We have warned for years that the unceasing antisemitic vitriol on our streets would evolve into antisemitic violence if left unchecked. We have warned that verbal abuse becomes graffiti, becomes arson, becomes physical violence, becomes murder,” its executive director, Colin Rubenstein, said in a statement.1:16Australian prime minister calls Bondi beach shootings an act of ‘evil antisemitism’ – videoHe added: “This is not just a terrible day for the Jewish community, for Bondi, and for Sydney but for all of Australia, and for the values we hold dear, that are the bedrock of what for so long has been our inclusive, harmonious society,” he added.The sentiment was echoed by Jillian Segal, the federal government’s special envoy to combat antisemitism in Australia. “What once seemed distant or uncomfortable can no longer be ignored,” Segal said in a statement. “Taunts from the Opera House steps, synagogues set alight and now massacres at a celebration form a clear pattern. This is not the Australia we know and it cannot be the Australia we accept.”‘It was a massacre’: how antisemitic terror exploded the peaceful idyll of Bondi beachRead moreIn July, Segal said reports of antisemitic incidentshad surgedafter the attack by Hamas-led militants on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, and Israel’s military response in Gaza, which has killed more than 70,700 people.A spate of incidents, including arson attacks on synagogues and achildcare centre, rocked the Jewish community in late 2024 and early 2025. Australia’s prime minister in Augustblamed Iranfor two of the attacks and cut diplomatic ties to Tehran.On Sunday, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, urged Australia’s government to do more to protect Jewish people in Australia. “The heart of the entire nation of Israel misses a beat at this very moment,” he said. “We repeat our alerts time and time again to the Australian government to seek action and fight against the enormous wave of antisemitism which is plaguing Australian society.”Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the Jewish community would have every resource it needed.“I say on behalf of all Australians to the Jewish community, we stand with you,” he said. “We embrace you and we reaffirm tonight that you have every right to be proud of who you are and what you believe … There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear: we will eradicate it.”3:22'We had nowhere to go': eyewitnesses recount Bondi beach mass shooting – videoIn neighbouring New Zealand, the Jewish Council said it was “utterly sickened and horrified” by the mass shooting. “We do not know all the details, but we are haunted by the scenes we have seen, in a place familiar to and loved by so many of us,” it said. “We are in shock, and we pray for the innocent victims of this atrocity.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had been in touch with members of the Jewish community in Australia to express its solidarity and offer support. “The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them,” it said in a statement.The leader of the Green party of England and Wales, Zack Polanski, said he was on his way to a Hanukah event on Sunday. “It should be a celebration but instead our community is once again mourning,” he wrote on social media. “I will be thinking of everyone in Australia and those around the world in the Jewish Community who know this fear and loss. We stand with you.”The European Jewish Congress said it was “appalled and shocked” by the attack. “It is unconscionable that Jewish families gathering to celebrate a joyous event in one of the most multicultural cities in the world should be slaughtered in cold blood by terrorists,” the group’s president, Moshe Kantor, said in a statement.The Conference of European Rabbis, an Orthodox rabbinical alliance, said the organisation was devastated by the attack. “We mourn with the Jewish community of Sydney and with the families mourning loved ones murdered in cold blood simply for being Jews,” said its president, Pinchas Goldschmidt. “A festival of light was shattered by terror.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackSydneyAntisemitismJudaismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Bondi beach terror attack may force it to confront its surging number of weaponsSarah MartinThere are now more guns in the community per capita than in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre, with at least 2,000 new firearms lawfully entering the community every weekSun 14 Dec 2025 17.37 ESTFirst published on Sun 14 Dec 2025 07.54 ESTShareFor almost three decades, Australia’s gun laws have been recognised as among the most stringent – and effective – in the world.After the horror of the 1996Port Arthur massacrethat killed 35 people in Tasmania, Australia’s then conservative government stared down the gun lobby to introduce restrictions that led to a dramatic decrease in the number of guns.In an almost unprecedented display of national collaboration, the federal government worked with the states to restrict semiautomatic weapons, toughen up licensing requirements and introduce a new requirement for gun holders to demonstrate a “genuine reason” for ownership.Bondi beach terror attack: 12 people killed after gunshots fired at park in Australia hosting Jewish festivalRead moreAustralians have been rightly proud of these reforms, confident that the community remains relatively safe from gun violence and far from the American reality of frequent mass shootings.Sunday’s Bondi attackwill shake that confidence and may force the country to again grapple with its gun laws.Police confirmed on Monday morning that one of the alleged shooters was a registered gun owner and had six legally obtained firearms.There has been growing concern among gun control advocates that firearms remain far too easy to access despite the country’s “gold standard” framework.Gun safety experts have been warning ofcomplacency, pointing to booming gun numbers and weaknesses across state and territory laws that can beeasily exploited, or see lawful weapons end upin criminal hands.At the same time, new threats such as 3D-printed weapons and a growingsovereign citizen movementare posing new challenges to law enforcement when it comes to gun control.While the well-intentioned reforms of 1996 have immense public and political support, in reality there are elements of the so-called national firearm agreement that have still not yet been fully implemented.A promised national register, for example, is still not a reality and, instead of nationally harmonised laws, Australians have different laws in different states, all of which are inconsistently regulated.Bystander tackles and wrestles gun from alleged gunman during Bondi beach mass shootingRead moreImmediately after the Port Arthur massacre, a national amnesty saw the number of firearms in the community plummet but there are now more than 4 million guns in Australia – almost double the number recorded in 2001.chart showing the number of registered firearms in Australia - prior to the port arthur massacre it is at around 4 million, then dips sharply after gun buybacks and bans were instituted, now it is back up over 4 millionYes, the population has increased at the same time but there is now a larger number of guns in the community per capita than in the aftermath of Port Arthur, with at least 2,000 new firearms lawfully entering the community every week.It is these figures that has the gun lobby boasting that it is“winning” the fightagainst Australia’s longstanding crackdown, calling for gun owners to become more politically active to further enable their industry.The lobby has been particularly alarmed by new laws introduced inWestern Australialast year, which have – among other measures – limited the number of guns that an individual licence holder can own and tightened mental health checks for licence holders.The West Australian police have suggested the new laws should be a “beacon” for other states to follow, saying it sets a new, higher bar for community safety.This story was updated on 15 December 2025 after police gave details of the weapons involved in the shooting.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackGun controlBondiSydneyNew South WalesanalysisShareReuse this content"

At least 12 people were killed, including one alleged gunman, and dozens were injured in Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.His words will resonate with representatives of the Jewish community in Australia and across the world who have been warning policymakers about the clear and present danger of such an attack.View image in fullscreenPolice officers guarding a restricted area after the Bondi attackPhotograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesExperts point out that antisemitism was already widely prevalent before the bloody conflict in Gaza, provoked by the Hamas attack into Israel of October 2023, polarised opinions across the world.The most lethal attack against the Jewish community in the US, for example, came in 2018, while in 2023, Michael O’Flaherty, the director of the EU’s agency for fundamental rights, described such hate as a “deeply ingrained racism in European society” that posed an existential threat to the continent’s Jewish community.But there is no doubt that such trends were intensified dramatically by the conflict in the Middle East.In the US, theAnti-Defamation Leaguereported 9,354 antisemitic incidents in 2024, the highest since its records began in 1979. For the first time, a majority “contained elements related to Israel or Zionism”.The Community Safety Trustrecorded 4,296 instancesof anti-Jewish hate across the UK in 2023 – double the previous year – and the most ever documented. There were 3,528 in 2024, the second-highest annual total.0:59Surf camera in Australia shows beachgoers fleeing Bondi beach during shooting – videoIn Australia, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) logged 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents in the 12 months to 30 September, about three times higher than any annual total before the war in Gaza.In a reportearlier this month, the ECAJ said anti-Jewish racism had left the fringes of society and become part of the mainstream, with “an increasing ideological alignment … between neo-Nazis, the anti-Israel left or Islamists”.Terrorism experts know that radicalisation does not occur in a vacuum. Such violence remains a social activity, reflecting broader trends. This means even incidents of race hate seen as relatively minor – hateful graffiti, racist insults in the street, and similar – suggest something deeper and more dangerous.The telescopic sights used by the Bondi attackers would have made every one of their victims plainly visible – talking, laughing, looking after children, greeting friends, hugging relatives at one of the most joyous events in the Jewish religious calendar.Pulling the trigger would have come at the end of a process of dehumanisation that begins well before even swastikas are painted on the walls of synagogues, or schoolchildren are insulted at a bus stop.0:33Vision shows gunman at Bondi Beach – videoSecurity officials have been warning for some time that the Gaza conflict has prompteda wave ofextremist radicalisation across the Islamic world and well beyond. Last year, then US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines,saidthe war “will have a generational impact on terrorism”.The most recent report of the UN committee overseeing sanctions on members of al-Qaida and Islamic State noted that “the Gaza and Israel conflict” still featured prominently in terrorist propaganda, and that “in the US, there were several alleged terrorist attack plots, largely motivated by the Gaza and Israel conflict or individuals inspired and radicalised by [IS]”.This will be a key focus of investigators.There have been some suggestions that Iran, which appears to have been responsible for instigating some earlier antisemitic attacks in Australia, could be to blame. But this would be a dramatic escalation and departure from recent tactics used by Iranian agents, so is improbable.0:59Israel's president sends condolences to Bondi beach shooting victims in Australia – videoBritish officials share information with their Australian counterparts through the Five Eyes security alliance and are likely to have passed on their own concerns about violence targeting Jewish communities following recent incidents in the UK.Jihad al-Shamie, 35,reportedly pledged allegiance to IS before he attacked a synagogue in Manchester on the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur in October, leading to the deaths of two worshippers.In the aftermath, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), issued a new call to arms in an online magazine distributed via social media, urging Muslims in the west to follow al-Shamie’s example.AQAP, which has significant propaganda reach and international ambitions, called for further violence against Jewish communities and offered detailed advice from its “lone jihad guide team” to aspirant attackers.An unconfirmed report from one witness that the killers in Sydney displayed a “black flag with an insignia on it” will interest investigators, as this could indicate an IS allegiance. But there is no evidence so far that the organisation has any link to Sunday’s horrifying events.For the moment, there is merely the sense of a tragedy foretold. “This is the worst fears of the Jewish community,” Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the ECAJ, told Sky News. “It’s been bubbling under the surface for a long time, and now it’s actually happened.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackBondi beachAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

He leaps on to him and wrestles the gun from his hands.A man who said he was a family member of the heroic bystander was interviewed outside a majorSydneyhospital where victims from the attack were being treated. He said al-Ahmed, the father of two young daughters, had been admitted after being shot twice in his upper arm and hand.“I hope he will be fine. I saw him last night, he wasn’t alright, but we’re waiting to see what the doctor will decide,” the family member, named Mustafa, said on Monday morning, adding his relative was “in pain” and yet to be operated on.“He’s a hero, absolutely. Because maybe he can lose his life to save other people. I hope everyone in Australia wish everything is good for Ahmed to get back to his family.”The video from Sunday evening shows the alleged gunman falling to the ground before the bystander points the gun at him as the gunman backs away.Bondi beach terror attack: 12 people killed after gunshots fired at park in Australia hosting Jewish festivalRead moreAs the alleged gunman retreats, the bystander gently places the gun against a tree and puts his hand in the air.At least 16 people were killed in the attack on a Hanukah celebration, including one of the shooters, police said. At least 40 people were taken to hospital.Authorities declared the incident a terrorist attack.“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said at a press conference on Sunday night.“The evil that was unleashed atBondi beachtoday is beyond comprehension and the trauma and loss that families are dealing with tonight is beyond anyone’s worst nightmare.“Australians have had their lives cruelly stolen and many have been injured. Our first thoughts are with those in the terrible early hours of their grief.“We are also thinking of everyone being treated for their injuries and many of whom are alive right now because of the courage and quick action of the NSW police and the first responders who rushed to their aid – as well as the courage of everyday Australians who, without hesitating, put themselves in danger in order to keep their fellow Australians safe.“We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others. These Australians are heroes and their bravery has saved lives.”A separate video of the terror attack showed two men in black clothes crossing a bridge at the beach and firing. Multiple shots could be heard and people could be heard screaming.Bondi beach attack: what we know so far about the shooting in AustraliaRead moreThe NSW premier, Chris Minns, told reporters on Sunday night: “This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see, and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney.”Minns recognised the “extraordinary acts of personal courage and bravery from individuals in our community”.“I think it’s worth remembering that in all of this evil, in all of this sadness, there are still wonderful, brave Australians prepared to risk their lives to help a complete stranger,” he said.Minns said the “attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukah”.“What should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.“I can only imagine the pain that they’re feeling right now to see their loved ones killed as they celebrate this ancient holiday. It’s a responsibility of all Australians to wrap their arms around Australia’s Jewish community and help them get through this incredibly difficult period.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackBondiBondi beachSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Chris Curtis, the co-chair of the Labour Growth Group, said at the time she would be an “exceptional addition” to the Treasury.Curtis told the Guardian: “Catherine has made a major contribution during her time at the Treasury, not least in ensuring the largest changes to planning in a generation will soon be passed into law. Her expertise has been a great asset to government.”Howard was then asked to stay on as long as she could because the Treasury found her advice helpful, but she decided to leave in January to return to her role as a partner at the private law firm Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer.While in government she is understood to have disagreed with Starmer’s decision to announce he would fully adopt the recommendations of a review into building nuclear power stations more quickly, written by the economist John Fingleton.Starmer saidin a post-budget speechlast week: “In addition to accepting the Fingleton recommendations, I am asking the business secretary to apply these lessons across the entire industrial strategy.”Fingleton made a number of suggestions, including changing rules around protected species and increasing radiation limits for those living near or working in a nuclear power plant.AI-powered nimbyism could grind UK planning system to a halt, experts warnRead moreHe suggested that infrastructure projects should pay a large, pre-agreed, upfront sum to government quango Natural England in lieu of protecting or replacing habitats lost to development.His review also recommended making it more costly for individuals and charities to take judicial reviews against infrastructure projects.Fingletontold the Guardianearlier this week: “We need to have a more mature relationship with risk. Projects often do not go ahead because of concerns about safety but often all you are doing is moving the risk somewhere else.”Howard believed Starmer should not have accepted his recommendations to rip up EU derived habitats laws before taking legal advice on whether they complied with legally binding nature targets and trading arrangements with the EU.She was bringing forward concerns shared with government departments including the Cabinet Office and the environment department, which said the review could jeopardise trade with the EU and lead to widespread habitat destruction.Those concerns are also shared by some Labour backbenchers.Chris Hinchliff, Labour MP for North East Hertfordshire, has been leading a campaign against the review.He said: “It’s time our Labour government stopped pitching nature as the enemy of a better life for ordinary people in this country and realised that, for the vast majority, it is a measure of it.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the NHS produces regular figures about deaths in hospitals and the Ministry of Justice does so with deaths in custody.Fifty-one people died in Home Office-provided asylum accommodation in 2024, an increase of 11 on the previous year and a more than twelvefold rise on 2019 when four people died, according to FoI data.The department initially claimed that only 30 people had died during that year, but had toapologiseafter it emerged there were 21 additional deaths.Deaths in recent years include those ofLeonard Farrukufrom Albania, who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge in December 2023; Mehrab Omrani from Iran, who is thought to have lain dead for four months in Home Office accommodation before his body was discovered in March 2024; and Hussein Haseeb Ahmed, a Kurdish Iraqi man whodied at Manston processing centrein Kent after contracting diphtheria in November 2022.An amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act 2025 proposed publishing this data but was not passed. The investigative journalism unitLiberty Investigatesargued in an appeal to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that the Home Office should make these deaths public but was unsuccessful.The ICO agreed with the Home Office, which said that “preventing potential harassment or violence against vulnerable individuals and staff would outweigh any countervailing interests in transparency”.The Home Office said giving the names of those who died could assist in “indirectly identifying the relatives of deceased individuals and/or the accommodation providers. This could expose relatives of the deceased to harassment or violence, particularly in light of recent incidents in August 2024 where asylum locations were targeted.”Officials added: “This targeting of asylum locations could also expose the staff who work there to harassment or violence. Therefore it is our view that disclosure of the requested information would lead to endangerment.”The charity Asylum Matters is coordinating a campaign calling for both deaths of asylum seekers in the care of the Home Office and those who die trying to cross the Channel to be published.Louise Calvey, the executive director at Asylum Matters, said: “People are dying in our asylum system. They’re dying at our borders, yes, but they’re also dying in camps, hotels, and other privately run, profit-driven Home Office funded accommodation. People are dying by suicide, dying of infectious disease, dying avoidable deaths. What we know for certain is that lives are being lost – but what we don’t know is how many.“It’s an utterly shameful outlier: when people die in government care in other settings, such as the prison system, there’s a duty to report and track that data. Not tracking the figures in the asylum system makes it impossible to take effective action to reduce these tragedies – and it sends the appalling message that the deaths of people seeking sanctuary don’t matter.”TheHome Officepreviouslyrevealedit did not routinely inform family members when asylum seekers died in its care and did not want to supply details of these deaths publicly in case it upset them and “endangers their mental health”.A department spokesperson said:“Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families and friends of any asylum seeker or migrant who has died. We have taken immediate action to restart asylum processing and robust measures are in place to prioritise the safety of anyone in asylum accommodation. Our Border Security Act will also make it an offence to endanger another life during perilous small boat crossings, including a sentence of up to five years in prison.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We commend the police, emergency services and members of the public whose heroic actions no doubt prevented even greater horror and tragedy.“In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve. I know that the spirit of community and love that shines so brightly in Australia – and the light at the heart of the Chanukah festival – will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.”Dave Rich, the director of policy at the Jewish charity, said a “wave of anti-Jewish hatred” had continued to fester after two worshippers died in an attack on aManchester synagogue in October.“As much as government and police are doing things to try to stop this, the fact it is still ongoing means that not enough is being done,” he told Sky News on Sunday.“We see incitement, we see hatred on our streets – there were protests in this country just this weekend using violent rhetoric and nobody’s being arrested.“These protests are not being dealt with properly and I think that’s what leaves a lot of Jewish people feeling incredibly vulnerable and, at times like this, incredibly angry.”The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was “devastated” by the Sydney attack and was working with the UK government on its response. It added: “The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them.”View image in fullscreenMichael Vaughan, who is in Australia for the Ashes, was trapped in a restaurant as the Bondi beach gun attack unfolded.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesThe former England cricket captainMichael Vaughansaid he was locked in a restaurant in Bondi as the incident unfolded.Vaughan, who is in Australia working as a media pundit for the Ashes series, said it was “scary” but thanked the emergency services and a bystander who was filmed disarming one of the gunmen.

They said it would lead to ambulance queues building up outside A&E departments, patients facing long waits to be seen, widespread “corridor care”, an increased spread of the flu virus – and even greater risk that seriously ill patients would die because of delays in finding them a bed.TheHealth Foundation analysedthe delayed discharges in hospitals in England from July to September last year and the same period this year. It found that:The percentage of bed days used by patients whose discharge was delayed rose from 10.1% in 2024 to 11% this year, an increase of 9% or 19,000 bed days.That rise was driven by an 8% year-on-year rise in the number of discharges, equivalent to about 3,800 patients a month.The number of the NHS’s overall stock of about 100,000 general and acute beds occupied last winter by delayed discharge patients hit a peak of 14%, but it is likely to be even higher this winter.“Winter has already begun but the NHS is already under intense strain, with an unprecedented surge in flu cases for the time of year,” said Francesca Cavallaro, the foundation’s senior analytical manager, who undertook the analysis.“The mounting pressures are compounded by the rising number of patients stranded in hospital beds despite being medically fit to be discharged compared with last year.“Our new analysis shows that 19,000 more hospital bed days were lost due to delays in discharging patients during July to September compared with the same period last year. These delays harm patients and increase pressures on overstretched A&E departments.“Last winter saw a record number of patients forced to wait for 12 hours or more in A&E, so this suggests this winter could be even more gruelling than the last.”Cash-strapped local councils’ inability to put in place the right social care package for patients who are medically fit to leave hospital is a key reason for the growing numbers of delayed discharges, but doctors and NHS leaders says the ageing population and advances in medical science that keep people alive for longer are also significant factors.The president of the Society of Acute Medicine, Dr Vicky Price, said chronic bed shortages this winter would lead to patients dying. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine estimates that 16,600 people died avoidably last winter as a result of delays in getting A&E care or a bed.“These findings fit with our clinical experience and if anything underestimate the problem,” Price said. “This is a complex problem which has been escalating for years, increasing the strain both in hospitals and in the community.”Record numbers of older people and life-prolonging treatment breakthroughs have led to an increase in the overall need for care, she explained.NHS England’s ability to withstand winter pressures has also been compromised by the cost-cutting “reset” of the service’s finances for 2025-26 ordered by its chief executive, Sir Jim Mackey, she said.“Many hospitals have had the number of beds reduced in order to comply with the penalising financial pressures they are placed under.“It was predictable that any additional strain would cause this effect. This is an extremely serious situation. For patients stranded in the emergency department, there is a significant mortality associated with this,” she said.Delayed discharges cost the NHS in England about £200m a month, or about £2bn a year, theHealth Service Journal estimatedin October. That was a small increase on the £1.7bn that theKing’s Fund health thinktank calculatedthe cost to be in 2023.Mackeypredicted recentlythat as many as 8,000 of the NHS’s 100,000 beds could soon be filled with flu patients, given the severity of the outbreak.Rory Deighton, the acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said: “Given the ever-increasing demand that the NHS has seen over the last few years – often from patients who are older or have more complex conditions – it is sadly not surprising to see this analysis highlighting the continued impact delayed discharges are putting on services.“Delayed discharges have been a longstanding challenge for the NHS and can exacerbate winter pressures.“A lack of social and community care can often result in delays getting medically fit patients out of hospital, which in turn can create bottlenecks in the urgent and emergency care system that result in longer ambulance handovers and A&E waits.”Hospital bosses were also “very concerned the upcoming resident doctor strikes will pile yet more pressure on to the NHS and could put patient safety at risk”, he said.A Department of Health and SocialCare spokesperson said: “The shocking delays to hospital discharge we inherited have cost patients and the NHS far too much.“We are working to turn this around. We even started preparing for this winter earlier than ever before – stress-testing hospital plans, working closely with care homes and local leaders, and making sure every part of the system is ready to keep patients flowing safely through hospitals.“We’re ramping up vaccination programmes, with more than 17m vaccines delivered this autumn – hundreds of thousands more compared with this time last year – and more than 60,000 more NHS staff also getting their jab.“We are also joining up NHS and social care through neighbourhood health teams – so more people can get the care they need at home – and backing adult social care with a £4bn funding boost.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of police spent the night scouring the campus and nearby neighbourhoods as the suspect remained at large.Weissman was in her dorm room at Brown when a friend called to warn her that a shooting was under way. Her initial feelings of panic soon turned to anger, she told NBC. “I’m angry that I thought I’d never have to deal with this again, and here I am eight years later,”Weissman told NBC News.She was 12 years old when she witnessed a shooting at the high school adjacent to her middle school inParkland, Florida.The 2018 shooting left 17 people dead.Tretta was shot in the abdomen in 2019 when a 16-year-old opened fire at Saugus high school, near Los Angeles, killing two people, including her best friend.“People always think, well, it’ll never be me,” Tretta told the New York Times. “And until I was shot in my school, I also thought the same thing.”On Saturday, she was in her dormitory, studying. She had initially planned to study in the Barus and Holley engineering and physics building,where the shootingtook place, but had changed her mind as she was feeling tired.Map of where the attack took placeSaturday’s attack has again cast a spotlight onlongstanding callsfor gun control in the US, where gun laws rank among the most permissive in the developed world. So far this year, there have been 389 mass shootings across the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines incidents where four or more victims have been shot. Last year, more than 500 mass shootings were reported.On Saturday, Tretta and Weissman said they had assumed they would never have to live through another shooting.“The one thing that gave me comfort was, like, statistically, it’s practically impossible for this to ever happen to me again,” said Weissman. “And clearly, we’re getting to a point where no one can say that any more.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.Before the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.The move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.The talks were hosted by the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were hosted by Friedrich Merz (right) in Berlin.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany Handout Bundesregierung/Guido Bergmann/ShutterstockZelenskyy described the concession onNatoas a compromise.“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US andEuropedid not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.Zelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.10:32Trump turns on Europe: will he pull support for Ukraine? | The LatestSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.Zelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.A ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s financesby leveraging frozen Russian central bank assetsto fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyNatoFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A common theme was crystallised by the Daily Mail’s Sarah Vine on Wednesday after two Afghan asylum seekers were jailed for raping a 15-year-old girl: “For too long this country has ignored the reality of what happens when men from certain cultures are let loose in our liberal democracy.”Increasingly, politicians express outrage, too, not just at the offence itself – but at the immigration status of the perpetrator. They repeat pledges to make it harder for people to enter the country illegally.Sometimes those commenting claim to be backed by statistics. But more often it is anecdotal, the preponderance of news stories themselves held up as evidence, accompanied by numerous police mugshots of brown or black men.Vine also wrote: “I don’t care if I’m accused of scaremongering, or worse. Facts are facts.” But the difficult truth is that the evidence is complex and frequently absent from official data.It is true, for example, that Afghan nationals offend in the UK at a higher rate than British nationals – but the difference has been exaggerated, and does not account for the difference in demographics between the two groups in the UK.While lists of crimes committed by foreign nationals create one impression, a similar list could be created of violent offences by white British men that would create another, but rarely attract coverage focused on ethnicity. And while offendingratesmay be higher among some immigrant groups, it is also true that if you are a victim of a violent or sexual crime in the UK, the available evidence suggests that the ethnic makeup of the country means that the perpetrator is most likely to be a white man.Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, said: “There’s a big concerted effort on both sides of the Atlantic to create this migrant crime crisis argument as a big piece of the argument about the dangers of immigration and the impossibility of integration​.“In the end, it’s a really tricky thing to counter because it captures something about perceptions about crime and something about the perceptions of migration and integration and it fuses them together.” He noted that crime rates overallwere falling, with sexual assault an important exception, but that that story rarely made the news. “For the citizen​ it’s not something you see,” he added. “Policymakers should collect the statistics​, ​show you the statistics, and ask: is [the offending by asylum seekers and migrants] proportionate?”What does the data say overall?The reality is that the government’s own data cannot tell us how many crimes are committed by asylum seekers because the Ministry of Justice does not record offences by immigration status. As such, there is no official way to compare offending rates of asylum seekers with the wider population.There are various proxies but none of them give a cast iron answer. For example, information on crime is collected by nationality but that only gets us so far.The category “foreign nationals’’ lumps together a wide mix of people: recent arrivals, long-settled immigrants, students, health and care workers, their dependants, and also asylum seekers.With that context in mind, the figures we do have show that, overall, foreign nationals in England and Wales are imprisoned or convicted at roughly the same rate as British nationals, according toanalysis by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford.What does a more granular look reveal?When you adjust for age and sex – important because young men are disproportionately likely to commit crime, and migrant populations tend to be younger –the share of non-citizens in prison is actually lower than the share of British citizens. (There is no publicly available data on conviction rates after adjusting for age.)Graphic: non-citizens are slightly less likely to be in prison than UK citizensNon-citizens are slightly less likely to be in prison than UK citizensBen Brindle, a researcher at the Migration Observatory, who carried out the analysis, said: “I think it’s likely that asylum seekers are more likely to commit crimes, but that’s in good part due to some of the other characteristics that those people tend to have.“For instance, asylum seekers are more likely to be young men and young men are more likely to commit crime. In a perfect world you’d want to be comparing a young male Brit to a young male asylum seeker to try and account for that but we can’t do that with the statistics that we’ve got.”Those saying that there is an emergency around crime committed by asylum seekers argue that whichever comparison you draw, the demographic mix of those arriving is part of the problem. Meanwhile, although nationality data is available, there are big gaps in the underlying population data which make comparisons shaky. High-quality figures on the share of non-British citizens in the population are hard to come by, meaning that any crime rates are uncertain.What causes differences in offending rates?Brindle said: “There are a range of other things which impact likelihood that somebody commits a crime, both Brits and migrants. Trauma is certainly one of them, mental health more broadly, socioeconomic status, all of these things, and yet we can’t account for them with the data we’ve got.“So we can see at one level whether certain nationalities, perhaps, are more likely to commit crime – although there are some limitations with the data there – but we’re not really getting into the why and the factors that are driving differences in crime rates between different groups.”The last census took place in 2021 – before the peak in migration – and the Office for National Statistics has faced problems withfalling response ratesin its main population surveys.There is another complication. Those surveys do not include people living in communal accommodation such as asylum hotels, which means many recent arrivals are not counted at all. Smaller groups of foreign nationals – for example Afghans – are most likely to be misrepresented.All of this makes it difficult to produce firm, detailed conclusions about the relationship between immigration status and crime in the UK.Are figures about the difference in offending rates reliable?An example of the complexity is illustrated in the claim from the Centre for Migration Control, cited by Reform UK and the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, that Afghan nationals were 22 times more likely to be convicted of sex offences than British nationals.The convictions data was from the years 2021-23 (capturing 77 sexual offences – not necessarily offenders – in that period committed by Afghan nationals) but the population data was from the 2021 census and the number of Afghans has increased greatly since, after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021.Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory,told BBC Radio 4’s More or Lessprogramme that she estimated the rate to be 14.5 – not 22 – times higher for Afghan nationals. Her calculation came with caveats too because, unlike for the prison population data, there is no age breakdown.That is still a very striking difference. But where there is a relatively small number of offences, a small change in the population – and we know population data is also unreliable and can be measured in different ways – can move the rate of offending significantly. As Brindle said: “Age is a really important factor when we look at the likelihood of criminality.”Are media reports a reliable representation of the issue?There may have been a rash of crimes committed by asylum seekers reported in the media recently, but that does not necessarily mean that they are increasing; there may simply be more coverage.“We saw that with the accidental release of a prisoner,” said Katwala. “It’s a famous caseand suddenly you realise that the prison system’saccidentally [been] releasing prisonersonce a month or whatever.”He added: “The people who will be reassured by the statistics are probably not the people that you need to reassure.” Without data on crime rates among asylum seekers, it is impossible to give a reliable answer.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumProtestCrimeHome OfficeexplainersShareReuse this content"

These were not evidence of disease per se, Maté went on to elaborate. Rather, he said: “I see it as a normal response to abnormal stress.”What Maté did is nowhere near customary clinical procedure: a diagnosis requires a structured assessment and adequate time with a patient. And to render a diagnosis publicly raises obvious privacy concerns.However, the gesture was much in keeping with the rash of diagnostic claims and self-labeling that have swept the internet and mass-market publishing, creating a space where confessional zeal and memeified pseudoscience – sometimes abetted by therapists who should know better – have become almost routine.Today, an entire industry has spawned around the idea that everything is trauma. Once understood as the psyche’s confrontation with genuine catastrophe, trauma is now treated as a personal possession: something to be owned, narrated and curated by the individual.This drift marks the entrance point to a broader cultural shift: the commodification of pain.It is evident on#TraumaTok, where across more than 650,000 posts creators variously rant, weep and recast traits as symptoms – “Perfectionist? It’s your trauma!” – to greatalgorithmic reward.The same sensibility crowds bookstore shelves. Barnes & Noble lists more than 3,300 titles under the “anxiety, stress and trauma-related disorders” category, frommemoirs of resurfaced memoriesto healing manuals and neuro-pop analysis. (One authorcallstrauma “an out-of-control epidemic”, transmissible among family and friends.)When everything is trauma, nothing isArash JavanbakhtMost of these works promise uplift, if not the beginning of a new life. They also assure readers they are not alone in being undone by challenges large and small (see for instance: Tiny Traumas: When You Don’t Know What’s Wrong, But Nothing Feels Quite Right). In audio form, theGifts of Traumapodcast considers subjects as diverse as menopause, math anxiety and inauthentic corporate leadership, whileStart Thrivingexamines the ways a wrecked nervous system dictates partner choice.And on any given weekend, the most well-off among us can select from a menu of expensive seminars and workshops devoted to defanging troubled memories and connecting to the inner self. For those willing to spend $6,200, there is a seven-day Adriatic cruise,Sailing into Alignment, in which Maté lectures in person on trauma’s profound impact on our wellbeing.Trauma, which once invoked a shattering incident, is now found in the unavoidable abrasions of ordinary life. It is implicated in procrastination, occupational malaise, and listless attachments. It is the reason we are “bad at relationships”; it is why we nap too much; it is the antecedent to our compulsive binging of Friends.As a result, trauma has been rendered meaningless. Or as psychiatrist Arash Javanbakht told me: “When everything is trauma, nothing is.”View image in fullscreenWhen trauma expanded beyond catastropheWriting on the subject inHarper’s, the British writer Will Self offered: “A concept is a useful tool for hacking edges into the chaos.” Trauma has proved a most useful tool for all the explanatory work we now foist upon it.Born from the nightmares and flashbacks of combat veterans, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was inaugurated as a diagnosis in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. Initially conceived as a debilitating response to stressors occurring outside the range of normal human experience, it was soon expanded by clinicians who contended thattraumatic memories were distinct from ordinary memories in the ways they are encoded, stored and experienced. If unresolved, they could linger on.In 1994, the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk published apaperon memory and the psychobiology of post-traumatic stress, which would become the foundation for his 2014 bestsellerThe Body Keeps the Score. The book argued that traumatic memories are often not explicit. Instead, they can sit outside conscious memory and lodge instead in the body’s sensory systems, in our limbs and viscera.Imagine someone who was screamed at as a child. Years later, even though they rationally know themself to be safe, their body reacts automatically to an elevated voice: their muscles clench, their heartbeat elevates, their stomach knots. The early traumatic experience shows up later as a reflexive physiologic response, triggered long after the initial danger has passed.His work dovetailed with that of Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman, whose 1992Trauma and Recoveryknit together previously siloed threads of trauma research. She demonstrated that whether trauma was the result of combat, sexual or domestic violence, or political terror, its impact on the individual followed a recognizable pattern. These wounds were deepened, she argued, not only by the violation but also what came after – and the ways society tends to deny, distort and suppress the realities of trauma.Think, for instance, of a woman assaulted by someone in a position of authority. If she comes forward she may be met with disbelief, blame or even intimidation because her experience confronts the dynamics that allow such abuse to occur.Herman’s work on chronic interpersonal trauma, such as domestic violence – as distinct from single-incident trauma – helped lay some of the theoretical groundwork for van der Kolk, who has researched the ways trauma dysregulates the nervous system, distorts memory, and fractures social connection.The common template for virtually all afflictions – mental illness, physical disease – is in fact traumaGabor MatéWhile van der Kolk’s theories are now treated as gospel – especially among lay readers— they were initially met with skepticism by his peers (and have since attractedsustained criticism). He went on to champion an expanded diagnosis of developmental trauma disorder, suggesting that early harms did not just represent a psychological injury, but became part of the architecture of the self. However, his efforts to include this in the DSM were not successful.When we spoke, van der Kolk described the dismissal with which his early work was met. “When you croak, no one is going to talk about trauma,” he recalls being told. But in his view, even that resistance was evidence of trauma’s implicating sweep. To not recognize the enormity of trauma, he told me, “is really a reluctance to come to terms with your own pain inside yourself”.Today, the pendulum has swung wildly in the other direction. According to PsychNet, the American Psychiatric Association’s scholarly literaturedatabase, the term “trauma” appeared less than 3,000 times between 1980 and 1990, compared to more than 66,000 times between 2015 and 2025. Added to the zeitgeist are the harms of vicarious trauma, secondary trauma, intergenerational trauma, epigenetic trauma, ecological trauma, attachment trauma and, of course, trauma-informed everything.Even van der Kolk concedes the paradox this profusion creates: trauma, he says, is both “an extraordinary event” and “extremely common, so unextraordinary”.Part of this surging interest makes sense given our recent past. We have reckoned with #MeToo, and the terrorizing dynamics that led toBlack Lives Matter. We have been grasping at the contours of our loneliness, amplified during the height of Covid, and gasping at the many ways society fails us all – men, women and children: no one is spared.Nonetheless, the consequences are framed as both lasting and sweeping. Trauma, it is theorized, now lurks as the hidden germ of heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disorders, substance abuse and run-amok anxiety.“The common template for virtually all afflictions – mental illness, physical disease – is in fact trauma,” Matépronouncedin 2021. In his bestselling books on subjects as diverse as ADD, addiction, and how toxic social values have turned the very idea of “normal” into a pathological state, Maté expands on this view: pervasive ills signal not just mounting individual distress, but the failure of systems that have stripped us of the ability to connect and cope.View image in fullscreenPain is part of life, but so is resilienceThe majority of Americanshaveexperienced an event that falls within psychiatry’s parameters of trauma, said Javanbakht, who directs the Stress, Trauma and Anxiety Research Clinic at Wayne State University school of medicine. “We’re talking about assault, robbery, rape, shootings, war exposures, serious motor vehicle accidents, life threatening illnesses.”And yet, this widespread exposure does not necessarily translate into lasting debility. The lifetimeprevalenceof PTSD among American adults hovers just below 7%. In his bookAfraid,Javanbakht describes working with refugees, survivors of torture and first responders – and notes that in such populations, the rates climb much higher. “But on an average,” he said, “in a not horribly war-exposed population, even when trauma occurs, it doesn’t mean you’re broken.”After 9/11, professionals anticipated widespread psychological fallout in New York and resources and providers flooded the city. Fema provided more than $150m in grants for crisis counseling and programs meant to alleviate distress. But the wave of need never came, said clinical psychologist George Bonanno, who runs the Loss, Trauma, and Emotion Lab at Teachers College at Columbia University. “Hardly anybody wanted it,” he said. For Bonanno, this instance offers a prime example of the way we tend to vastly overestimate PTSD at the expense of appreciating our innate capacity to recover.What we lose when we surrender care to algorithms | Eric ReinhartRead more“PTSD is what happens when traumatic stress doesn’t go away, when it festers and expands and eventually stabilizes into a more enduring state of distress,” Bonanno writes in his book,The End of Trauma. But events themselves are poor predictors of their emotional aftermath. Both trauma and PTSD are “dynamic states with fuzzy boundaries that unfold and change over time”.Bonanno has spent decades researching the other side of trauma: the fact that most people, even after enduring violence or disaster, will recover on their own with time. While resilience is equally hard to predict, we trend on average in being expert in our healing. If we were all stewards of buried trauma, acquired in our lives or passed through the generations, “we wouldn’t even be here,” said Bonanno. “We would just be the most helpless race of beings on Earth.”The more interesting question, according to van der Kolk, is what propels survival. For the person who has been abused or subjected to horrors, what is most intriguing is the ability to surmount and continue.“That’s really what keeps me going in this field,” he said, “when I get to know what happened to people. Oh my God, you’re still here. You haven’t killed yourself. You’re trying to be a good person.”View image in fullscreen‘If you follow me, you’ll be saved’For van der Kolk, trauma becomes problematic “when it becomes your identity or your alibi”. But in today’s popular culture, it is often framed as exactly that: both the wound that defines us, and the map promising our way back.Once cloaked in shame, trauma has shifted from “stigmatizing to romanticizing”, Javanbakht said. It is the modern hero’s journey, facilitated by a booming marketplace and algorithms that reward the recitation of our misery.In our secular age, the excavating of our pain for public consumption has replaced the descent into the underworld and the voyages of peril and bravery. The hero is not Odysseus or Orpheus, but the survivor who finds courage to tell their tale, and what was once tragedy has become a product.“They sell these tragedies,” said psychotherapist Antonieta Contreras of the proliferating options pandering to our pain. “They are selling everything as trauma. ‘You are broken and if you follow me, you’ll be saved.’”The promise is always the same: we can be healed, we can triumph, we can transcend.We tend to elevate people who’ve suffered at someone else’s handsNicholas HaslamTrauma has become a form of cultural currency that risks pathologizing every day experience and confers an identity that is “virtuous but impotent”,writespsychologist Nicholas Haslam of the University of Melbourne. Trauma is, by definition, something external – a rupture that tears through what we imagine to be an otherwise continuous life. Because of that, Haslam told me, it can serve a psychological function by giving meaning to feelings of distress, stuckness and the confusion we all feel in life.Moreover, he said, it suggests a badge of honor: “We tend to elevate people who’ve suffered at someone else’s hands.”When I asked Bonanno why he thinks people cling to self-imposed labels of trauma, he admitted to a cynical outlook. “I think it’s an excuse,” he told me. “It takes away our personal agency and it also removes responsibility. It’s not me. I wastraumatised. That’s why I’m behaving this way.”Contreras sees in this trend a certain level of entitlement, in which the individual, through publicly confessing their story, in effect inures themself from any criticism. It offers the stamp of validation, while also providing “an easy way out of how difficult life has become”.The vision of trauma as expressed by Maté and othersisdeeply appealing. By flaunting the label, one becomes blameless. I am acting brutishly, recklessly, selfishly not because of some characterologic flaw, but on account of subterranean pains that dictate my actions. This view is what Javanbakht describes as a “secondary gain” of trauma self-labeling.We are meaning-making creatures, he said, we default to narrative explanations to give order to our lives. Trauma offers a way to rationalize “the things that are bothering us and sometimes give us an excuse for lack of functioning”.‘Pain is the way the world is designed’There is a paradox influencers and their followers rarely foresee: the tighter one clings to the wound, the narrower life becomes. Indeed, researchsuggeststhat labeling distress as a mental health problem gives rise to a genuine increase in symptoms. The label itself becomes destructive.While talking more openly about our private hurts has raised awareness of mental wellbeing, it hasn’t made us healthier. Instead, as Contreras told me, it deepens our sense of defeat. That is not to say the pain is unwarranted, she said – especially for younger generations coping with digital displacement, environmental decline, strained social ties, and the collapse of structures that once suggested some kind of upward path.“People think it’s trauma,” she said, “But no, it’s pain, and pain is the way the world is designed.”Trauma has become the privileged idiom through which individual and collective suffering is expressedDidier Fassin and Richard RechtmanAnother unintended consequence: as trauma saturates our culture, those most harmed are eclipsed by those who are most prolific. Online performances of distress, Javanbakht argues, risk trivializing the suffering of people who have endured truly debilitating harm.He pointed out: “How many survivors of torture, how many refugees, how many veterans, how many firefighters, how many people coming from extreme poverty have you seen on TikTok or social media talking about their trauma?”Rather, he observed, we hear from those who have “the time and the resources and the sense that I am important enough to share my glorious trauma with others”. The privileged get platformed and access to therapeutic resources, while systemic suffering is shunted further into the margins.Javanbakht’s comments track with observations from the social sciences. In their pointed critique,The Empire of Trauma, anthropologist Didier Fassin and psychiatrist Richard Rechtman argue that trauma has moved beyond a medical or psychological diagnosis to become a moral and political category.“Trauma,” they write, “has become the privileged idiom through which individual and collective suffering is expressed, acknowledged, and governed.” As a moral category, it determines who deserves both resources and compassion. To be recognized as traumatized is to claim a ticket to legitimacy.If the badge of trauma is ultimately more injurious than palliative, Javanbakht suggests we cease brandishing it.“Your freedom” – to choose, to process, to make meaning, to resist – “is the most important thing you have,” he said. “I tell my patients, you live just once. And every minute that is gone is gone and will not come back.”"

None of them ended well.View image in fullscreenThe world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, with at least 40 fighter jets on its deck, off the coast of Saint Thomas, US Virgin Islands.

What the hell are we getting ourselves into?’”The Venezuelan politicians battling to end Maduro’s 12-year rule reject claims that his downfall would inevitably thrust their country into a maelstrom of bloodshed and retribution.María Corina Machado – the Nobel laureate and leader of the political movement widely believed to have beaten Maduro in last year’s presidential election – called claims Maduro’s exit could plunge Venezuela into violence similar to Syria’s civil war “utterly unfounded”.View image in fullscreenA rally of the Bolivarian national militia in support of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, amid rising tensions with the United States.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/Reuters“Venezuela is a country with a long democratic culture and a society that is set on recovering that democracy,” she told the Guardian in Oslo on Friday after slipping out of her country to receive the peace prize.Miguel Pizarro, another opposition leader, dismissed the suggestion Venezuela was doomed to become a South American version of Iraq, Libya or Haiti if Maduro was toppled. “The truth is that Venezuelans took their decision [in last year’s election] … it was Venezuela’s greatest ever social consensus.”Allies of Donald Trump – who has spent recent monthsratcheting up the pressure on Maduro with a massive military deployment, deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbeanand the seizure of an oil tanker – also play down the dangers of a possible US intervention.US attack on Venezuela risks ‘Vietnam-style’ regional conflict, warns Lula adviserRead moreBut many experts and South American diplomats are sceptical things will go so smoothly – irrespective of how Maduro’s deposition comes about.“If there’s a popular uprising, the military is probably gonna be very defensive, very violent and reactionary to the protests on the street. [You’ll have] a lot of people dead,” warned Farah, who thought, in that scenario, it was possible Colombian guerrillas, including the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) might enter the fray on the side of Venezuela’s nominally leftwing regime.View image in fullscreenNobel peace prize laureate and Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado speaking in Oslo, Norway, on 11 December.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersA coup had the potential to produce “ahuge vacuum of power”with rival armed actors battling to fill Maduro’s shoes. “You might have four different folks saying: ‘OK, now I’m in charge,’” Farah said.If foreign troops were deployed, they would probably be able to take control of big cities and infrastructure such as ports and airports. But they faced the possibility of asymmetric attacks from government loyalists or Colombian rebels and a protracted battle to regain control of gold mining regionsalready under the influence of the ELN. “[Defeating them is] a long-term proposition that would require a lot of money, a lot troops and probably some casualties,”Farah said.Whatever happened, Farah feared post-Maduro Venezuela was likely to suffer “a huge mess that would last a while”. “None of this [is] going to be resolved in three weeks. You’re talking years.”Farah is not the only observer who frets that sudden political change could have dire consequences for the oil-rich South American country.Last week the chief foreign policy adviser to Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, warned upheaval in Venezuela could transform the region intoa Vietnam-style “war zone”.Juan González, the White House’s top Latin America official under Joe Biden, also said he feared the potential for violent retaliation.“I have this recurring dream about Venezuela … of Maduro getting dragged through the streets like Benito Mussolini,” González said of the Italian dictator who was captured while trying to flee to Switzerland in 1945 and shot by a firing squad.“You just never know what the trigger is … [Muammar] Gaddafi was very much in power until he wasn’t,” González added of Libya’s former leader, who also met a grisly end after being captured by his enemies.González hoped a negotiated solution could still be found despite the escalating tensions.‘Transition is irreversible’: María Corina Machado says not too late for Maduro’s peaceful handoverRead more“Negotiations are long and hard fought and require compromise. But history shows us that they’re the most effective way to actually promote a transition,” he said, warning that toppling Maduro didn’t necessarily mean the situation would improve. “It could actually get worse,” he said, pondering what might happen if a regime hardliner such as interior minister Diosdado Cabello, who runs Venezuela’s repressive security forces, succeeded Maduro.Farah thought a temporary power-sharing deal might be one way to avoid the “massive fracturing” of Venezuela between rival factions. But for that to happen, difficult choices would have to be made, possibly including letting “massive human rights violators” off the hook and giving Maduro safe passage out of the country and some form of immunity for alleged crimes against humanity.An indication that the opposition might accept some such compromises came last week when the Washington Postreportedthat Machado’s opposition believed only a “‘limited’ purge of top Maduro officials would be necessary” once he was gone.But many of the alternatives were even uglier. If the security situation spiralled out of control post-Maduro, Farah feared Washington’s temptation might be to engage mercenary groups and private military contractors, rather than put US boots on the ground.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators scuffle with security forces during an opposition rally in Caracas in 2017.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/Reuters“[That] gets you closer to an Iraqi-type scenario, where you have multiple non-state groups doing multiple things on the ground that no one has control over,” Farah warned.“If things go south, that’s one of the options they will look at,” he predicted, “and that would be very damaging”.Additional reporting by Camille Rodríguez Montilla in OsloExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasMaría Corina MachadofeaturesShareReuse this content"

This travelogue, in which Ant and Dec send him to South Korea to overcome  phobias – including nudity – is strangely charmingLucy ManganSun 14 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTShareWhat can I tell you about Stephen Mulhern? He’s an ITV presenter (Dancing on Ice, Deal or No Deal, You Bet), magician, longtime friend ofAnt and Dec, he’s never had hummus or tasted a prawn, and he’s only recently been introduced to ham. “I like what I like,” he says simply, when Ant (or Dec – I never did have them straight in my mind and it’s honestly too late to start now) asks him how it is possible to have avoided ham for 47 years.“He’s odd,” says Dec (maybe – see above) fondly. “He’s an odd man.” “Sheltered,” supplements Ant. “Set in his ways.”In fact, as rapidly becomes clear, it is something deeper than that. Stephen is not stubborn, narrow-minded or, in his aversion to travel, xenophobic. He is phobic in the true sense of the word: irrationally frightened of certain things. “I’m frightened of food, I’m scared of strange places, I’ve got a fear of heights and I’m terrified of the sea.” A friend of his, he tells Ant and Dec, went bungee jumping “and two weeks later all his hair fell out”. In life, you cannot, Mulhern feels, be too careful. He loves swimming, but only in a pool, where the water is clean and you can see that there is nothing coming to grab your feet. There is obviously some germ phobia in the mix, too – he is horrified by the idea of people double-dipping their crisps in a … well, dip (“You’ve swapped bodily fluids”) – and nor does he like needles, being naked or hearing people chew. Many, if not all of which, most of us will entirely understand, but his antipathies exist at extremes. He wants things to be different. “I find my phobias so frustrating,” he says.View image in fullscreenMulhern overcomes his fear of swimming in open water with the help of professional divers.Photograph: ITVThe premise of Accidental Tourist is that Ant and Dec are sending their pal off on a trip to Korea (a place, of course, that Stephen has never been nor dreamed of going to) to face all his fears and, hopefully, overcome them. “I hope it’s a different Stephen coming back,” Mulhern says. He imagines his dad, who died very recently, hearing about his plans. “He wouldn’t believe it. I hope he’d be proud.” The tears come, and again when he reads a letter from his mum, Holly, when he’s alone in his Korean bedroom, encouraging him to be brave and assuring him of his parents’ love for him.It remains, in essence, Christmas schedule filler, but there is an unusual degree of emotional authenticity that marks Accidental Tourist out (from the seasonal schedule and from the customary herd of travelogues and minor-celebrities-overcoming-adversity documentaries.) Yes, it’s funny. Mulhern’s vibe is very much Karl Pilkington with insight, and Ant and Dec collapse laughing at his semi-inadvertent bon mots, revelations (“And then the duck came outwith its beak on!”) and genuine horror at what most of us consider to be normal life events (like … hummus. Or ham). But they also clearly adore him, and he clearly wants to change and use this opportunity to try to do so.They send Mulhern to a Korean fish market first, accompanied by Leeby, a mukbang video star. No, I didn’t know either, but it’s the practice of consuming food, often in large amounts and accompanied by amplified chewing sounds online for an avid audience. I haven’t gone much further in my research because I very quickly got the feeling that I would prefer not to know much more about the particular interests that make up the audience, but I hope Leeby is enjoying working in her chosen field and that she keeps her home address very secret.Anyway. The man who will not eat prawns is soon trapped in a world of octopuses, sea snails and penis fish. We see them. They are aptly named. I’m definitely not doing any more research there. Mulhern, God love him, tries them all. His body convulses but he succeeds. It is indeed a proud moment.Thereafter, he confronts the rest of his fears in quick succession. He gets naked in a sauna, has acupuncture, crosses a mountain bridge to a spiritual healer, and goes into the sea – he only just manages this one – with a group of free divers. He recounts it all for Ant and Dec over teriyaki chicken (“I’m going to try it!”) in a Korean restaurant back in the UK. His unfiltered gratitude and happiness is properly touching. “It’s been more than I could ever have wished for. To do something and change a pattern in your life is a big deal.” He is right, and you rarely hear it said so simply or in tones so heartfelt.Accidental Tourist was originally intended to be a series. I hope it doesn’t become one. I hope it’s left like this. An unexpectedly lovely one-off, instead of a conceit stretched past all meaning and soon corrupted.Accidental Tourist aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewAnt and DecreviewsShareReuse this content"

And that famously fantastically convoluted narrative is presented clearly enough for everyone to understand (recommended age is five-plus, and it’s delightful for grownups too).View image in fullscreenFlute magic … Pamina, Tamino and the Queen of the Night.Photograph: Jane HobsonPapageno the bird catcher is played with bags of personality by the brilliant Nathan Bartman, he’s cheeky and big-hearted with more than enough warm energy to fill the stage. Prince Tamino (Jacob Lang) is his more earnest foil, and the choreography sends them both in easy arcs, lilting and circling across the stage as they set off to find Princess Pamina (Faith Prendergast). Multitalented soprano Donna Lennard, meanwhile, swaps between roles, as comfortable landing the leaping notes of the Queen of the Night’s famous Der Hölle Rache aria, as she is dancing or making winking asides to the audience.The four are like a group of travelling players – Dick Bird’s set, featuring a wooden stage within a stage, adds to this feeling – and there’s something pleasingly DIY about some of the props, like the glowing-eyed monster that chases Tamino. But there’s also clever use of video, designed by Douglas Baker, with a shadow-puppet feel, both stylish and smart storytelling. There’s also a touch of the surreal in, for example, the three spirits with round white balloons for heads and wobbling dance steps. The score, by Frank Moon (well known to dance audiences for his work with Arthur Pita) similarly mixes the homespun and the high-flown, with Mozart woven into his own mysterious and melodious music.Choreographer/directorLuca Silvestrinifounded Protein in 1997 and has made dance-theatre about everything from our love of food to the migrant experience, always with humour and heart. The Magic Flute is his second family show, after 2018’s The Little Prince, and you feel you are in completely safe hands, both with Silvestrini and the cast, their skill worn lightly in this gently upbeat production that’s completely charming.AtDanceEast, Ipswich, until 14 December; then atthe Place, London, 17-24 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDanceChildren's theatreOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She was a figurehead to me’The Nip/Tuck and Downton Abbey star on losing her sister, growing up in a theatrical dynasty, and how she feels about ageingHarriet GibsoneSun 14 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 17.51 ESTShareJoely Richardson in 1970 and 2025Joely Richardson in 1970 and 2025. Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Katrin Rees. Archive photograph: courtesy of Joely RichardsonBorn in London in 1965, Joely Richardson is an actor and campaigner. The daughter of actorVanessa Redgraveand director and producer Tony Richardson, she trained at Rada, and rose to prominence with roles in 101 Dalmatians, Nip/Tuck and The Tudors, as well as in theatre and on Broadway. More recently, she appeared in Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen, and Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. Richardson is working for Save the Children’s annual festive fundraiser, Christmas Jumper Day, and also backing the charity’s new Christmas campaign.I remember this as a happy day, but my eyes tell a different story. They look a little mistrustful. In my arms is my brother Carlo – we have different fathers; his is Italian actor Franco Nero. That day was Carlo’s christening, and it was obvious from my hand position that I’m not used to standing like that. Someone’s gone: “Put your arms out! We’re taking a picture of you holding the baby!” The whole thing looks awkward.Before the ceremony, I’d gone down to the Italian version of the local Woolworths to pick out an outfit. I didn’t usually wear dresses – I was more of a tomboy – so this felt like a special occasion. The only other time I’d worn anything fancy was as an extra in one of my father’s films, The Charge of the Light Brigade, but because my hair was cropped short, they put me in a strange little pageboy outfit. As a result, I was thrilled to wear this frilly nylon dress, even if I do look shy and ill at ease in it.When I became a teenager, my form of rebellion was sports – I wanted to do anything but act professionallyGrowing up, I was always mischievous and naughty – running around, putting on plays, inventing characters. I lived in a completely creative environment. The culture of fame wasn’t as intense as it is now, so there was no consciousness of coming from “a theatrical dynasty” or having well-known parents. Absolutely nobody was talking about sponsorship or paparazzi. Instead, there was a lot of reading books, talking about films and going to see plays.My mother and father were away working a lot, so Carlo and my sister Natasha and I were very domestic together. Because of my parents’ work, I didn’t feel that I always had that person to look after me, other than Natasha. But along the way I found other role models: teachers, friends, mentors, people to guide you through the dark.When I became a teenager, my form of rebellion was sports. I wanted to do anything but act professionally. In the end, going on stage became my comfort, my outlet. I started to come out of my shell by doing school plays and I liked to step into an alter ego; the terror melted away as soon as I pretended to be someone else. I’ve always gotten nervous before speaking or performing, but over the years that shyness has faded. I think it’s because I’ve always loved people, and over time my curiosity about them pulls me out of my own head. I suppose confidence is like slowly chiselling away at fear until one day you realise it’s gone.As for partying, I never had any money in my younger years, so I wasn’t going clubbing and I wasn’t ever rock’n’roll. Because of my family, there was an element of myth that followed me around, and people assumed I would be rich. The reality was very different. I remember people being shocked when they came to visit me at Mum’s house: “Wait, this is just a two-up, two-down. We thought you’d live in a mansion with a swimming pool.” Mum didn’t have any money; and if she did, she’d give it away to causes. Over time, we moved from that house to a smaller house, then a flat. There was always a feeling of things crumbling around us. As a result, I knew I wanted a nice house as soon as I could afford one.Being in Nip/Tuck was an exciting time. We were still filming the first season when it started airing, so I could be walking down the street – which no one does in LA, but I did because I’m English – and people would stop me and say: “And when he did that! And when you did that!” Seeing people so caught up in the story while we were still making it was incredibly rewarding.Now that I am 60, I definitely feel more free, but there is a growing realisation that time is a limited commodityThe popularity of the show wasn’t difficult to adjust to, as I’d experienced some recognition from various projects in my 20s. But I did notice a shift after Maybe Baby, a film I did in 2000 with Hugh Laurie and Ben Elton. For the premiere, I wore a backless gold dress. Before the 00s, you could turn up in a pair of old jeans to a premiere and nobody would blink an eye. I hadn’t expected my dress to become a “moment”. After that, the It-girl label started to get used when I was being written about. I found it very odd. But it wasn’t about me. It was about a dress, and a moment of change in the industry. The business of brand deals and journalists asking “What are you wearing” on the red carpet was just emerging.AfterNatasha died[in 2009, from a brain injury after a skiing accident], I spent a lot of time in New York, where her boys were living. It was completely life-changing. I hadn’t lived a day without her and she was a figurehead for me, as well as being my sister. When a tragedy like that happens and there are children to think about, everything’s blown to pieces and then it has to come back together again quickly. A dynamic has shifted and a massive regroup takes place, which went on for a few years. It was so long ago that now life after her death has become the norm. Which is probably why I post old photos of her online so much.When it comes to ageing, the buildup for women is quite discombobulating, but the minute you’re over 50, you realise it’s fine. There is nothing to be scared of. Now that I am 60, I definitely feel more free, but there is a growing realisation that time is a limited commodity and I want to make sure I spend it wisely.Actor Dylan Llewellyn looks back: ‘I warned Mum that Big Boys was a bit raw. Thankfully she never commented on the glory hole scene’Read moreIn many ways, I have never loved my job more than now. The truth is, I don’t have to retire. I can keep working for ever. Of course, the parts are going to be different; sometimes as an older woman you can feel marginalised as there are only a limited number of great roles. But I felt that more in the UK than anywhere else. It was really hard to break back into the English market after I turned 50. I would get offered work all over the world, but just never in my own country. I had to start with tiny roles: a little bit here, a little bit there – anything that would just help me get a foot in the door. Then it gradually started to pick up again.I always say to my friends and loved ones, if it was all over tomorrow, I’d be OK because I’ve had a great life – despite all the heartbreaks, despite the moments that I literally had to peel myself off the floor and had no idea how to cope. So much so, I feel for the version of me in this photo. When I think of that strange little girl, I want to tell her that I know it will be OK: you will always find the strength to walk through it all.Explore more on these topicsJoely RichardsonFlashbackFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was perpetually crowded and would always be standing room only by the time I got on.One particular morning, I was feeling quite nauseous as the bus swayed around each corner. I kept telling myself to hold on another few kilometres until the bus got to my stop, and then I could make a mad dash for the nearest public toilet to throw up.We were coming down the street towards the stop when I realised I wasn’t going to make it. All of a sudden, it was like a veil came over me. Everything just went white and really quiet; like someone had cut the sound. I thought, “I’m going to faint”.Luckily I was near the front of the bus, so I took a couple of steps forward and asked the driver to stop, telling him I was going to be sick. He opened the doors and I stumbled out on to the pavement.The kindness of strangers: a concierge gave me his mother’s opera ticketRead moreI was determined not to vomit in front of six lanes of traffic, so I picked myself up and started trying to walk to the park across the road, where I thought I’d at least be able to discreetly hide behind a bush to throw up. But then I must have blacked out. I could feel my body but I couldn’t walk or see properly, so I started crawling towards the park.At that moment, I got scooped up. I felt an arm around my waist and heard a man say, “You right, love?” I told this mysterious stranger that I needed to be sick. So he virtually carried me down into a nearby building and put me in the ladies’ toilets. He asked me if I needed him to stay with me but I said no.A few minutes later I had recovered enough to sit on the toilet and from outside the door I heard him ask, “Are you OK, love? Do you need anything?” I wasn’t able to get up just then but did manage to say thank you and after a few more minutes recovered the use of my legs. I got myself home and spent the next few days recovering from what turned out to be a nasty tummy bug.I never saw that man’s face – only his legs and the big steelwork tools container he was carrying – but he saved me, when I was at my most vulnerable.Often this world can make you defensive, aggressive and competitive. His was the sort of gesture that undoes that hardening of the heart. He was proof that people’s natural inclination is towards kindness, something I love about my fellow humans.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

That must changeSun 14 Dec 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 20.17 ESTShareLike all Australians, Bondi isn’t just a place to me, it lives in my heart as a symbol of who we are. As a child I spent many Sundays on the beach at North Bondi life-savers as a “nipper”, and as a former mayor of Waverley council and a local councillor for more than a decade, I have walked its concrete ramparts thousands of times, in all its seasons.In a few weeks, visitors from every corner of the globe will gather there to celebrate Christmas. For locals, it is a place of peace and play. For the small Jewish community, it is also a place where festivals are marked openly and proudly.‘It was a massacre’: how antisemitic terror exploded the peaceful idyll of Bondi beachRead moreSunday night was the first night we celebrated Hanukah (think of it as Jewish Christmas). Over the years, in my official role, I attended many Hanukah ceremonies. They were always occasions of light, joy and belonging. That is why these murders have been so shocking to the peace-loving citizens of Bondi, and especially to the Jewish community.We are a small community. I know some of those who were murdered and injured. This is not an abstract tragedy for us; it is profoundly personal. My heart breaks for the victims, their loved ones, and for all those who experienced the trauma of this act of terrorism. At the same time, I am in awe of the extraordinary heroism of those who stepped forward, at great personal risk, to defend innocent congregants and bystanders.What compounds the grief is fear. In recent years, Jewish people in Australia have felt threatened, dismissed, alienated and, at times, openly vilified. There is a temptation to explain away or qualify this by reference to political differences or debates about events in the Middle East. But that misses the point. Every Jew is not responsible for every decision made by the Israeli government. The right to live free from fear in Australia should not depend on a person’s politics, their views on the Middle East, or their religion.‘We stand with you’: Jewish leaders around world respond to Bondi beach attackRead moreOver the past two and a half years, some groups have deliberately travelled to events in the city, Bondi and the Eastern Suburbs to intimidate the local Jewish community, often with little public condemnation. At protest marches, chants calling for violence against Jews have been heard, reinforcing the message, whether intended or not, that Jewish people are fair game. When racial and religious hatred is left unaddressed and intimidation is tolerated, it creates an environment that emboldens the worst elements of society and leaves Jewish people feeling diminished. Each of us has a responsibility to speak up, and all Australians must come together now to support those of us living in fear.This is not a demand for special treatment. It is a call for basic decency, equal concern and the simple acknowledgement that Jewish Australians are entitled to live without fear, in the same way as any other community.George Newhouse is a human rights lawyer and former mayor of Waverley council in Sydney.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

I’d rather be deportedEmma BeddingtonThe potential demand that visitors to the US hand over their social media records, or even their phones, opens up a world of embarrassmentSun 14 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 14.35 ESTShareAs someone with a child in the US, thisnew Trump threat to scrutinise tourists’ social mediais concerning. Providing my user name would be OK – the authorities would get sick of scrolling through chicken pics before they found anything critical of their Glorious Leader – but what if I have tohand over my phone at the border, as has happened to some travellers already? I would rather get deported.There’s nothing criminal or egregiously immoral on there; I don’t foment revolution or indulge in Trump trolling, tempting as that would be. But my phone does not paint a flattering picture of me. Does anyone’s? Those shiny black rectangles have become contemporary confessionals, and we would like to believe they abide by the same kind of confidentiality rules.There’s ajokey online trendof people posting pictures of themselves weeping, with the caption that their partner checked their phone for infidelity, but found “something much worse” – the next image reveals it’s the calculator app, used for infant-level arithmetic (15-9 say, or 300 x 2). Occasionally, it’s a daft Google search (“quickest way to make money” “how to stop being batshit crazy”) or simplya million open tabs full of weirdness.And this is just stuff that people will admit to (or pretend; some of those sums have to be a joke). What about the rest? In the comments under photographs and videos, women express horror at imagining their ChatGPT prompts orNotes appbeing scrutinised (“I have a note that says ‘If husband cheats, release the crickets,’ and I do NOT want him to question me about it,” one says, which particularly piqued my interest).A cursory swipe would reveal I’ll stare at any number of fit youths slopping yoghurt into bowls to hit their protein goalsAlmost every app on my phone has embarrassing content, even seemingly innocuous ones. My calculator reveals a recent tussle with 16 x 3 and my calendar contains reminders that no functional adult should need. “Check big pears” is arguably reasonable – we all know pears have a five-second window of edibility – but there’s stuff like “Drink water”, “Stand up!” (relics of abandoned attempts at wellness) and “DEODORANT!” – a recent and essential addition after many sweaty days forgetting. YouTube is all videos about the phallic-looking Korean skincare gadget I bought in a moment of self-loathing, but am too scared to use; photos contains selfies that must be destroyed with fire and Netflix reveals that I only watch Manhattan property agents with faces smooth as eggs and five-inch spike heels fighting over luxury beige penthouses.It gets worse: imagining anyone seeing my TikTok “For You” page (where the algorithm offers up what you’ve shown a moment’s interest in, or predicts you’ll like), is unbearable. A cursory swipe would reveal I’ll stare at any number of fit youths slopping yoghurt into bowls to hit their protein goals,have a morbid fear of “overactive traps” (it’s a weightlifting thing) and harbour the delusion that I can learn to do a handstand when I gave up gymnastics aged eight. It’s not a version of myself fit for public consumption.Ready to give up social media? ‘Advice pollution’ might just get you there | Emma BeddingtonRead moreMy phone enabled me to become this idiotic, and now it holds its secrets over me, lurking ominously beyond the lockscreen. I’m certain everyone feels similarly, but it’s hard to prove because no one wants to share what’s in their rectangle of shame. I elicited enough anonymous admissions, though – a daily step count of 60, a food diary that’s exclusively chocolate, photos of facial buboes, pelvic floor exercise prompts – to know none of us would be cool with our phones facing public scrutiny.Yet we’re leaving our vanities and vulnerabilities, our big and little secrets, our precious data, in the hands of tech companies, and that could lead to worse than embarrassment, especially for women. In 2022,a study suggestedthe majority of period-tracker apps share data with third parties;Facebook has disclosed private messagesto assist an abortion prosecution; this year,the UK National Police Chiefs’ Council issued guidanceon searching women’s phones after pregnancy loss.Even my foggy brain, full of shoulder mobility “hacks” and Taylor Swift dance routines, can see that that’s bad. Given that I need digital reminders for basic acts of personal hygiene, I can’t realistically commit to an intellectually rigorous, entirely offline life. But as a bare minimum, in 2026, I’ve resolved to put my darkest, weirdest, worst thoughts on paper.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrivacyOpinionDonald TrumpSocial mediaAppsSmartphonesInternetDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

After last week’s disappointingOctober growth figures, the jobs market and consumer prices data due out on Tuesday and Wednesday – before the rates decision – are expected to confirm that inflationary pressures in the UK economy are fading.But while a cut will be good news for businesses, mortgage borrowers and the beleaguered occupants of Downing Street, attention will quickly shift to the prospects for 2026. How many more times could the central bank come to the chancellor’s rescue? Here things are a bit more complicated.View image in fullscreenReeves’s increase in employer national insurance contributions has played a part in unemployment hitting its highest level since 2021.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThat Britain’s economy is in the doldrums should hardly come as a surprise. Continual tax speculation hassapped business confidence and household spending, while Reeves’s increase in employer national insurance contributions has played a part in UKunemploymenthitting the highest levels since 2021, during the height of the Covid pandemic.Celebrating a rate cut, in this context, is akin to an arsonist cheering the arrival of the fire brigade.There are, though, factors beyond Reeves’s control. Not least the dire state Britain’s economy was left in by the Conservative party, and Donald Trump’s damaging tariff war.The Bank has also played a role. Borrowers have been singed by three years of punitively high interest rates set in deeply restrictive territory. The policy is the central banker’s main tool for combating inflation as it chokes off demand by incentivising saving and discouraging spending.After the inflation shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Threadneedle Street argues it had little choice but to act. But the growth trade-off is clear. Even after successive rate cuts, the Bank’s ownanalysisshows the base rate continues to subtract about 2% from the level of GDP.Bank rate chartAnyone who has remortgaged their home since 2022 knows this first-hand. And despite progress since the Liz Truss debacle, millions of borrowers still face substantially higher loan repayments – and will continue to do so for years to come. That is hardly going to light a match under the UK’s consumption-driven economy.This week the Bank’s policymakers are expected to be split on the appropriate way forward. Some on the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) recognise the damage rates are doing at a time when inflation is cooling. Others think a tough approach is warranted to snuff out price rises.Andrew Bailey is expected to hold the casting vote. The Bank’s governor hassuggested he thinks inflation is more likely to fall backthan stick at stubbornly high levels – paving the way for a quarter-point cut on Thursday.Next year, however, it is tougher to anticipate how the MPC will respond. Policymakers are likely to remain divided on the inflation outlook and the “neutral” position for rates – the point at which they are neither stoking nor hosing down economic activity.Reeves’s budget measures – including relief on energy bills, fuel duty, rail fares and prescription charges – could support the case for deeper cuts. The Bank predicts the policies could slash headline inflation byup to 0.5 percentage pointsby the middle of 2026.All of this was part of a deliberate strategy inside the Treasury in the hope voters give credit to Labour for lower mortgage costs. Government borrowing costs could also fall back, unpicking some of the factors behind the recent years of fiscal drama in Westminster.However, many economists warn the reprieve could be temporary.Much of the disinflationary impulse will be in energy prices, and do little to help Britain’s issues with sticky service sector inflation. Other areas of government policy could also push in the wrong direction.Business leaders warn a higher minimum wage, business rates, and other tax increases will drive up their costs – resulting in companies putting up prices for their customers, in turn stoking inflation.That said, some of the factors the hawks are betting on look shaky.Business costs are rising but hardly at breakneck speed. At 4.1%, the rise in the minimum wage from April is significantly below that in previous years – particularly when set against the context of 2022, whenJeremy Huntignored misplaced warnings about awage-price spiraland increased the legal pay floor by 9.7% from April 2023.By the time we get to spring, there should be signs that inflation is undershooting, and wage growth is slowing. The economy will probably still be lacking momentum. Household confidence may be picking up, and companies will probably lack the pricing power to push through yet more increases.All of this means Reeves could see more rate cuts from the Bank.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandEconomics viewpointRachel ReevesInterest ratesEconomicsEconomic policyMonetary policy committeeInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

But say you also want to make the world a better place. In that case, maybe the spiritual instruction you need emerges in the famous final lines of George Eliot’s 1871 novel Middlemarch:“… the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”Eliot offers a bracing reality check: the spotlight needn’t be on you for you to live an influential life. A life might be “hidden” – a heresy in the social media era, where everything exists to be shared – yet still well lived. You can shape the course of history, even if you leave little trace on it.This strange idea takes on added significance for me atChristmas. The story of Jesus’s birth is nothing if not “unhistoric” – in the sense of being ignored – even if today we live in the wake of his influence.How can we navigate difficult conversations these holidays? Buddhism offers some guidance | Making sense of itRead moreMaybe it’s cheeky to file Christmas under “unhistoric” when our times pivot on the life of Christ. BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) bear his trace, the latter meaning “the year of the Lord”.But nothing about the birth of Jesus predicted history’s interest in him. He’s born in obscurity on the outskirts of the Roman empire. Angels announce his birth to nobody shepherds. Wise men bring gifts, but it’s a subdued baby shower.Yet from this unhistoric beginning, big things grow. Early Christians reasoned that if God became a baby in Christ, then God, in a sense, shows up in every vulnerable life, and in extremes of distress and suffering (crucifixion, Jesus’s ghastly end, made a point of that). Discussingresearchfor his 2019 novel, Damascus, Christos Tsiolkas glimpsed the staggering implications of this idea:“God is not in the noble Olympian heights. God is not in the palaces. God is actually the man or the woman you step over. That is still revolutionary. That is still hopeful [today].”It’s as though Jesus’ birth also birthed a new way of seeing people. God becoming human enabled people to see how people resembled God. A crazy claim, but it levels the playing field like nothing else. Everyone has dignity. Everyone is regarded as equally valuable.Now, that once incendiary idea feels ordinary. Human rights and the question of human value, we conventionally believe, are a product of the Enlightenment and western reason and have nothing to do with the baby in the manger.The secular mainstream is sometimes shy about Christianity’s influence or (often withgood reason) suspicious of it. No wonder historian Tom Holland felt nervous about publishing his blockbuster 2019 tome, Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind.He knew his was an unpopular thesis: that our belief in the moral equality of all people places us downstream of the Christian revolution. We can’t quite grasp how Jesus made human value unhistoric.Eliot gives us a place to start renewing our attention – by recognising that “the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts”.If nothing else, the line doubles as a fitting description of Christianity’s lasting effect. That it was penned by a woman who shed her Christian faith, but largely retained its ethics, is even more ironic. Whatever you believe, Eliot’s is excellent advice: keep adding to the world’s growing good by small acts. Unhistoric on their own, perhaps, but that still prove generative, spawning possibilities long after.I am left seeking the God who tends to conceal himself in obscure, half-forgotten places: a newborn baby, the rights we claim are universal (but don’t ask why), the neglected moral inheritance of the west. His humility seems surprising, given Christianity’s oftenbrashpublic profile today. Regardless, I see in Christmas an invitation to see differently: God in the social outcast, life on the margins reimagined as the centre of gravity.That way of seeing is the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.Justine Toh is senior research fellow at the Centre for Public ChristianityExplore more on these topicsReligionMaking sense of itChristianityChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

So let me put those carping critics rightRhiannon Lucy CosslettThe artist’s winning Turner prize entry has been hailed for its life and energy, but to some dissenting voices its challenge to the status quo is hard to stomachSun 14 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 06.07 ESTShareNnena Kalu is an artist. She is also, as of this week, awinner of the Turner prize. Her work – twisting ribbon forms made from old VHS tape, plastic and strips of fabric – has been praised for its “finesse of scale, composition and colour” (the judges), its “emphasis … on the visual, tactile and experiential in art” (Mark Hudson, the Independent) and for being “so full of life and energy … so embodied, so sensuous” (Adrian Searle, this newspaper).As well as being an artist, Kalu also happens to be autistic, has a learning disability and does not communicate verbally as much as many neurotypical people (she is supported by the organisation ActionSpace). These things shouldn’t matter, and perhaps one day they won’t. However, neurodivergent artists have not historically been given much space by the art world, especially not those with learning disabilities. Four years ago, when Project Art Works – a collective of neurodivergent artists – was nominated for the prize, its CEO, Kate Adams, recounted to me howshe was told bya museum professional: “I don’t think it’s right [to have] people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn’t be in the same building.”So this prize for Kalu feels like a powerful moment of acceptance. Having a differently wired brain, a communication difference or a learning disability does not preclude someone from being seen, and lauded, as an artist. Does that mean we are finally moving away from the notion of the capital-“A” artist (a white male “genius”, usually), and embracing the word in all its magical diversity? Along with many autistic people, as well as the people who love them, not to mention anyone else with a wider view of “artist” than the parameters it has historically been given, I find myself hoping that the time has finally come that we can appreciate art in all its myriad, complex forms.Alas, as with much of the discourse around disability and autism in Britain and the US, I find myself inevitably disappointed. For all of the praise that has been heaped on Kalu and the hailing of her win as a historic moment, there have also been a number of depressing responses. “Maddening”, the Telegraph whinged. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times art critic Waldemar Januszczak, who had already beenaffronted by Kalu’s nomination(“I left the room wondering who was right: the art critic judging the evidence? Or the Turner judges showing compassion and widening the definition of good art?”),wore his prejudiceon his sleeve in seeming to suggest that the prize was only awarded out of a sense of pity, as opposed to on the merits of the work:“She has one mode. And cruel as it sounds, it is not the job of art to confuse therapy with talent. Nor is it the task of theTurner prizeto play doctors and nurses or involve itself so flagrantly in the collection of medical brownie points.”View image in fullscreenNnena Kalu, centre, is announced as the winner of the 2025 Turner prize.Photograph: James Speakman/PAHow offensive you find this will vary from person to person. Consideringmy family background, I find his words, on a personal level, quite nauseatingly unpleasant. More important, from an academic perspective, I am struck by the paucity of his vision. To Januszczak, the judges are flying in the face of critical authority. They can only be giving this prize for reasons of charity, compassion and virtue signalling (prejudiced assumptions that neurodivergent artists have long fought against). As an arbiter of “good” and “bad” art, Januszczak is “baffled” by the work. As ever with certain art critics, that bafflement never seems to provoke more profound, interesting questions. What are the limits of my own understanding? What has shaped my personal conception of artistic meaning and worth? Why does some people’s idea of art seem to be wider, and more embracing, than my own?As for art as therapy, well: show me an artist who hasn’t made work as a means of survival, a form of emotional processing or a deep exploration of the meaning of existence?Artis a way for us to seek to understand, or to be understood. But it is not only that. It is the manifestation of our inner worlds. That so many seem to struggle with Kalu’s version of that is, to me, very telling. They highlight her repetitive working processes, the involvement of assistants.‘Nnena Kalu was ready for this – nobody else was’: how her Turner prize victory shook the art worldRead moreIt reminds me of an argument I had with my tutor at university, when I said that I had always believed Andy Warhol (talk about using assistants!) to be neurodivergent. There was something about the compulsive, repetitive way in which he worked, I said. My tutor was annoyed, as though “autism” reduced the integrity, or genius, of the work somehow. That wasn’t what I meant at all. All art is the manifestation of a unique brain, and Warhol’s was no exception.One of the things that you learn when you study the history of art – or at least if you’re thinking about it deeply – is that language has limits regarding visual art. I wish more critics could be humble about this problem. If we are to take as our starting point the insufficiency of verbal or written expression with regard to visual art, then our traditional conceptions start to break down. My belief has always been that art is one soul speaking to another. It doesn’t matter whether that soul spoke 16th-century Italian (Michelangelo), or some extinct paleolithic tongue (whoever made the woman of Hohle Fels), uses less language than some others (Kalu), or modern American English (Jackson Pollock, who nonetheless chose to say little about the “rationale” behind his work). All that matters is that my soul hears, or more specifically feels, theirs.And that, right there, is what really makes an artist.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

In addition, Donald Trumpsaid it was seditiousfor Democratic members of Congress to inform members of the military that they can, and indeed, must, resist patently illegal orders, and theFBIandPentagon are reportedly investigating the members’ speech. Those related developments – the murder of civilians and an attack on free speech – exemplify two of Trump’s principal tactics in his second term. The first involves the assertion of extraordinary emergency powers in the absence of any actual emergency. The second seeks to suppress dissent by punishing those who dare to raise their voices. Both moves have been replicated time and time again since January 2025. How courts and the public respond will determine the future of constitutional democracy in the United States.Nothing is more essential to a liberal democracy than the rule of law – that is, the notion that a democratic government is guided by laws, not discretionary whims; that the laws respect basic liberties for all; and that independent courts have the authority to hold political officials accountable when they violate those laws. These principles, forged in the United Kingdom, adopted and revised by the United States, are the bedrock of constitutional democracy. But they depend on courts being willing and able to check government abuse, and citizens exercising their rights to speak out in defense of the fundamental values when those values are under attack.Trump, who evidently prefers “the rule of Trump” to the rule of law, has launched a two-pronged attack on these principles. The campaign against alleged drug smugglers is an example of the first tactic: declare a nonexistent emergency and invoke extraordinary authorities that would be unacceptable in ordinary times. Ordinarily, police can’t simply kill those they think might be distributing drugs; suspects must be arrested, tried and convicted, and even then they can only be sentenced to prison, not executed. (The death penalty is reserved for crimes involving homicide.) But by declaring that the metaphorical war on drugs is an actual “armed conflict”, and declaring that fishers carrying drugs are “narco-terrorists”, Trump has asserted the power to kill in cold blood – premeditated murder without trial.Using the same rationale, Trump hasinvoked a 1798 law, the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the government during a war to detain or deport citizens of the country with which the US is at war. The last time it was used was the second world war, to detain people of Japanese, German and Italian heritage. The US is not at war today. But Trump has asserted that a Venezuelan drug gang few Americans had even heard of, Tren de Aragua, is at war with us, and used that claim todeport more than 1oo Venezuelansto a notorious prison in El Salvador without hearings of any kind – and in defiance of a court order.Emergency powers have long posed a threat to the rule of law. “Necessity knows no law”, after all. But it’s one thing to invoke emergency powers in a real emergency. It’s another to do so in a trumped-up one. What we are seeing today is the latter. And it remains to be seen whether the supreme court will call Trump’s bluff.The second prong of Trump’s strategy is to neutralize the opposition. The rule of law cannot rely on courts alone. It depends as well on citizens standing up and speaking out, through the institutions of civil society – from non-profit advocacy groups like the ACLU to universities, the media and the professions. Trump has systematically targeted them all. He’s issued orderspenalizing law firmsfor filing lawsuits or hiring associates that he doesn’t like. He’spressured universitiesto clamp down on students’ and professors’ speech. He’s penalized press outlets that don’t parrot his messages, as when heexpelled the Associated Pressfrom the Oval Office press pool for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”, Trump’s preferred rebranding. And he’sthreatened to designate non-profit groupsand foundations as “domestic terrorists”.The United States has a robust civil society. The ACLU, for example, the American version of the UK’s Liberty, has about 2,000 staff members nationwide. American universities are among the best in the world; American media is read across the globe. And US foundations support essential democracy, health and development work throughout the nation. But these institutions are as strong as they are in part because the government has subsidized them – through grants for research, tax subsidies, access to public airwaves and the like. Trump, however, has shown that that support is simultaneously a source of strength and a critical vulnerability. Trump has repeatedly used threats to withdraw government funding or approval as a means to chill dissent. And it has worked, as universities, law firms and corporations that seek to do business with the government have complied with Trump’s wishes – even where it would be illegal for Trump to compel them to act.Universities, businesses and non-profits have eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion training that was perfectly legal, indeed constitutionally protected. They have reduced their engagement in challenges to the administration, hoping that their silence might stave off Trump’s wrath. Universities have agreed to reforms of their internal institutional structures that Trump could not have imposed directly. Nine law firms that settled with Trumpagreed to provide, collectively, almost $1bn of pro bono assistance to causes that Trump supports. Media institutions have also done the president’s bidding, as whenABC suspendedthe late-night talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel, and Paramount, the parent of CBS,paid Trump $16mto settle a frivolous lawsuit he filed objecting to how its public affairs program, 60 Minutes, had edited an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Those who have reached agreements with the administration have done so not because they were obligated to do so, but because they feared the pain the government could inflict by denying funding, withholding approval of mergers or otherwise not providing government support. But if civil society institutions are to perform the essential function allotted to them in a constitutional democracy, they must stand up for their rights, fight for their principles and maintain a bright light on the wrongs of the administration.Courts need to do their part as well. And as difficult as it can be to second-guess the president on questions of “emergency” power, many have. A federal judge in Massachusettsruled unlawfulTrump’s freeze of $2.2bn from Harvard University in retaliation for its political views, andseveral judges have invalidatedTrump’s executive orders punishing his disfavored law firms. Courts have blocked his efforts to send national guard troops to cities like Chicago and Portland, Oregon, and have invalidated many of his cruel immigration enforcement measures. In all, according to a litigation tracker maintained byJust Security, federal courts have issued more than 120 injunctions against Trump initiatives already, and we’re not even through the first year of his second term.But courts can’t act alone. And if citizens duck and cover in the face of Trump’s assault, the courts will not be able to save us. Civil society institutions have been buoyed over the years by federal government support. Now that the government has turned against them, they canstand for freedom and the rule of law, or capitulate to illegal pressure. The choice should be clear.David Cole is the Honorable George J Mitchell professor in law and public policy at Georgetown University and former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

Here’s how to find courage to oppose TrumpYaqiu WangWhile acting on your moral convictions can be risky, it can also feel profoundly goodSun 14 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareIn the eleven months since Donald Trump took office – during which he has unleashed unprecedented assaults on the checks and balances of American democracy – there has been a wave of warnings and advice from activists, writers and scholars who have either fought against authoritarian regimes or studied them closely. A common thread runs through much of their guidance: Americans, especially those in positions of power, must find thecourageto stand up for what is right, even when doing so carries personal risk.Yet few have addressed the harder questions: how does one become courageous? How much of courage is innate, and how much is learned? And what can we do to help people find the courage to act?I am a Chinese human rights advocate. For 15 years, I have worked alongside many brave individuals inChinawho have stood up to the notoriously repressive Chinese Communist party (CCP). Their experiences have taught me invaluable lessons about fear and courage. If you are a federal government employee wondering whether to resign rather than carry out an order you believe is wrong, an academic debating whether to speak to a journalist about political interference on your campus, or an editor weighing the risks of publishing a story that could draw government retaliation, here are a few lessons I hope will help you.What Rosa Parks can teach us about resistance today | Jan-Werner MuellerRead moreMost people understand that if everyone were to resist together, they could prevail. But they also know that such unity rarely happens and that resisting alone can seem to bring only personal cost, with no visible gain for anyone. I have no easy answer to this classic “collective action” problem, but I can say this: while acting on your moral convictions can be risky, it can also feel profoundly good.Over the years, many people from China have confided in me about a painful dilemma: “If I speak up, I live in fear of being punished by the government. If I stay silent, I live in shame for feeling complicit. What should I do?” Caught between such a rock and a hard place, they feel paralyzed. Yet those who ultimately choose to speak out often tell me afterward that they are glad they did – regardless of whether punishment followed. The act of standing in truth, they say, is deeply freeing and empowering.In late 2022, as protests erupted across China against Xi Jinping’s draconian zero-Covid restrictions, many participants described feeling a sense of euphoria. A young woman in Beijingsaidstanding up for her own dignity was “the most important decision of my life”. Anotherwrote: “It wasn’t until that night that I realized there were so many people who spokeourlanguage, that there were, in fact, so many ofus… braveus.” (The Chinese authorities arrested an unknown number of protesters,laterreleasing most of them while handing down prison sentences to some.)By contrast, staying silent against your conscience can be emotionally draining. It eats away at your self-esteem, dampens your spirit, and stifles your creativity. A common topic at dinner tables among Chinese people living abroad is the struggle to shake off the ingrained self-censorship shaped by an earlier life under authoritarianism. One friend told me that she no longer writes in Chinese because she can’t help but self-censor the moment she starts to type. Even though her English feels clumsy, she said, writing in English gives her a sense of freedom – and that freedom matters more to her than elegant prose.It’s important to remember that Trump’s America is far less repressive than Xi’s China, and Trump’s capacity for retaliation is nowhere near Xi’s. If Chinese people can still feel good about standing up, so can Americans.While it is true that some people are naturally more risk-averse and others more inclined to defy authority, courage can be cultivated through exposure and repetition, much like building a muscle. When people from China ask me how to overcome fear, I often encourage them to take one small step beyond their comfort zone, then see how it feels before taking the next. Never commented on political issues online? Try making a mildly critical post. Never attended a Tiananmen Massacre commemoration abroad? Go to one – wearing a mask if that makes you feel safer. Courage grows gradually through small acts that push the boundaries of fear.Many of the extraordinary human rights activists in China did not start out as “activists.” They were ordinary people with regular jobs, some even indifferent to politics. Their transformation often began with tiny acts: reposting a censored social media message, pushing back when a school administrator dictated what could not be said in class or demanding that the police explain why a relative had been detained simply for doing his job. Step by step, they learned to speak up more boldly and to endure greater reprisals. Each decision – to tell the truth, to refuse to comply, to insist on accountability – expanded their sense of agency.In 2015, the Chinese government disappeared the prominent human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang. Over the next three years, his wife, Li Wenzu – who had not been involved in her husband’s professional life – launched a relentless campaign demanding information about him and calling for his release. She latersaidthe experience left her “no longer resembling my former self”, transforming her from a shy, gentle woman into a committed advocate. Her husband was released from detention in 2020 butcontinued to face harassment.And finally, once you choose to take a stand at personal cost, you may be surprised by how many people – including those you never expected – reach out to express their admiration and support. That kind of affirmation can be deeply rewarding. And courage is contagious. Your act of conscience nudges others toward their own. Even if your actions don’t immediately ignite a wave of change or yield tangible results, your bravery will stay with people. It will become a quiet source of inspiration for them when their own moment of decision comes. Acts of courage rarely vanish; they ripple outward in ways we cannot always see.So, Americans, stand up and fight back!What’s giving me hope nowComing from China, I’ve always deeply appreciated the energy of the American people. They are gregarious and sometimes brash, but also refreshingly non-hierarchical and free-spirited. I think this vitality is rooted in the country’s immigrant character – immigrants are often a self-selected group driven to improve their lives. After so many generations of liberal democracy, those Americans who support it have grown complacent, while authoritarian forces have worked aggressively to disrupt the status quo. But I believe the drift and paralysis many pro-democracy Americans have felt is temporary. Their energy is returning. Creative, determined people will rise from the anti-authoritarian camp, and they will push back with real force.I like Americans – and I believe in them.Yaqiu Wang is a Chinese human rights researcher and advocate.

A further 29 individuals suffered serious injuries. ForSunday evening’s shootingsto occur in one of the most idyllic and quintessentially Australian of locations, at one of the most joyous times in the Jewish calendar, only deepens the fear and anguish felt throughout the Jewish community, across Australia and more broadly.Authorities were quick to identify the attack as terrorism, targeting Jews as they gathered to celebrate the beginning of Hanukah on the beach. The two gunmen – one now dead, another critically injured as of Sunday night – fired on the crowds from a bridge. Parents ran with their children in their arms; elderly people struggled to flee. A car containing improvised explosive devices was found nearby and late on Sunday police were still searching for a possible third offender. Without the extraordinary courage of the man who single-handedly wrestled a gun from one attacker at the beach, and the swift response of others, this violence would probably have been still more devastating.If the location was a shock, the attack itself is all the more disturbing because it is part of a global surge in antisemitic incidents and violence, particularly since the Hamas attack on Israel of 7 October and Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza. The devastation has reverberated across the globe. It should not need to be said that nothing can justify the sickening violence unleashed on Sunday.Australia had already enduredarson attackson synagogues and other properties. (Its security serviceblamed Iran, working through a complex web of proxies, for at least some of those.) In the UK, it is little more than two months since the attack on the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur left two worshippers dead. In the US too there have been increasing antisemitic attacks, with one counter-terrorism researcher recentlywarningthat they “[come] from all forms of ideologies and extremism”.Eighty-eight Australians died in bombings in Bali in 2002, and it was an Australian white supremacist who massacred 51 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019. Yet this may be the most lethal terror attack on its soil. It is the deadliest shooting since the Port Arthur massacre of 1996, in which a single perpetrator killed 35 people including children. That spurred Australia to introduce some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Experts’ concerns that the country is losing control of firearmsmust be heard.“In this moment of darkness, we must be each other’s light,” Anthony Albanese told the nation. As the prime minister rightly observed, an attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian. The perpetrators targeted Jews. And in doing so, they wreaked damage on society as a whole. Others will seek to exploit their violence to fuel division in Australia and beyond.They too must be challenged. Communities around the world have long used light to dispel the shadows in ceremonies and festivals at the darkest time of the year. These rituals are not reducible to a single idea; they have specific histories, resonances and meanings. Yet the common thread is that light can and must persist in the darkness. That the flickers are easily extinguished is more reason for all to protect and nurture them together.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Mr Trump also boasted of having ended war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He brags of having brought eight conflicts to a close and has just had the US Institute of Peacerenamed in his honour.Yet the truce between Thailand and Cambodia has already fallen apart. Half a million residents along the border havefled renewed fightingand civilians are among at least 27 people killed. Meanwhile, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 200,000 people havefled the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels– days after a peace deal was signed in Washington.On Friday, Mr Trump declared that the two sides had agreed to put down arms again. But theydisagreedand fighting continued over the weekend. Bangkok reluctantly agreed to the July deal because the US wielded tariffs as leverage. Phnom Penh, in the weaker position, was happier for it to intercede. Thailand then accused Cambodia –with good evidence– of laying new landmines in border areas, injuring several Thai soldiers. The conflict reignited in early December, with each side blaming the other.The territorial dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is more than a century old and centred ondisagreements over colonial-era maps. The two countries have clashed before over an ancient temple and seen unrest over who can claim other aspects of heritage. Thailand has also attacked the proliferation ofcriminal online scam centres in Cambodia. What gives the disagreement such potency, however, is that in both countriesnationalist feelinghas been weaponised for domestic purposes. In Cambodia, where the longstanding ruler Hun Sen has given way to his son Hun Manet in a dynastic dictatorship, whipping up anger against its neighbour helps to legitimise a regime that has little to offer its people.In Thailand, the long-running clash between the powerful military and royalist elites and the politician Thaksin Shinawatra, his family and proxies has been key. In August, a courtdismissed his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra as prime ministerfor failing to protect the country’s interests, after a recording of her discussing the border dispute with Hun Sen was leaked. It captured her addressing him as “uncle”, promising to “take care of it”, and denigrating a key military commander – prompting a storm of outrage. It played to political opponents’ claims that the Shinawatra family were happy to sell the country’s interests for personal benefit.The caretaker prime ministerappointed in her steadhas courted popularity by giving the military free rein in its stated aim of crippling the Cambodian army. Ahead of promised elections, the clashes are distracting from governmental woes – including a poor response to deadly floods – as well as positioning the army as national champions.Mr Trump, who predicted that he could settle the renewed conflict “pretty quickly”, wants instant wins and photo opportunities. Leaders who fear alienating him may provide handshakes and promises when pushed to it. But while pressure from powerful external players can help to push the parties in regional disputes to the negotiating table, there is a big difference between quick fixes andlasting peace– as the airstrikes and rocket attacks along the Thai-Cambodian border demonstrate.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He had been a friend and colleague of Sträussler in Czechoslovakia. The chief executive of Bata shoes, Jan Antonín Bat’a, gave Gellert a ticket for his family to go to the Bata factory in Singapore, and he gave Sträussler a ticket for his family to go to Nairobi, to another Bata factory. Thinking that Singapore sounded more interesting, Sträussler offered to swap tickets with his friend. Gellert agreed and the fatal exchange took place.Sträussler and family moved to Singapore. Marta and the boys escaped before the fall of the city, but Eugen was drowned when his boat was sunk.

Wes Streeting should not be on it, 7 December). While this review will inevitably examine questions of overdiagnosis, Harris is wrong to imply that Streeting’s main motivation is political. There is nothing unusual, of course, about ministers making decisions based on political considerations, but there is rather more to the review than Harris indicates.It hardly needs restating that mental health services are grossly overstretched and underresourced, and an inquiry is necessary. This is a particular problem in child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). When I was working as a clinical psychologist and involved in a Camhs autism diagnosis team 15 years ago, the waiting time for an autism assessment was around four to six months. Nowadays a waiting time of up to two years is common.It is sensible that questions of overdiagnosis should be addressed in this review. It is the malevolent leaders of Reform UK who are jumping on to a bandwagon here, not Streeting. Overdiagnosis is now being discussed in sober and non-political terms by clinicians and researchers who recognise it as an important issue.Nevertheless, Harris dismisses too quickly Suzanne O’Sullivan’s thoughtful book, The Age of Diagnosis. O’Sullivan argues persuasively that diagnosis should be conducted with a specific purpose in mind and make a practical difference for the patient. She explains that this is often not the case. Similarly, it is often unnecessary to fit somebody into a diagnostic category to offer them appropriate help. But some evidently find this hard to accept.Dr Richard HassallKnaresborough, North YorkshireJohn Harris argues that concern about mental health overdiagnosis is a politically motivated austerity power play that will deprive vulnerable patients of desperately needed services. As chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV taskforce, which developed the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1994, I am in a good position to contradict his assertion. Rates of reported psychiatric diagnoses have exploded recently due to a combination of: 1) confounding stress and distress with mental disorder; 2) ignoring the context in which symptoms occur; 3) the rise of internet self-diagnosis; 4) loose and fuzzily defined diagnostic criteria; 5) careless diagnosis (especially by GPs who have too little time to know their patients); 6) big pharma marketing; and 7) tying benefits too closely to diagnosis rather than level of functioning.The result is a wasteful misallocation of scarce resources. The worried well and mildly symptomatic receive harmful, unnecessary treatments – while patients with severe illness are deprived of the treatment and services they desperately need.Allen FrancesProfessor and chair emeritus, department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Duke UniversityADHD UKestimatesthat there are 2 million people in the UK with undiagnosed ADHD. Statistically, we are underdiagnosing ADHD, rather than overdiagnosing it.I work in a primary school as a learning support assistant for special educational needs and disabilities. I am also a parent of a child with ADHD. ADHD is very common, and it is accepted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence that aboutone in 20 childrenhas it. I don’t believe NHS services currently have the capacity to even assess one in every 20 children for ADHD, let alone provide support for them.Natasha FairbairnBristolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But it is not confined to GP referrals. Hospital patients are constantly in a similar position. I have experienced this myself many times, with investigations and/or outpatient appointments promised but never happening. Sometimes this follows an appointment being cancelled, with a “we will be in contact soon” message that turns out not to be true. Sometimes one just falls off the system, presumably included on a waiting list to be dealt with, that is then not dealt with. My experience is shared by large numbers of patients.The administrators are, in my experience, competent and dedicated people – but the system is not working. The commonly heard complaint that “there’s too much bureaucracy in the NHS” is wrong. What is needed is a well-managed administrative system, where the chief priority is that somebody is responsible for ensuring coordination, and that gaps are filled, eg when an administrator is on leave, ill, or moves to a different job. The present dire situation also means that nurses and doctors have to add administrative tasks to their already-heavy workload, adding to their stress and burnout.Probably it is not just the NHS, but a widespread problem. There are constant reports of failures of liaison between, for example, social services and the police. Good administration is undervalued, probably because everybody seems to be against “bureaucrats” – and politicians are often keen to be seen to cut “bureaucracy”.Michael JoffeLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

No one is calling for teenagers to be criminalised for using platforms designed to keep them hooked. The responsibility lies squarely with the tech companies that profit from exposing children to harm. Why does the government still allow systems that erode childhood for commercial gain?Teachers and parents witness the fallout daily: pupils too anxious and distracted to learn, children awake into the night because notifications demand constant attention, bullying that never ends, and content that pushes young people to extremes. This is not poor parenting or teaching – it is caused by the exploitative business models at the core of these addictive platforms.Despite what Nandy claims,three-quartersof the UK public support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. Parents don’t want “help navigating the online space”; they want action that tackles the source of harm.Australia is showing what is possible by not succumbing to the pressures of big tech. The UK needs to follow its lead, and watch closely to learn from the ban’s implementation and enforcement so our children are protected by big tech’s exploitative systems.

A bad afternoon for Newcastle’s German striker got significantly worse shortly after half-time when he cut an even more isolated, peripheral and forlorn figure in his own team’s box after inadvertently heading a Nordi Mukiele cross past Aaron Ramsdale from six yards out.Woltemade’s embarrassing own goal proved to be the unwitting match-winner in a contest that had until that point been high on full-blooded aggression but low on moments of real quality. As he made way for Yoane Wissa, it was no surprise theSunderlandfans granted the visibly deflated 23-year-old a sarcastic ovation. A fan favourite on Tyneside until the 46th minute of this match, Woltemade has now pulled off the unlikely feat of winning a permanent, bitterly ironic place in mackem hearts.Woltemade’s bizarre own goal hands Sunderland derby spoils over NewcastleRead moreIt may have been the biggest show in town but the first Premier League derby between these sides in almost a decade wasn’t the only local drama scheduled for Sunday afternoon. Less than a mile from the Stadium of Light, the matinee performance of Sleeping Beauty, the Christmas panto, was kicking off at the Empire Theatre. The cursed Princess Aurora will have done exceptionally well to have dozed through the febrile, visceral cacophony that rumbled across town from all four sides of the nearby cauldron of conflict when the players took to the pitch under a tifo boasting a ferocious black cat with fangs slavering and claws bared.Newcastle cowered accordingly and their extreme caution was all too apparent in an opening 45 minutes during which both sides huffed and puffed to no great effect but the hosts at least tried to attack, albeit through a series of hideously overhit crosses. Marooned up front due in no small part to a Newcastle approach that had Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga perform more as auxiliary full‑backs than wingers, Woltemade was given an early inkling this might not be his day when the increasingly ineffectual Gordon subjected him to a very severe and public dressing-down for the heinous crime of misplacing a pass. Having contributed little or nothing, both Newcastle wide men would be withdrawn on the hour mark.View image in fullscreenSunderland fans unveil a tifo before kick-off.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockLike most high-profile local rivalries, the mutual contempt between fans of Sunderland andNewcastle Unitedpurports to be an animus without equal. Yet, if familiarity breeds contempt, absence certainly hadn’t made contrasting hearts grow fonder and at times during a stop-start first half the pitch resembled the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan. Bodies slumped on, or fell to the deck theatrically and Dan Burn was forced off with damaged ribs to unsympathetic jeers. Despite showing early leniency, Peter Bankes showed his yellow card nine times during a game that simmered without ever threatening to boil over.An auspicious occasion for Sunderland after an eight-season absence from the Premier League, it was tempered by the upsetting news that the club legend Gary Rowell had died. Word of the 1979 derby-day hat-trick hero’s death after a long illness had spread through the city centre the previous evening and in at least one bar hosting Christmas revellers, a previously festive atmosphere immediately turned maudlin. It was like somebody had flicked a switch and before kick-off, a warm and lengthy tribute was paid to the former striker with a standing ovation.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In terms of style and personnel, today’s iteration of Sunderland bears little resemblance to the Championship side that was contemptuously swatted asidein an FA Cup tieby Newcastle at the Stadium of Light in January 2024. Arguably a blessing in disguise, that grim day in Sunderland’s recent history would ultimately lead to the recruitment of Régis Le Bris as head coach and a well-funded summer revival few fans could have imagined during the club’s fly-on-the-wall Netflix documentary banter years. Immense on Sunday, the experienced Granit Xhaka is the poster boy for a shrewd summer transfer window splurge that heralded 14 new arrivals, while the 20-year-old Noah Sadiki, a Belgium-born Democratic Republic of the Congo international, has proved one of last summer’s best signings for any Premier League side.In recent years, Newcastle have enjoyed their own trajectory of ascent under their preposterously wealthy Saudi Arabian owners, and Champions League nights and silverware may have helped engender the hope, if not belief, that their own days of humiliation were finally over. They have struggled away from home in this campaign and as defeats go, this was as harrowing and chastening as they get. They have now failed to beat Sunderland in 10 consecutive league games and this reverse was their fourth on the spin at the Stadium of Light, increasingly a fortress where the mood could scarcely be more upbeat.Explore more on these topicsSunderlandNewcastle UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

Spurs registered a single shot on target at the City Ground, where Callum Hudson-Odoi scored twice and Ibrahim Sangaré sealed victory with a stunning first-time strike.Hudson-Odoi double sinks limp Spurs to help move Forest away from relegationRead moreFrank cut a calm figure but insisted a “hurricane” was swirling inside of him. Asked whether he felt confident he would be afforded time to revive their form, the Dane said: “I can’t see why not. I think it’s pretty evident that if no one gets the time, no one can turn this around. This is not a quick fix. Today was a very bad performance. No two ways about that, but also know that to change this, this will take some time. No one will want to hear about that, it’s just reality.”Guglielmo Vicario appeared to be at fault for both of Hudson-Odoi’s goals but Frank defended his goalkeeper’s role in the first, with the Italian playing a short pass to Archie Gray, under pressure from Sangaré, who pinched possession before teeing up Hudson-Odoi. Vicario was badly exposed for Hudson-Odoi’s second, a cross-shot from the left flank.Asked if he had an issue with Vicario’s role in Forest’s first goal, Frank said: “No … I think you see that every week in the Premier League and from every team all over the world. So there’s no problem with that. Mistakes like that happen. When things are going against us we need to keep doing the right thing and keep our cool heads.”Frank added he would investigate his defender Djed Spence’s petulant reaction to being withdrawn during the second half as part of a triple substitution. The Spurs full-back, who won promotion to the Premier League with Forest while on loan from Middlesbrough in the 2021-22 season, spread his arms in disbelief as he left the field and then threw a warm-up jacket into the dugout.Last month Spence apologised to Frank for ignoring him after ahome defeat by Chelsea. Of Sunday’s incident, Frank said: “I didn’t see it. I think there can be three reasons: he can be disappointed with his own performance, disappointed with the team’s performance or disappointed to be subbed off. I will ask him.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurNottingham ForestThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

In light of that, Amorim was asked in the buildup toMonday’s visit of Bournemouthif the 20-year-old had spoken to him regarding a temporary move.Amorim unsure if Manchester United’s Afcon-bound trio can face BournemouthRead more“If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him,” said the head coach. “I’m not going to say what I’m going to say to Kobbie but I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.“The frustration [of any player] doesn’t help anybody. But again, the focus is [Bournemouth] and we will see if that happens. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players but about that subject, no I didn’t speak with him. I am completely open [to talk].”Last week Paul Scholes claimed Amorim “doesn’t get the club”. The Portuguese was asked if comments such as these from United legends makes his job harder. “No, it’s not winning – not winning is the issue,” he said. “If I’m winning I can go to the games on a horse, arrive there, play with just two defenders and everything will be fine. The problem is that as a manager I’m not doing good enough and that is a fact also. So that is the only problem.“Me as a manager of Manchester United, we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take that, naturally. Sometimes they [critical former players] don’t have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here. Always winning. So it’s hard for them to see their club in this situation.”Scholes also questioned Amorim’s reluctance to start Mainoo in midfield, a stance echoed by Nicky Butt and Rio Ferdinand. “I know that for you guys there are some players that you believe in a lot and I believe a lot but sometimes I have to make choices,” said Amorim. “We play with two midfielders. We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it’s really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.”Amorim was asked if he rates Mainoo highly. “Of course. Like everyone else,” the 40-year-old insisted. “Casemiro is the biggest example [of him changing his mind]. He was behind Toby [Collyer, now on loan at West Brom] and now he’s a star.”Amorim did concede that Mainoo can operate in Casemiro’s position as the holding midfielder. “Yes, he can. I think it wasagainst Everton– I took Casemiro out and I put Kobbie in there because we were trying to play a different game. He can play in that position. But it’s hard sometimes. Sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think [if he is] the guy for blocking transitions. He needs to spend more time there but he can be in that position in the future.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

And not going to lie it’s hurts. But all we can do now is trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,” Mahomes wrote on X. “Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”The Chiefs said in a statement that “Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.”Justin Herbert, playing through a broken left hand, threw for 210 yards and a touchdown, and the Chargers (10-4) ensured consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time since 2006-07 by completing a rare regular-season sweep of Kansas City. It is the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs have missed the playoffs. During that span, they have won three Super Bowls and reached the AFC Championship Game seven times.Mahomes was trying to rally the Chiefs in the closing seconds, completing a series of passes to get across midfield by the two-minute warning. But on the next play, he was scrambling toward the Kansas City sideline and throwing the ball away when he was spun to the ground by defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand, leaving the two-time MVP clutching his left knee. Mahomes was taken briefly to the blue injury tent, then helped to the locker room with a towel draped over his head.The once formidable Kansas City Chiefs look old, tired and out of ideasRead moreMinshew took over and completed three straight passes, giving Chiefs fans hope on a day that began with wind chills near zero and their playoff chances about the same. But with 20 seconds to go, Minshew unloaded a pass intended for Travis Kelce, and James – his longtime divisional foil – leaped up to pick it off, allowing Los Angeles to escape.“It’s very frustrating, man. It’s been hard to watch for Pat, a dude that puts so much into it,” Minshew said. “I’ve never seen someone give so much of themselves to the team. I have confidence in him and his ability to come back better than ever.”Mahomes was held to 189 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Kansas City (6-8) managed just 239 yards as a team. The Chargers beat the Chiefs in their opener in September in Brazil, setting each of the clubs on their season-long trajectory.Indianapolis Colts 16–18 Seattle SeahawksJason Myers kicked a franchise-record six field goals, including a 56-yarder with 29 seconds left, and the Seattle Seahawks outlasted 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts (8-6). Rivers threw a touchdown pass after coming out of retirement to make his first start in nearly five years, and he led the Colts into position for Blake Grupe’s go-ahead, 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds left. That was enough time for Sam Darnold and the Seahawks (11-3). Rashid Shaheed returned Grupe’s kickoff 28 yards to the Seattle 37, and Darnold connected with Shaheed twice for 25 yards to set up Myers.Buffalo Bills 35–31 New England PatriotsJosh Allen threw three touchdown passes, and James Cook ran for two TDs and caught another as the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-0 deficit to beat New England, preventing the Patriots from clinching the AFC East title.Allen finished 19 of 28 for 193 yards. Cook ran 22 times for 107 yards for the Bills (10-4), who avoided being swept by a division opponent for the first time since 2019. Buffalo reached 10 wins for the seventh consecutive season. The Bills overcame a double-digit deficit for the third time this year after previously rallying against Baltimore (down 15 points in the fourth quarter) and Cincinnati (down 10).The Patriots (11-3) lost their first division game of the season and their 10-game win streak ended. They haven’t won the AFC East since 2019 but still lead the Bills by one game with three games left. Drake Maye had a pair of touchdown runs, and TreVeyon Henderson ran for scores of 52 and 65 yards. Henderson finished with 14 carries for 148 yards.Trailing 35-31 with 2:43 to play, the Patriots had fourth-and-five on their own 22. Maye was flushed out of the pocket and had a pass batted down by Joey Bosa. The Bills ran out the clock from there.Detroit Lions 34–41 Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford passed for 368 yards and hit Colby Parkinson for two touchdowns, and the NFC-leading Los Angeles Rams (11-3) clinched a playoff berth with a furious second-half rally. Kyren Williams rushed for two scores and Blake Corum added another TD for the Rams, who came back from a double-digit deficit shortly before halftime with 20 consecutive points before securing their eighth victory in nine games. Amon-Ra St Brown scorched his hometown team for 163 yards and two touchdowns on 13 receptions for the Lions (8-6). Detroit have alternated wins and losses since Week 5.Green Bay Packers 26–34 Denver BroncosBo Nix tied a career-high with four touchdown passes, Courtland Sutton had seven receptions for 113 yards and a TD catch and the Denver Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers. Nix finished 23-for-34 for 302 yards passing for Denver (12-2), who have won 11 straight, holds the top seed in the AFC and clinched a playoff spot with the victory Troy Franklin, Lil’Jordan Humphrey and Michael Bandy each caught touchdown passes, while RJ Harvey scored another on the ground for the Broncos. Jordan Love completed 24 of 40 passes for 259 yards and threw a touchdown to Josh Jacobs, who also scored on the ground for Green Bay (9-4-1). Love was intercepted twice, with the second interception coming after Harvey put Denver ahead by eight. It was a costly game for the Packers, who lost wide receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury and defensive end Micah Parsons to a left knee injury. Both happened in the third quarter.Washington Commanders 29-21 New York GiantsJacory Croskey-Merritt ran for a touchdown, fellow rookie Jaylin Lane returned a punt 63 yards to the end zone and the Washington Commanders (4-10) ended their season-derailing skid at eight games by beating the similarly woeful New York Giants (2-12). The onlyNFLgame this week with no playoff implications has a far bigger bearing on draft positioning. The Giants lost their eighth in a row, moving a step closer to the top pick, a last-place finish in the NFC East and potential front-office changes, with a coaching search already coming.Arizona Cardinals 20–40 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw for 260 yards and three touchdowns and the Houston Texans jumped out to a big early lead and cruised to victory over the slumping Arizona Cardinals. The Texans (9-5) have won six straight games for the first time since a nine-game winning streak in 2018 to improve their playoff hopes. It’s the sixth straight loss for the Cardinals (3-11), whose last win came on 3 November against the Cowboys. Houston got going immediately with their fastest score of the season when Stroud connected with Nico Collins on a 57-yard touchdown on the second play of the game. Collins took the short throw, escaped two diving defenders at around the 40 and ran untouched into the end zone for the score.New York Jets 20–48 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence accounted for six touchdowns, including a career-high five passing, and the Jacksonville Jaguars overwhelmed the New York Jets from start to finish. Lawrence’s passer rating of 136.7 was the best of his five-year NFL career. Jacksonville improved to 10-4 and scored touchdowns on their first three possessions for the first time since 1998. The Jaguars topped 40 points through three quarters for the first time since 2005. The Jets (3-11) allowed their most points since a 54-13 loss to New England in 2021.Baltimore Ravens 24–0 Cincinnati BengalsThe Baltimore Ravens have handed Joe Burrow the first shutout of his six-year career. Lamar Jackson threw for two touchdowns, and Kyle Van Noy and Alohi Gilman teamed up for a 95-yard pick-six as the Ravens (7-7) blanked the Cincinnati Bengals (4-10). Derrick Henry rushed for 100 yards on 11 carries for the Ravens. Baltimore won their fourth straight road game and pulled within a half-game of Pittsburgh in the AFC North. The Steelers host Miami on Monday night. Cincinnati were eliminated from playoff contention. Burrow was picked off twice as he completed 25 of 39 passes for 225 yards.Tennessee Titans 24–37 San Francisco 49ersBrock Purdy threw three touchdown passes as the San Francisco 49ers beat the Tennessee Titans. The 49ers are 10-4 and looked sharp after their bye week, scoring on their first five possessions. Purdy connected twice with Jauan Jennings and once with George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey added a rushing touchdown. Rookie Cam Ward threw two touchdown passes for the Titans, who fell to 2-12. Tennessee defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons had a strip sack and a touchdown catch. Tennessee struggled with missed opportunities and injuries, failing to build on last week’s win over Cleveland.Carolina Panthers 17–20 New Orleans SaintsTyler Shough passed for 272 yards and a touchdown and helped set up Charlie Smyth’s go-ahead field goal, and the host New Orleans Saints defeated the Carolina Panthers. Shough and the Saints drove 62 yards in 51 seconds before giving way to Smyth for a 47-yard field goal, which split the uprights with two seconds left.The Saints (4-10) swept the Panthers (7-7), having won 17-7 on 9 November in Charlotte. Bryce Young threw for 163 yards and rushed for 49 to lead the Panthers, who fell into a tie with Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South. Carolina and the Buccaneers face each other twice in the final three weeks, beginning with a game in Charlotte next Sunday.Cleveland Browns 3–31 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams threw two touchdown passes and the Chicago Bears (10-4) beat Cleveland (3-11) in one of the coldest games ever at Soldier Field even though the Browns’ Myles Garrett moved within a sack of the NFL’s single-season record. The Bears heated up early on a day when the gametime temperature was 8F (-13C), scoring two first-quarter touchdowns and breaking the game open with two more in the third. Garrett had 1.5 sacks, giving him 21.5 on the season and leaving him one shy of the record shared by Michael Strahan and TJ Watt.Las Vegas Raiders 0–31 Philadelphia EaglesJalen Hurts bounced back from his worst NFL game by throwing three touchdown passes and Saquon Barkley added a two-yard touchdown run as the Philadelphia Eagles snapped a three-game losing streak. The Eagles are 9-5 and finally showed signs of life under offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. Hurts threw a 27-yard touchdown to AJ Brown early in the fourth quarter. The Raiders are 2-12 and lost their eighth straight game. Kenny Pickett struggled in his first start at quarterback for the injured Geno Smith.Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsUS sportsPatrick MahomesnewsShareReuse this content"

They aren’t something this group have had to deal with for a while. The consistency of selection has been amazing, with players protected as a matter of policy from the threat of losing their place.McCullum is now promising more of the same but I think the players will be realising that they, and beyond them the coaches in charge of the side and the ethos they have established over the past three years, are not immune if the team’s fortunes do not change. I expect the group will have acknowledged that what they have done so far on this tour has not worked. They want to play with freedom, to take the aggressive option, but are they playing to entertain or are they playing to win? Because at the moment they are losing, and the only people they are entertaining are Australian.I think back to two of the statements made by senior members of the England setup in Brisbane during and after the last Test. One wasBen Stokespromising to have honest conversations with his players – I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the team’s mantra of putting pressure on their opponents wherever possible, but their decision-making has to improve, and that is what he will have wanted to talk about. But I can’t forget Marcus Trescothick’s extraordinary admission that there had been no chats among the group about the perils of driving on the up outside off-stump. For that not to be discussed on a tour of Australia, particularly given it has been a real issue in England’s performances so far, really beggars belief.In teams I was involved with the batters would tend to get together and discuss an upcoming match: potential pitch conditions; boundary sizes; whether there was a prevailing breeze and what challenges the opposition bowlers were going to pose. Trescothick’s statement implies that these conversations are not happening, and it may be tricky to introduce them now into such an established group. But without them it is hard to address the kind of shortcomings we have seen.View image in fullscreenWill Jacks could keep his place in Adelaide after taking a brilliant catch and batting with guts and determination in the second Test.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesStokes and the coaching group may want to discuss necessary refinements to the batters’ approach, but without seeding doubt in their minds. Come the first morning of the third Test they each have to be absolutely clear about and committed to the way they want to go. They have to believe they can get big scores and maybe Adelaide, where the pitch traditionally has alittle less spice and bouncethan those in Perth or Brisbane, will bemore conducive to their aggressive approach. The players will be desperately trying to cling on to their confidence and belief, remembering previous good performances, how they felt and what they did well.I remember Sachin Tendulkar making a famous double hundred in Sydney in 2004 without playing a single cover drive, because he’d been guilty of edging outside off-stump a few times. That’s an example of a great player showing adaptability and deciding to eliminate an area of vulnerability. Of course not everyone will have the honesty and the discipline to take that extreme approach but it does show what can be done with the right attitude and mindset. The problem for England is that they may not be able to change their mindsets, or for that matter their personnel.View image in fullscreenEngland’s bowlers, including Jofra Archer, have lacked penetration and there might be a changed lineup of pace bowlers for the third Test.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesI saw enough from Will Jacks in Brisbane for me to think he should keep his place in Adelaide – he took a brilliant catch, batted with guts and determination, and there is not really much difference between his off-spin and Shoaib Bashir’s on a wicket that is likely to be pretty flat. I expect to see a change in the lineup of pace bowlers – we haven’t seen the best of Gus Atkinson, Jofra Archer has lacked penetration, Brydon Carse has been expensive, and Stokes did not seem to think they executed the team’s plans well enough at the Gabba. I can see Carse being taken out of the firing line, and maybe Josh Tongue can be the metronome they need to give them control at one end.But what about the batting? The best No 3s I can remember brought a calmness to proceedings and with Ollie Pope struggling England may benefit from having someone in the wings who could come in and play in a more conventional way and protect the middle order. But McCullum has said we should not expect any changes, and has created a situation where there aren’t any options. He must have considered bringing in Jacob Bethell, the only spare batter in the squad, who would change the dynamic as a left-hander who brings a bit of calmness. I have always been impressed by his temperament, and I don’t think he’d be overawed by the occasion – but his recent performances, what few of them there have been, haven’t exactly made a compelling case for his inclusion.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell could change the dynamic for England as a left-hander who brings a bit of calmness.Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty ImagesI remember when England went to the West Indies in 1998 there were so many possible permutations of batters, so much flexibility in the lineup, people who could move up and down the order, could bat at three or at six. The ability to shuffle our pack, in a tour against tough opponents being played on tough pitches, was helpful (though it didn’t help us avoid a series defeat). But McCullum and Stokes value certainty, the same logic that drives them to announce their team two days before a game starts – clearly beneficial to their opponents, but they feel it is even more helpful for their own players to know where they stand.Well I hope that logic is sound, because they certainly know where they stand now.They are 2-0 downand they have all the clarity they could wish for: no messing about, they have to stand up, they have to perform, and they have to find a way to win.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Brendon McCullumBen StokesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

Victory had seemed within his grasp as he recorded a 160 checkout on his way to taking the second set.Bunting cooled, however, and won just one leg over the next two sets, allowing Bialecki – oblivious to a wasp that landed on his shoulder – to pull back level. Bunting recovered his composure in the fifth leg but was still taken to the wire before winning it 4-2.“When you are playing at Ally Pally you go through all the emotions,” Bunting told Sky Sports. “I knew Sebastian was going to be tough and even at 2-0 he never gave in.“I am lucky to get away with that one.

This defeat, a third for Wilfried Nancy in his three games as the manager, plunged the club firmly into a state of crisis. What a festive fiasco.There is a scenario in which Nancy changes Celtic’s fortunes. The trouble for the Frenchman is, that feels highly unlikely. On one of the finest days in St Mirren’s 148-year history they deservedly claimed the League Cup for only the second time. Yet it was impossible to ignore the desperate nature of Celtic’s performance. They have swapped Brendan Rodgers and Martin O’Neill – elite managers who fully comprehend this environment – for a project under Nancy that is already covered in red flags. Another key attribute shared by Rodgers and O’Neill is experience. Nancy is in a situation he has never encountered before in football.European football: Inter make no mistake and go top after rivals falterRead moreNancy is a symptom rather than the cause of Celtic’s decline. Under Rodgers, great headway was made in last season’s Champions League and, despite the odd bump, domestic dominance was a near-certainty. The failure to build on European progress in transfer windows triggered not only the exit of Rodgers but widespread supporter discontent, epitomised by an AGM that had to be abandoned. There is a lack of accountability among the Celtic hierarchy that rightly angers paying punters. Paul Tisdale, the head of football operations, might as well be the invisible man.O’Neill’s caretaker spell pre-Nancy was only ever supposed to be that, yet at least the 73-year-old won games. O’Neill retains presence. The lack of hype from Celtic around Nancy’s appointment left the impression even his paymasters were unsure of what was coming next.Hearts,Romaand now St Mirren have revelled in Celtic’s vulnerability. It is pretty difficult to envisage how they extricate themselves from this trauma. Even the spending of fortunes in January, presumably to endorse Nancy’s football theories, looks dangerous.View image in fullscreenA glum Wilfried Nancy looks on at full time after his third defeat in three games.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PANot that Nancy is blameless. His insistence on switching to a back three has looked problematic from the start, namely because Celtic lack wingbacks and appropriate balance at centre-half. The shipping of eight goals in three games tells a story. Celtic’s midfield, a recent strength, is suddenly ragged. Nancy’s messaging to the media, as again the case post-match here, verges on waffle. What on earth, then, must players think?Quick GuideScottish Premiership roundup: Braga and Kingsley take Hearts clearShowCláudio Braga and Stephen Kingsley were on target as a resurgentHeartswon 2-0 away to misfiringFalkirkon Saturday night to move six points clear at the top of the Premiership. Buoyed by ending a four-game run without a victory with last Sunday’s triumph against their title rivals Celtic, the Jambos raced into an early lead through Braga. Hearts – who survived a Bairns penalty claim just before half-time – had to dig deep to keep their advantage intact before the substitute Kingsley killed off the Bairns’ hopes of getting back into the game with a brilliant strike in the 77th minute (pictured).Celtic, who play St Mirren in the League Cup final on Sunday, have two games in hand.Jim Goodwin admitted he understood why theDundee Unitedfans booed at the final whistle of the 0-0  Premiership draw withMotherwell. The result meant that the Terrors have now failed to win in their last seven matches. However, United manager Goodwin was determined to accentuate the positives, with his side keeping their first clean sheet since 23 September when they beat Aberdeen 2-0.The Irishman said: \"We understand the frustration from the supporters. They turned out in great numbers again today. We've kept a clean sheet against a really, really good team. I'm going to give my players a bit of credit, off the back of a really disappointing performance last weekend.\"We're not happy not to win the game. We don't set up to draw games of football. But we set up in a way out of respect to the opposition. Motherwell are a very good possession-based team. I think they're probably, at this moment, the best team in the country in terms of how they play the game.\"Livingstonfought back from two goals down to salvage an important point from a 2-2 draw in the bottom-of-the-table Premiership clash withDundee. The visitors took control of the game with two goals in quick succession in the first half from Yan Dhanda and Cameron Congreve. After being booed off at the interval, Livingston improved in the second half and deservedly pulled one back through Jeremy Bokila. Then, just moments after coming on from the bench, Tete Yengi knocked an effort through the legs of Dundee goalkeeper Jon McCracken in the 85th minute. The draw moved Livingston to within three points of second-bottom Kilmarnock while Dundee climbed to 10th, four points better off than the Lions.On Sunday,Aberdeen's improved form continued with a 2-1 comeback victory over strugglingKilmarnock, whose winless run stretched to 10 games. The Dons toiled in the first period and were fortunate to trail by just one goal at the interval after Tyreece John-Jules opener the scoring for the visitors. But the hosts upped the tempo in the second half and Kenan Bilalovic levelled before Jesper Karlsson tucked home a late penalty to extend their unbeaten league run to seven matches.PA MediaPhotograph: Pete Summers/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Frenchman admitted defeat was “painful” before bemoaning Celtic’s “failure to connect” the game and said his squad carries “self-doubt”. Nancy added: “I know where we are now and I know where we want to go. If you don’t know me, you might think I am all over the place but I know exactly what I need to do. I am the manager and I need to find solutions.” He must source them before Wednesday night and a trip to Dundee United.As Nancy floundered, this was a triumph for his opposite number at St Mirren. Stephen Robinson out-thought and out-coached Nancy. St Mirren’s cup final plans had been disrupted by a call from Mikael Mandron to his manager at 7.30am, stating he had been sick all night. Mandron had been due to start at centre-forward. “I want being as comfortable as we were today to be recognised,” said Robinson. And it should be.View image in fullscreenJonah Ayunga heads St Mirren in front in the second half before adding a third.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe Paisley side surged ahead inside 100 seconds. Marcus Fraser reacted quickest to meet a Keanu Baccus corner for the third goal Celtic had lost from that form of set play in three games. Kasper Schmeichel was slow with his attempt to save, which is becoming something of a theme. Dan Nlundulu should have doubled the St Mirren lead but instead fired wide from close range.Celtic responded strongly enough. Reo Hatate ghosted in at the back post as Kieran Tierney floated in a cross. Hatate’s volley restored parity.What happened next was ominous for Nancy. As St Mirren seized the second-half initiative, Celtic had no reply. Schmeichel was in no man’s land as Jonah Ayunga rose to meet Alex Gogic’s chipped cross. Ayunga’s second of the afternoon arrived after Miguel Freckleton found the marauding Declan John with a terrific pass and the Welshman spotted his teammate in blissful isolation.In February, Celtic wereso close to giving Bayern Munich a bloody nosein Bavaria. Here was the same team being shown up by Ayunga, a striker whose most prolific spell came at Havant and Waterlooville. This is the stuff of dreams for St Mirren.

The more pedantic-minded might also point out that both their opponents have fielded below-strength sides, but when the qualifying sums are completed next month that will not be the top line as far as the Saints’ management are concerned.Because regardless of the depth of the resistance they are facing,Northamptonare again underlining their ability to pick apart sides who give them too much space and time. On this occasion they rattled up eight tries, including a hat-trick for George Hendy, two for the fit-again Ollie Sleightholme and one for the roaming Henry Pollock, who showed a further glimpse or two of his rare talent.Ten-try Harlequins cruise to Champions Cup rout of understrength BayonneRead moreOne searing diagonal burst by the 20-year-old England back-rower, stopped only by a tap tackle within sight of the line, was the most obvious retort to the pre-match lip-smacking in South Africa at the prospect of him venturing down a dark alley populated by hard-nosed Afrikaaners unimpressed by his growing international reputation.Quick GuideChampions Cup roundup: Edinburgh suffer 33-0 defeat at CastresShowToulon came out on top over Bath in an entertaining nine-try contest and took a 45-34 victory at the Stade Mayol. The result means all six teams in Pool Two have a win and a loss to their name after their first two matches but Bath's bonus point means they top the table with six points, with the other sides on five. Finn Russell slotted two penalties either side of Brian Alainu'uese's try which gave Toulon a 7-6 lead. Mateo Garcia kicked three points for the hosts following a ruck infringement but Bath went ahead through Ted Hill with their first try of the game before Garcia knocked over his second penalty to make it 13-13. Toulon went eight points to the good when Juan Ignacio Brex finished off after Kyle Sinckler's powerful run, that was before Garcia kicked his third penalty of the game - but back came Bath again when Russell's delayed pass allowed Santi Carreras to cross the whitewash. Sinckler's powerful run proved troublesome again in Toulon's next try as Gael Drean picked a line to race clear and re-establish the French side's eight point lead but Bath were not going away themselves, Arthur Green dotted down to bring the deficit back to one. Toulon got their try bonus point through Lewis Ludlam but Max Ojomoh's short pass let Louie Hennessey cut the gap to four points for Bath before another penalty and Teddy Baubigny's try finished things off in the French side's favour.In the other Pool 2 match,Edinburghwere brought back down to earth in the Champions Cup as they fell to a 33-0 defeat atCastres. The visitors claimed a stunning win over Toulon on their return to the competition last week but they were well beaten in France this time.Bristolran riot with nine tries as they thrashed Pau 61-12 at Ashton Gate in Pool 4. Eight different try scorers got in on the act as Bristol made it two wins from two and scored all 61 of their points – as Tom Jordan kicked eight successful conversions – within the opening hour to claim a dominant win. The England prop Ellis Genge powered over from close range open a destructive afternoon of scoring and Fitz Harding slipped the ball to Benjamin Grondona in a two-on-one situation to go under the posts for their second try. Things were threatening to get a bit ugly for the French visitors when Bristol ran in three more tries before the break courtesy of Kieran Marmion, Kalaveti Ravouvou and Gabriel Oghre’s score at the back of the maul on the stroke of half-time. There were no signs of letting up in the second period either, Benhard Janse van Rensburg crossed over four minutes into the half before Joe Batley made it 47-0. Pau got on the scoresheet through Fabien Brau-Boirie’s try under the posts but Aidan Boshoff and Grondona – who crossed over for his brace – extended the hosts’ score, while Brau-Boirie’s second try was nothing more than a consolation for the visitors.PA MediaPhotograph: George Tewkesbury/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With the increasing number of cameras trained on the modern game, that was never going to stray too far beyond the boundaries of decency and, not for the first time, Pollock had the last laugh on the scoreboard. As the Bulls’ head coach, Johan Ackermann, correctly observed beforehand: “He gets under the skin of the opposition with his overconfidence, but the reality is that he backs it up when he plays.”With Fin Smith, the player of the match, George Furbank – increasingly strongly linked with a summer move to Harlequins – Rory Hutchinson and Alex Mitchell also playing slick supporting roles, the result was another of those one-sided spectacles that are now a feature of this tournament’s early stages. This should have been a delicious prospect for any rugby neutral: last year’s Champions Cup finalists against a team containing multiple Springboks. Instead, as is becoming a wearily familiar story in the pool stages, the reality was slightly more humdrum.It remained a stronger Bulls side than some of those sighted in these parts in past seasons but a full-bore, eyeballs-out selection it was not. The visitors were missing half a team of Bok representatives with Handré Pollard, Canan Moodie, Wilco Louw and Willie le Roux, among others, all spared the East Midlands in December.View image in fullscreenOllie Sleightholme scored two tries in Northampton’s emphatic victory.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesIt was not a massive surprise, then, when Saints took the early initiative, slick handling and a nicely timed pass from Pollock sending Sleighthome over in the left corner. The England wing has endured an injury disrupted year but is finally back doing what comes naturally.In his own half, unfortunately, the 25-year-old was less sure-handed, dropping a costly ball in contact which was then hacked on for the pacy Stravino Jacobs to break away and score. Saints were suitably relieved when they did finally enjoy some sustained territorial advantage and created a mismatch out wide for Hendy to exploit.At which point, under other circumstances, it would have been the signal for Ackermann’s army to circle the wagons and smash their way back into the contest through sheer physical will. The truth, sadly, is that the best South African players cannot play across both hemispheres all year round without some occasional respite. And until that fiendish circle is even vaguely squared, their participation in northern hemisphere club tournaments will continue to create as many problems as it solves, regardless of the format.Quick GuideNorthampton 50-5 Bulls teams and scorersShowTeams and scorersNorthamptonFurbank (capt); Sleightholme, Hutchinson, Dingwall (Thame 53), Hendy; F Smith, Mitchell (James 60) Fischetti (Iyogun 49), Wright (R Smith 49), Davison (Kundiona 49), Coles (Munga 60), Van der Mescht (Prowse 61), Kemeny, Pearson (Graham 69), Pollock.TriesSleightholme 2, Hendy 3, Pollock, Coles, Kemeny.ConF Smith 5.BullsWilliams; Petersen, Gans, Vorster (Van Niekirk 61), Jacobs; Wolhuter (Johannes 66), Burger (Papier 11); Tshakweni (Louw 63), Van der Merwe (Else 67), C Smith (Mchunu 54), Wiese, Van Heerden, Coetzee (capt; Carr 40) Ludwig, Louw (Sithole 55, Gumede 66).TryJacobs.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The format of the competition also has to take its share of the blame. Bulls have already lost to Bordeaux at home but a single bonus-point win at home to Bristol next month followed by a losing bonus point in Pau may conceivably be enough to squeeze them into the last 16. On that basis, why would middle-ranking sides necessarily bust a gut in the pool stages if they are not overly focus on securing home advantage in the knockout phase?In this instance, certainly, the last quarter was a procession after Alu Tshakweni had been sent to the sin-bin for a retaliatory 53rd-minute kick at Manny Iyogun. With a numerical advantage against flagging opposition the Saints duly made hay with the hard-running Sleightholme and Hendy, twice, benefiting from the efforts of those inside them. Rare is also the game in which Pollock does not play some part in the narrative but these were nothing like the raging Bulls this competition would ideally like.“We knew when we saw the Saints team that it was going to be tough because of the quality they possess,” said Ackermann, whose side lost at home to Bordeaux in the opening round. “It was just disappointing that we collapsed in the second half.”His Saints counterpart, Phil Dowson, whose side head out to France to face the holders, Bordeaux, next month, also admitted the club were realistic about the difficulty of retaining experienced players like Furbank in addition to their rich crop of young English talent. “We’re trying to work hard to keep George … but we respect the decision the player makes,” said Dowson, who has previously lost both Lewis Ludlam and David Ribbans to French clubs for salary cap-related reasons.“Obviously it would be a bitter pill if George bloody Furbank drops a goal from halfway in a semi-final, for example. If that eventuality happens and he ends up at an English club we’ll obviously track his career and keep in touch but I don’t think we can be bitter about that.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupNorthamptonBullsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Arecent pollof Labour members suggested Burham would be the most popular candidate to replace Starmer.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham, pictured with Keir Starmer last year, dismissed the latest reports as ‘quite a lot of rubbish’.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesGwynne, 51, is undergoing treatment for serious health issues and has not returned to Westminster since he was sacked as health minister in relation to the WhatsApp messages, which he called “badly misjudged”.Speaking publicly for the first time since his dismissal, he told the Guardian that he had no intention of standing down imminently.“I can categorically say that no decision has been made on whether I stand down or fight the next general election – but I have no plans to stand down before the May elections,” said the MP for Gorton and Denton in Greater Manchester.Gwynne said Burnham was a “close family friend” and that there had been “no conversations at all with him about me standing down”.He added: “He’s a decent guy and he knows I am poorly and there’s been no pressure from him at all. Idle speculation like this does not help.”Gwynne, a longtime Burnham ally who ran his mayoral campaign in 2016, remains under investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.Labour sources played down reports that the Great Manchester mayor was “on the brink of a major breakthrough” in returning to Westminster.They pointed out that the mayor faced several hurdles before he could fight any byelection, not least being allowed by Labour’s ruling national executive committee to run as a candidate.Some suggest Starmer would seek to block Burnham from standing for election and potentially mounting a leadership challenge, although others said this tactic would make the prime minister look weak.With Labour trailing Nigel Farage’s Reform UK in the polls by anaverage of 9 percentage points, party sources said virtually no seat was a guaranteed path to victory for Burnham.Gwynne, who won the seat with a 13,000-vote majority last year, is facing a challenge from Reform and the Green party as Labour loses votes nationally to the left and right of politics.Labour figures have previouslytold the Guardianthat Burnham could arrange a “job swap” with Jim McMahon, the MP for Oldham West, Chadderton and Royton, who lost his ministerial job in the reshuffle in September.The demotion is said to have frustrated McMahon, who allies said he fancied Burnham’s job as Greater Manchester mayor. However, pollsindicate McMahon’s seat would be lost to Reform and that Labour faces losing other previously loyal voters in the constituency to pro-Palestinian independents.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, when asked about the latest Burnham speculation, said everyone in Labour had a “role to play” in supporting the government.Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, she said: “Wherever you sit in the Labour family, we all have a role to play in supporting the Labour government deliver for the people of this country.”Burnham and McMahon have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourGreater ManchesterKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

The hope of living without fear. That fear that torments families,” Kast told the thousands of supporters who waited more than two hours for his speech.Many analysts believe the ultra-conservative succeeded in addressing one of Chileans’ main concerns: rising violence, which has increased in recent years even though the country remains one of the safest in Latin America.Over the past decade, the number of migrants has doubled, fuelled by about 700,000 Venezuelans forced to leave their country amid its economic collapse.Kast repeatedly presented migrants as the reason for rising insecurity. During the campaign, he gave the roughly 330,000 undocumented migrants – most of them Venezuelan – an ultimatum to leave before the next president takes office on 11 March or be expelled “with only the clothes on their backs”.In his victory speech, in which he repeatedly said Chileans were living in “fear”, the president-elect said his administration would show “great firmness in confronting all those who harm us”.He added: “When we tell an irregular migrant that they are breaking the law and must leave our country if they ever want the chance to return, we mean it … We must show great firmness against crime, organised crime, impunity and disorder.”Kast’s platform included a Trump-inspired plan to build detention centres and five-metre-high walls, electric fences and three-metre-deep trenches, as well as an increased military presence along the border, particularly in the north, on the frontier with Peru and Bolivia.This was Kast’s third attempt at the presidency: in 2021, he was defeated by Boric in the runoff.In a televised phone call, Boric congratulated Kast on “a clear victory” and invited the president-elect to a first meeting on Monday morning at La Moneda, the presidential palace in Santiago, to begin the transition.Boric said Kast “will at some point come to understand what the loneliness of power means, and the moments in which very difficult decisions must be made.”Although Jara won the first round in November, Kast’s victory had beenwidely anticipated by pollsand because he was expected to inherit the votes of the other rightwing candidates, which far outnumbered those of the left.Jara called Kast on Sunday to concede and, in a speech afterwards, said she did not want a divided country and that she would lead a “constructive” opposition, but would “condemn any hint of violence, wherever it comes from”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday congratulated Kast, whose victory has added another right wing leader more closely aligned with Donald Trump in Latin America.Under Kast’s leadership, “we are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration, and revitalising our commercial relationship,” Rubio said in a statement.Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei, congratulated his “friend” Kast with a post on social media: “One more step for our region in defence of life, liberty and private property. I am sure we will work together so that theAmericasembrace the ideas of freedom and we can free ourselves from the oppressive yoke of 21st-century socialism.”Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, also congratulated Kast in a post and said he “will continue working” with the Chilean government to strengthen relations between the two countries and to ensure “the preservation of South America as a zone of peace”.Although many analysts see the result as part of a broader rightwing wave sweeping South America – with victories this year inEcuador,BoliviaandArgentina’s midterms– many Chilean analysts also view Kast’s win as a continuation of the alternation of power between left and right since the country returned to democracy after the military dictatorship which lasted from 1973 to 1990.Despite his sweeping victory, Kast will not command an absolute majority in Congress, neither in the lower house nor in the Senate, even when counting all rightwing parties together.The ultra-conservative has pledged to cut public spending by $6bn within 18 months, but has not explained how he intends to do so.“There are many things about what a Kast government will look like that we don’t know because he has not said how he will do them,” said Rossana Castiglioni, a political science professor at the Universidad Diego Portales.“In terms of economic policy, it is very likely we will see adjustment measures typical of the right. But we have no certainty about how he will implement them … where there is far less uncertainty is on security policy, because that has been his workhorse throughout the campaign,” she added.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It would also completely end the 2030 ban on newpetrol and diesel cars.A future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”If we delay the UK’s drive for electric vehicles, our rivals will overtake us | Jonathan ReynoldsRead moreWritingin the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035. More drivers than ever are choosing electric, and November saw another month of increased sales with EV’s accounting for one in four cars sold.“We’re investing over £7.5bn to support drivers and manufacturers make the switch to zero emission. This includes £4bn investment to back British manufacturing and R&D, create jobs and drive growth in the sector.”“Our electric car grant is making it cheaper than ever to choose an EV, with over 40,000 drivers saving up to £3,750 since launch, backed by an extra £1.3bn announced at the autumn budget.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoringTravel and transportConservativesKemi BadenochGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The organisation also helped to uncover key evidence of a major alleged corruption scandal involving the police.The surveillance reports contained personal information about Graham Smith, who founded and ran the HCDA, including his marriage and his father’s terminal cancer.The judge-led inquiry is looking at theconduct of undercover police officers who spied on thousands of predominantlyleftwing campaigners between 1968 and at least 2010. It was established afterrevelations of misconduct.It heard that undercover officers compiled 44 reports which had details of the activities of the HCDA and Smith between 1988 and 1998. The first was filed in August 1988, a month after the HCDA had been set up.The organisationwas established to counter police brutality and racism. It operated as a self-help group which enabled victims of police violence to use lawsuits as a means of obtaining justice. Over time, the HCDA highlighted a series of cases which were regularly publicised in the media.It also helped in the1990s to expose one of the worst alleged casesof police corruption in which officers at Stoke Newington station were accused of planting drugs on people, selling drugs, theft and other crimes.The Met has conceded that it was wrong for senior officers to have directed undercover officers to spy on the HCDA.It and other groups “were engagedin legitimate activities, including seeking to hold the [Met] accountable for its own conduct and decision making, the force said.Givingevidence on Thursday, Smith said many of the surveillance reports were inaccurate. One said the HCDA had obtained a scanner to listen into police communications and was “particularly interested in monitoring the activities of a Hackney police unit headed by a sergeant which it believes is specifically targeting anarchists in the area”.Smith said: “I don’t know anybody in HCDA who was in possession of a radio scanner,” and that the undercover police had wrongly sought to portray the organisation as being run by anarchists.Hounding the bad copsRead moreOne of the undercover officers, Mark Jenner,started a five-year deployment in Hackney in 1995. The strategy document outlining the groups he was sent to infiltrate specifically referred to the HCDA, which was described as being “involved in co-ordination of opposition to … local police (allegations of harassment, racism, wrongful arrest, etc).”In the document, his managers said the HCDA was “probably not worthy of monitoring in terms of [its] own importance”, but would be “suitable vehicles for an undercover officer establishing an anarchist reputation”.Smith rejected suggestions that the surveillance of the HCDA was an incidental byproduct of the covert deployments.He said the undercover officers “sought to deflect from their unlawful collection, recording and retention of intelligence by labelling the police accountability campaigns they targeted as political extremists”.Jenner passed personal information about Smith to his managers. This, Jenner has said, was done toupdate the secret file on Smith that wasmaintained by special branch, the secretive police division that monitored political activists.Special branch, which employed the undercover officers, started keeping confidential files on the HCDA itself to logits activities in 1988, the year it was founded.Another undercoverofficer, Trevor Morris, was deployed in 1991to spy on groups in Hackney for four years. Outlining the purpose of his covert work, his managers referred to issues such as “anti-police matters”, and said the HCDA was one of the groups he would be monitoring “in order to assess their level of activity and potential involvement in future issues”.Smith said he believed a significant number of surveillance reports on himself and the HCDA had not been disclosed to him.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

An initial payment of £400m will be funded by an increase in the group’s debt with its longstanding lender NatWest and existing company cash.The group will pay RedBird IMI a further £100m within two years, most likely using a DMGT bond with Deutsche Bank that matures in 2027, according to the Observer.Details of the financing structure will be given this week to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, as part of information she will need before allowing the deal to proceed.Regulators including the Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom will also have to review the offer.The consortium RedBird IMI – a joint-venture between the US private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners and the United Arab Emirate’s International Media Investments –took control of the Telegraph in 2023. However, it wasforced to put the newspaper group up for salein April last year after the UK government legislated against foreign state ownership of British newspaper assets.Rothermere has long-coveted control of the Telegraph titles. If successful, they will join a stable of newspapers and magazines that includes Metro, the i Paper and New Scientist. DMGT already handles the advertising contract for the Telegraph titles.As part of the offer, which was initially floated last month, DMGT has said that the Mail and Telegraph editorial teams will remain separate and editorially independent, with investment provided to pursue the titles’ goal of becoming a global brand.Rothermere’s group has said the deal would also give “much-needed certainty” to Telegraph staff, who have beenstuck in limboover a sale process that hasdragged on for more than two years.However, rival bidders are still circling. Dovid Efune, the owner of the New York Sun, is considering a bid and has the secured backing of the Baltimore Sun owner, David Smith, according to the Financial Times. Efune has secured about £100m in investment backing from the Brexit-supporting businessman Jeremy Hosking, it said.Efune, who was born in the UK, had been in talks to buy the Telegraph last year, but was reportedly derailed by funding problems.Explore more on these topicsTelegraph Media GroupMergers and acquisitionsDaily Mail & General Trust (Business)Daily TelegraphSunday TelegraphNewspapersNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

What I would say is we’re the sort of country that allows people to have the calling of their own conscience to live their own life free, but also has common rules that we all live by so that we live in peace together.”The home secretary said she was “very proud to be a citizen of a country that is as diverse as we are” and added: “We are a multifaith, multi-ethnic country. I think that we have managed the challenges very well compared to other countries.“That’s not to say that we don’t have work to do on integration, on the pace of change in our communities. It’s why I’m looking very closely at not just illegal migrants into our country but legal migration as well, to make sure it’s done in a way that retains public confidence.”Trump’s security strategy calls for the restoration of “western identity” and claims that Europe will be “unrecognisable in 20 years or less” and faces the “stark prospect of civilisational erasure”.It says the US wants “Europe to remain European” and “regain its civilisational self-confidence”. It celebrates the influence of “patriotic European parties” and says “America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.The strategy appears to endorse attempts to influence politics on the continent, saying that US policy should prioritise “resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.The UK government has been careful not to directly criticise Trump over the document and Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has said he would always stand up for Europe’s “longstanding values of freedom and democracy”.Seema Malhotra, a Foreign Office minister,said in the Commons this weekthat although the government disagreed with aspects of the strategy, the US remained a trusted and valuable ally.Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly faced personal attacks from Trump, told LBC radio “we’ve seen in the UK a massive increase in anti-Muslim hatred”. The mayor of London added: “When President Trump says some of the things he does … he normalises and brings to the mainstream views that I think are unacceptable.”Mahmood, who has spoken about how being a Muslim guides her in public service, said her faith was “the reason why I want to serve my country and do my best to make our country a better place for millions of people”.Asked whether she thought the UK was ready for a Muslim prime minister, she said: “That’s not a thing that I can predict for the future but what I can tell you is you have a Muslim home secretary … and I think that shows the art of the possible in this country.”Explore more on these topicsShabana MahmoodImmigration and asylumDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It will be like the one in Paris,” Trump said, referring to the Arc de Triomphe, constructed between 1806 and 1836 at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, honoring those who died fighting for France in the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.“But to be honest with you,” Trump said, the new arch Haley will be in charge of constructing will be much better than the one Napoleon Bonaparte ordered up. “It blows it away. Blows it away in every way.”According to the president, his domestic policy chief was stunned by amodel of the triumphal archthe first time he saw it.Trump sued by preservation group over $300m White House ballroom projectRead more“Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming,” the president said, apparently reaching for the word “beaming” in his memory and not finding it.“I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it, and he wanted to do that,” Trump said.“That’s your primary thing,” the president said to Haley. “There is nothing that can compete with that.”Americansstrugglingwithincreased costsdue totariffsimposedby Trump on imported goods – or those whose health insurance premiums are set to double or triple in the coming weeks – might disagree with the president’s claim that the construction of an Arc de Triomphe knockoff should be the main focus of his chief domestic policy adviser.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationWashington DCUS domestic policyArchitectureUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone should want your elected leaders to do well and you don’t have to be scathing against him and saying: ‘I hate this person, hate that person.’ Just say: ‘Listen, I disagree. I wish they would consider something else.’”He said that too many lawmakers remain “in attack mode”, adding: “You are not the enemy. And the American people aren’t stupid.”Extremists exploit political ‘trigger events’ to recruit people online, says studyRead moreManchin had long been a Democrat but left the party in 2024 toregisteras an independent – shortly beforeretiringfrom theSenateafter 15 years in office.A wealthy coal industry executive, Manchin argued that the party had grown intolerant and heavy-handed toward ordinary citizens, placing the blame on progressive activists.In his Sunday remarks, Manchin urged both Democrats andRepublicansto free themselves from the influence of the “far left” and “far right” and focus instead on forming a “sensible majority” capable of advancing policy.“I’m fiscally responsible and socially compassionate,” Manchin said. “I think mostDemocratsand Republicans feel that way. They might have different ideas of how to solve the problem, but they all are Americans. They feel strongly about our country.”Manchin’s comments illustrated how members of both political parties have recentlycalled for a reductionin heated political discourse, particularly following Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah on 10 September.Authorities who investigated Kirk’s killing allege that the man charged with murdering the Turning Point USA co-founder did so after becoming sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”.On Saturday, during atown hallhosted by CBS, Erika Kirk said that “everyone has a responsibility” to tone things down.“I’m doing my part,” Kirk said in response to a question from an audience member. “I’m not in control of other people.”The question came fromUtah Valley Universitystudent Hunter Kozak, who had asked Charlie Kirk about political violence moments before Kirk was fatally shot.Kozak referenced tensions around political extremism and mentionedDonald Trump’s recent comments accusing six Democratic lawmakers of treason for telling US military members to resist unlawful commands. On Truth Social, the presidentaccusedthe lawmakers of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR” that was “punishable by DEATH!”“Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on Earth?” Kozak asked.Kirk replied that the problem was “so much more deeper than just one person”.Charlie Kirk’s death raises fears of ‘beginning of a darker chapter’ for US violenceRead moreRand Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, also warned on Sunday of a potential rise in political violence spurred by the recent bipartisan push to draw newredistricting mapsmeant to favor their parties.“I think that it’s going to lead to more civil tension and possibly more violence in our country,” he said onNBC News’s Meet the Press, saying the move is a “mistake” by both parties to boost their prospects in the 2026 midterm elections.“I think there is the potential that when people have no representation, that they feel disenfranchised, that it can lead and might lead to violence in our country,” he added.Sunday’s commentary came after Trump survived twoassassinationattemptswhile successfully running for a second presidency in 2024.

She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in animmigration crackdownthat has largely targeted Kenner, a New Orleans suburb with a large Hispanic population, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests across south-east Louisiana in December,according tothe Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded inLos Angeles,ChicagoandCharlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests havetaken away parentswho were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.Trump revives family separations amid drive to deport millions: ‘A tactic to punish’Read moreCruz’s detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old US citizen who finished high school this year, to care for his nine-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother’s bank account, locate his sister’s medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother’s name.“Honestly I’m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,” Escalante told the Associated Press. “But I’m willing to take them on if I have to. And I’m just praying that I get my mom back.”The crackdown dubbed “Operation Catahoula Crunch” has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting.Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories. And most in US immigration detention nationwide are immigrants with no criminal record, according to governmentdata.Billy Nungesser, Louisiana’s Republican lieutenant governor, recently became the first state official to break with his party overthe operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed homeout of fear.View image in fullscreenJonathan Escalante, left, and his mother, Vilma Cruz, pose for a photo at his high school graduation in Kenner, Louisiana, on 17 May.Photograph: AP“Are they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids?” Nungesser said.DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach toracially profileHispanic communities.Cruz’s family was supposed to move into their new home this coming January. She leased it so that her son could finally sleep in his own room.Kenner resident Kristi Rogers watched masked agents detain Cruz, a soon-to-be neighbor whom she had not yet met. Rogers said her heart went out to Cruz, and she wondered why she was targeted.“I’m for them trying to clean up the criminals in our area, but I’m hoping that’s all they are detaining and deporting – the criminals,” Rogers said.Jefferson and Orleans parish court records did not reveal any criminal history for Cruz, and her son said she had a clean record.In conservative Kenner, where Hispanics make up about a third of residents andDonald Trumpwon the last three presidential elections, police chief Keith Conley has said that the federal immigration operation is a “prayer answered”.As evidence of violence committed by immigrants in his city, Conley shared about a dozen press releases issued since 2022 documenting crimes in which the suspect was identified as being in the US illegally, including sex offenses, a killing, gang activity and shootings. He said residents were also at risk from immigrant drivers who are unlicensed and uninsured.Jose Reyes, a Honduran construction worker and landscaper whose family says he has lived in the US for 16 years, stayed home for weeks to avoid federal agents. But the father of four had to pay rent, so last week he drove to the bank around the corner.Unmarked vehicles began following Reyes and pulled up alongside his car as he parked in front of his house in Kenner. A video reviewed by AP showed several agents leaping out and removing Reyes from his car as his sobbing daughters screamed for mercy.View image in fullscreenPeople hug inside their family-operated gas station shop as border protection agents patrol outside in Kenner, Louisiana, on 5 December.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPA“We were begging that they let him go,” said his eldest daughter, 19-year-old Heylin Leonor Reyes. “He’s the one who provides for food, pays bills, pays the rent. We were begging them because they’re leaving a family totally in the dark, trying to figure out what to do, figuring out where to get money to get by.”Asked about the arrest, DHS said Jose Reyes committed an unspecified felony and had previously been deported from the US. The agency did not elaborate.US citizen chased by federal agents in New Orleans says she was targeted because ‘I’m brown’Read moreHis daughter, who works at a local restaurant, said her salary is not enough to keep a roof over the heads of her three younger siblings, two of whom she says were born in the US and are citizens. Her mother is caring for the youngest, a four-year-old, who watched agents grab her father from the doorway.Reyes said she is also seeking a lawyer for her father’s case. But they need to locate him first.“We were not given that information,” Reyes said. “We were given absolutely nothing.”Reyes has tried to shield her siblings from the stress surrounding their father’s detention.Escalante has not yet told his sister about their mother’s arrest, hoping Cruz can be released before he has to explain her absence.“I’m technically the adult of the house now,” he said. “I have to make these hard choices.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationLouisianaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The foot bones that lend the fossil its name were first discovered inSouth Africa1994, leading to a painstaking excavation over 20 years in the Sterkfontein cave system.Prof Ronald Clarke, a paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, who led the team that excavated the skeleton,attributed Little Footto the speciesAustralopithecus prometheus. Others believed it wasAustralopithecus africanus, a species first described in 1925 and which had previously been found in the same cave system.Australopithecus –meaning “southern ape”– was a group of hominins that existed inAfricaas early as 4.2m years ago.View image in fullscreenStudents visit Sterkfontein where Little Foot was discovered.Photograph: La Trobe UniversityHumans made fire 350,000 years earlier than previously thought, discovery in Suffolk suggestsRead moreBut a new study led by Australian researchers, published in theAmerican Journal of Biological Anthropology, has found that Little Foot’s traits differ from both species, raising a third possibility.“We think it is a formerly unknown, unsampled species of human ancestor,” said Dr Jesse Martin, an adjunct at La Trobe University in Melbourne, who led the research.“It doesn’t look likeAustralopithecus prometheus… but it also doesn’t look like all of theafricanusto come out of Sterkfontein.”View image in fullscreenA map showing the site where Little Foot was discovered.Illustration: La Trobe UniversityMartin, also a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Cambridge, added: “This thing will be part of a lineage of hominins, so it’s possible that we have not just a point in our human family tree that we hadn’t discovered before, but an entire limb of that tree.”Martin said Clarke was “one of the only people to maintain there were two species of hominin at Sterkfontein” and had been “proven to be correct” in that regard.“Where [Clarke] and I depart is I would argue one is definitely notprometheus,” he said.The researchers identified key differences distinguishing Little Foot fromAustralopithecus africanus, including a longer nuchal plane – a region at the back of the skull.“The bottom back of the skull is supposed to be fairly conserved in human evolution, which is to say it doesn’t change that rapidly,” Martin said. “If you find differences between things in the base of the cranium … those differences are more likely to represent different species, because they just don’t change readily, evolutionarily speaking. All of the differences we’ve found are in that region.“To find evidence hiding in plain sight at Sterkfontain of an entirely new species is kind of remarkable and counterintuitive,” Martin added, given “it is the most complete human ancestral fossil in the record”.“We should be able to figure out where it sits in the human family tree.”The study’s authors have not formally reclassified Little Foot, suggesting: “It is more appropriate that a new species be named by the research team that has spent more than two decades excavating and analysing the remarkable Little Foot specimen. We hope they will view our suggestion in this regard as well-intentioned advice.”There has also been disagreement among scientists about Little Foot’s age. The fossil skeleton has been dated as3.67m years old, but other scientists have suggested Little Foot cannot be older than2.8m years.Prof Ronald Clarke, who discovered the skeleton, has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEvolutionArchaeologySouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

As that commitment draws closer to expiring, concerns have been raised about whether the US company will continue to fully fund Sky News, which has an annual budget of £100m but is thought to make losses of as much as £80m.Dana Strong, the chief executive of Sky, recently told staff that the broadcaster would continue to back the news operation regardless of any ongoing support by Comcast, which has cut jobs at NBC News in the US.It is understood that if any deal to buy ITV is tabled it would include guarantees not to seek permission from the media regulator Ofcom to vary any of the conditions of its public service broadcast licence, which includes commitments to national and regional news.Last year, ITV accepted the terms of a new licence which will remain in place until 2034. In May, it also agreed a new five-year news output deal with ITN, which observers point out effectively operates as a guarantee that the status quo will be maintained in the event of a takeover.“There are definitely questions about plurality,” says Stewart Puvis, a former ITN chief executive. “Theoretically Comcast could, say, merge Sky and ITV News and use its position as a 40% shareholder in ITN to assert control and offer Channel 4 and Channel 5 continued news supply but on more expensive terms. I would hope Comcast realise ways of solving these problems [if the ITV deal happens].“They did a deal protecting Sky News to get control of Sky, so they have been round this course before, they understand the sensitivities. The main priority is to keep an eye on their intentions.”British TV executives have previously warned of the risk posed to the UK’s system of public service broadcasers (PSBs) bylarge parts of the British television industry being snapped upby US corporations.In July, Ofcom published a report warning that public service television, such as news provision and prestige UK-focused content such as ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office,risks becoming an “endangered species”as viewers migrate to US online platforms and streamers.View image in fullscreenOfcom revealed data showing YouTube had overtaken ITV to become the UK’s second most-watched media service, behind only the BBC.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersThe watchdog also published data showing that YouTube hadovertaken ITV to become the UK’s second most-watched media service, behind only the BBC, with it and Netflix now thetwo most popular first TV destinations among four- to 15-year-olds.There are those that believe that a Sky takeover of ITV, against a backdrop of the rise of the viewer shift to mostly US digital companies, heralds the need for closer collaboration between the UK’s biggest broadcasters.“The UK wants and needs its own part of mass media which isn’t US controlled,” says a second broadcasting executive. “It’s a national strategic imperative.I think the government need to work out how the boards of the PSBs have a new part to their remits that obligates them to collaborate.“In terms of an ITV takeover it is less of an issue given Sky’s history in the UK, on balance I think it would help the PSBs as it strengthens ITV. It’s more to do with how the rest of the PSB system would need to readjust.”Given that advertisers follow eyeballs, a combination of Sky and ITV could create a British TV and streaming powerhouse, with the two companies’ sales houses controlling 73% of the total ad spend on traditional TV and broadcasters’ streaming services combined.Any deal will trigger an investigation by the UK competition watchdog, which historically would not have allowed the combination, as James Murdoch found out after making an audacious move to becomethe biggest shareholder in ITV in 2006.However, Sky is hoping that the regulator will widen the scope of its definition of the ad market to include the impact of giants such as YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.The government has also been pushing regulators to be more “pro-business”, with former Amazon UK chief Doug Gurrinstalled at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).For clearance to be given Sky is likely to, at the least, look to shed its third-party ad sales deals. It handles the contracts for media owners including Channel 5 and Warner Bros Discovery – now facing its own takeover battle between rivalbids from NetflixandParamount Skydance– to reduce its dominance.View image in fullscreenA Sky-ITV deal would leave Channel 4 a relative commercial minnow when it comes to TV and digital ad sales.Photograph: Tony Watson/Alamy“I think it will get cleared,” says Alex DeGroote, a media analyst. “Comcast will do everything it can to say it will maintain the PSB status quo and obligations, to give the impression it will be a good owner. But you don’t buy to ultimately keep everything the same.“ITV plus Sky will give them 70% of the [traditional] TV ad market, close to a monopoly. The thrust of the debate will be the CMA being encouraged not to put insurmountable obstacles in place.”Channel 4 hasseen off multiple attempts at privatisationby Conservative governments that argued it would not be able to compete against digital companies such as Netflix and YouTube without outside investment.Now, given theweakened state of the BBCand the commercial threat to Channel 4, which relies on advertising for the vast majority of its income, there are those that believe sporadic talk over the past 15 years on the need for closer collaboration between the two is likely to become a necessity.“We may at some point end up in that situation because of the deep cumulative cuts since 2010 in the BBC’s real-terms funding and because Channel 4, too, has a structural funding problem, which is not its fault,” says Patrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at London Business School.“Channel 4 has repeatedly beaten the predictions, but that is just postponing the problem. It’s now beginning to run out of road.”Explore more on these topicsITVSkyComcastChannel 4ITNMedia businessTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It outlines how PeopleCert plans to relocate a third of those jobs toGreece“at a cost [of] up to 50% lower”. The same quantity of roles “are due to not be replaced due to overlapping functions”, the presentation sets out, while the remainder will be rehired in the UK.The result will slash personnel costs as a proportion of revenue by 15 percentage points from 69% to 54% within two years, with a target of eventually matching the Greek group’s ratio of 26%.There is a “clear opportunity to transition C&G operations from a non-profit business model to a best-in-class, lean corporate structure, unlocking further profitability”, the presentation adds.The plan to replace skilled UK staff with lower-cost alternatives and cut the workforce by attrition might appear out of place with the image of the City & Guilds ofLondonInstitute (CGLI), which has made its reputation by helping people become more employable and increasing their skills since Victorian times.The charity’sfamous alumniinclude the celebrity gardener Alan Titchmarsh, the television chef Ainsley Harriott and the fashion designer Karen Millen.CGLI said the deal selling C&G to PeopleCert would “unlock new opportunities” for the qualifications body, including access to technology that it said would improve its training services.A spokesperson said: “Whilst some jobs may change through natural attrition, others will be created through strategic expansion, enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness for our learners and customers in an increasingly digital and AI-enabled world.”They said the proceeds of the sale generated “a significant fund” for CGLI, which now operates as a “social impact charity” called City & Guilds Foundation.“Whilst an exact figure cannot be revealed, along with the proceeds of this sale, CGLI will have circa £180m-£200m in gross assets under management to ensure its long-term sustainability and continued commitment to skills,” the spokesperson added.“All the gains from the sale were accrued to CGLI/City & Guilds Foundation, which now operates independently from C&G Ltd.”The charity focuses on services to help people progress in the workplace, including training bursaries and funding to support “displaced people, former offenders, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds”.PeopleCert did not respond to efforts to contact it. The Greek company will retain the City & Guilds brand for its training courses.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Now a new TV version turns up the temperature several notches – but will its stars develop a rivalry of their own?Sun 14 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShare“Aprodigal son story with God as the father,” is how actor Paul Bettany describes Amadeus, the Peter Shaffer play that became a celebrated film in 1984. Both depict the rivalry between Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri andWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a former child phenomenon whose towering talent exposes Salieri as mediocre and stuck in his ways. Salieri, who believes a composer’s gift to be divine, is so affronted by this upstart that he renounces God and sets about destroying Mozart.Now Amadeus has been remade for TV, with Will Sharpe in the title role and Bettany as Salieri. The series, which begins with Mozart arriving in Vienna in a rickety carriage and promptly throwing up in the street, is written byJoe Barton, the Black Doves and Giri/Haji writer known for his leftfield approach to genre TV. Little surprise, then, that Amadeus takes liberties with the classic period drama, injecting it with modern-day dialogue and gloriously anarchic flourishes. While I won’t divulge the details of an early sex scene between Mozart and a young soprano, safe to say you won’t look at a macaron the same way again.Sharpe and Bettany are both talking via video call. From his kitchen in New York – and wearing a T-shirt with the word “Amateur” on the chest – Bettany, 54, is voluble and funny, given to hoots of laughter, while 39-year-old Sharpe, at home in north London, is quieter and more contemplative. Filming for Amadeus took place in Budapest, a city that Sharpe notes “has lots of beautiful performing arts spaces and a strong opera scene, meaning the interior shots could be done there, too”. Less good was that they were shooting in the height of summer in wigs and full period costume. “There was lots of joking about how it was a character choice for Mozart to be covered in sweat the whole time,” he says. “But there was no other way, even in the scenes before Mozart becomes unwell. Someone would come and pat me dry and in about six and a half seconds I would be soaked again.”View image in fullscreenOrchestral manoeuvres … Will Sharpe (centre) as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/Sky UKIf the heat weren’t bad enough, Bettany had to deal with spending five and a half hours in the makeup chair having decades added to his face. As with the film, the story is framed by the elderly Salieri, who has been committed to an asylum, looking back with remorse on his old life. Where the movie has Salieri confessing to a priest, the TV series finds him spilling his guts to Mozart’s widow, Constanze (Gabrielle Creevy). “All the hair that you see on his face and neck is real human hair [applied] individually, so there was nothing comfortable about it,” Bettany recalls. “It was fascinating because beforehand I thought I had an idea of [how to play] old Salieri – or old hairy Sally, as I call him. But there I am in front of the mirror with all this stuff glued to my face and when I started speaking, I realised: Oh God, it’s completely different to what I had in my head. I could push the character so much further.”For the actors, much of the appeal of reprising Amadeus lay in the freedom of having five episodes in which to tell the story. “I think that allowed us the space and bandwidth to explore it from different points of view,” says Sharpe. “We’re still driving the story with Salieri’s manic jealousy, but you get Constanze’s perspective on their lives as well.” Bettany, who made his name in the early 2000s in Gangster No 1 and the medieval comedy A Knight’s Tale, made the move into big-budget TV relatively recently with Marvel’sWandaVision. He says he still finds the frantic schedule of a TV show “baffling … When I get to the end of the day when I’m making a movie, I can think about the day’s work. When I’m making a TV show and I get to the end of the day, I can’t remember how it began.”Sharpe, who is also a writer and director – a decade ago, he directed, co-wrote and starred in Channel 4’sFlowers, about a depressed children’s author – has risen to fame in the era of prestige TV, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance as a wealthy tech entrepreneur in the second series of The White Lotus. For him, the speed of filming “adds to the adrenaline, you just want to keep moving. It can be very helpful to be in a place where you have to be instinctive.”Long before starting the project, both actors knew Amadeus the movie well. Bettany calls it “the last greatMiloš Formanmovie. I don’t have a problem with going back and watching other performances [as research], but I didn’t need to with this. I’ve seen it so many times. If [ours] had been a film, I might have gone: ‘Well what’s the point? It’s already been done.’ But because it was for TV, it felt different.” The Forman movie, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1985, also earned F Murray Abraham an Oscar for best actor. Did that make him a tough act to follow? Bettany shakes his head. “I’m quite practical about these things. There have been lots of great Hamlets, so why not have a new Salieri? And I think he’s eminently relatable. We’ve all had some venal, mendacious, awful instincts and then hopefully not acted on them. It’s quite fun to have the opportunity to just let go of it all and go to war with God.”Salieri wants something that Mozart has, but would Salieri actually want it if he knew what it meant?Sharpe’s approach to playing Mozart was not to think too hard about him as a cultural giant and more as a man who “is literally trying to get through the day”. Even so, he says his entry point was the music, much of which “I was coming to afresh. I had never had my opera epiphany but, making this, I started to understand it. And it is extraordinary. Some of it’s so playful and light and kind of mischievous and dainty. And then in other places, it’s really dark and grand.” Those “seemingly conflicting elements” in Mozart’s music turned out to be a valuable resource, providing insight into the psyche of their creator.To get to grips with the music, Bettany had the advantage of having a son who is a composer and studying for his master’s, and who explained to him that “operas were really composers’ money-spinners. They thought of symphonies as their serious work, and the operas were kind of like the seven-inch [singles].” Bettany’s son was also invaluable in talking him through other aspects of the life of a composer. Mozart is depicted as having a constant musical soundtrack in his head, something that Salieri desperately covets. “So I asked my son: what’s the truth of that? Do composers really have music in their heads?” Bettany says. “And he said he really does. Sometimes he’ll have two competing melodies and he’ll have to write one down, as otherwise his mind is absolute chaos.”View image in fullscreenPassing the baton … Paul Bettany as Salieri and Will Sharpe as Mozart.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/Sky UK LtdAmadeus is primarily about the relationship of Mozart and Salieri of course, making it the ultimate dramatic two-hander. Mozart’s first formal appearance at the court of the music-loving emperor, Joseph II (Rory Kinnear), is in a piano battle where he rips Salieri’s sheet music off the stand, exclaiming: “Oh yuck. Who wrote this?” Asked what sort of preparation goes into a portrait of a relationship powered by antagonism and envy, both actors’ answers boil down to: not much. “It wasn’t like we were conspiring heavily beforehand about how to play it,” says Sharpe. “We had never met before, so we were getting a feel for each other within the scenes, which brought an extra frisson. But I felt like we didn’t need to talk about the dynamic too much. Salieri is devising Mozart’s [downfall] while Mozart is largely oblivious, so there’s a degree to which we’re carrying our own agendas.”Mozart may be oblivious to Salieri’s machinations, but Salieri never ceases thinking about and plotting against Mozart. “On paper,” Bettany says, “Will does lots of scenes without me in them, but every scene that I’m in has Mozart in one way or another. The ghost of him is there.”“The fact is,” Sharpe adds, “that Salieri wants something that Mozart has, but Mozart doesn’t necessarily want it. And would Salieri actually want it if he knew what it meant? In Shaffer’s play and in Amadeus, the film, Mozart is presented as this absolute genius, almost like a superhero of music. But here we had the space to explore it, like: what would that have been like in the day-to-day? What is that in reality? From Amadeus’s perspective, the attention of God feels like a burden. It’s quite painful to have that responsibility.”I  did feel there was room for a more minor-key approach. I wasn’t going into scenes thinking: How am I going to be insufferable this timeMozart’s unravelling is not helped by his drinking and philandering, although it’s Salieri who pushes him over the edge. Following the death of Mozart’s overbearing father, whose approval the young Wolfgang had desperately sought, Salieri begins dressing up as a masked figure whom Mozart believes to be his father’s ghost. I wonder if Sharpe’s performance, especially in Mozart’s final weeks as he despairingly tries to compose a requiem, was informed by his own bipolar diagnosis, which he also knitted into Flowers. “I think it must do obliquely,” he replies, “but I wasn’t really wanting to approach it in an overly academic way. Going mad is not something that’s easy to play, because it’s quite an abstract thing. And so I wanted to approach it scene by scene, figuring out: what is he trying to achieve? Where is he trying to get to?”In Forman’s film, Mozart’s latent instability is signalled by a mercurial nature and maniacal laugh that is deliberately insufferable. But for Barton’s drama, Sharpe says, “I did feel like maybe there was room for a more minor-key approach. Of course, he is insufferable when Salieri or Constanze are experiencing him. But I wasn’t going into a scene rubbing my hands and thinking: How am I going to be insufferable this time?”Rock on, Shostakovich, Handel, Ravel: lives of great composers hit the screensRead moreIt is one of the central ironies of Amadeus that Salieri is simultaneously Mozart’s greatest enemy and his No 1 fan. Bettany may not believe an actor’s gift is God-given, but can he understand Salieri’s professional envy? Has he ever dreamed of bumping off one of his acting rivals?“Well, as Gore Vidal said: ‘Every time I hear of a friend’s success, a little bit of me dies,’” he laughs. “Oftentimes, when you’re working with actors, it feels like a sporting event, like somebody is going to try and beat you at acting, whereas I want to come at it like a team game where we can be more than the sum of our parts. In Amadeus, I felt safe in the knowledge that Will approached it the same way as me. But if he gets all the good reviews and I start feeling a hot hatred towards him? Well, we’ll see what happens.”Amadeus will air onSky Atlantic and Now from 21 December.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPaul BettanyWolfgang Amadeus MozartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what unites them – and is there a formula for this type of success?Emma LoffhagenSun 14 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareThere is a particular kind of literary deja vu that strikes sometimes. Seemingly out of nowhere, the same book starts appearing across multiple social media feeds. On the bus, you’ll spot two copies of the same title in one day. A friend says, “Have you read this yet?”, to which you respond, “Someone was just telling me about it the other day.”These are the sleeper hits that seem to materialise without warning. They are not stacked high on the new release tables. They are books that, for one reason or another, have slipped their original timelines and found a second, often more powerful life.For a long time, the lifecycle of a book followed a similar ritual: publication-week fanfare, a few reviews and festival appearances, and then a slow fade unless garlanded with awards. But today’s sleeper hits emerge from an alchemical combination of influences: online enthusiasm, translation, design, political mood, bookseller advocacy and sheer serendipity.Perhaps the standout example from this year is the runaway success of Jacqueline Harpman’s dystopian feminist novellaI Who Have Never Known Men. Originally published in French in 1995, it follows a girl imprisoned underground with 39 other women, raised in captivity, then released into a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape she must try to make sense of. It was translated into English in 1997 and was a marked failure in both markets. The English version was left to languish under the (decidedly worse) title The Mistress of Silence, and global sales were at one or two per year.It’s tempting to imagine sleeper hits as miraculous accidents, but the machinery underneath is increasingly deliberateFast forward three decades, and the book has sold 275,000 copies worldwide this year, a 143% jump on 2024. It has sold 75,000 copies in the UK alone – more than double last year’s figure. It has appeared on themust-read lists of Service95, a book club and website set up by Dua Lipa, and is one of the buzziest titles on TikTok.Its renaissance was a mixture of luck and strategy. Its publisher, Vintage Classics, reissued the novel in English in 2019 after a canny executive made the case for it. The new version was repackaged, retranslated and had its original title restored.Part of its success was timing. As Nick Skidmore, publishing director at Vintage, explains, the reissue came “in the wake of Trump’s inauguration … at that time The Handmaid’s Tale and dystopia more generally were selling”. Harpman’s book tapped into that bewilderment, Skidmore says: “A lot of people don’t know where we are, or how we got to this place, and were looking to fiction to help explain that.”A large factor was also its retranslation. Ros Schwartz, the book’s translator, was acutely aware that her first translation in the 1990s had missed the narrator’s voice. Much of it was written in esoteric, literary language, which didn’t chime with the experience of the callow protagonist.“I realised I had translated the words and not the voice,” she says. She stripped out “Latinate words” that had lifted the prose into an overly formal register and restored contractions, which had been missing entirely.In fact, a striking number of recent word-of-mouth successes have been translated works. Translation can crack open a book’s potential, giving it a new voice and therefore a new audience.Perfection – Vincenzo Latronico’s slim, wry novel about an aspirational creative-class couple documenting (and slowly warping) their lives through the pursuit of aesthetic “perfection” – is one such example. Published in Italian in 2022, the book didn’t take off at home; it was only once Fitzcarraldo Editionspublished it in English in Februarythis year (translated by Sophie Hughes) that the phenomenon began. Suddenly, the book was everywhere, appearing in every carefully photographed bedside stack and “April Reads” carousel, becoming the unofficial book of Instagram – and it went on to be shortlisted for the International Booker.Latronico recalls that in the first weeks after the book came out in English, his publisher sent him anInstagramstory from “a famous literary figure recommending my book”. It was an audience Fitzcarraldo “does not usually reach”, his publisher told him. He describes the uncanny experience of being read predominantly in translation. “I honestly think the English translation is better than the Italian version,” he says of Hughes’s rendering. This has produced a “strange position” in which “the majority of my readers are not from the culture I am from”.He believes that this cultural distance is partly why the book exploded in London and New York. For Italians or those outside big cities in Europe, the lifestyle he portrays is “not that common, it is quite exotic”. For Berliners, it felt too familiar. But for anglophone creative-class readers, it struck the sweet spot of recognition and distance. “It has now sold more copies in specific London bookshops than in the whole of France, for example,” says Latronico.Not all trending hits are bleak or skewering satires – some are buoyed up by the desire for refuge. Mary Mount, publisher at Picador, believes the global rise of Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s Before the Coffee Gets Cold series (translated by Geoffrey Trousselot) is rooted in escapism. The books, set around a small Tokyo cafe where customers can travel back in time for the duration of a single cup of coffee, have built a devoted cult following since publication, selling around the world and spreading steadily through online reader communities.“Kawaguchi has created a world you want to return to,” Mount says. These are “cosy, comforting” titles – exactly what many readers want. The series has now sold more than 1m copies worldwide, and Before the Coffee Gets Cold has been the bestselling Japanese book in translation for three years in a row. Sales quadrupled in 2022, partially helped by aTikToktrend of people reading the series with a coffee that has helped to boost sales in international markets, according to its publisher.Design and the physicality of books matter here, too. In a video-first online ecosystem, content creators know that an aesthetically pleasing cover will drive clicks, and arresting covers are also more likely to make it to Instagram feeds. “They are beautiful physical books in both hardback and paperback,” Mount says, “and we invest a lot in how the books look and feel, because readers show their copies and discuss the books on social media.”The role of Fitzcarraldo’s trademark branding – the minimalist Klein blue cover – was undeniable in the success of Perfection, too. “The book benefited immensely from Fitzcarraldo’s vibe and reputation,” Latronico says. Their titles are often a badge of cultural capital on social feeds and in tote bags, an irony not lost on Latronico. “The book is about things that look good on Instagram, and it has become a thing that looks good on Instagram itself.”The rebranding of I Who Have Never Known Men shows this process in action. The newcover by Anna Morrisonis, Skidmore says, “already somewhat iconic” and helped position the book as “a strange, mesmerising and beautiful novel”.It’s tempting to imagine sleeper hits as miraculous accidents: a lone reader praising a book, then a chain reaction of friends pressing copies into hands. But the machinery underneath is increasingly deliberate.Bookshops play a crucial role, says Bea Carvalho, head of books at Waterstones. When a book begins to stir, Waterstones can “ensure that we are part of the conversation”, placing it in more stores. Sometimes, she notes, “this can start with one individual, sometimes with a splashy pre-publication buzz”, but either way, “booksellers are now increasingly good at harnessing it”.Meanwhile, in recent years, a number of publishing houses and imprints have created dedicated programmes for unearthing forgotten classics. “There’s an art to it,” says Skidmore. “You have to resurface the right book at the right time. My desk is full of lists of books that I know could and should find new readers, but they all need to wait patiently for the right set of circumstances – be that a publicity hook, a design trend, a celebrity or influencer endorsement – to come along, or be engineered successfully.”If there is one constant across these stories, it’s unpredictability. “There’s no formula for success,” Schwartz says. Latronico is similarly sceptical. “I had zero expectations when I wrote this book,” he admits. “I’m trying to remember that this kind of thing doesn’t happen twice.”Explore more on these topicsBooksSocial trendsFictionFiction in translationMarketing & PRBooksellersTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the better part of a century, ambitious theater artists have endeavored to climb the mountains ofLong Day’s Journey Into NightandThe Iceman Cometh. Less so for Anna Christie, a strange piece about a supposedly ruined woman trying to get her life back in order.It’s an interesting choice of vehicle for starMichelle Williams, making her return to the stage after anine-yearhiatus. Anna Christie is an erratic and now quite dated play, one whose moral outlook is hard to parse, its shifts in tone sudden and varied. There’s also the matter that at 45, Williams is about a quarter-century older than O’Neill’s heroine, who is meant to be a hardened and battered young woman trying to start her adult life on new footing.Marjorie Prime review – Cynthia Nixon steals sad, and spotty, sci-fi revivalRead moreBut Williams and her husband, the director Thomas Kail, have decided to tackle the play anyway, in a new production at St Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn. (Apt for the play’s nautical theme, St Ann’s sits right alongside a busy waterway.) One hopes that at least Williams and Kail got what they wanted out of the experience, because the audience is served very little of substance in this tedious and mercurial staging.Broadwaylegend Bryan d’Arcy James plays Chris, the salty captain of a barge that hauls up and down the eastern seaboard. He used to go on more far-flung maritime adventures, but he has become fearful of the briny deep. So fearful, in fact, that he sent his only daughter far into the interior of the country, to frigid Minnesota, to be raised by family. Now, 15 years later, Anna has ventured east to find her father, fleeing a past that involved brutal work at a brothel.Anna is furious at men, perhaps particularly her father for abandoning her. But she needs his help, too, and the two eventually form a wary bond – Chris convinced that Anna is a woman of pure virtue, far from the scum and scallywags he is forced to associate with. When just such a rogue, a steamship stoker named Mat (Tom Sturridge), comes sniffing around attempting to woo Anna, tensions begin to mount.Though, there’s really not much tension at all in Kail’s lurching, lumbering production. Unless you count the stress of watching d’Arcy James, Williams and Sturridge wrestling to gain control of unwieldy accents. Chris, who is Swedish, sounds Irish. Mat, who is Irish, sounds Mancunian. And Anna … well, poor Anna zigs and zags from flat-voweled Minnesotan to faint Brooklynese to what could maybe only be described as WC Fields.But those are minor technical matters. The real problem of this Anna Christie is its failure to make any of this gendered, conservative strife feel urgent, or really worthy of our time. The case for remounting this curious play is never convincingly made. Williams is obviously the star attraction, but in all her tearful fluster and gathered mettle, she can’t get a handle on the role. It’s an unfortunate bit of miscasting that leaves the production struggling to find its center of gravity.Sturridge overeggs Mat’s prowling allure and menace, making a lot of big acting-class choices that don’t legibly translate as human. D’Arcy James is more relaxed in his role, but his nuance is too easily subsumed by Williams and Sturridge’s histrionics.‘It went gangbusters’: the play about the Iraq war – told through the eyes of a starving Baghdad zoo tigerRead moreKail tries many things to make this mess of performance feel like a dynamic piece of art. Actors (rather needlessly) rearrange sets between scenes, overlong transitions that are scored by original compositions fromNicholas Britell(who, among other things, wrote the theme to Succession). There are some trust falls, a fog machine is frequently employed (as fog is a heavy motif in O’Neill’s text), a great metal beam spins ominously over the proceedings. But it’s all adornment of a sinking ship, a production that seems to have no concrete or compelling stance on what forces have sent these people crashing into one another.There’s a miserablism to Anna Christie that might partly be inherent to the play, bleak as O’Neill’s view of these working-class folks is. Kail, though, adds some squalor of his own, a terribly abiding sense that these downtrodden characters are mere experiments for the actors, that all of this was done as a test of capability rather than being driven by a thoughtful and complex motivation to reinterpret a tricky text. All the very talented people involved would probably get a decent grade for this scene study in theater school, but it’s not a vessel fit for paying customers.Explore more on these topicsStageMichelle WilliamsEugene O'NeillUS theaterTheatreNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Divas, of course, are used to leaping from castle walls or being swept away in avalanches but seldom is a singer required to be swallowed whole by a monstrous gourmand. Payne plays June Spoon, the vociferous host of a TV cookery programme, and whether or not she will be “passed” or, alas, be turned into excrement is the 11th-hour dilemma in this frankly bonkers show.The idea was cooked up (pardon the pun) back in 2008 when Irish composer David Fennessy and director Nicholas Bone hooked up withDavid Shrigley, the visual artist famous for his distinctive, darkly humorous line drawings and witty captions. Described as “a sort-of opera,” it premiered at Glasgow’s Tramway in 2011.Shrigley considers life with its mundane cruelties and responds with a scabrous wit and deadpan irreverence. In the opera, June and her hapless assistant Phillip Fork, plan a slap-up meal for the reputedly baby-eating Mr Granules. The real heroes, however, are the foodstuffs: a trio of terrified tubers, a manic-depressive egg and a banana convinced of his superiority as an exotic fruit compared with mere root vegetables. The cast is completed by a psychotic butcher and a dancing turd.View image in fullscreenOn air … hosts Amy J Payne as June Spoon and Xavier Hetherington as Phillip Fork, centre, with  Frazer Scott’s Mr Egg and Mark Nathan’s Banana.Photograph: Tom ArberFennessy’s score, played by an onstage chamber orchestra of 11 all dressed as chefs, held the attention throughout. Rooted in 20th-century modernism – at its most macabre, Birtwistle’sPunch and Judysprang to mind – he wasn’t averse to trotting out a tune here and there or even purloining Für Elise. Motoric rhythms, caustic strings and the hiss of sharpening knives all played their part, as did wah-wah trombone, chamber organ, harp and a kitchen drawerful of percussion. Opera North music director Garry Walker kept things tight, especially important given the orchestra was frequently required to sing and shout.Bek Palmer’s set complete with table, counter and shiny red fridge complemented the playful costumes, designed by Shrigley in his signature style. With their tiny eyes and quivering slits for mouths, the doomed vegetables were surprisingly moving amid the general air of lunacy. The silent Mr Granules, a cross between a waddling ogre and a gluttonous businessman, was a hoot. The resourceful Bone moved his pieces around the board with a cool efficiency.Payne worked tirelessly as Spoon, pumping out the decibels each time she hurled forth the word “soup”. She was well paired with Xavier Heatherington, who slipped effortlessly in and out of head voice as the querulous Fork. Mark Nathan was an authoritative Banana with Peter Van Hulle a curiously disturbing Butcher. Stealing the show, though, was Frazer Scott doubling as Mr Egg and the delightfully lavatorial Shit.At Howard Assembly Room, Leeds, until 21 DecemberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera NorthDavid ShrigleyreviewsShareReuse this content"

He suggested that the map of North America would look more beautiful without it.Historians pointed out that the border reflected a complex history and an everyday reality for millions, but they also admitted that Trump wasn’t entirely wrong. Much of the border does follow a straight line – the 49th parallel – and the Americans and Britons who drew it up knew almost nothing about local geography.Trump’s gambit drew attention to the fact that the maps most of us grew up with convey a deceptively tidy view of the world – one parcelled into homogeneous blocks that admits no challenge to its objectivity, omniscience or truth.Historian William Rankin of Yale University traces this view back to 18th-century British cartographers who produced “jigsaw-puzzle maps” as teaching aids for children of the aristocracy. These maps, which represented countries with clear-cut frontiers and doubled as the first jigsaw puzzles, remained a fixture of education for more than a century. They still shape our thinking today: what started out as a geography lesson evolved into a way of depicting variability in indicators such as life expectancy or GDP per capita, with each country-block represented by a single number. “I think that does real damage, not just to how we understand those countries, but to how we understand inequality,” says Rankin.Some are now calling for a mapping revolution. Last year, political geographer Henk van Houtum of Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, issued a call to “Free the Map”. He wants to replace the state-centric mindset with one that emphasises mobility and human connections. Or as he puts it, to swap Atlas, buckling under the weighty globe, for his grandson Hermes – he of the winged sandals, messenger between worlds.Van Houtum is an expert on European border policy and migration, which is routinely depicted on maps byswooping arrowsthat suggest invasion (for those old enough, think theDad’s Army’s opening sequence). “The faceless, massive arrow is primarily the perspective of the state,” he writes. “It emphasises the imagined homogeneity of the nation and the exceptionality of the border crossing of non-natives.” In response to his and others’ critiques, Frontex, Europe’s border and coastguard agency, has replaced the menacing arrows on its migratory maps with less alarmist – though still non-neutral –circles of varying sizes, and legions of schoolteachers have promised to change the visual narrative in their classrooms.For his part, Rankin wants cartography to embrace a new set of values. Both the collection and visualisation of data are flawed human enterprises that require interpretation, he says. Rather than aspire to neutrality, objectivity and sharp distinctions, map‑makers should embrace uncertainty, subjectivity and multiplicity. His book,Radical Cartography, is filled with maps that challenge the dominant narrative. One depicts European and American exploration over 500 years from the early 1400s, not in terms of where the explorers planted their flags, but the places they reached that had never previously been inhabited. These amounted to “several dozen islands and a huge amount of ice”.That’s informative both about how much of the globe humans had already settled by the middle ages, and about the genuine discovery that happened after that. It contrasts with an 18th-century map of North America currently on display in the British Library’sSecret Mapsexhibition, which shows indigenous lands as blank spaces, “to provide an impression that they were unoccupied and available for acquisition”, says Tom Harper, the library’s lead curator of antiquarian maps.In the 1980s, the pavement dwellers of Mumbai, India, staved off eviction by mapping themselves. Civil rights activists in the US had been doing the same for a while, to highlight inequality, and this kind of “countermapping” became a favoured tool of indigenous or marginalised peoples for making themselves seen by those in power. It is a huge and ongoing task. By the 1990s, when Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, had been a significant slum for well over half a century, it still showed up on official maps as forest.New knowledge makes new cartographic demands. When The Lancet published amapof global hotspots for emerging infectious diseases in 2012, somecriticisedit for pointing the finger at poorer regions while shielding the conglomerates whose investments were driving new patterns of land use in those regions, and reshaping disease ecologies in the process. Follow the money, the critics said, and you’ll locate the real disease hotspots – in London, New York and Hong Kong.Technical wizardry is constantly expanding the possibilities for visualising patterns in data, but Rankin and Van Houtum’s point is that the perfect map will never exist. An animation that shows how slavery evolved over time in the southern US may tell a more nuanced story than a static map, but it focuses attention on one possible end of the story – abolition – rather than on slavery’s historical scars.Accepting that perfection is unattainable allows us to be more forgiving of imperfection, as illustrated by the case of the Mercator projection, a map of the world created by the 16th-century cartographer Gerardus Mercator as a navigational aid. Since it’s impossible to depict a sphere in two dimensions without introducing distortion, every flattened world map makes trade-offs. In Mercator’s case, it’s accurate at small scale, but at large scale the size of landmasses near the poles is exaggerated relative to those nearer the equator.Cartographers retired Mercator a century or more ago for that reason, while others objected to its imperialist associations. But starting around 2005 it made a comeback as thestandard world map used in web applications. These capitalise on its strengths, either by preventing viewers from zooming out, or by switching to a spherical view at large scale. Its flaws minimised, complemented by other visual stories, Mercator is enjoying a new lease of life.Further readingFree the Mapby Henk van Houtum (NAI, £38.25)Radical Cartographyby William Rankin (Picador, £30)Secret Mapsby Tom Harper, Nick Dykes and Magdalena Peszko (British Library, £40)Explore more on these topicsMapsThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is Charles Dickens’ parlour, where he has just finished writing A Christmas Carol, and it’s dinner time.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Great Christmas Feast is an immersive production in which a three-course meal is served while a quicksilver Dickens (David Alwyn) narrates his ghost story about the perils of penny-pinching in the season of goodwill.Immersive theatrehas evidently concocted a tasty festive offshoot that might suit those tired of watching yet another straight-up adaptation of the classic tale.Versions of cabaret and interactive dinner theatre have long existed, including Faulty Towers: The Dining Experience, while Rebecca Frecknall’s West End staging of Cabaret offersfood and drink packagesfor premium ticket holders at the Kit Kat Club. What has been notable in recent years is how sumptuous some site-specific productions are becoming, with an elaborate convergence of spectacle, story, music and food. They certainly solve the conundrum ofwhento eat dinner. Before a show usually seems too early, afterwards too late. “During” is the perfect solution, I think, as I enter this music-filled production, which is in its eighth year.View image in fullscreenGhosts of Christmas repasts … The Great Christmas Feast.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMy dinner companion and I have come hungry, and we are not kept waiting. My welcome drink is a mix of non-alcoholic cider, chestnut cordial, ginger and spice tinctures. A starter is served with period newspaper decor and rustic-looking mains – roast duck or pithivier of shiitake and king oyster mushrooms for vegetarians like me along with lovely trimmings (mulled red cabbage, spiced parsnip puree). It is a hearty plate of food followed by Christmas pudding, and in keeping with its period setting (archives and historical manuals are scoured by the production company, The Lost Estate, under the executive chef Ashley Clarke, previously of the Gordon Ramsay Group).The audience have been advised to dress up, and there are top hats, waistcoats, ruffled dresses and feathered fascinators all around. My dinner companion has rocked up in sweatshirt and trainers and now tries to pass herself off as a Victorian ragamuffin.The story is divided into distinct acts, told between courses around the room and on a central platform in the round, sometimes stopping at a cliffhanger. A few diners are enlisted to read a short exchange of dialogue from a script, and are clearly tickled to be asked.View image in fullscreenFull command of the material …David Alwyn in The Great Christmas Feast.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAlwyn is charismatic, playful and in full command of the material, and there is pin-drop silence as he performs. Three versatile musicians around him (Guy Button, Beth Higham-Edwards and Kieran Carteron) play string instruments and percussion. There are lovely minimalist elements too – the three Christmas spirits are cleverly evoked, surprises come from different corners of the room. It is a feat that the production manages to make such a familiar tale newly dangerous and its message of charity feels genuine.When immersive theatre works, there is nothing quite like it. But numerous elements need to align: you might get a great show but bad food or vice versa, which is sadly the case with The Nutcracker Noir, produced by SecretTheatrein east London. Billed as a reimagining of Tchaikovsky’s classic “with a twist”, it has some characters from ETA Hoffmann’s original story but without a cohesive or compelling narrative around them.View image in fullscreenElaborate confection …The Nutcracker Noir.Photograph: Mark SeniorWe are initially led into a series of rooms to be introduced to some of the characters. There is ethereal magician Eldar (Christopher Howell); Frank Zane (Jairus McClanahan), the nattily dressed son of club owner George (David Michael Johnson); and protagonist Clara (Anita Nicole), who stands on a dais in an elaborate confection of pink net, tutu, hoops and diamante.The rooms certainly evoke a fantasy realm, with heady swirls of light and projection. Tonight is the grand re-opening of Zane’s club and Clara has orchestrated the show we are about to see. A critic called Madame Zel (Jessica Alonso) is here to review it.The characters are beautifully, flamboyantly dressed – coloured wigs, ruffs and fishnets along with Dangerous Liaisons-style aesthetics. But the imagination poured into these costumes outweighs the drama itself. Adapted by Richard Crawford, who co-directs with Gary Lloyd, the barely fleshed out story has tenuous nods to the original Nutcracker tale, along with song and dance.The central stage and dining area is impressive all the same, an opulent pop-up dining room with chandeliers and disco lights. Frustratingly, performers continue with intros and warm-ups for too long. The food is slower to arrive in this show but it is beautifully presented and tasty too. Again it is served in intervals, between performances, with champagne, cocktails and mocktails flowing generously. The five-course meal is created by Jenny McNeill (from immersive dining pioneers Gingerline and Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck). It begins with a seasoned, flavoursome butter and sourdough, and proceeds with pretty looking dishes full of invention, such as nori and brown sugar-cured trout and the most gorgeous mid-winter salad featuring slivers of sweet potato and pickled cranberries.View image in fullscreenFlowing generously … The Nutcracker Noir.Photograph: Mark SeniorThe ensemble finally begin their floor show. It’s not the finest; there are backing-dancer moves to club beats and covers of Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World, David Bowie’s Changes and the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York. Clara narrates her life story, which has a strange incestuous revelation at one point, and feels unsatisfyingly thin and incoherent. Before pudding is served, we are led out into a room where Madame Zel tells us how much she is enjoying the stage show. So much so that we must help her write a letter to Clara, telling her so. It galls, to be railroaded into critical praise.The couple beside me, who are fans of dining cabaret nights, tell me that they bought half-price tickets and still feel let down by the unfolding experience. But there are plenty of others who are enjoying it. Many are up on their feet now, some dancing. An announcement tells us that a man has just proposed to his girlfriend. Cheers all round. The room is embracing the mood, and exudes office party vibes. Have the cocktails gone to people’s heads? A conga starts up around us. Our waitress is leading it and doing a vigorous job of getting people on their feet. “I hope she’s paid commission for that,” says my friend.While the room congas to Sister Sledge’s We Are Family, we eat our pudding, which is a baked Basque cheesecake with sugar plum coulis. It is smooth, light, utterly delectable – the highlight and consolation of this bizarre hybrid entertainment. And there lies the sugared nub of high-end dining theatre: if the show itself is best forgotten, there will always be the cheesecake.The Great Christmas Feastruns until 4 January.The Nutcracker Noirruns until 21 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsFoodChristmas food and drinkImmersive theatreCabaretfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No matter the number or scale of jobs still to do, a smartly dressed table, like a smart outfit, will make you feel in control. Try to resist the pull of paper plates and napkins: they’re non-recyclable, look naff and are a false economy if you host regularly.Investing in nice table linen doesn’t need to break the bank. Skye McAlpine, chef and author ofThe Christmas Companion,has a huge collection of napkins and tablecloths from years of scouring antiques markets and charity shops. “If you can’t get to a market or good charity shop, there are loads of amazing vintage linens onEtsyandeBay,” she says.Food writer Anna Jones, whose eponymous newsletter is a treasure trove of tasteful things, also loves a tablecloth. Her favourites come fromBlock Shop TextilesandSZ Blockprints, but she suggests buying a couple of metres of cotton or linen from a cheap haberdashery – “there are loads of odds and ends in the bargain bin” – and just throwing it over the table as a more budget option. “You don’t even need hemmed edges. It works really well.”Fabric napkinsFabric napkins always make it feel like a special occasion. If you want to jazz up your existing napkins, reuse ribbons from gifts or head toVV Rouleaux. “You can zhoosh any napkin by tying itwith a nice ribbon,” says McAlpine.If you’re buying new, opt for warm, earthy hues, advises writer, editor and serial dinner party host Alexandra Dudley. “[You want] things that can be elevated with the addition of a sprig of holly or leafy clementine but aren’t so [Christmassy] that they’re banished to the back of the cupboard for 11 months of the year.” Dudley believes the White Company sells “the best napkins in the world. They can handle a good wash, and there’s no need to iron them.” If you prefer a pattern, tryMidnatt, a chic Swedish brand offering textiles insustainably producedorganic cotton. The ones below with red ribbons are subtle, but chic.View image in fullscreenRustic linen napkins£45 at the White CompanyView image in fullscreenBow napkins£40 at Maison FlâneurMismatched tablewareIf you need more serveware, consider supporting independent makers. “We usually have 12 to 14 people at Christmas – way more than I have most days,” says Jones. “I love adding to my collection.

I don’t think people should worry about having [tableware] matching.” Try alsoMinnie-MaeandRosie Gorefor serveware, both available atGlassette, run by the queen of stylish entertaining, Laura Jackson.Edible table decorations“I love decorating the table with things people will enjoy eating afterwards,” says McAlpine. “Fruits, sweets, glasses of candy canes, chocolate coins scattered over the table – Divine’s milk chocolate coins are delicious and Fairtrade.” Jones also sticks to edible decor such as “clementines, lemons [and] green mandarins. I also make posies from garden herbs, and put a sprig or two on top of people’s napkins.”View image in fullscreenDivine milk chocolate coins£3.20 at Divine£3.20 at OxfamFresh (British) flowersFlowers enhance any Christmas table. “Think British-grown and seasonal. At this time of year, lean into the beautiful autumnal foliage we have in the UK – as well as winter flowering clematis and hellebores,” says Alex Head, founder of the Social Pantry, an independent catering company with an emphasis on sustainability and social impact.Garden centres are your friend, but so too are your local parks; just make sure you forage for your holly, fern and mistletoe (if you can reach it!) responsibly.Certified B CorpFreddie’s Flowersoffers responsibly sourced, seasonal posies through the post.

Less romantic, perhaps, but very reusable, are LED candles, favoured by the Social Pantry. “They’re really effective,” says Head.Candledis based in the UK and creates the most realistic LED “flames” I’ve seen.If a strong sense of tradition rules those out, try organic beeswax candles, such asthese from Skar: created in collaboration with apiaries dedicated to the careful management of their hives and surrounding environment; orthese patterned beauties from Pygmalion, handmade from plant-based wax and natural dyes.Candles are a great way of adding colour, too. McAlpine recommends buying them individually to create an eclectic mix. If you’re opting for patterned tapered candles, go for a classic holder, in brass or in stoneware, advises Dudley.

Recyclable, refillable and plastic-free Christmas crackers have never been more widespread; in fact, any cracker you buy fromJohn LewisorWaitroseis recyclable, and the gifts inside have been plastic-free since 2020.There are hosts of make-your-own or fill-your-own cracker kits available online, as well as other sustainable options. Crackers from theLittle Green Cracker Companyare plastic-free and tied with sustainable ribbons, and include usable gifts such as seeds, organic teabags or scented soap sourced from reputable, eco-conscious brands. TheRSPB makes its crackerswith sustainably sourced certified paper, with little wildlife pin badges as gifts, and the proceeds support conservation works. And crackers fromKeep This Crackerdon’t rip when you pull them, so you can reuse them every year; you just need to replace the contents and the “snaps”.If you’re not bothered by a lack of bang, the velvet Christmas crackers below from Holly & Co are designed to be untied and reused year after year.View image in fullscreenCracker-making craft kitsFrom £2.24 at the Cracker CompanyView image in fullscreenLuxury velvet reusable crackers£23.95 at Holly & CoCanapesView image in fullscreenThere’s no shame in serving ready-made nibbles.Photograph: Vitalina/Getty ImagesFor years, my one concession to the gods of ready-made food was canapes. Why faff around with filo pastry when a fiver can get you breaded prawns and mouth-burning brie and cranberry parcels? Then during Covid we made canapes to kill time, and now we mostly make our own (though we’ve still got a soft spot for Waitrose No 1 king prawn toasts).Sophie Wyburd, author of the cookbookTucking Inand the SubstackFeeder, likewise goes for a blend of homemade canapes with some Sainsbury’s nibbles thrown in. “My family has always bought the breaded cheese selection to cater to the veggies,” she says. For Nicholson, the best option isCook“for ease and deliciousness, as well as an ethical brand that focuses on whole foods”. Itstomato and pine nut tarte tatinsare one of her favourites.View image in fullscreenWaitrose No 1 king prawn toasts£8 at WaitroseView image in fullscreenSainsbury’s breaded cheese selection£5.50 at Sainsbury’sToasts and tapenadeMichelin-starred chefs and home cooks alike agree on one thing: keep canapes simple so you can prioritise time with people. “Some of my favourites involve small toasts (from old sourdough) and then creating delicious things to go on top,” says Nicholson, such as smoked trout –ChalkStreamis the most delicious brand going (and sustainable) – ormushroom paté. Dips are an easy but impressive win. “Whip upGalbani ricottawith a little lemon juice and olive oil until smooth, then top with a salsa made with roughly chopped nocellara olives, chopped parsley, lots of lemon zest, chopped pistachios and olive oil,” says Wyburd.Stephen Harris, chef at the Michelin-starredSportsmanin Whitstable, Kent, makes tapenade in a hand blender. “Good black olives, a splash of extra virgin olive oil, garlic, maybe some anchovies, and you have a lovely spreadable texture – much better than being authentic and chopping it all,” he says. Wyburd likes her olives – Perelló gordal olives – threaded on to a skewer withOdysea semi-dried datterini tomatoes, an anchovy and a pickledguindilla chilli, also from Perelló. This novel take on the trendy gilda is “perfect for kicking things off”, she says.View image in fullscreenPerelló olives£3.50 at Sainsbury’s£5.10 at OcadoBlinisPersonally, I’m with TopJaw host Jesse Burgess: you can’t beat a homemade blini, topped with ChalkStream trout (or trout’s roe), creme fraiche and dill. Usually, I mix dill into the batter (my mum buys Waitrose frozen dill for this purpose), but it can be a garnish. “Try using WildFarmed flour – it’ll add so much more flavour and interest than bog-standard flours,” Head advises, and it means the grain comes from regenerative sources.View image in fullscreenWildFarmed plain white flour£2 at TescoCocktailsView image in fullscreenUse punch bowls to mix cocktails at volume.Photograph: s-cphoto/Getty Images/iStockphotoHomemade pre-batched cocktails are easy and can often taste better than freshly made. “They can help you measure powerful ingredients with ease, and they can also mellow out and balance flavours in a different way,” says Ryan Chetiyawardana, AKAMr Lyan, the genius behind a family of multi-award-winning drinks and cocktail bars. “You can also accent with your favourite or seasonal flavour, which is a great way to use up fruit and herb trims. Use a microwave for a quick and easy infusion into the spirits.” Mr Lyan’s nuked negroni uses rosemary, blackberries and pink grapefruit to accent a negroni base; my brother infuses our Christmas negronis with black pepper and rosemary.For a crowd-pleasing Christmas twist on a classic cocktail, mix up a batch of spiced Christmas margs, says Max Venning, co-founder of the award-winning London cocktail bar Three Sheets. “This year everyone’s been going crazy for tequila, and margaritas are the ultimate party drink for getting things off to a good start.” To make it, mix 300ml tequila (Three Sheets chooseVolcan), 150ml fresh lime juice, 100ml ofBelvoir ginger cordialand 25g agave syrup with 2ml ofCholula hot sauce. On the day of the party, strain through a fine sieve, then serve by pouring a good glug of the mix over ice and topping with a small splash (50ml or so) of soda water. “Garnish with an orange slice and enjoy.”Use pitchers or punch bowls to mix, rather than shakers – “shaking drinks is hard to do at a volume”, Lyan explains. Wayfair sells a variety of well-priced vessels for mixing. Also, don’t forget the ice. Freeze larger cubes at home or, for big batches, “fill a one- or two-litre ice-cream tub with water and freeze overnight (you can decorate it with fruits, herbs and edible flowers too) to chill larger-format drinks”. Run warm water over the back of the tub to remove it and add to your large drinks container.View image in fullscreenBovellthree-litre pitcher£19.99 at WayfairView image in fullscreenOxo Good Grips silicone large ice cube tray£12.76 at Harts of Stur£16.30 at AmazonWineView image in fullscreen‘There’s no need to blow your budget on a fancy bottle.’Photograph: fstop123/Getty Images/iStockphotoWine writer and broadcaster Olly Smith, author ofWine: Everything You Need to Know, knows his way around the frankly overwhelming range of wine that appears at this time of year. There’s no need to blow your budget on a fancy bottle (unless that’s your priority of course), he says: “Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Loire sparkling No 49 (12%) is a rich golden bubbly with fulsome depth that’s a smasher to pair with festive nibbles,” he says; for a crowd-pleasing white “that’s scented as orange blossom yet delightfully crisp and zippy, bag a bottle ofWaitrose Loved & Found viorica 2024(12%) from Moldova. AndExceptional By Asda Central Otago pinot noir 2023(13%) is £8.97 and an outrageously good pinot from a top-notch New Zealand winery.”If, like me, you run out of sparkling wine at a party faster than your poor fridge can manage, use the Vacu Vin wine cooler sleeve (below). “It lives in my freezer, and chills wine down fast,” Smith says. As for decanting? Don’t. “Just decant your wine into a jug and then immediately use a funnel to decant it back into the bottle – and you should try this on whites and roses as well as reds,” he continues. “It’s a trick that’s used in the wine trade all the time and opens up the aromas and flavours in your wine for free.”View image in fullscreenTaste the Difference Crémant de Loire white wine£12.50 at Sainsbury’sView image in fullscreenVacu Vin rapid wine and champagne cooler sleeve£17.98 at NisbetsGlassesView image in fullscreenThe right glass can make all the difference to the drinking experience.Photograph: igorr1/Getty ImagesAnna Jones favours low glasses, like Yod & Co’s Eddie Glasses, so people can make eye contact.

This is true whether you’re serving a negroni (best in a heavy tumbler), a margarita (served in a sombrero glass or a coupe if it’s straight up, a tumbler if it’s on the rocks) or a martini in – of course – a martini glass.

Food styling: Emily Kidd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay. Photo assistant and retouching: Sophie Bronze. Food styling assistant: Jessica Geddes.Turkey“A lot of people don’t like turkey, and there is a good reason for that: there are lots of poor-quality turkeys out there, and lots of people not cooking it well,” says Nick Jefferson, founder of online farmer’s marketWylde. “You want a slow-grown heritage turkey, which has more muscle and fat, and lives for twice as long as your industrial equivalent.” A dry brine – AKA rubbing salt into the surface of the bird before covering it and refrigerating it for a day or two – really makes a difference to the flavour, he advises.Look for heritage or traditional breeds that have been reared in free range farming systems, and dry plucked after dispatch. This means the bird hasn’t been plunged in hot water before plucking, as is common in industrial production. It’s more time-consuming for the producer, but the dry plucking results in a much better texture and taste, because there is no risk of trapped additional moisture.Bronze, Norfolk black and bourbon red are among the most widely available, and if they’ve been well reared, they’re likely to have been dry plucked. Try Daylesford’s bronze turkeys, which are “free to roam and feed off fruit, clover and worms”, or Ginger Pig. Apricity’s Nicholson, who favours slow-cooked turkey legs over a crown, heads to theEthical Butcherto source them. A bronze from Paul Kelly atKellyBronze– both easily available online – has been the go-to in our house for years.View image in fullscreenWhole organic bronze turkeyFrom £150 at DaylesfordView image in fullscreenBroad-breasted bronze turkeyFrom £128.25 at the Ginger PigCooking and carvingIf you’re spending a fair whack on a fine bird, you want to make extra sure you’re cooking it properly. First, you need a good roasting tray, one that can accommodate the bird both breast down (as it should be for half the cooking time) and the right way up. Ed Smith, whose cookbook on chickens,Peckish,comes out next year, recommendsBorough Kitchen. Avoid anything “so thin or cheap that heat is lost (so, not a foil tray)”.The second is a meat thermometer – many swear byMeater. The final internal temperature should be between 73C and 75C in the thickest part of the leg, and remember to let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving, as the temperature will rise during this time.Poor carving can make even the best bird look bad. “You need a nice long blade, with a bit of rigidity to it – tryKatto,” says Ed Smith. Tim Wilson, founder of the Ginger Pig, always ensures he has a good, sharp knife to hand: “I use an inexpensive 10in Victorinox butchers’ steak knife for almost everything. But it’s the sharpness of the knife that matters most. “Invest five minutes in sharpening your knife well. Robert Welch’s knife sharpener is cracking,” says Jefferson.Finally, good pans are worth their weight in cast iron, keeping your sides warm while you carve the meat. Wilson recommendsStaub. “They’re expensive, but they’ll last several lifetimes, and well-made cast iron will keep whatever is inside nicely hot for some time.”View image in fullscreen10in Victorinox butchers’ steak knife£30 at M&S Butcher EquipmentView image in fullscreenRobert Welch handheldknife sharpener£28 at John Lewis£28 at AmazonMeat-freecentrepiecesView image in fullscreenWould you choose turbot over turkey at Christmas?Photograph: GMVozd/Getty ImagesIf you’re cooking Christmas lunch for vegetarians or vegans, pastry is your friend, says Anna Jones. “I want the main event to be a bit of a showstopper but not take too much time. So I’m going to sprinkle puff pastry with spice, then layer finely sliced vegetables, onions, citrus on top.” The result is a quick and easy tart that looks beautiful and tastes delicious, she says. “I use delica squash and citrus fromNatoora,ricotta from Westcombe, and herbs from my garden.” The cheese doesn’t have to be fancy – cheddar would work as well – and you can make these ahead of time (thefull recipe is on her Substack). “Serve at room temperature or warm slightly in the oven.”Pies are a great shout, says Nicholson. “If you’ve got a guest list that includes veggies and meat eaters, then a mushroom pithivier (assembled in advance) is both delicious and a bit of a centrepiece.” Ottolenghi has amushroom pithivier recipethat makes the most of pre-rolled pastry and takes mere minutes to assemble.Fish is another option, whether for pescatarian guests or seafood lovers. Mitch Tonks, founder ofRockfishand chef-owner of several seafood restaurants around Devon and Cornwall, is a big fan of turbot over turkey. “It’s incredibly easy to cook, with a rich, meaty texture,” he says. “Roast onions, fennel and leeks, pour in your choice of riesling and place the turbot on top of the roasting vegetables. Finish with tarragon leaves and lemon juice and serve.” You can ask your local fishmonger to source turbot, or tryPesky, an online fish market dedicated to regenerative fishing.Harris of the Sportsman recommends a large monkfish tail, roasted whole. The most important thing, once you’ve found a good fishmonger, is telling them in advance what you want and how you’d like it prepped, he says, “so they can get it all ready to just put in a large tray in the oven”.GravyTaz Sarhane, head chef of the Michelin-starredCycene, advises asking your butcher for bone marrow and buying stock there too. “The bone marrow helps the fat emulsify beautifully into the gravy. Finish with a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, and a touch of lemon for brightness,” he says. If you can’t get to a butcher’s, quality bone broth exists in most supermarkets. Mushrooms are also worth adding. “They’re packed with umami and add a really lovely earthiness,” says Ben Boeynaems, executive head chef at theBeaumont Mayfairhotel in London.For vegans and vegetarians, bone marrow is obviously a no-go, but that doesn’t mean forgoing delicious gravy. Anna Jonesmakes hers with red wine, mushrooms, root vegetables and woody herbs; Felicity Cloakeopts for white wine with vegetables and mushrooms, as well as a splash of port and a few teaspoons of her beloved Marmite. The joy of vegetarian gravy is that it can be made in advance and will store for up to three months in the freezer.PotatoesChefs are divided on which fat is best. “I love the flavour of beef fat, and it gives you a super crispy and fluffy roastie,” says James Wilson, head chef at the House of George in the Cotswolds. “You can pick it up from any local butcher, and at a much better price compared with duck or goose fat from a supermarket.” For Poppy O’Toole, whoselatest cookbookfocuses on her beloved tuber, Christmas is an excuse to splash out a little. “Normally, I’m all for a neutral oil, but when else do you get the excuse to bring out the fancy stuff? Goose fat gives roasties that naturally rich, savoury flavour that feels instantly festive,” she says.Jones uses olive oil, because it’s suitable for vegans as well as vegetarians; ghee gets a good crisp, but tastes rather buttery (and isn’t suitable for vegans). Jonny Lake, head chef at the Michelin-starred restaurant Trivet, agrees that the best fat to roast potatoes is olive oil. “I find duck and goose fat to be just too much,” he says.As for potato varieties? It’s maris piper all the way. “They’re starchy, easy to find and crisp up beautifully,” says O’Toole. “Cut them into big, equal sizes, and make sure you salt your boiling water properly – it should taste like the sea!” Jones recommends a boiling time of 12 minutes. “In order to get those craggy bits that crunch up, you need to boil them long enough so that you fluff up the outside before roasting them,” she says. To achieve an even craggier texture, drain the potatoes, shake them up a bit, and let them steam dry in a colander. “It gives you that dry, rough surface that turns gloriously golden and crunchy in hot fat, while keeping the inside light and fluffy,” says O’Toole.More important than the type of fat you use is that you heat it in the tray before adding the potatoes. You can achieve peak potato – “crisp on the outside, fluffy within” – with any fat, says Ed Smith, so long as you avoid using a high-sided tin or adding too much salt, both of which encourage steam, and thus sogginess. “Spread the potatoes out so there’s gaps between all of them, using two trays if necessary.”Finally, if using olive oil, Jones advises adding citrus zest as well as garlic cloves to the tray before roasting to add “a hint of freshness, which is nice in a rich meal”.Boeynaems infuses thyme, garlic and rosemary into the rendered fat, “to get your flavour into the potatoes”. But if time is tight, follow O’Toole’s approach: “Grind together fresh sage, rosemary, thyme, sea salt and garlic, and add to the potato pan. It’s festive, fragrant and such an easy way to elevate your Christmas dinner.”DessertView image in fullscreenLight and impressive: a cranberry-sauce-filled meringue roulade makes a superb pud.At this stage, there’s nothing wrong with chocolates – even just the chocolate coins and sweets you’ve scattered on the table. But if you love puddings, Christmas is the perfect reason to rustle up a recipe that might otherwise feel a little excessive. Both my mum and grandma gravitate towards aMary Berry meringue rouladefilled with a homemade cranberry sauce instead of summer strawberries. It’s light but impressive, with the white whipped cream mingling with the scarlet sauce.If the idea of baking and rolling a meringue is too daunting, chef Helen Goh – author ofBaking and the Meaning of Life– suggests achestnut ice-cream roll, her take on the perennially kitsch arctic roll. “It’s not super easy, because you still make the sponge, but the filling is chestnut paste and ice-cream, both of which you can buy,” she says. “Make sure you ‘train’ the cake first,” she says, “which means when it’s warm, you roll it up. It could crack it if you let it cool down before trying to do that.”CheeseboardView image in fullscreenEnjoy trying the cheeses before you buy.Photograph: Elena Katkova/Getty ImagesThe cheeseThere’s only one thing that makes me feel more festive than watching The Grinch, and that’s assembling a festive cheeseboard. My top tip is to tell your cheesemonger your general preferences, ask them what’s tasting great at the moment, and go from there. Artisan cheese can vary from batch to batch, so it’s worth trying before you buy, and most good cheesemongers will insist you do so.“One thing I love to do is get a largish slab of ripe, melting gorgonzola dolce and put it into a bowl surrounded by crisp charcoal cheese biscuits for guests to dip into. That is usually when everyone arrives, and it’s served as an appetiser with a glass of champagne,” says Patricia Michelson, founder and owner ofLa Fromagerie, in London. “I don’t like to add any honey or other toppings as gorgonzola is so delicious it stands on its own.”Angus D Birditt, author ofA Portrait of British Cheese, also likes to support lesser-known artisan cheeses.Doddingtonis “a lovely alternative to cheddar, with strong caramel notes”.Fat Cow, from Scotland, is “somewhere near emmental”, while Balcombe Blue Clouds (below) is “bright and creamy – an interesting alternative to stilton”.Though I’ve never knowingly worried about leftover cheese, I appreciate others might. Fear not, says Head of the Social Pantry: “There are so many great things you can do with any leftovers. We do aSparkenhoe red leicesterand cauliflower cheese croquette.” Dudley transforms brie and leftover cranberry sauce into filo tartlets. Nicholson favours gougères, which can be made with pretty much any leftover hard or blue cheese, and frozen for your next party. And if you’re still stuck as to what to do with the cheeseboard remnants, the Guardian has46 different suggestionscovering almost every cheese style.View image in fullscreenGorgonzola dolce£7.95 at Pong CheeseView image in fullscreenMiller’s Damsels charcoal wafers£3.05 at the Fine Cheese CoView image in fullscreenBlue Clouds cheese£6.90 at the Cheese HutThe board and knivesBirditt favoursTrianglefor a range that’s “affordable, lightweight and durable”, and Fortnum & Mason’s set(below) “to cut most styles of cheeses” if you want to treat yourself.

Why has human nature not evolved at the same rate? It seems to me that every country has criminals and every age in history had warfare. We seem to be as morally primitive as our distant ancestors. Why are we not better people?John Gorrill, CumberlandSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyCapitalism.DorkaliciousI am, and so is my wife.GoldgreenWe are, it’s just that the outliers get all the attention.Sagarmatha1953Moral expectations are less primitive than those of our ancestors, but this “progress” is compromised for several reasons.1. Public morality is totally undermined by our rewards system. We point our children towards compassion, honesty and cooperation, yet those who consider moral conduct most malleable rise to the top. Many quickly conclude that “goodness” is naive or performative.2. Hurt gets into the bones. Neglect, poverty, abuse, humiliation, injustice leave many people thinking it’s a rigged game. Why bother playing fair.Society can mitigate or exacerbate the basic human toolkit (fear, desire, tribalism); perhaps at the moment we’re shifting towards the latter.pawkietalkieMost people are good. Unfortunately, we remember the bad ones more. Somebody letting you on the bus first when they’re really before you is nice but not memorable. Someone pushing in front of you out of turn sticks in your mind.PeteTheBeatIn 1961 Bertrand Russell also asked that question in his book Has Man a Future? He proposed that the instincts that helped people survive early in human evolution have not had time to evolve in accord with modern times, those modern times including our ability to destroy ourselves. He asked whether present-day humans could be wise enough to overcome more primitive behaviour. And many, many years earlier, in his Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle looked around and asked: “What is a good life?”. After considering wealth, power, adulation, he concluded that the moral life was truly the best life. But then he limited who could actually attain that life. Slaves could not, people with disabilities, the destitute. He didn’t question whether this was fair, or should be remedied; he just said they couldn’t have it.Joanne Frantska, Washington state, USBecause we think “We” are better than “Them”, so we aren’t.minermackemJohn Gorrill asked: “Why are we not better people?” His question was rooted in the idea that evolution should result in improvements to our nature. His question begs another question: “How has he determined that we are not better people?” John specifically references our propensity for war as an example of non-improvement. However, study of apes during the last century has shown that apes have the same propensity for warfare and genocide as humans – cf Jane Goodall’s observation of theGombe wars between chimpanzees.So if warfare and butchery is natural to apes (and humans), how did John determine that it is bad? The answer has to be that, either deliberately or subconsciously, he is invoking a standard of moral behaviour which sits outside natural behaviour – a “non-natural” or “supernatural” moral standard. John might benefit from reflecting on why this non-natural standard resonates so much with him.Mathematical models of evolutionary theory show that where a group has individuals displaying altruistic behaviour, the survival rate of the group is enhanced, but not the survival rate of the altruistic individuals. In other words, evolution is constantly promoting the survival of intensely selfish individuals living in a society with a high degree of altruism – which is more or less what modern society looks like.So evolutionary (genetic) pressure has gotten us as far as it can towards a society of “good” (altruistic) people as it can. For society to become “better”, it is necessary for a large number of people to deliberately (philosophically) embrace non-natural (supernatural) behavioural standards.The nature of that supernatural moral standard, and the reasons for adopting it personally, have been studied by philosophers and theologians for millennia, and cannot be neatly summarised in a short space. So all I will say on that is to quote the promise of Jesus to his followers: “Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find.”Philip Lees, by emailThere is an important piece of evolutionary theory known as the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). It was introduced by John Maynard Smith [and George R Price] about 50 years ago. A living thing (or a group of them) exhibit(s) an ESS when any different strategy leads to worse individual outcomes. It is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium in game theory.An example due to Maynard Smith himself is called hawks and doves. Suppose some people are hawks and are always pugnacious, aggressive and belligerent; and suppose some are doves and never hurt others, always cooperate, and always run away from a fight. It’s fairly obvious that in a society of doves a hawk will have an enormous advantage. Less obvious, but true, is that in a society of hawks a dove will have an enormous advantage – the dove doesn’t get injured nearly as often. This means that there must be a proportion of hawks to doves somewhere in between that is an ESS – away from the ESS if there are more hawks then doves will have an advantage; if there are more doves then hawks will have an advantage.The ESS proportion depends on the actual rewards for each behaviour. Those rewards have changed throughout history, altering the stable ESS proportion. But even in hunter-gatherer societies (which were and are notoriously violent) the ESS made doves much more numerous. They are even more numerous today (just think of the statistical sample represented by proportion of people that you personally know who go round murdering other people …)It is perfectly possible to shift an ESS by deliberately changing the rewards for behaviours. A society with laws and prisons (which reduces the rewards for being a hawk) will be less violent than one without. A society without social support (which increases the penalties for being an injured dove) will be more violent that one with.MaynardSmithFanI’m going to go with capitalism and patriarchy as being responsible for humans not evolving into better people. No let’s just leave it as patriarchy, because capitalism is probably just another offshoot (like so many crap things in the world) of patriarchy.kiramangoToo risky, because we know that those among us who are better people are by definition always obsessively taking a punt.ThereisnoOwlI’d be interested to hear what others have heard. In my case it was being fed a lot of flannel from Mr Forbes, who turned around from the board to face the class, in his chalk-dust-flecked tweed jacket, waved a hand around and announced airily: “And the most intelligent of the higher primates is the human being.” Which was diligently copied into the exercise book, and accepted without question.After some years I’m surprised that the other higher primates haven’t sued Mr Forbes for making false comparisons. Some of them must feel quite insulted, coming out with defensive statements such as: “Well now, at least we’re not daft enough to go around wrecking the place.”No, I’m reasonably sure that the human being has much more in common with the jackdaw of legend. More sly than most foxes, but not particularly bright. Distracted by, and attracted to, glittery, sparkly things. When confronted with large amounts of them, uttering a loud “Cor!” Also has the habit of flying about all over the place in search of more, without much thought. When hindered in its quest for accumulating even more glittery, sparkly things has the tendency to turn rather nasty.bricklayersoptionOur brains, our knowledge, technology, healthcare and longevity haven’t really universally increased. The human brain is about the same now as it was over 10,000 years ago, and, contrary to popular belief, isnota finely honed machine refined over millennia, equally allotted to every human … but a mass of biological goop arranged to disperse electrons, according to various random environmental pressures that made your direct ancestors slightly less likely to die before they procreated. It is not a uniform thing, it is a series of phenomena, easily mouldable through teaching, inference, persuasion, trauma, chemical intervention, random projections and hallucinations of its own devising … all kinds of stuff! Why would you assume that our brains would make us inherently “good”?Our knowledge cannot help us decide what is “good”, either – No human being has perfect knowledge, and most people don’t have access to knowledge, or are deliberately given false “knowledge” in the form of misconceptions, dogma, magical thinking, falsehoods, etc … nothing is inherently morally correct, only subject to ever greater shades of nuance. No two human beings hold the exact same things to be true and virtuous. People can hate the same thing for different reasons, and have completely incompatible ideas of how it should be solved as a problem.The same goes for technology and healthcare – the global majority still does not have equal access to these benefits, which are not universal, and frequently include drawbacks. Imperfect knowledge means that we still cannot be sure that most technology is doing more good than harm.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by models; EMS-Forster Productions/Getty ImagesInequality is also driving a very different game when it comes to statistical longevity – even in the UK, for those in the most deprived regions, poverty is driving the average life expectancy down. I also know a lot of people who have spent decades on this earth only further entrenching their God-awful personality flaws and inflicting them on others, so a long life needn’t be inherently a good one.I think it just goes to prove that none of these factors affect whether or not someone is a good person. Indeed, most of them are equally as capable of being weaponised as they are of being used to good purpose.That is ultimately our Original Sin as human beings – cursed to know that we are capable of making the wrong moral choices and doing harm, and having to tread the path of right action through conscientious, deliberate choice (assuming that we can be convinced that it really is ultimately the right thing to do).Maybe just concentrate on what you’re going to do for your own soul, and let God sort out the rest.AngstMuffinWe are not better people because we are biologically apex predator primates, with all of the well-documented instincts and behaviours that that implies. We can watch some of the groundbreaking studies of chimpanzees in the wild, made by Jane Goodall, and all of these instinctive behaviours are there.As we struggle to evolve as a species into a late stageKardashev I planetary civilisation, it is our innate apex predator primate instincts that are the ball and chain slowing us down and threatening us with self-extinction. Some are ready to evolve and progress, while others are motivated to devolve and regress. This is the root of the socioeconomic/political tension we see played out in the news every day.The outcome is probably not preordained, so it is likely a collective choice that could go either way or even both ways at the same time. Some might call this the Dividing of the Way”. It is perhaps a planetary scale Darwin filter, and one reason we have not encountered signs of intelligent life from anywhere in our galaxy. I hope we take the wise path …Alan McRae, US, by emailUnfortunately, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that there are evolutionary advantages to being nasty.EddieChorepostit’s not that people fail to “become better.” It’s that the underlying forces we respond to haven’t disappeared. Technological progress doesn’t get rid of scarcity. Economic systems still pit people against one another. Social structures still encourage in-groups and out-groups. When those pressures remain, you get predictable patterns of harm – even in a world with medicine, smartphones, and space telescopes.The interesting part is that our ethics have evolved. We have larger moral circles, broader sympathy, and better tools for cooperation than any previous era. But ethics will always be shaped by the conditions we’re living in.JR Arianthi, by emailIf there were nothing to fear – poverty, illness, starvation, injury, betrayal – people would find kindness easier. There would be nothing to fear if everyone’s needs were met at any given moment. Scarcity, or the perception of it, is why we are not a better society.Jennifer Volchan Cruz, by emailExplore more on these topicsLife and styleNotes and queriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When guests feel that they’ve been looked after with care, it sets the tone for a harmonious visit. Whether you have the luxury of a guest room, or a space that is somewhere between a home office and a laundry graveyard, there are lots of simple, thoughtful ways to give guests a genuinely warm welcome.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When friends and family are staying for just one night, it’s all about making their room comfortable and convenient – think cosy bedding, chargers by the bed, space for an overnight bag, etc. But if it’s a few days or more, it’s worth putting more effort in because, however close you are, you don’t want to be on top of each other. Create a space where they’re happy to relax, and everyone will be able to enjoy some time to decompress.If preparing for guests feels daunting, remember that all the effort put into cleaning and decluttering will mean a more serene stay for all. Those who love entertaining might want to invest a little more in their guest facilities, while occasional hosts should keep it simple. Take your pick of these interior designers’ expert tips – just a few thoughtful gestures will go a long way to creating a happy stay for guests and hosts alike.Test drive the roomDo as the top hoteliers do and scope out any issues by spending a night in your spare room, living out of an overnight bag. This is the best way to identify what needs to be added or changed before guests arrive.DeclutterIf you’re lucky enough to have a spare room, there’s a good chance it’s become a dumping ground, so make time for a strenuous declutter ahead of guests arriving.“We often hold on to things that no longer serve us, so clear away visual noise, empty the bedside drawers and keep surfaces clear to make intentional space for your guests,” say interior designers Zoë Starreveld and Alex Forbes, ofStarreveld Forbes. Lay out holdalls and bin bags designated for rubbish, recycling, the charity shop and “elsewhere in the house”. If you run out of time or space, things can always be relocated to the loft or shed – or, worst-case scenario, just drape a throw over the offending stack of (ideally boxed) clutter.Clean upMany of us are grossed out by grime in someone else’s house that we would turn a blind eye to at home. So it’s time to get the whole household on board and blitz the areas your guests will use, in particular the bedroom and bathroom.Create somecharacterA vase, jug or even a jam jar of greenery, flowers or berries will bring life to the room – but keep it small so it won’t get in the way. If you’re looking for a steer on the decor itself, interior designer Tanya Selway, ofStelly Selwaystudio, advises treating “the spare room as a little escape: less guest room, more boutique retreat. Give it personality with layered textures, a few unexpected vintage pieces and something that hints at travel or leisure. It should feel like a place where guests can exhale, with its own, distinct character rather than a pared-back afterthought.”And so to bedView image in fullscreenPiglet in Bed duvet coversIf you need to buy bed linen, the options are vast, butPiglet in Be,M&S,Dunelm,La RedouteandH&M Homeare all good for duvet sets. To create a coherent colour scheme, look for shades that are already in the room, or play it safe by sticking to white. When washing linens for guests, it’s nice to be generous with the fabric softener, even if you don’t normally use it, so that everything smells reassuringly clean.Make sure your duvet and pillows are up to the job –Soak & Sleephave a wide range, if you need to stock up, and a cosy throw such as Habitat’svelvet bedspread(£50)is a nice touch. Cushions on a bed can feel fussy, but if there isn’t space for a comfy chair in the room, they will allow guests to relax on the bed during the day. TryLa Redoute,H&M HomeandDunelmfor bargains, while independent brands such asNkukuandPalavahave beautiful, sustainable designs.Peace and quietTo give your guests a great night’s sleep, you could add blackout linings to your bedroom curtains. Dunelm’sblackout pencil pleat linings(£12-£40) are easy to attach to existing curtain hooks. If that’s too much faff, provide a sleep mask. Perhaps you have some left over from a flight, or if you need to buy some, opt for silk ones such asAlaska Bear’s twin-strap mask with nose baffle(£15.99 from Amazon).If neighbourhood noise or early-rising children are likely to be an issue, raid that flight kit again for earplugs, or check out the options atHappy Ears. You could also provide a simple white noise machine, such as theHushing mini(£19.99). These can be incredibly effective at drowning out intermittent noise.Good lightingView image in fullscreenSpool table lamp from Där LightingIt’s a crime against hospitality to make guests stumble their way to bed in the dark after turning off the big light. Bedside lamps are essential. These can be appropriated from elsewhere in the house, or look for a bargain. Dunelm have plenty of strong, affordable options, includingHera table lamp(£6), or if you’ve a bigger budget, try theSpool table lamp(£91) from Där Lighting.Starreveld Forbes suggest a handy portable light such as theFerm Living Arum(£169), from Earl of East, and advise: “Light the room with intention. Low-level lighting makes a huge difference, so always turn on at least one lamp before guests arrive. It makes the room feel welcoming.”Chargers on handAnother bedside essential is access to a plug, while a generously long phone charger cable shows that you’ve thought of everything. If there isn’t a socket on each side of the bed, make sure there’s an extension lead –AmazonandeBayare good for a wide choice of sockets and lengths. Ikea does a great range of multi-USB port chargers, includingSmåhagel(£6) – pair it with colourfulLillhultandSittbrunncharger cables (from £1.50) and even a pair of cute little Havskål USB anchors (£3) to stop cables flopping about.Carafe and glassesView image in fullscreenNardo olive green carafe and glass set from the Futon CompanyMake sure guests have a glass of water at bedtime or, if you’re staying in for a festive night, place water in the room in advance. A carafe and glasses are a lovely touch too. You can pick up a stylishNardo olive green setfrom the Futon Company for (£16) or for something fancier, aNine Milk carafe set(£40-£49) from twentytwentyone.Make sure to provide a vanity mirror, ideally placed in good natural light. If you don’t have something suitable, Dunelm’sElements dressing table mirror(£20) is a fun design. If you can spare a hairdryer too, guests will appreciate it and won’t come knocking on your door when you’re getting dressed.Neat and tidyView image in fullscreenSun Swirl trinket dishesTo help everything stay pleasingly in its place, provide a container for cosmetics, and perhaps a pot for makeup brushes too. Any nice little bits of tableware will do this job, and empty candle jars are good too. A trinket tray by the bed is also useful. Oliver Bonas has a great selection, including a set of twoSun Swirl trinket dishes(£14.50). Similarly, a wastepaper bin helps keep things spick and span. Zara Home’scylindrical metal wastepaper basket(£69.99) is a chic solution.Keep cosyView image in fullscreenForte wool hot-water bottle coverIt’s horrible when you feel cold in someone else’s house, so make sure to provide throws and blankets in the living room as well as the bedroom. Hot-water bottles are a lovely gesture – zhuzh them up with a stylish cover such as theForte wool cover(£52) from Toast. A heated throw can be moved around the house and even draped over the bed on cold nights. Dreamland’s are among the best, including aCosy Up faux fur warming throw(£109.99) in a gorgeous terracotta tone.Create surfacesView image in fullscreenX Collagerie shiny and matte side tableMany a guest bedroom and bathroom fails in this area. Guests need somewhere to unpack their bag or place a washbag. “Aim to set up like a hotel room – include a small side chair, stool or bench to rest a bag on or layer clothes,” say Starreveld Forbes, who recommend theX Collagerie shiny and matte side table(£129.99, Zara Home), and theRylee nesting bedside table(£399) West Elm. If space is tight, the Futon Company do a great range of small-space furniture, including theirHale narrow bedside table(£40) which is just 24cm wide.Somewhere for clothesView image in fullscreenTurner single clothes railIf you aren’t able to provide wardrobe space, Gemma Tucker, ofBalance Interior Design, suggests “adding a clothes rail with wooden hangers – it’s an easy and affordable touch. If there’s enough room, include a small chest of drawers for things like underwear and cosmetics.”She recommends theelegant black iron clothes railfrom Design Vintage (available in three sizes, from £245) . For a more contemporary look, try the compactTurner single clothes rail(£50, Habitat). If space is ultra-tight, a rack of hooks on the back of a door, or on a wall, will do the job. Nordic Nest has a great selection, including theRelief hook rack(£134) used with aset of 10 hangers(£9) from Argos Home.Scent the roomView image in fullscreenTrue Grace scented candle“Set the mood before your guests arrive by lighting a scented candle. Opt for rich, woody notes in the cooler seasons, and lighter, fresh fig aromas as the weather warms.True Graceoffers a great selection,” advises Tucker. A sweet-smelling bathroom is an essential too. Ailsa MacConnell, ofStudio Mac, says: “For me, it’s all about creating a beautiful scent, so guests relax and feel comfortable. TheSweet Pea reed diffuser(£33.99) from St Eval, is my absolute go-to, and so many of my friends and family comment on the scent after they’ve stayed a couple of nights.”Home entertainmentView image in fullscreenRattan magazine holderIf you have a small television and smart stick, you may want to put them in the guest room to avoid TV clashes. Or perhaps a digital radio or Bluetooth speaker, so guests can entertain themselves in the room. A tailored selection of books from your own shelves is always lovely – perhaps include some short-story compilations.Antonia Winkler von Stiernhielm, ofStudio Anton, likes to add “a slim magazine rack with a few well-chosen titles, because it brings a quiet sense of care and makes the room feel thoughtfully personal”. She suggests arattan magazine holder(£85, Uru Home), orStackers garnet magazine rack(£40), available from John Lewis, is another stylish option.Tea and biscuitsIf there’s space, it’s lovely to provide guests with a tea or coffee. Use a tray and include a small kettle, such as the John LewisAnyday(£20) and perhaps a fancy tin of biscuits. Amazon sells a selection of small,insulated milk bottles.Boost the bathroom tooView image in fullscreenTowels from La RedouteObviously, make sure you provide your best towels. If you need to restock,La RedouteandDunelmare good go-tos. Give the bathroom a declutter to free up space, provide an empty candle jar or presentable mug as a toothbrush holder, and perhaps create a basket of some of your favourite spa treats to indulge guests.Winkler von Stiernhielm also suggests “a freshly laundered linen robe on the back of the door, because comfort should feel like it’s been beautifully thought through. I always stick to white sheets and robes, so they feel like a luxury hotel.” The White Company’slong lightweight waffle robe(£65) fits the bill.After the guests goSelway has thoughts on this: “Your spare room doesn’t have to wait for visitors to come to life. Add a turntable and records, or a reading nook, so it becomes a place you enjoy too. It should be a little retreat that reflects your interests while still welcoming guests.”Explore more on these topicsHomesInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, a pack of supermarket own-label pigs in blankets is up 19p at £2.88. Lots of us will be paying quite a bit more for gravy this year: a 190g tub of Bisto gravy granules is up 35p – or 13% – at £2.95. In 2022, it was £2. And a 170g box of Paxo sage and onion stuffing mix is up 17p to £2.57. Compared with 2022, that’s a 51% increase.View image in fullscreenFood price inflation has risen to 4.9%.Photograph: Kate WhitakerHowever, there is some good news, with price falls for items such as potatoes and yorkshire puddings – down 2p to £1.84 for a 2kg bag of maris piper spuds, and a 14p reduction to £1.11 for a bag of frozen yorkshires. Overall, says Assosia, the total cost of nine key food items is up 5% on last year. These prices are based on the pre-promotion price across four supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.Christmas is always an expensive time and, after several years of rising living costs, budgets are tight in many households this year. The last set ofofficial datameasured UK inflation at 3.6% in October. But while gas and electricity bills are rising at a slower pace than a year earlier, food price inflation accelerated to 4.9%.One of the UK’s largest annual studies of festive spending, saving and lifestyle trends found Britons were aiming to save money where they could.Important findings of the big Christmas survey by Park Christmas Savings include that more than a third of people will not be sending physical cards in part because ofhigher postage costs, with cuts extending to the Christmas table, too. One-in-three households have now adopted budget-friendly food swaps, choosing supermarket-own brands or simplifying their menusto keep festive costs under control, according to the poll of 5,000 households.Supermarkets go all out on dealsWith supermarket bosses aware that money is tight, a promotional blitz has begun in the aisles, with about one-in-three products on the shelf on special offer.“It is likely to be the most promotional Christmas we’ve seen in the 2020s,” says Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at the market research firm Worldpanel.The competitive environment is fuelling a tit for tat in the “Christmas dinner wars”, with Aldi and Lidl going head-to-head to attract cost conscious shoppers.Giles Hurley, the Aldi chief executive, has thrown down the gauntlet with a pitch to sell the “UK’s lowest-price Christmas dinner”. He says the retailer wants to take the “guesswork out of affordability” by offering the lowest prices now on Christmas dinner veggies, turkey and the trimmings.Aldi is selling a “full festive feast” for eight for £11.75, or £1.47 a head. The most expensive component is the 3kg fresh British turkey, at £9 (£2.95 a kg), but it is charging pennies for the veg – a tactic that has beencriticised by growers– with the potatoes (2kg), brussels sprouts (500g), carrots (1kg) and parsnips (500g) all priced at 8p. (This deal runs from 19 to 24 December.)McKevitt says: “The supermarkets are really conscious that people are struggling with the cost of living and want to be able to talk about having the cheapest offer for Christmas.”View image in fullscreenThe Christmas vegetable price war has been criticised by growers.Photograph: Calvin Chan Wai Meng/Getty ImagesFrozen or fresh turkey?Worldpanel also tracks prices, and by its measure, the data shows that the average cost of aChristmasdinner for four people hasfallen by a penny to £32.46.Its analysis showed that the cost of a frozen turkey, the most expensive component of an average Christmas dinner, has fallen by 4% to £13.52. However, the cost of all the trimmings has risen: the price of four portions of potatoes has risen 1% to £1.67, cranberry sauce has increased by 10% to 86p, and stuffing mix is up by 7% to 96p.With UK poultry producers battling a“bad season”ofbird fluthat has affected supplies of Christmas birds, many will be surprised to read headlines about cheaper, albeit frozen, birds.View image in fullscreenTurkey is the most expensive component of an average Christmas dinner.Photograph: Jordan Lye/Getty ImagesPaul Kelly, the managing director of KellyBronze, which produces free-range turkeys in Essex, says the picture is being distorted by supermarket price cuts. “It’s not that the cost hasn’t gone up. It’s because retailers are sacrificing margin – they’re loss-leading.“We gave up trying to compete with that years ago because they are losing a fortune on turkeys. The rationale is that they’re going to attract people in to buy the rest of their shop if they sell the turkey cheap.”While on some measures you may be able to pick up a frozen turkey that is a bit cheaper than last year, about 70% of Britons opt for a fresh one. With the quality of the bird an important concern for many households, the average KellyBronze customer spends £95-£100.Kelly says higher business taxes and labour costs contributed to a 4.8% increase in running expenses this year, and it has no option but to pass that on to customers. “We can’t afford not to.”Retailers up game on own-label rangesWith Worldpanel putting annual grocery price inflation at 4.7%in November, McKevitt says: “People are trading down. They’re broadly buying the same volume of food but choosing cheaper items.”For many shoppers this means swapping big brand names for cheaper supermarket own-label items. With this in mind, the big supermarkets have been investing in their top-end, own-label brands – such as Tesco Finest and Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference – so people can still feel as if they are treating themselves.Given the horse-trading required to balance family budgets, analysts say savvy consumers need more than ever to shop around for the best deals – and best-tasting products.For the latter, it is worth consulting the festive taste tests conducted by theGood Housekeeping Institute(GHI) and Which?, as well as the Guardian reviews siteThe Filter.This year, for some traditional Christmas foods such as mince pies, low-cost brands have triumphed over more expensive stores.View image in fullscreenYou could opt for supermarket fizz.Photograph: gregory_lee/Getty ImagesAfter testing almost 700 festive foods, GHI crowned Waitrose the overall winner, with its £14 No.1 Pistachio & Cherry Stollen Wreath and £3 No.1 Golden Mince Pies with Limoncello (which judges said offered the “acidic kiss of a zippy lemon liqueur”) among the standouts.But no-frills rival Asda finished second with a handful of wins, including for its Exceptional by Asda Yule Log (£5.47) and Heritage Slate Turkey Crown (£50.04/2kg) and praise for its wines. In the fiercely contested “classic” mince pie category Iceland came out on top with its £3 Luxury All Butter Mince Pies.Callum Black, the GHI’s deputy head of testing, says festive meals are being shaped by cost of living pressures, and it has noted the rise of “cost-conscious alternative meats for Christmas lunch”.Black says: “Although it’s not uncommon to see a big, glazed gammon on the menu, we’re seeing the emergence ofhigh-quality large cuts of pork, from trimmed racks to sirloins, making for a value-focused but utterly delicious option that’s just as good cold in a Boxing Day sandwich.”Katherine Scott, the director of marketing for Park Christmas Savings, sums up the mood: “What we’re seeing across the board is a more thoughtful, more intentional Christmas. Women, who continue to shoulder most of the planning and budgeting, are finding smart ways to keep the season joyful while staying in control of costs.”All prices correct at time of writingExplore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkConsumer affairsUK cost of living crisisFood & drink industryChristmasFoodSupermarketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was originally served with hot, boozy custard – though I think it’s just enough as it is – and it makes a fabulous Christmas centrepiece,Prep15 minSoakOvernightCook20 minFreeze2 hr+Serves6125g currants, or raisins or sultanas50g good-quality candied peel, finely chopped75ml maraschino, or other sweet alcohol of your choice (see step 2)1 vanilla pod, split, or 1 tsp vanilla extract600ml whipping cream4 egg yolks50g caster sugar45g flaked almonds125g whole peeled cooked chestnuts, or unsweetened chestnut puree1 A note on the dried fruitView image in fullscreenPut the fruit and peel in a bowl. Mony’s recipe is reported to have contained currants and raisins (though other vine fruit, or indeed any chopped dried fruit you prefer, will work), as well as candied citron, the peel of a mild, thick-skinned citrus, which is available online, as are other candied peels that are far nicer than those chewy, greasy nubs sold in supermarkets.2 And a note on the boozeAdd the alcohol: maraschino, an Italian sour cherry liqueur, is the original choice, butClaire Macdonalduses an orange triple sec, Victorian ice queenAgnes B Marshallbrandy and noyaux, an almond-flavoured liqueur made from apricot kernels, andRegula Ysewijnmixes maraschino with dark rum. Madeira, sherry, port, etc, would surely be good, too. Soak the fruit for a few hours, or overnight.3 Infuse the creamView image in fullscreenAn hour or so before you begin, slit the vanilla pod down its length and use a sharp knife to scrape out the seeds. Put these and the empty pod into a small pan with the cream, bring gently just to a simmer, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse. (If using extract, stir in and use immediately.)4 Whisk the sugar and egg yolksPut the egg yolks in a heatproof bowl near the hob (freeze the whites for cocktails or meringues – a pavlova makes a lovely New Year’s Eve dessert). Gently reheat the cream back up to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar into the egg yolks (if you have a notably sweet tooth, you may wish to increase the amount of sugar to 75g).View image in fullscreen5 Add the hot creamView image in fullscreenLift the vanilla pod out of the cream, then whisk the hot cream into the egg yolk bowl. Pour back into the pan, set it over a gentle heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mix is just thick enough that a distinct line can be drawn in it on the back of the spoon. Put the pan in a sink of cold water to cool.6 Blitz the chestnutsView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden. If using whole chestnuts, whizz them in a food processor, or pound to a powder in a mortar.View image in fullscreenDrain the fruit, add the alcohol to the blitzed chestnuts and whizz again until creamy (if need be, add a little of the custard to help loosen). If using chestnut puree, just stir in the alcohol.7 Make the ice-creamView image in fullscreenPut the creamy chestnut puree in a large bowl, then gradually whisk in the cooled custard until well combined.

While we don’t think to use too much “sweet” before dessert, it can counterbalance and enhance other flavours. Maple syrup is my sweetener of choice during the holidays because it just tastes cozy. Add it to roasted root vegetables or a poultry glaze, and it’s especially tasty in drinks, from hot apple cider to eggnog and even mulled wine.View image in fullscreenHomemade butterI’ve never met anyone who didn’t like butter, or ooh and ah at a homemade one. Think of this ridiculously easy condiment as a blank canvas; you know your guests best, so feel free to add whatever spice, herb, or flavouring they’ll love the most. Think brown sugar and cinnamon; dried herbs and lemon zest; maple syrup and miso; parmesan and pepper; or gochujang and chopped spring onion.BovrilBovril is an absolute must during the holidays. It’s an easy way to start a gravy base, and an even easier way to glaze veggies, plus its history is surely a conversation starter. During the Franco-Prussian war in the 1870s, in an effort to feed his troops, Napoleon III commissioned John Lawson Johnston to develop a non-perishable protein. First named Johnston’s Fluid Beef, this salty spread made from beef bones, salt and flavourings was renamed Bovril in 1886.Cranberry sauceAs an American, I take my cranberry sauce extremely seriously (after all, it is a Thanksgiving staple). I’ve always been my family’s designated cranberry sauce maker and rarely show up with fewer than three variations. Of course, in my opinion classic is best so start by putting 500g fresh or frozen cranberries in a large pot with the juice and zest of two lemons, 240g granulated sugar and 250ml water. Bring to the boil (the cranberries will begin to pop), then cook for around 10 minutes, until it reaches your desired consistency. Place in a bowl directly in the fridge or plop into a sterilised jar.Flaky saltThere’s ingredient salt and then there’s gorgeous, crystal clear, flaky condiment salt. The word condiment comes from the Latin verb condire, which means to “enhance the flavour of” – you wouldn’t use flaky salt while cooking, but you would use it to top a finished dish to give that extra pizzazz. ForChristmas, toss some quite literally on roast potatoes or dessert for that sweet-and-salty element, and some textural fun. In the UK, I always go for Halen Môn.GrainydijonGrainy dijon can level up a dish thanks to its texture. I love a chunky mash so when I’m served a silky, almost soup-like mashed potato dish I just dollop in a big spoonful of grainy dijon for a nice pop of acidity and bite. It can also be used to coat brussels sprouts, dip pigs in blankets, as a layer in leftover turkey sandwiches … you name it!Bloody mary ketchupOK, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here and skipping to Boxing Day breakfast. I think it’s safe to assume last night was a long one and you may need a burst of energy? That’s where this ketchup comes in. Add a quarter-teaspoon celery salt, a teaspoon of horseradish, the juice of half a lemon, a half-teaspoon of hot sauce (ideally red to preserve the traditional ketchup colour) and one and a half teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to 240g ketchup and combine. Don’t have any ketchup? Just combine 200g concentrated tomato puree, 80ml apple cider vinegar, a half-teaspoon of onion powder, a quarter-teaspoon of garlic paste, an eighth of a teaspoon of ground cumin, and some salt and pepper.HerbsPlease don’t forget about herbs! These condiments (yes, condiments – they’re not needed but they add flavour) bring emotions into dishes. They’re so much more than last-minute garnishes: add sage to your stuffing, a bay leaf to your gravy, some rosemary to your potatoes, and dill to lemony smoked salmon.View image in fullscreenCandied olivesI am well aware that this is not a traditional Christmas condiment, but hear me out. Candied olives are briny, sweet, slightly spiced and the perfect addition to a cheeseboard, plus a jar becomes a two-in-one condiment: use the liquid for glazes, dressings and marinades, and the olives for cheeseboards, finely chopped and swirled into butter, baked into bread, or even tossed into salads. To make, strain a tin of black olives (I use the cheap, pizza-style ones, but feel free to splurge as long as they’re in brine, not oil). Toast a teaspoon of chilli flakes in a pan over a high heat, moving them around for five minutes. Transfer them to a pan with 250ml water and 175g white granulated sugar over a medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the olives and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes. (I like to smash the olives under my wooden spoon to create texture.) Once you’re happy with the syrup’s thickness, transfer to a glass jar and seal. Let this sit on the counter until cool, then pop in the fridge. They get better over time, so I’d recommend prepping them a few days in advance.Spiced plum chutneyI love adding plums to holiday dishes, whether baked alongside a roast chicken or served with duck; the deep, rich flavour always highlights a protein without overpowering it. For Christmas this year, I’d opt for a spiced plum chutney as it can be paired with turkey, goose or a beef wellington, as well as with starters, sides, cheese and especially leftovers the next day. Place 300ml white wine, 200g carob molasses, 100g brown sugar, three teaspoons mustard seeds, a teaspoon of chilli flakes, a cinnamon stick, a half-teaspoon of ground ginger, a finely chopped onion, a finely chopped shallot, two tablespoons of port and a pinch of salt in a pot and bring to a boil. Once the alliums are translucent, add 800g plums, stoned and sliced, and simmer, stirring frequently, over a medium heat for 30-40 minutes. While it’s still hot, pour the chutney into sterilised jars and close immediately. This tastes better with time so prep it a few weeks in advance.View image in fullscreenSaltand sugar blendWe rarely see salt and sugar combined and I’ve always wondered why, so I started making my own (use half a cup of salt for every cup of sugar). Although this duo works for all seasons, I find that holiday flavours marry particularly well with the contrasting tastes. Feel free to add anything that takes your fancy into your blend: orange zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, powdered ginger, tonka bean – the list goes on. Use to coat sugar cookies or shortbread, to top a loaf cake, sprinkle over bread and butter, dip fruit into, add to a poultry glaze or your morning oats, or to rim a cocktail glass.Mulled wine jellyLast, but most certainly not least, is my mulled wine jelly, which is a start-to-finish Christmas dinner condiment. It’s a paté’s best friend, pairs wonderfully with soft white cheese, and is a fun topping for a beef wellington. Make sure to prepare enough because, regardless of what dessert is on the table, you can also top it with this jelly: vanilla ice-cream, mince pies, festive trifle, cheesecake … It’s really up to you!Prep a spice bag with a cinnamon stick, two star anise, three cloves, and half a dried slice, or both, of lemon and clementine. (To dry citrus, thinly slice, place on a baking sheet and bake at 100C (80C fan)/gas ¼ for an hour.) Heat 750ml red wine and the spice bag in a saucepan over a medium-high heat for a minimum of 20 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes. Remove the spice bag, and add 12g powdered pectin and 400g granulated sugar, whisking to dissolve. Bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for five to 10 minutes. Transfer the hot jelly to hot sterilised jars, and seal. Place in the fridge (don’t worry if it doesn’t look set right away, it takes a few hours to take shape).Claire Dinhut, AKA Condiment Claire, is the author ofThe Condiment Book: A Brilliantly Flavourful Guide to Food’s Unsung Heroes, published byBloomsbury at £14.99.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWinter food 2025ChristmasSauces and graviesFoodWinter food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Hayley MaitlandSun 14 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareSarah, 45It took me a while to figure out what turned me on – I was well into my 20s when I first had an orgasm with himRespecting each other’s boundaries and individuality is one of the reasons we’ve been so happy together for 28 years. Admittedly, things got off to a comically rocky start when I marched up to Scott at an arcade in the late 90s and began drunkenly smothering him with kisses. I spent the next day mortified, but he soon asked me out on a date. Shortly after my 17th birthday I lost my virginity to him by his fireplace. He’s the only partner I’ve had; the only one I ever want to have.The sex has got better, and more frequent, over the years. Nothing compares to the intimacy you experience when you’re lying there in the afterglow with someone you really trust. But it took me a while to figure out what turned me on – I was well into my 20s when I first had an orgasm with him. It was only in my 30s that sex became a priority for me. Neither Scott nor I wanted kids, so I didn’t have to navigate the emotional and physical shifts that come with pregnancy and motherhood, and I felt as if I came into my body at that point in my life.Scott mentioned he had this fantasy of having sex on a boat, so I’m planning a trip to Hawaii to make that happenFor well over 10 years, we’ve had sex pretty much every day, although if my mood is lower it can be harder for me to get into the right headspace. I inherited a tendency to depression – both my mother and grandmother were sectioned – but once Scott gets the ball rolling I can usually find my groove. No matter how long you’re with someone, there’s always more to discover. Scott mentioned a while ago he had this fantasy of having sex on a boat, so I’m planning a trip to Hawaii to make that happen. If he mentions a particular sexy costume he’s into, I’ll always find it (though I tease him about resenting the extra laundry).Really, though, it’s maintaining a sense of everyday courtesy that keeps our relationship strong; Scott and I come from pretty chaotic backgrounds, so neither of us ever takes calmness or politeness for granted. We still hold the door for each other, do our fair share of the housework, and ask each other about our days without fail. When you’ve got that, the rest just flows – including amazing sex.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Though she’d tell you she kissed me first, she’d been playing hard to get with me for months before that.Hilariously, when I was younger I had this reputation as a player, but I had no damn clue what I was doing in bed. It’s a blessing to be with someone loving and patient as you figure out how each other’s bodies work. It’s trial and error really.We’ve experimented with having sex in less-expected places on holiday: on our balcony in Greece at sunset, or on a beach in Mexico at midnightI’m the one to initiate sex at least 75% of the time – I almost feel like my sex drive has increased since my teens – but Sarah has been instigating it more and more recently, which I love. We’ve experimented with having sex in less-expected places on holiday: on our balcony in Greece at sunset, or on a beach in Mexico at midnight. When something doesn’t go according to plan, we always laugh through it.These days, I’d say we have sex more frequently than any other couple we know, which has probably been helped by our decision not to have children. We never have to worry about bath time or homework, so instead we can spend an hour or two before bed just focusing on each other. Living on our own also means sex isn’t limited to the bedroom – we’ll often do it in the living room with porn on the TV, or against the kitchen island – and there’s so much more that we want to try together. I’d be quite open to a threesome, and Sarah is interested in experimentation too.That said, we both know there’s never any pressure to have sex, whatever form it takes – and that’s really key. On the rare occasions when Sarah’s really feeling down, we’re 100% just watching a rerun on the couch, and as long as I get to be with her, that’s more than enough.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My dad starteda business when I wasfive.Now it’sworth several million. My brother was invited by my dad to go into the business when he left university. I was not. By then, the business was well established and mydadstayed on as CEO. Mydadgave my brother 80% ofit.He will now sell the business andrealisemillions, meaning he can retire early.My dadhelped me with university fees and house purchases. He’s told me I will inherit the house and whatever money is leftwhenmy parents pass away, which is likely to be inabout 20 years. I doubt there will be anything left.Mydadsaid hewill leave my child and my brother’sdaughtersome moneytoo.He said this will be equal amountsas“things have to be fair and equal”. Given my brother has millions, and his daughter will never have any financial concerns, I find thismakes the situation even more unequal.It really hurts.I struggle to pay my mortgage and find covering basic costs hard. My brother has always had a high salary from the business, andan extremelyluxurious lifestyle, including a second home.When I’ve raised this issue with myparents, I’ve beenrepeatedlytoldI am horribly ungrateful. Boththink that because my brother worked in the business and I didn’t, I don’t deserve ashare in it.I feel that if another employee had done my brother’s job, they wouldn’t have been given 80%of it.Iam a doctor and work really hard. I regularly help mydad withhealth issues, but no matter what I do in mycareer or personallife, I feelhorribly dismissed.How can I come to terms with this?I felt the sting of injustice in your letter and wondered why better conversations weren’t had earlier on. But this is what happens when families don’t sit down and discuss such important matters.I went to the UKCP-registered psychotherapist Michelle Briggs. She said: “Money can often be a proxy for other things going on in relationships. The line that really stood out for me in your letter was that you feel horribly dismissed and a second-rate member of the family. It sounds as if you are valuing your self-worth based on the money your parents give you, when in truth you feel emotionally neglected.”I wonder if you could raise the imbalance you feel with your parents without mentioning money?It sounded as if your dad’s foray into business wasn’t easy, so Briggs wondered if your early years were marked by financial worry that you picked up from your parents. Were you bothered about not being invited into the family business at the time, or is it only now that you feel the exclusion?Briggs pointed out that your parents gave you “a very large contribution to your house, and paid for your education, even though it is a fraction of what was given to your brother, so it isn’t that they don’t care at all”. They are also leaving you the house in their will, plus whatever may be left over.My friend only ever wants to talk about herself. Should I cut her off? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreBut the overarching theme in your letter is that you believe your parents favour your brother over you. I can’t make this better for you. You say you don’t want to talk to them, but I wonder if you could raise the imbalance you feel without mentioning money?Briggs felt this could be a chance to think about the sort of relationship you’d like with your family. “It will take courage and there’s a risk you may hear things you don’t like, but airing your feelings with them will still help you move on.”What would make things OK for you? Is there an imagined scenario that would put things right, and is that achievable? I wonder what your brother’s take on all of this is.You won’t shake off this feeling of injustice unless you talk to your parents, but you don’t have to centre on money, and it may help if you acknowledge what they have done for you, even if you don’t think things are fair.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

While the 6ft 9in center once regularly played more than 80 games in a regular season, he’s hit new career lows, appearing just 40 times on court during the 2024-2025 season. Following the money, however, suggests Thompson is pivoting into a new career. He’s rebranded as a crypto investor, consultant and brand ambassador, bringing his relative cultural cache to the blockchain. Now the host of his own podcast, Courtside Crypto, he has made frequent appearances with other crypto celebrities, such as at the Nasdaq in September, when hecelebrated the IPO of an explicitly nationalist Bitcoin mining operationalongside Eric Trump; Thompson has also developed a crypto startup slated to launch in 2026.In 2025, crypto is back in style in Washington and among agrowing set in Hollywood, where Thompson lives adjacent to the Kardashian clan, some of whom have been crypto spokespeople. Donald Trump has reversed Joe Biden’s legal offensive against crypto, debuting his own token, $Trump, before his inauguration, and rolling back government actions against the industry, which heavily supported him during his bid for the presidency. Celebrities have likewise returned to hawking cryptocurrency projects or launching tokens of their own.View image in fullscreenIggy Azalea in North Hollywood, California, in 2025.Photograph: Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for MemeHouse Productions”Thompson is not the only pro sports figure diving in. Lamar Odom, a former basketball star, launcheda crypto coinin May that partially funds addiction recovery, and Mike Tyson, the former boxing legend, isa spokesperson for Naga, a Robinhood-like trading platform that includes cryptocurrency products. Outside sports, Thomspon stands shoulder to shoulder, metaphorically speaking, with figures such as Iggy Azalea, an Australian rapper, who, in addition to her work as the spokesperson forher $MOTHER crypto token, was featured alongside Thompson and Eric Trump as a keynote speaker atthe 2025 Blockchain Futurist Conferencelast month. At the November conference, Azalea was named the creative director ofThrust, a new platform allowing celebrities to issue their own branded meme coins, a subset of cryptocurrencies that are billed as purely speculative and arenot enforcedas securities. Streaming personalityN3on was the firstto launch his meme coin on the Thrust platform. Actor Megan Fox will be next.“A few years ago, most celebrity crypto stuff came off like quick stunts, and now, people expect an actual plan and some kind of real value for communities, not just a splashy moment,” Azalea told the Guardian via text. “Yes, I think celebrities are still curious about the space, but are a lot more careful. No one wants to be linked to something chaotic or sloppy.”Through limits on how token issuers can sell their own shares, the project claims to mitigate the potential for token collapses and pump-and-dump schemes. The industry may not have entirely reformed, though: Azalea’s $MOTHER meme coin facedallegationsof insider trading almost as soon as it launched in May. Azalea has denied dumping $2m worth of tokens and has disclaimed any control over, or knowledge of, the people who owned them.Crypto springCelebrities were enamored with crypto schemes at the peak of the market in 2021, when Matt Damon appeared in a Super Bowl ad for a crypto company. But after the fraud-induced collapse of crypto exchange FTX, A-listers faced a wave of lawsuits and penalties, part of a wider regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency under the former president. Celebrities listed as defendants in crypto-related court cases includedTom Brady, Shohei Ohtani, Steph Curry,Shaquille O’Neal, Naomi Osaka,Cristiano Ronaldo,Floyd Mayweather, and Kim Kardashian– sister to Khloé Kardashian, with whom Tristan Thompson has had a tumultuous relationship and two children. In 2022,Kim Kardashian settled with the SECfor $1.26m over charges in connection with illegally promoting a crypto security, EthereumMax.The rich and famous backed off promoting digital currency in the ensuing years. The Kardashian case “tamped down on all celebrity involvement” in crypto, according to Dr William Mullins, a professor of finance at UC San Diegostudyingthe effects of celebrity influence on individuals’ crypto investments. Celebrities in the crypto realm can reach hundreds of millions of followers cheaply via social media, and they can easily establish a narrative since most fiduciary advisors steer clear of the sector, he said. Directing follower attention can be incredibly lucrative, since crypto investments are largely a “coordination game” driven by demand, rather than underlying fundamentals, Mullins added, making crypto “extraordinarily vulnerable to celebrity influence”.View image in fullscreenKhloé Kardashian at the 2022 Met Gala.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue“A lot of people are more comfortable when the President of the United States launches a meme coin,” said Jake Antifaev, the co-founder and CEO of Thrust.$Trump demonstrated meme coins’ lucrative potential, though its windfall may have come at the expense of other celebrities’ crypto ambitions. In May, Trumppersonally hosteda dinner for the 220 largest holders of $Trump, and held a private “reception” for the largest 25 buyers. These individuals collectively spent around $148m purchasing $Trump tokens, the Guardianpreviously reported. According to Andrew Duca, the founder of crypto-focused tax platformAwaken, the $Trump token “sucked up so much liquidity” that it caused other meme coins’ price to fall, which may have dissuaded other celebrities from launching their own tokens.Duca said celebrity activity in crypto in 2025 is markedly different from what we saw in 2021. “Last cycle, you were getting more A-list celebs … and this cycle, you basically only saw the griftier celebs actually participate,” he said. These celebrities’ endorsements in 2025 primarily center around meme coins, rather than more traditional cryptocurrencies or crypto exchanges, Duca added.According to Paul Afshar, chief marketing officer atPaybis, a crypto exchange, celebrities are opting for meme coin launches because “the economics are not the same” compared with the crypto-endorsement craze of 2021: major crypto companies once offered eight-figure endorsement deals, but those big-budget campaigns have dried up, as they failed to retain users and were eventually seen as too legally risky.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 2024.Photograph: Kevin Wurm/Reuters“So, instead of coordinated campaigns backed by crypto companies, we’ve got celebrities trying to monetize their own audiences directly through token launches,” Afshar told the Guardian via email. “It’s lower budget, higher risk, and reaches far fewer people than the 2021 celeb craze ever did.”During his first tenure in office, Trump was a vocal crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin “a scam against the dollar”. After entering office a second time, though, his administration rescinded a range of regulatory bulletins and policies perceived as restricting the growth of the crypto industry. His U-turn has also come with a windfall in other crypto-related deals and tie-ups for Trump family businesses – not just the $Trump meme coin, or the$Melania meme cointied to the first lady. Estimates suggest that the September launch of another Trump-affiliated crypto token, $WLFI, may havebuoyed the Trumps’ net worthby as much as $5bn, and may have become the Trump family’s most valuable asset – edging out their real estate portfolio. The Genius Act, the first major federal law to explicitly legalize blockchain-based products in the US, which Trump signed into law in July, did not bar the relatives of elected officials from engaging in crypto-related business. Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, has denied that the president ever engaged in a conflict of interest.In an interview with the Guardian, Thompson said he thinks many figures in the crypto industry have been unfairly punished in the past, and he welcomes Trump’s enthusiasm for the industry, includinghis pardon in October of Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of crypto platform Binance, who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws for failing to report suspicious transactions with organizations such as al-Qaida.Thompson is familiar with how quickly fortunes can change in the cryptocurrency industry. In February,he debuted Tracy AI, an automated sportscasting platform, and served as its chief content officer and lead adviser. The startup already appears defunct:its websiteno longer functions, and the company haspublished instructionson how to transfer $TRACY, the platform’s crypto token, into other major crypto denominations.View image in fullscreenTristan Thompson at All Star Tracy AI in San Francisco, California.Photograph: Cassidy Sparrow/Getty Images for Tracy AIAdditional celebrity activity in the crypto sector may come through two paths, said Duca, the crypto-taxation entrepreneur. More buttoned-up ventures, such as companies working in stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency pegged to a more stable asset like the dollar, may launch ad campaigns with well-regarded brand ambassadors, similar to Jennifer Garner’s deal with Capital One, he theorized. Duca also foresees celebrities tying up with prediction markets like Polymarket or Kalshi, especially sports stars, whose followers may use gambling platforms like DraftKings. Prediction-market sites have “so much cash”, and already have endorsements in play with tech figures, he added.Thompson’s upcoming venture, Basketball.fun, is a crypto-inflected hybrid of DraftKings and Polymarket that is slated to launch early next year. In Thompson’s words, the company will “be a disruptor to traditional gambling” by adding a “prediction market component, because obviously, right now, the prediction market is going crazy”. The platform will use a fantasy league-type user experience as its foundation, minting a meme coin assigned to every player in the NBA, and allowing users on the platform to determine the value of the player by trading those currencies, rather than using the weighted scores companies like ESPN and FanDuel assign to a player. The Polymarket-esque prediction market component lets users set their predictions on the future value of players’ coins. In aggregate, Thompson thinks these efforts can help dis-intermediate the current sports-watching experience, refracted through broadcast networks.Speaking to the Guardian the same morning, Chauncey Billups, a former NBA star, was arrested for his alleged role in an illegal gambling scheme – while several insider gambling investigations are ongoing in the NBA and Major League Baseball – Thompson emphasized that NBA players and other sports professionals should not bet on their own games. At the same time, he criticized sports networks’ prominent display of betting products during broadcasts. “Why can’t we challenge [the networks] and give the people an opportunity to be in control and take back their rights?” he asked.Thompson, whorecordeda special episode of his podcast from the White House in July, said his affinity for the Trump presidency goes beyond their shared passion for crypto: “I stand by what President Trump’s about,” he said. He cited the Trump administration’s slate of tariffs as one path towards empowerment, and pointed to the economies of Israel, Russia, and Dubai as ones where “they [successfully] keep money circulating within the country” to generate wealth.“I believe President Trump is trying to do it when he says, ‘make America great again’,” said Thompson, who was born in Canada and became a US citizen in 2020. “And I think what he’s trying to do, it’s very similar to how it was when the early settlers came around, where the money was circulating [internally]. That’s when America was at its peak … there was so much money being made, so he’s trying to just bring that back.

You don’t recognise the brand, but the reviews are fantastic – five-star raves that say things such as “this product changed my life” and “this is the greatest air fryer ever”.You buy it, but when it arrives it is clearly cheap and poor quality, and possibly dangerous, too.Those glowing online reviews were fake.Although explicitlybanned in the UK in April this year, they are continuing to trap consumers.National Trading Standards (NTS), the consumer protection and enforcement body,issued a warningrecently that criminals are using paid individuals, bots and, increasingly, AI to generate fake reviews “on a mass scale”. It says crooks are even creating entire fake review websites, usually linked to specific high-demand products such as air fryers and vacuum cleaners.View image in fullscreenToo many glowing reviews should ring alarm bells, say experts.Photograph: Andriy Popov/AlamyIn many cases those who fall for these fraudulent reviews will receive nothing, or they will get a bad-quality item, or a counterfeit of the brand they were expecting.Estimates vary as to what proportion of all online reviews are fake. A2023 UK government studyestimated that 11% to 15% of all reviews across three common product categories (consumer electronics, home and kitchen, and sports and outdoors) on e-commerce platforms widely used by UK consumers, were not real. Other studies haveput the figure at 30%.What the scam looks likeTraditionally, the business was largely centred on sweatshops located in places such as India and Russia, with people paid to churn out vast numbers of posts to boost a business’s rating. Many of these human-written reviews contain typos, errors and grammar that can be an obvious red flag for UK consumers.However, technology has transformed this “business”, and the AI-generated reviews are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from those written by genuine punters.It is still often the case that they also do not feature much concrete detail about the product or service, or include phrases seemingly copied from the product description (for example “up to 75% less fat than traditional frying methods”).They also often go big on vague phrases such as “I can’t believe this is so great”, have hyperbolic headlines such as “these are the greatest hair stylers ever,” and typically don’t include anecdotes.“Genuine reviews will often be personal and specific to the individual’s experience of using the item, while a fake is more likely to be vague, using generic words and phrases such as ‘amazing’, ‘awesome’, and ‘buy this product’,” says NTS.Similarly, consumer body Which? says “real reviewers will often want to go into detail”.It adds that if there is an extremely high percentage of five-star reviews, “consider how likely it is that so many people found the product to be ‘perfect’. Is the reviewer going over the top in the language? For some this may be natural, but if it happens a lot, be wary”.Alarm bells should also ring if multiple, similar, reviews have been posted all at the same time, or if a reviewer’s account has been activated recently, or has only reviewed a narrow range of products.What to doWhich? says one way to get a more balanced view of a product is toignore the five-star reviews. “Check the four, three and two stars and it’s likely you’ll be getting more honest opinions,” it says.Be particularly careful if you are considering buying a brand you don’t recognise.And look for “verified” reviews and purchases, where the retailer, or marketplace, has confirmed the item was bought through its site.Finally, make sure you use trusted review sites.You can find trustworthy, in-depth and independent reviews by clicking onThe Filter, the Guardian’s home for independent product reviews and recommendations across fashion, beauty, food, tech, appliances and a whole lot more.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchOnline shoppingConsumer affairsCrimeE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

Families who did just that share the hostel horrors and mid-trip meltdowns behind the Instagram feedElle HuntSun 14 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareIt was going to be the adventure of a lifetime. Late last year, Josy and Joe Davis decided to quit their jobs, sell their home and pull their two young daughters out of school to travel the world. Though their life in Gloucestershire was good on paper, post-pandemic it had been increasingly feeling like a grind. Josy, 35, a police dispatcher, worked shifts that swung from early morning to late night. Joe, also 35, a logistics manager, was often on call until 10pm. Neither felt as if they could ever switch off – let alone enjoy family time.Exhausted, Josy caught herself being short with her daughters, Lola and Zara, six and four. “I felt like I spent my days off recovering, rather than actually being present,” she says. Though only in Year 1, Lola was feeling the pressure at school, fretting about where she ranked in the class.Josy and Joe wanted more, for themselves and their children – and Instagram was a constant reminder that it was possible, serving them envy-inducing updates from young families like theirs who had escaped nine-to-fives to explore the world full time. “It made us stop and think,” Josy says. “If they can do it, why can’t we?”In mid-February this year, after storing their possessions and making their farewells, the Davises set out from Heathrow, their lives packed into three suitcases. Their plan was to ease in gently with five days at an all-inclusive resort in Oman. From there, they would travel to Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand.Although they hadn’t booked beyond August, the Davises were open to travelling long-term – Joe had family in Australia and they were curious about the quality of life. What mattered was making the leap.But just three months later, their dream had been brought crashing down to reality. In August, after a family tragedy at home, they were back in England, flights to Bali and Australia cancelled. “Ultimately,” Josy says, appearing on Zoom alongside Joe in Cornwall, where they’ve since settled, “we got to the point where we were thinking: was thisour family’s dream? Orours?”There are nowan estimated 40 million digital nomads– mostly footloose young freelancers, able to meet all their obligations on their laptops as they hop between continents. And since the pandemic, a growing number of families have been making the leap, too, inspired by rising living costs, the increasing ease of remote working and social media influencers modelling it as a possibility. Some even use social media to help fund their adventures.The lifestyle has become known as “worldschooling”: educating children through travel. On Instagram, the#travelfamilytag has 1.3m posts, and#worldschooling350,000. The largestworldschoolingFacebookgroups have around 100,000 members, swapping tips for family-friendly destinations, home schooling resources and sustaining the lifestyle long-term.View image in fullscreenJosy and Joe Davis and their children on safari in Sri Lanka this year.Photograph: courtesy of Josy and Joe DavisFor those who can afford it, the appeal is obvious. Parents get to escape long commutes and stretch their money further; kids gain life skills and a real-world education.Interest in home schoolingis already rocketing, driven by concerns about children’s mental health and inadequate school support. Why not do it in paradise?But the digital nomad lifestyle isn’t always as aspirational as it appears. Many describe loneliness, a lack of community and stress from managing work across time zones.A recent surveyof 4,729 nomads by the online bank Bunq found nearly two in five (38%) struggled with their mental health. Factor in children – not just parenting but educating them – and the dream may seem more daunting than idyllic.New Zealand-born Melissa Wiringi has been travelling with her husband Rimaha and their four children since 2020. Her children are now 18, 16, nine and three; the younger two have never been in formal schooling. Her three-year-old was even born a nomad, in Spain, while Melissa was on a tourist visa.“People thought I was nuts for a while, going on about how I was going to travel the world with my kids,” the 40-year-old says from her family’s base in Hoi An, Vietnam, palm fronds reflected in the mirror behind her. “Making that happen – it was a slow process.”Melissa set the goal back in 2010, after escaping an abusive relationship, with her eldest two children. “It really came down to: what do I actually want from my life? One of my early mindsets was that if I’m going to live my dreams, that’s a good thing for my kids,” she says. “Even if it’s uncomfortable and hard for them, it’s still showing them they’ve got to put their dreams first.”Sceptical of formal schooling, Melissa began home schooling her eldest in 2016, while living an otherwise conventional life near Sydney. Rimaha, 41, was earning a good living as a truck driver, allowing her to quit a job as a travel agent. They set out from Sydney with less than AU$20,000 (£10,000) in savings. “In hindsight, it’s no bloody way of doing it,” she says ruefully. “We just locked it in: ‘We’re going to make this work.’”Their progress was slowed by the pandemic, grounding them in Vietnam. They spent 18 months in An Bang, a tiny beach village where they had connected with other worldschoolers. That turned out to be a blessing, Melissa says, forcing them to embrace a slow pace of travel. “Fast travel, long-term, doesn’t work – it’s tiring for the planner and for the kids. The adventure can quickly turn into a disaster if you’re go, go, go.”View image in fullscreenMelissa Wiringi and family in Vietnam in 2020 …View image in fullscreen… and in Turkey in 2021. Photographs: courtesy of Melissa WiringiThese days, Melissa’s older children’s education tends to be self-directed and informed by their interests, but her younger two learn formally for about an hour every day, with coding and touch-typing on top of core subjects. While travelling, they will read, play games and prioritise informal learning from their environment. “The reality is the kids don’t get the same education as sitting in a classroom,” Melissa says. But she believes it’s better preparation for adulthood. “Now, with five years under my belt, this is worth so much more than I ever set out to achieve.”But the lifestyle isn’t easy, she adds. Sometimes they have turned up at their accommodation, found it not as billed and had to “deal with it for a night, if it’s livable” – or find somewhere else on the fly. They have had to travel while sick, and leave countries sooner than desirable because their visa was up.Melissa is the most restless in the family, “happiest on an adventure”. Her older children, however, prefer some consistency. Her 16-year-old daughter in particular struggles with social anxiety (predating nomadism, Melissa says) and adjusting to new places. After their quiet pandemic stint in Vietnam, landing in busy, urban Istanbul was “a shock”, Melissa says. “She was having a meltdown, like, holy shit, there’s so many people.”Although her children may complain about repacking their bags or travelling by overnight train, they have told her they don’t want to return to a “normal” life. They tried that out in New Zealand in 2023, leasing an Airbnb for six months. But after three months, “they were like, ‘This is boring – we want to go travel again,’” Melissa says happily. “My heart was like: yay!’”When Sharon Ward set out on a “free-range” life with her family, “it felt like we were a giant social experiment”, she says. A New Zealander, she lived in Papua New Guinea as a child, Honduras for part of her teens, then spent 15 years in Dubai, where she started her family. For the past year they have been settled in Bali, from where Sharon appears on Zoom one evening, deeply tanned and apologetic for being in her pyjamas.“I often blame my nomadic ways on my mum and dad,” she says good-naturedly. “They gave me the bug.” In September 2020, Sharon, her husband Mike (also a New Zealander) and their two daughters, then aged eight and five, left Dubai to travel. Sharon, 44, had been managing a group of childcare centres, while Mike, 46, a builder, fitted out the interiors of restaurants and offices.Both routinely worked 50-hour weeks, and saved for three years to afford their trip. They had imagined it as a “gap year”, travelling through south-east Asia and Central America at a clip of two to three weeks a country before settling in New Zealand. But after Covid and travel restrictions disrupted their plans, they settled in for the long haul.A qualified early-years teacher, Sharon was more confident at worldschooling than many parents. They used textbooks, visited museums and historical sites, and, after their eldest turned nine, signed up to an online platform for home learners for extra support.Living off savings, they stuck to a budget and sought out cheap accommodation. “I’d pick a country on Airbnb, drop the price right down to the cheapest possible,” Sharon says. Many listings looked “fairly unsavoury”, or not family friendly, but there were often hidden gems: a comfortable caravan in Spain, abungalow built up a treein Turkey.When money was really tight, they would book a hostel – even once, in Marrakech, a shared dorm, the two girls in a single bed. “A lot of people would say, ‘I wouldn’t take kids into that environment,’ but they’ve always been really good at top-and-tailing,” Sharon says. In Turkey, they spent three nights at a backpackers’ hostel, all four of them sharing a bed.View image in fullscreenSharon Ward’s eldest daughter in a backpackers’ hostel in Australia in 2021 …View image in fullscreen… and the family in Spain in 2022. Photographs: courtesy of Sharon WardWith Mike’s skills as a builder, they were often able to do manual labour in exchange for board through sites such as Workaway and WWOOF. Sharon was also writinga blog, which slowly began generating income.But finding a balance between education, earning and enjoying their adventure was often challenging. When settled at a base, the kids would knuckle down to some focused schoolwork and Sharon would update the blog. But when on the move, both would inevitably fall by the wayside. Some months, Sharon says, “There was no space for anything more than just getting from A to B, unpacking then repacking the bag, figuring out what we were going to eat … ”Their youngest daughter has struggled with change since she was a baby, and early in their travels used to get upset or throw tantrums on the days they were due to relocate. “To alleviate that stress and pressure on her, we’d look for opportunities to stop and just pause for a month,” Sharon says.A planned road trip through Turkey ended up being scrapped to give their daughter time to recharge. Over time she developed coping strategies and is now “quite resilient”, Sharon says. But managing everyone’s needs, booking travel as they went, was a “constant balancing act”, easily thrown out by the unexpected.Their toughest ever month was in Morocco, in June 2022. After a few days in Marrakech, they jumped on a 10-hour bus to Tagounite, a small village near the Algerian border. Sharon and Mike had committed to a one-month homestay on a date farm in the desert, living in a traditional mud brick house in exchange for three hours of work, five days a week.The accommodation was “rustic”, Sharon says, with next to no furniture, dirt floors and palm-frond thatching on the roof; one of their tasks was to patch up parts of the wall. But it was comfortable enough, and they got stuck in. “It was really fun. It was also back-breaking,” she says. This was summertime in the Sahara, with temperatures routinely exceeding 40C. There was no air conditioning and there was limited drinking water.Then their youngest started showing signs of fever. The next day, her sister had the same symptoms. Sharon carried on working while Mike looked after them – then he was struck down as well. “I’ve never seen them that sick in my life,” Sharon says. All three were bedridden, almost delirious. Sharon’s mind was racing. “Typhoid, hepatitis – your brain starts going to all those places.”They arranged a truck to take them to the nearest doctor’s, where they found the waiting room full of people with similar symptoms, leading Sharon to suspect a water contamination. They were given hydration packets and soon recovered.But for Sharon, it was a wake-up call. “I do remember thinking, please God, let us get through this,” she says. She had grown so comfortable with travel, she’d underestimated the potential for things to go wrong. It was the first time she and Mike doubted their lifestyle, Sharon says. “We really started to think: what are we doing to our kids?”However, it proved only a blip: one difficult month in four magical years – it could even be considered part of the worldschooling education, Sharon suggests. “The challenges are hard, but at the same time the rewards are even bigger. When I look at my kids and how well they cope, how resilient they are, how worldly and tolerant, I think a massive reason for that is those experiences of travel.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSharon Ward’s family in Mexico in 2021. Photographs: courtesy of Sharon WardSince January, they have been settled in Bali. Mike has gone back to work, and the girls, now 13 and 10, have joined an international school. Only time will tell how her children look back on their nomadic experiences. “We’ll know in a couple of years whether we’ve broken them or not,” says Sharon, half jokingly.Because digital nomadism is such a recent phenomenon, little is known about the impacts on children – but recent research on early experiences of mobility may give an indication.A large studypublished in the JAMA Psychiatry journal found that adults who had moved frequently as children had a significantly higher risk of depression than those who hadn’t.Clive Sabel, a professor of big data and spatial science at the University of Plymouth and the paper’s lead author, says they did not investigate potential causes, but he speculates that it reflects the effect on friendships, community and sense of belonging. “Social capital is really important, and moving disrupts that.”However, Sabel stresses, “individual familial circumstances” could also play a part – for example, marriage breakdowns and diplomat parents. It “absolutely is not” the case that digital nomads doom their children to depression, he says. Children do need stability, but that can be met within the family unit. “Maybe the parents have a better lifestyle as nomads, and are more present.”Anecdotally, however, the range in experiences is stark. Sabel received a huge response to his paper from adults who had moved around in childhood. “Half said, ‘It was the best thing that ever happened to me’ and the other half said, ‘It was awful.’”By the time the Davis family embarked on their adventure, their daughters were “absolutely buzzing”, Josy says. They had loved going abroad on holidays and approached this flight the same way, running down the airport travelator already wearing their neck pillows.For their parents, “It took a few weeks before it really sank in that this was our new way of life,” Josy says. The biggest shift, landing in Sri Lanka, was the change in pace: waking up without a job to go to, or even a plan for the day. The sudden proximity also took adjustment. Though they had wanted quality time, “it is a lot, to spend 24/7 with your family”, Josy admits.But waking up in their beachfront apartment in Galle, with ocean views from their balcony, they felt sure they had made the right decision. Over three weeks, they found a rhythm, doing 90 minutes or so of home schooling in the morning, then exploring in the afternoon. After the girls had gone to bed, Josy and Joe stayed up editing video of their trip. They had started documenting their travels asThe Roaming Rascalsin the hope of being able to monetise the trip, potentially extending it. “Ultimately, that was how we’d seen that this was possible – through following other families,” Josy says.Online, Lola was being taught maths and phonics; on safari, she and Zara learned about nature, food chains and the importance of conservation. They found out where their tea came from by visiting a plantation. Swimming counted as phys ed. The girls still had low-energy days, squabbles and the occasional meltdown. “Kids are still kids, wherever you are,” Josy says. But they were enthusiastic about the adventure, and took tuk-tuk rides, unfamiliar foods, pre-dawn departures and travel disruptions in their stride.View image in fullscreenJoe and Josy Davis with their girls in Sri Lanka this year.Photograph: courtesy of Josy and Joe DavisEven the harsh contrast between the poverty in Sri Lanka with their privileged life in England seemed valuable, Josy says, “showing our children how other people live,really”. As “mid-budget” travellers, they aimed to spend £80 a night on accommodation and £30 on expenses –roughly the sameas Sri Lanka’s median monthly household income.By the time they reached Thailand in about May, the Davises felt as if they had hacked life. They were spending a month on Koh Samui island, staying in a private villa with a pool in the beach town of Bo Phut. As a popular base for worldschoolers, there were kids’ clubs and groups for them to slot into. And they could eat out for an entire day for what they would have paid for a takeaway back home. Lola’s past worries about school had melted away and neither she nor Zara were showing any sign of homesickness. But two weeks into their stay, they were dealt a blow that they could never have predicted.The family had just piled into their rental car to head to the beach for the afternoon when both Josy and Joe received a text from Joe’s mum in Cornwall. “Call me urgently,” it said. They pulled over and Joe called home. Josy saw his face drop, then Joe broke down: his father had died in a freak accident.The funeral would be in two weeks’ time, in mid-May; they were booked to fly to Bali from Singapore. Joe floated the idea that he would return to England alone while Josy pressed on with the girls, but Lola and Zara pushed back. They had been close to their grandad and were struggling to make sense of what had happened. It hit them just how far away they were from home.After 36 hours of travel, the Davises eventually arrived in England. They spent three weeks there, staying with family. For Josy and Joe, there was no question that they would be resuming their travels. They had been going so well, and Joe’s dad had been nothing but supportive. “We knew he wouldn’t have wanted us to stop,” Josy says.‘Dad said: We’re going to follow Captain Cook’: how an endless round-the-world voyage stole my childhoodRead moreThey decided to skip Bali and return to Sri Lanka, where they had first fallen in love with the travel family lifestyle, intending to revisit their favourite spots and explore more. But this time they found the magic had gone – at least for Lola. Earlier in their travels, she had been up for adventure. Now, Josy and Joe found she was more reluctant, wanting to stay put at their accommodation and swim in the pool rather than the ocean. Getting her along to new destinations became “a bit more of a fight”, Joe says. “We just felt a complete shift,” Josy agrees.Both Lola and Zara kept talking about home, and wanting to call loved ones on FaceTime. Even spotting leopards on a second safari and holding newborn turtles at a sanctuary didn’t lift their mood. When their parents brought up where they might go after Sri Lanka, their daughters were united. “They both just said: England.’”Josy and Joe were torn. On the one hand, Australia was just on the horizon. They had flights booked to Perth and planned to drive a camper van up the east coast from Sydney to Cairns. On the other hand, their daughters were no longer thriving.In late July, Josyannounced totheir 26,500 Instagram followers that, after seven countries and 14 flights, they were stopping their roaming to return to England.With the Davises now settled in north Cornwall, both girls are doing well: Zara has started school and Lola’s past anxieties haven’t returned. Josy credits their experiences abroad with boosting her girls’ self-confidence. But as “incredible” as their five months of family travel were, they were also challenging, emotional and at times overwhelming, she admits. “It’s not all about the Instagram moments … I do think people should show more of the reality.”They are planning to buy a camper van for exploring Europe during the school holidays. But any decisions will be made as a unit. Josy’s advice to any other parents tempted by worldschooling is: “Listen to your children.” It’s possible that Lola and Zara will regret not travelling for longer when they’re older.

But the world is still too often designed without wheelchair users in mindLucy KnightSun 14 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 00.02 ESTShareAlot has changed for people with disabilities since the 1950s, when the then seven-year-old Alice Moira was given her first wheelchair – not least the fact that it was made of wood and she couldn’t push it herself. Technology has come on in leaps and bounds, of course, as has society’s understanding of disability, while moves towards flexible working have, in some ways, made things easier. But wheelchair users still face challenges in a world that, so often, has been designed without them in mind. Recentplans to make cuts to disability benefitsin the UK have raised concerns that disability rights might be retreating. Thirty years on from the UK’sDisability Discrimination Actbecoming law, Moira, now 81, chats to 25-year-old Lochlann O’Higgins about what their experiences of using a wheelchair have had in common – and how they differ.Do you remember the first time you used a wheelchair?Lochlann O’Higgins:No, I was two. My parents told me about it, though. I have brittle bone disease, so I used to break my bones a lot and I couldn’t walk. In the hospital, the first time I got in a wheelchair, I apparently just jumped in it and started wheeling up and down the corridor, having the best time of my life because I was able to move around freely for the first time. The nurses and my mum were scared I was going to crash into a wall.View image in fullscreen‘I was really scared of being put in a chair and having to stay in it’ … Alice Moira.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAlice Moira:From the age of four and a half I attended St Margaret’s, Croydon, a boarding school for children with cerebral palsy. I learned to walk at seven in callipers, and there were handrails all over the school, so we could go anywhere. However, I leaned badly to one side, so they eventually decided that I should go in a wheelchair, which was a wooden chair with two wheels at the back. I was really scared of being put in a chair and having to stay in it. I also thought that I’d get labelled as being handicapped, which didn’t suit me at all. I was going to fight the world whether they liked it or not. So for a year, I refused to sit down, even for lessons, and they eventually built me a table with a hole in the middle so I could stand and still do my work.What were your school years like?AM:At 10, I got pushed out of school because I’d not learned to read. My dad managed to get somebody in Moorfields eye hospital to have a look at me, and they came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with my eyes, part of my cerebral palsy. My eyes didn’t get steady enough for me to see words continuously until I was 17. By the time I left St Margaret’s my dad, along with some other parents of children with cerebral palsy, had set up the Spastic Society [now known as Scope] which had started to open schools, so I attended those until I was 19.LOH:I spent my early years in China, where my parents, who are Irish, were working. We came over to the UK, to Staines, when I was eight, and I went to a non-disabled school, which brings its own unique set of difficulties. I spent a lot of time in hospital, which kept me out of school, so I was a bit late to learn how to read. I was always the only one in a wheelchair in my classes. I had really good friends. They always wanted to have a go in my wheelchair.Wheelchairs can’t go everywhere and they can’t do everything. That’s just how it isAM:Yes, mine too – it was perfect for riding down hills, with everybody else on the back!LOH:In that sense, people were very interested in me – I was unique – but sometimes there were certain things that I couldn’t do, like PE lessons or playing football. That was difficult sometimes. Wheelchairs can’t go everywhere and they can’t do everything. That’s just how it is.Do you ever get frustrated by that?AM:Frustration is something that’s always there. But it’s a question of thinking outside the box. For example, Ian, my late husband, and I were both in wheelchairs, and when we went on holiday we would give our helper a camera to take whenever she went where we couldn’t, so that we could see whatever it was.View image in fullscreen‘I had really good friends at school – they always wanted to have a go in my wheelchair’ … Lochlann O’Higgins.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHow have you navigated the workplace as wheelchair users?LOH:I’m studying for a master’s in software engineering, but before that I did remote work as a freelance web designer. I applied for a few jobs, but I preferred working from home. I find that commuting is a lot of extra stress.AM:Before I left school, I’d already typed out a list of the things I could do and things I couldn’t do. What I put on top of my list was the ability to solve problems, to talk to people, to understand people. There was nothing very physical in my list. And then it was a question of fitting those things into a job situation. So I decided to become a social worker. I had to get an unqualified social work post before I took on social work training. I made 200 applications and got one answer, and the one answer interviewed me four times because they weren’t sure whether I was capable.Alice, you now rent from theHabinteg housing association, which was set up by your father and other leading figures at Scope to provide accessible accommodation that was suitable foreveryone, including disabled people. Howwas the experience of finding accessible housing?AM:I don’t think it’s ever easy. There isn’t enough of it. I know from working as a social worker that there are people in high-rise blocks and flats who had become disabled while living there - they had a stroke, for example – and can’t even get out of their homes. When I got into university, the only condition I was given was to find my own accommodation. Eventually I found somewhere, but it was in Marlow, and outside High Wycombe, where I was studying, by several miles. To begin with, the taxis used up all my grant. So I applied to a local authority, sending them all the taxi receipts for a whole year. They gave me a travel grant, so the problem was solved, but I had to take the risk of writing and hoping that I’d done the right thing. Luckily for me, I landed on my wheels.View image in fullscreen‘I know from being a social worker that there are disabled people in high-rise blocks who can’t even get out’ … Alice Moira.Composite: Guardian Design; David Levene/The GuardianLOH:It’s completely different now. We don’t have to keep taxi receipts – you just get sent the money, or there’s something called the Motability scheme which is what I use, letting you lease a car. It just makes life easy. It’s much better in London nowadays, but there are still times when you get to an underground station and there’s no lift or escalator and you find yourself stuck. I couldn’t imagine going to university without accessible accommodation. I studied in Twickenham for my undergraduate degree and they had accessible rooms designed for wheelchair users. It’s come a long way, it sounds like.It’s so difficult to find houses at a good price. Sometimes you just have to take what you can getAM:I’m glad it has.LOH:But they only had that accommodation for the first year, so I ended up in the second year having to look for houses with some friends. Our house had steps going in [so we had to install a ramp] and it was really small, which made it difficult to spin around. The kitchen top was too high, so I was sitting there with a knife, chopping things above me. It’s so difficult to find houses at a good price. Sometimes you just have to take what you can get.Lochlann, you play rugby for the Englanduniversitieswheelchair team. How has sport helped you?LOH:I’m a big advocate of getting active – playing basketball, tennis and rugby has helped me find a community. It’s somewhere you can go and relax and be yourself. Early on I started playing table tennis, which was something I could do because you don’t have to be running around. And growing up, when I got back pain, my mum would take me swimming. Getting out of the chair, you just feel so light.View image in fullscreen‘I’m a big advocate of getting active’ … Lochlann O’Higgins.Composite: Guardian Design; David Levene/The GuardianAM:Swimming is brilliant. When I was a teenager, I had a lot of surgery on my legs. They were very sore. So when we went to the sea, my sisters used to drag the wheelchair into the water until it was deep enough for me just to float out.How have things improved for wheelchair users?AM:I was 11 before I had a wheelchair I could push myself. There were problems. One was that it had wooden rims, which filled my hands with splinters. Yuck. Now there has been development in wheelchairs for kids, making them more kid-oriented.LOH:There’s so much technology nowadays which I rely on that helps me get around and interact. For example, I always use Google Maps and I can just search for wheelchair access, or find a lift via the app.Are you concerned about the proposedcuts to personal independence payments(Pip)?LOH:It’s not great. It is very difficult still to get Pip and you have to meet a lot of requirements. I didn’t realise I could get this money until I was 17 or 18, and then that took two years just to apply for. I really hope things aren’t starting to go backwards, because over the past five or six years there has been a lot of progress – I see a lot of people getting more money towards chairs, especially in sports communities. If you want to get the actual sports chairs, they’re six, seven thousand pounds, so when I play sports, I play in a sports chair borrowed from my wheelchair rugby club. I’ve noticed that people who do wheelchair sport are often slightly older, and I think that might be because the people who are a bit younger struggle to get access to the money. I know that they’re trying to work on that.What do you hope to see change for wheelchair users in the future?LOH:Nowadays you can go online and search “community near me” or “sports clubs near me” so wheelchair users can go out and try sports and make new friends. I think that has improved a lot, and I hope it continues to grow.AM:I want to see more opportunities for people to try things and not be constantly confronted with: “Well, you have a disability. How can you do this?” Some people will be able to do some things and others not. But that’s no reason to not let people have the opportunity to try.Explore more on these topicsAll agesDisabilityDisability and sportBenefitsAccessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of them may be working part-time but it’s very hard to do that while studying for a PhD. From what I can gather from our meetings with the students, a lot of them are in debt and getting loans from back home.”The petition sent to Downing Street says the funding crisis “is so severe that some colleagues are now facing court cases over unpaid rent. To survive, some have had to depend on food banks because they have no money to feed themselves.”The students affected are at institutions spread across Britain, including University College London, Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen and the universities of Nottingham, Bradford, Warwick, Lincoln and Liverpool.Ghanaian authorities said that afterPresident John Mahama’s new administrationwas sworn in last January, it found inherited debts to about 110 institutions in the UK worth an estimated £32m.Alex Kwaku Asafo-Agyei, the registrar of theGhana scholarship secretariatin Accra, said an audit of all scholarships given out by the last administration was continuing while a pause had been placed on new scholarships to the UK.After his appointment in April, Asafo-Agyei said he went on a “fact-finding mission” to the UK and drew up instalment plans with some of the institutions. But he said some of the universities had since rescinded the agreements.Asafo-Agyei saidGhanahad made “significant payments to our partner institutions in the UK and we have agreed to amicably resolve these issues so that our students are not at a loss”. He added that he was “not at liberty to make such disclosures without express approval from above”.Asafo-Agyei declined to answer how much of the debt has been paid so far.About 30 of the Ghanian PhD students said the scholarship secretariat had failed to pay their tuition fees since 2024, with some barred from officially graduating, submitting work or accessing their university’s facilities.Others have missed support payments for more than three years, while Bansah said the government had also failed to renew its letters of support for scholarship holders already studying in the UK.Home Office tells foreign students they will be removed if they overstay visasRead moreBansah said: “We all agree that the new government only came into power in January but the reality is that the government was already aware of the situation and it still hasn’t made the payments.“Meanwhile, there is evidence that they have still awarded foreign scholarships, so why are they still awarding scholarships when they know there is still a major problem with the UK?”Earlier this year, more than 180 Ghanaian students at the University of Memphis in the UScomplained about missing paymentsfrom the secretariat.Students from other countries have also struggled with the same problems. In 2020, Nigerian studentsprotestedoutside their high commission in London after some students lost course places.

The foot bones that lend the fossil its name were first discovered inSouth Africa1994, leading to a painstaking excavation over 20 years in the Sterkfontein cave system.Prof Ronald Clarke, a paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, who led the team that excavated the skeleton,attributed Little Footto the speciesAustralopithecus prometheus. Others believed it wasAustralopithecus africanus, a species first described in 1925 and which had previously been found in the same cave system.Australopithecus –meaning “southern ape”– was a group of hominins that existed inAfricaas early as 4.2m years ago.View image in fullscreenStudents visit Sterkfontein where Little Foot was discovered.Photograph: La Trobe UniversityHumans made fire 350,000 years earlier than previously thought, discovery in Suffolk suggestsRead moreBut a new study led by Australian researchers, published in theAmerican Journal of Biological Anthropology, has found that Little Foot’s traits differ from both species, raising a third possibility.“We think it is a formerly unknown, unsampled species of human ancestor,” said Dr Jesse Martin, an adjunct at La Trobe University in Melbourne, who led the research.“It doesn’t look likeAustralopithecus prometheus… but it also doesn’t look like all of theafricanusto come out of Sterkfontein.”View image in fullscreenA map showing the site where Little Foot was discovered.Illustration: La Trobe UniversityMartin, also a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Cambridge, added: “This thing will be part of a lineage of hominins, so it’s possible that we have not just a point in our human family tree that we hadn’t discovered before, but an entire limb of that tree.”Martin said Clarke was “one of the only people to maintain there were two species of hominin at Sterkfontein” and had been “proven to be correct” in that regard.“Where [Clarke] and I depart is I would argue one is definitely notprometheus,” he said.The researchers identified key differences distinguishing Little Foot fromAustralopithecus africanus, including a longer nuchal plane – a region at the back of the skull.“The bottom back of the skull is supposed to be fairly conserved in human evolution, which is to say it doesn’t change that rapidly,” Martin said. “If you find differences between things in the base of the cranium … those differences are more likely to represent different species, because they just don’t change readily, evolutionarily speaking. All of the differences we’ve found are in that region.“To find evidence hiding in plain sight at Sterkfontain of an entirely new species is kind of remarkable and counterintuitive,” Martin added, given “it is the most complete human ancestral fossil in the record”.“We should be able to figure out where it sits in the human family tree.”The study’s authors have not formally reclassified Little Foot, suggesting: “It is more appropriate that a new species be named by the research team that has spent more than two decades excavating and analysing the remarkable Little Foot specimen. We hope they will view our suggestion in this regard as well-intentioned advice.”There has also been disagreement among scientists about Little Foot’s age. The fossil skeleton has been dated as3.67m years old, but other scientists have suggested Little Foot cannot be older than2.8m years.Prof Ronald Clarke, who discovered the skeleton, has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEvolutionArchaeologySouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The hope of living without fear. That fear that torments families,” Kast told the thousands of supporters who waited more than two hours for his speech.Many analysts believe the ultra-conservative succeeded in addressing one of Chileans’ main concerns: rising violence, which has increased in recent years even though the country remains one of the safest in Latin America.Over the past decade, the number of migrants has doubled, fuelled by about 700,000 Venezuelans forced to leave their country amid its economic collapse.Kast repeatedly presented migrants as the reason for rising insecurity. During the campaign, he gave the roughly 330,000 undocumented migrants – most of them Venezuelan – an ultimatum to leave before the next president takes office on 11 March or be expelled “with only the clothes on their backs”.In his victory speech, in which he repeatedly said Chileans were living in “fear”, the president-elect said his administration would show “great firmness in confronting all those who harm us”.He added: “When we tell an irregular migrant that they are breaking the law and must leave our country if they ever want the chance to return, we mean it … We must show great firmness against crime, organised crime, impunity and disorder.”Kast’s platform included a Trump-inspired plan to build detention centres and five-metre-high walls, electric fences and three-metre-deep trenches, as well as an increased military presence along the border, particularly in the north, on the frontier with Peru and Bolivia.This was Kast’s third attempt at the presidency: in 2021, he was defeated by Boric in the runoff.In a televised phone call, Boric congratulated Kast on “a clear victory” and invited the president-elect to a first meeting on Monday morning at La Moneda, the presidential palace in Santiago, to begin the transition.Boric said Kast “will at some point come to understand what the loneliness of power means, and the moments in which very difficult decisions must be made.”Although Jara won the first round in November, Kast’s victory had beenwidely anticipated by pollsand because he was expected to inherit the votes of the other rightwing candidates, which far outnumbered those of the left.Jara called Kast on Sunday to concede and, in a speech afterwards, said she did not want a divided country and that she would lead a “constructive” opposition, but would “condemn any hint of violence, wherever it comes from”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday congratulated Kast, whose victory has added another right wing leader more closely aligned with Donald Trump in Latin America.Under Kast’s leadership, “we are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration, and revitalising our commercial relationship,” Rubio said in a statement.Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei, congratulated his “friend” Kast with a post on social media: “One more step for our region in defence of life, liberty and private property. I am sure we will work together so that theAmericasembrace the ideas of freedom and we can free ourselves from the oppressive yoke of 21st-century socialism.”Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, also congratulated Kast in a post and said he “will continue working” with the Chilean government to strengthen relations between the two countries and to ensure “the preservation of South America as a zone of peace”.Although many analysts see the result as part of a broader rightwing wave sweeping South America – with victories this year inEcuador,BoliviaandArgentina’s midterms– many Chilean analysts also view Kast’s win as a continuation of the alternation of power between left and right since the country returned to democracy after the military dictatorship which lasted from 1973 to 1990.Despite his sweeping victory, Kast will not command an absolute majority in Congress, neither in the lower house nor in the Senate, even when counting all rightwing parties together.The ultra-conservative has pledged to cut public spending by $6bn within 18 months, but has not explained how he intends to do so.“There are many things about what a Kast government will look like that we don’t know because he has not said how he will do them,” said Rossana Castiglioni, a political science professor at the Universidad Diego Portales.“In terms of economic policy, it is very likely we will see adjustment measures typical of the right. But we have no certainty about how he will implement them … where there is far less uncertainty is on security policy, because that has been his workhorse throughout the campaign,” she added.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Parisi, who was running for a third time, still presented himself as an “outsider” and secured a surprising third place with 20% of the vote.“Parisi appealed to an audience of young men who generally had no political engagement,” said Rossana Castiglioni, a political science professor at the Universidad Diego Portales.Now, she said, it is difficult to know where Parisi’s votes will go, since, unlike the other defeated rightwing candidates, he did not endorse Kast in the runoff. Instead, he stuck to his campaign slogan of “neither fascist nor communist”, and many of his voters may end up spoiling their ballots as a form of protest.Still, “if we trust the polls, everything indicates that Kast should be the winner”, said Castiglioni.Heiss said that Kast has benefited from a wave of public “paranoia” on security and migration. Chile’s immigrant population has doubled in the past decade, fuelled by about 700,000 Venezuelans forced to leave their country amid its economic collapse.“There is a fear linked to the emergence of new forms of crime that weren’t common here – such as contract killings, kidnappings and extortion – linked to the arrival of foreign organised crime groups, but they are not the bulk of migrants coming to Chile,” said Heiss.“Heightened fear has created fertile ground for penal populism and iron-fist policies,” she added.In apresidential debate, Kast twice claimed that “1.2 million people are murdered each year in Chile”, a completely unrealistic figure. Despite an increase in recent years, the country actually registers about 1,200 homicides a year, still making it one of the safest in Latin America.Like many rightwing leaders across the region,Kast describes himself as an admirer of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, who has imprisoned at least 2% of his country’s adult population as part of a controversial crackdown on gangs. “Every Chilean voting today, if Bukele were on the ballot, would choose Bukele,” he said in anotherdebate.Jara has also presented her own version of an “iron fist” policy, saying security is her “top priority” and promising to build five new prisons and expel immigrants convicted of drug trafficking.While Jara says she wants to register the roughly 330,000 undocumented migrants through biometric identification, Kast has given them an ultimatum to leave before the next president takes office on 11 March or be expelled “with only the clothes on their backs”.Migrants are a central focus of his platform, which includes a Trump-inspiredplanto build detention centres and 5-metre-high walls, electric fences and 3-metre-deep trenches as well as an increased military presence along the border, particularly in the north, on the frontier with Peru and Bolivia.Despite Kast’s clear praise and references to Trump, the US president has not expressed support for his Chilean follower, unlike in other Latin American elections this year – including Argentina and Honduras, where analysts and local politicians criticised Trump foroutrightinterference.Even without any sign of support from his political lodestar, Kast has continued to revere Trump and his actions. Asked in the debate whether he would support a US ground intervention in Venezuela, the ultra-conservative responded positively, using the motto of Chile’s national coat of arms: “By reason or by force.”Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The party used to sweep city-wide legislative elections and pushChinaon democratic reforms and upholding freedoms.However, mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a perceived tightening of China’s grip on the city prompted Beijing to enact a sweeping national security law to stifle dissent.On Sunday, DP members voted to disband the party and to enter liquidation, its chair, Lo Kin-hei, told reporters after an extraordinary general meeting.“To have journeyed through these three decades, shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong, has been our greatest honour. Throughout these years, we have always treated the wellbeing of Hong Kong and its people as our guiding purpose,” Lo said.Of 121 votes cast, 117 were in favour of disbanding while four were abstentions.Senior party members previously told Reuters they had been approached by Chinese officials or “middlemen” and told to disband or face severe consequences, including possible arrest.There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Hong Kong Liaison Office, China’s main representative body in the special administrative region.Emily Lau, a former DP chair, expressed regret at the vote’s outcome.“Why does an organisation that has done so much for Hong Kong need to end like this? I find it very problematic,” she said.China’s “one country, two systems” arrangement, promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. However, in recent years, authorities have used new security laws to arrest scores of opponents, disband civil society groups and close media outlets.“We were never able to have democracy. We never had the chance to elect our government … We hope it [the principle of one country, two systems] won’t keep shrinking more and more. We hope there won’t be more and more people being arrested,” Lau said.The DP’s vote to disband came a week after Hong Kong held a “patriots only” legislative council election and a day before a verdict is due in the national security trial of the media mogul and China critic Jimmy Lai.China’s move in 2021 to overhaul Hong Kong’s electoral system – allowing only those vetted as “patriots” to run for public office – marginalised the DP by removing it from mainstream politics.In June, another pro-democracy group, the League of Social Democrats, said it would disband amid “immense political pressure”.Senior DP members Wu Chi-wai, Albert Ho, Helena Wong and Lam Cheuk-ting have been jailed or held in custody under a national security law that China imposed in 2020 in response to mass pro-democracy protests the year before.Some governments, including those of the US and the UK, have criticised the law, saying it has been used to stifle dissent and individual freedom.China has said no freedom is absolute and that the national security law has restored stability to Hong Kong.Explore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

He claimed Albanese had “replaced weakness with weakness and appeasement with more appeasement”.“Your government did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia. You did nothing to curb the cancer cells that were growing inside your country. You took no action. You let the disease spread and the result is the horrific attacks on Jews we saw today.”Albanese declined to respond directly when asked about Netanyahu’s comments at a media conference on Monday morning.Timeline: Bondi beach terror attack becomes Australia’s worst mass shooting in three decadesRead more“This is a moment for national unity,” Albanese said in response. “This is a moment for Australians to come together. That’s precisely what we’ll be doing.”Netanyahu praised the actions of abystander who wrestled the gun from one of the attackers, saying he saluted “a Muslim brave man” who prevented the death of “innocent Jews” (the man’s religion was unconfirmed as of Monday morning).“But we are worrying right now about our people, our safety, and we do not remain silent,” Netanyahu said. “We fight those who try to annihilate us.”The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, said in a video message posted online that “vile terrorists deliberately targeted innocent Jewish families celebrating the first night of Hanukah”.“The people of Israel stand together with all of you in this very dark and difficult moment … the Jewish people are strong, resilient and united, and our message is clear: the Hanukah lights must go on and will be lit all over the world, especially in Bondi beach, in Sydney and all over Australia.”0:59Surf camera in Australia shows beachgoers fleeing Bondi beach during shooting – videoThe US president,Donald Trump, said it was “a terrible attack” and “an antisemitic attack, obviously”. He said he wanted to pay his respects “to everybody”.The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the US strongly condemned the attack. “Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.”The former US president Barack Obama said he and his wife, Michelle, were praying for the families mourning victims of the attack. “For everyone lighting a candle tonight, may the glow of the menorah brighten your darkest moments,” he wrote on X.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the news was “deeply distressing”. “The United Kingdom sends our thoughts and condolences to everyone affected by the appalling ‍attack in Bondi beach.”King Charles said he and Camilla were “appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack”. “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully, including the police officers who were injured while protecting members of their community … In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve. I know that the spirit of community and love that shines so brightly in Australia – and the light at the heart of the Chanukah festival – will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.”Bystander tackles and wrestles gun from alleged gunman during Bondi beach mass shootingRead moreThe New Zealand prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said he was shocked by the distressing scenes at Bondi, “a place that Kiwis visit every day”.“My thoughts, and the thoughts of all New Zealanders, are with those affected,” he said. “Australia and New Zealand are closer than friends, we’re family.”The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Ukraine stands in solidarity with Australia in the face of the brutal terrorist attack … which targeted the Jewish community at the start of Hanukkah … Terror and hatred must never prevail – they must be defeated everywhere and every time.”The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, wrote on X: “I am horrified and condemn today’s heinous deadly attack on Jewish families gathered in Sydney to celebrate Hanukkah.“My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hanukkah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackBenjamin NetanyahuAnthony AlbaneseIsraelKing Charles IIIDonald TrumpAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 12 people were killed, including one alleged gunman, and dozens were injured in Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.His words will resonate with representatives of the Jewish community in Australia and across the world who have been warning policymakers about the clear and present danger of such an attack.View image in fullscreenPolice officers guarding a restricted area after the Bondi attackPhotograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesExperts point out that antisemitism was already widely prevalent before the bloody conflict in Gaza, provoked by the Hamas attack into Israel of October 2023, polarised opinions across the world.The most lethal attack against the Jewish community in the US, for example, came in 2018, while in 2023, Michael O’Flaherty, the director of the EU’s agency for fundamental rights, described such hate as a “deeply ingrained racism in European society” that posed an existential threat to the continent’s Jewish community.But there is no doubt that such trends were intensified dramatically by the conflict in the Middle East.In the US, theAnti-Defamation Leaguereported 9,354 antisemitic incidents in 2024, the highest since its records began in 1979. For the first time, a majority “contained elements related to Israel or Zionism”.The Community Safety Trustrecorded 4,296 instancesof anti-Jewish hate across the UK in 2023 – double the previous year – and the most ever documented. There were 3,528 in 2024, the second-highest annual total.0:59Surf camera in Australia shows beachgoers fleeing Bondi beach during shooting – videoIn Australia, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) logged 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents in the 12 months to 30 September, about three times higher than any annual total before the war in Gaza.In a reportearlier this month, the ECAJ said anti-Jewish racism had left the fringes of society and become part of the mainstream, with “an increasing ideological alignment … between neo-Nazis, the anti-Israel left or Islamists”.Terrorism experts know that radicalisation does not occur in a vacuum. Such violence remains a social activity, reflecting broader trends. This means even incidents of race hate seen as relatively minor – hateful graffiti, racist insults in the street, and similar – suggest something deeper and more dangerous.The telescopic sights used by the Bondi attackers would have made every one of their victims plainly visible – talking, laughing, looking after children, greeting friends, hugging relatives at one of the most joyous events in the Jewish religious calendar.Pulling the trigger would have come at the end of a process of dehumanisation that begins well before even swastikas are painted on the walls of synagogues, or schoolchildren are insulted at a bus stop.0:33Vision shows gunman at Bondi Beach – videoSecurity officials have been warning for some time that the Gaza conflict has prompteda wave ofextremist radicalisation across the Islamic world and well beyond. Last year, then US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines,saidthe war “will have a generational impact on terrorism”.The most recent report of the UN committee overseeing sanctions on members of al-Qaida and Islamic State noted that “the Gaza and Israel conflict” still featured prominently in terrorist propaganda, and that “in the US, there were several alleged terrorist attack plots, largely motivated by the Gaza and Israel conflict or individuals inspired and radicalised by [IS]”.This will be a key focus of investigators.There have been some suggestions that Iran, which appears to have been responsible for instigating some earlier antisemitic attacks in Australia, could be to blame. But this would be a dramatic escalation and departure from recent tactics used by Iranian agents, so is improbable.0:59Israel's president sends condolences to Bondi beach shooting victims in Australia – videoBritish officials share information with their Australian counterparts through the Five Eyes security alliance and are likely to have passed on their own concerns about violence targeting Jewish communities following recent incidents in the UK.Jihad al-Shamie, 35,reportedly pledged allegiance to IS before he attacked a synagogue in Manchester on the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur in October, leading to the deaths of two worshippers.In the aftermath, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), issued a new call to arms in an online magazine distributed via social media, urging Muslims in the west to follow al-Shamie’s example.AQAP, which has significant propaganda reach and international ambitions, called for further violence against Jewish communities and offered detailed advice from its “lone jihad guide team” to aspirant attackers.An unconfirmed report from one witness that the killers in Sydney displayed a “black flag with an insignia on it” will interest investigators, as this could indicate an IS allegiance. But there is no evidence so far that the organisation has any link to Sunday’s horrifying events.For the moment, there is merely the sense of a tragedy foretold. “This is the worst fears of the Jewish community,” Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the ECAJ, told Sky News. “It’s been bubbling under the surface for a long time, and now it’s actually happened.”Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackBondi beachAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.Before the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.The move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.The talks were hosted by the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate.

Some partners from the US andEuropedid not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.Zelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.10:32Trump turns on Europe: will he pull support for Ukraine? | The LatestSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.Zelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.A ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s financesby leveraging frozen Russian central bank assetsto fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyNatoFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2011, Bettencourt’s daughter sought to have her declared of unsound mind after she lavished an estimated €1bn in gifts on a young photographer friend.View image in fullscreenNadine de Rothschild in France in 1993.Photograph: Luc Castel/Getty ImagesSpeaking from her home in the Swiss countryside, Nadine, who used to appear regularly on television chatshows talking about manners and etiquette, told the Guardian: “I knew Liliane and I can tell you she was absolutely not a woman you could make do anything she didn’t want. And neither am I under anyone’s influence. You can tell from my voice and answers that it would be hard to influence me.“I am the last Rothschild baroness of my generation. All the others have died. To end my life with a major legal battle like this of course upsets me.“In the beginning I opened my arms to my daughter-in-law; there are photos of us together, I was generous in my personal gifts to her.”View image in fullscreenNadine and Edmond de Rothschild in 1964.Photograph: Henri Bureau/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesThe senior baroness has known harder times. Born Nadine Lhopitalier, she grew up in a communist-supporting family and left home at 14. Two years later, she was sewing poppers on Peugeot sunroofs and working as an artists’ model. Later, she took the stage name Nadine Tallier and played in music halls and small film roles.In the early 1960s, she met Edmond de Rothschild. She later recalled their first meeting, saying: “He looked at my ring and he said, ‘It’s lovely, but unfortunately the diamond is fake.’”The couple married in 1963. From then on, all the jewels were real.As the wife of the wealthiest member of the banking family, Nadine oversaw the running of their 14 properties, where, over several decades, they received thebeau monde– including the Kennedys, Audrey Hepburn, Maria Callas, Princess Diana, Romy Schneider and Greta Garbo.Nadine admits that she was an absent mother to Benjamin, who was brought up by nannies. He claimed she treated him as “an heir” and not a son. She insists she welcomed his wife, Ariane, into the family in 1999 and moved out of the 1,126sq metre Chateau de Pregny into a pavilion in the 18-hectare (44-acre) grounds, leaving the family home to the young couple, who had four daughters.Nadine says that relations between the two baronesses became “irreparable” after Benjamin’s death. She has since left the estate and lives “comfortably” in the countryside outside Geneva.Today, both sides have won legal battles, but the family war rages on. Ariane lost her attempt to ban Nadine from using Edmond’s name for her foundation; Nadine has lost any legal right to enter the château. A third lawsuit over ownership of the artworks and other items is dragging on.A source close to the family said Ariane and her daughters would not discuss the falling out.View image in fullscreenChateau de Pregny in Switzerland is reported to house art by Goya, Rembrandt, El Greco and others.Photograph: Jérémy Toma“Out of respect for all parties involved, the family is not commenting on this matter, which it is dealing with with the utmost restraint,” the source said in a statement. “The family is fully committed to its family activities, working daily to preserve and pass on its heritage.”Nadine is less restrained.“I inherited from my husband many objects that are in the Chateau de Pregny, but it has been impossible to recover them since my son’s death. That is why, sadly, I have been forced to take legal action.”Representatives for Ariane have argued that Nadine made no claim on the works of art until after Benjamin’s death and this being the case, she no longer has a valid claim to them – a question at the heart of the current ongoing legal case.View image in fullscreenAriane de Rothschild in 2017.Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images“We are talking about major objects, classified historic objects that belong in a museum,” Nadine says. “I hardly see the younger generation [of Rothschilds] wanting to be burdened with such things, but in any case my granddaughters will inherit from me.“I haven’t lost hope that my granddaughters will understand that this battle is between their mother and grandmother and not against them. My only hope is that one day they will appreciate that I am doing this for the honour of the family.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeSwitzerlandThe super-richBankingArtnewsShareReuse this content"

It would also completely end the 2030 ban on newpetrol and diesel cars.A future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”If we delay the UK’s drive for electric vehicles, our rivals will overtake us | Jonathan ReynoldsRead moreWritingin the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035. More drivers than ever are choosing electric, and November saw another month of increased sales with EV’s accounting for one in four cars sold.“We’re investing over £7.5bn to support drivers and manufacturers make the switch to zero emission. This includes £4bn investment to back British manufacturing and R&D, create jobs and drive growth in the sector.”“Our electric car grant is making it cheaper than ever to choose an EV, with over 40,000 drivers saving up to £3,750 since launch, backed by an extra £1.3bn announced at the autumn budget.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoringTravel and transportConservativesKemi BadenochGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said it would lead to ambulance queues building up outside A&E departments, patients facing long waits to be seen, widespread “corridor care”, an increased spread of the flu virus – and even greater risk that seriously ill patients would die because of delays in finding them a bed.TheHealth Foundation analysedthe delayed discharges in hospitals in England from July to September last year and the same period this year. It found that:The percentage of bed days used by patients whose discharge was delayed rose from 10.1% in 2024 to 11% this year, an increase of 9% or 19,000 bed days.That rise was driven by an 8% year-on-year rise in the number of discharges, equivalent to about 3,800 patients a month.The number of the NHS’s overall stock of about 100,000 general and acute beds occupied last winter by delayed discharge patients hit a peak of 14%, but it is likely to be even higher this winter.“Winter has already begun but the NHS is already under intense strain, with an unprecedented surge in flu cases for the time of year,” said Francesca Cavallaro, the foundation’s senior analytical manager, who undertook the analysis.“The mounting pressures are compounded by the rising number of patients stranded in hospital beds despite being medically fit to be discharged compared with last year.“Our new analysis shows that 19,000 more hospital bed days were lost due to delays in discharging patients during July to September compared with the same period last year. These delays harm patients and increase pressures on overstretched A&E departments.“Last winter saw a record number of patients forced to wait for 12 hours or more in A&E, so this suggests this winter could be even more gruelling than the last.”Cash-strapped local councils’ inability to put in place the right social care package for patients who are medically fit to leave hospital is a key reason for the growing numbers of delayed discharges, but doctors and NHS leaders says the ageing population and advances in medical science that keep people alive for longer are also significant factors.The president of the Society of Acute Medicine, Dr Vicky Price, said chronic bed shortages this winter would lead to patients dying. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine estimates that 16,600 people died avoidably last winter as a result of delays in getting A&E care or a bed.“These findings fit with our clinical experience and if anything underestimate the problem,” Price said. “This is a complex problem which has been escalating for years, increasing the strain both in hospitals and in the community.”Record numbers of older people and life-prolonging treatment breakthroughs have led to an increase in the overall need for care, she explained.NHS England’s ability to withstand winter pressures has also been compromised by the cost-cutting “reset” of the service’s finances for 2025-26 ordered by its chief executive, Sir Jim Mackey, she said.“Many hospitals have had the number of beds reduced in order to comply with the penalising financial pressures they are placed under.“It was predictable that any additional strain would cause this effect. This is an extremely serious situation. For patients stranded in the emergency department, there is a significant mortality associated with this,” she said.Delayed discharges cost the NHS in England about £200m a month, or about £2bn a year, theHealth Service Journal estimatedin October. That was a small increase on the £1.7bn that theKing’s Fund health thinktank calculatedthe cost to be in 2023.Mackeypredicted recentlythat as many as 8,000 of the NHS’s 100,000 beds could soon be filled with flu patients, given the severity of the outbreak.Rory Deighton, the acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said: “Given the ever-increasing demand that the NHS has seen over the last few years – often from patients who are older or have more complex conditions – it is sadly not surprising to see this analysis highlighting the continued impact delayed discharges are putting on services.“Delayed discharges have been a longstanding challenge for the NHS and can exacerbate winter pressures.“A lack of social and community care can often result in delays getting medically fit patients out of hospital, which in turn can create bottlenecks in the urgent and emergency care system that result in longer ambulance handovers and A&E waits.”Hospital bosses were also “very concerned the upcoming resident doctor strikes will pile yet more pressure on to the NHS and could put patient safety at risk”, he said.A Department of Health and SocialCare spokesperson said: “The shocking delays to hospital discharge we inherited have cost patients and the NHS far too much.“We are working to turn this around. We even started preparing for this winter earlier than ever before – stress-testing hospital plans, working closely with care homes and local leaders, and making sure every part of the system is ready to keep patients flowing safely through hospitals.“We’re ramping up vaccination programmes, with more than 17m vaccines delivered this autumn – hundreds of thousands more compared with this time last year – and more than 60,000 more NHS staff also getting their jab.“We are also joining up NHS and social care through neighbourhood health teams – so more people can get the care they need at home – and backing adult social care with a £4bn funding boost.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ‘cause they’re all right there,” Trump continued, referring to prominent monuments in the nation’s capital dedicated to three of his predecessors.“And it’s something that is so special. It will be like the one in Paris,” Trump said, referring to the Arc de Triomphe, constructed between 1806 and 1836 at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, honoring those who died fighting for France in the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.“But to be honest with you,” Trump said, the new arch Haley will be in charge of constructing will be much better than the one Napoleon Bonaparte ordered up. “It blows it away. Blows it away in every way.”According to the president, his domestic policy chief was stunned by amodel of the triumphal archthe first time he saw it.Trump sued by preservation group over $300m White House ballroom projectRead more“Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming,” the president said, apparently reaching for the word “beaming” in his memory and not finding it.“I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it, and he wanted to do that,” Trump said.“That’s your primary thing,” the president said to Haley. “There is nothing that can compete with that.”Americansstrugglingwithincreased costsdue totariffsimposedby Trump on imported goods – or those whose health insurance premiums are set to double or triple in the coming weeks – might disagree with the president’s claim that the construction of an Arc de Triomphe knockoff should be the main focus of his chief domestic policy adviser.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationWashington DCUS domestic policyArchitectureUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in animmigration crackdownthat has largely targeted Kenner, a New Orleans suburb with a large Hispanic population, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests across south-east Louisiana in December,according tothe Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded inLos Angeles,ChicagoandCharlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests havetaken away parentswho were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.Trump revives family separations amid drive to deport millions: ‘A tactic to punish’Read moreCruz’s detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old US citizen who finished high school this year, to care for his nine-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother’s bank account, locate his sister’s medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother’s name.“Honestly I’m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,” Escalante told the Associated Press. “But I’m willing to take them on if I have to. And I’m just praying that I get my mom back.”The crackdown dubbed “Operation Catahoula Crunch” has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting.Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories. And most in US immigration detention nationwide are immigrants with no criminal record, according to governmentdata.Billy Nungesser, Louisiana’s Republican lieutenant governor, recently became the first state official to break with his party overthe operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed homeout of fear.View image in fullscreenJonathan Escalante, left, and his mother, Vilma Cruz, pose for a photo at his high school graduation in Kenner, Louisiana, on 17 May.Photograph: AP“Are they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids?” Nungesser said.DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach toracially profileHispanic communities.Cruz’s family was supposed to move into their new home this coming January. She leased it so that her son could finally sleep in his own room.Kenner resident Kristi Rogers watched masked agents detain Cruz, a soon-to-be neighbor whom she had not yet met. Rogers said her heart went out to Cruz, and she wondered why she was targeted.“I’m for them trying to clean up the criminals in our area, but I’m hoping that’s all they are detaining and deporting – the criminals,” Rogers said.Jefferson and Orleans parish court records did not reveal any criminal history for Cruz, and her son said she had a clean record.In conservative Kenner, where Hispanics make up about a third of residents andDonald Trumpwon the last three presidential elections, police chief Keith Conley has said that the federal immigration operation is a “prayer answered”.As evidence of violence committed by immigrants in his city, Conley shared about a dozen press releases issued since 2022 documenting crimes in which the suspect was identified as being in the US illegally, including sex offenses, a killing, gang activity and shootings. He said residents were also at risk from immigrant drivers who are unlicensed and uninsured.Jose Reyes, a Honduran construction worker and landscaper whose family says he has lived in the US for 16 years, stayed home for weeks to avoid federal agents. But the father of four had to pay rent, so last week he drove to the bank around the corner.Unmarked vehicles began following Reyes and pulled up alongside his car as he parked in front of his house in Kenner. A video reviewed by AP showed several agents leaping out and removing Reyes from his car as his sobbing daughters screamed for mercy.View image in fullscreenPeople hug inside their family-operated gas station shop as border protection agents patrol outside in Kenner, Louisiana, on 5 December.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPA“We were begging that they let him go,” said his eldest daughter, 19-year-old Heylin Leonor Reyes. “He’s the one who provides for food, pays bills, pays the rent. We were begging them because they’re leaving a family totally in the dark, trying to figure out what to do, figuring out where to get money to get by.”Asked about the arrest, DHS said Jose Reyes committed an unspecified felony and had previously been deported from the US.

        "Content": "16.05 ESTClosing summaryWe’re wrapping up our live coverage of the aftermath of a shooting at Brown University that left two people dead and eight people still in hospital. Here is what we know so far at a glance:A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person.A shooter dressed in blackkilled at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown Universityduring final examson the Ivy League campus.Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.Smiley declined to name any of the shooting victims, saying authorities had not yet been able to contact all the relatives.Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”Politicians have condemned the attack and called for more action to combat gun violence in the US.Among them were senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla as well as former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. According to the university’s website, the building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices. Brown, one of the America’s most prestigious colleges, has roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students.Share"

Meanwhile, the measure introduced by Cassidy – a physician – and his Republican colleague Mike Crapo is built around government payments of $1,000 into the health spending accounts of people enrolled in bronze or catastrophic exchange plans, which typically have high deductibles. People from the ages of 50 to 64 would get another $500, and there would be limits for all who received the funds on using the money to pay for abortions or gender-affirming care.Cassidy’s plan received no Democratic backing. He argued, however, that Democrats must also consider the burden of high deductibles in their approach, stating: “You’ve got to put cash in the patient’s pocket to pay the out of pocket.”He continued: “I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credit for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we’ve got to do something” for $6,000 out of pocket deductibles.“I think there’s a deal to be had here,” Cassidy added. “We need to push for that deal.”Cassidy said he was actively working to find a compromise that could appeal to both sides of the aisle. “Let’s address our concerns,” he said. “And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that’s what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium – but also helping everybody with their deductible.”His remarks come as senators express hope that some form of agreement could emerge after Thursday’s unsuccessful efforts. SeveralRepublicanshave signaled openness to continuing the enhanced tax credits temporarily, with certain restrictions, noting that roughly 22 million Americans could lose assistance when the credits lapse at the end of the month.“We can get this done,” Cassidy said. “And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Perez did not provide many other details about the person, including whether that person was connected to Brown.NBC News, citing law enforcement sources,reportedthat the person of interest was Benjamin Erickson, 24, a former soldier who has lived in Wisconsin and Washington DC.Erickson could face charges in the coming hours, the outlet reported.Brown University shooting: what we know so far about the attack in Providence, Rhode IslandRead moreErickson served as an infantryman in the US army between May 2021 and November 2024, an army spokesperson confirmed to NBC News.The Guardian has not independently confirmed the identity of the person in custody, but a social media profile for a person of that name, with those same dates of military service, indicates that he had enrolled at the University of Wisconsin during the pandemic, but recently “transferred to Brown University after leaving service to attend in the fall 2025 semester”.The same profile indicates that Erickson was open to volunteering in two locations: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Providence,Rhode Island.The FBI director, Kash Patel, said on Sunday that the agencyactivatedits “cellular analysis survey team to provide critical geolocation capabilities”, adding that law enforcement was able to detain the person of interest “based off a lead” by Providence police.The person of interest was taken into custody about 17 miles from Providence, at a hotel in Coventry,according toreports. Perez said authorities at the moment were not searching for anyone else in connection with the shooting.According toa CNN photojournalist who was staying at the hotel, guests were woken up shortly before 4am to loud banging from police who said: “Open up.”Guests also heard police saying, “We have a warrant for your apartment,” and that they were going to take the person of interest “back to the cruiser”.Map depicting areas in Providence, Rhode Island near shootingLaw enforcement often uses the term “person of interest” to refer to someone whom they consider important to a criminal investigation – but whom there is not enough evidence to consider a suspect and accuse of having committed the underlying offense.A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a room at the hotel in Coventry, which was a Hampton Inn, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources.Saturday’s shooting at the Ivy League institution occurred during final exams at the campus. The attack erupted in the engineering building, and the shooter initially managed to flee.Hundreds of police officers scoured Brown as well as nearby neighborhoods while poring over surveillance video in search of the shooter, who opened fire inside a classroom.One of the people wounded in the shooting has been discharged from the hospital, one victim remains in critical but stable condition and seven others remain in stable condition, police said on Sunday.Durham Academy, a private K-12 school in Durham, North Carolina, confirmed that Kendall Turner, a recent graduate now at Brown, was critically wounded. The school said her parents were with her.“Our school community is rallying around Kendall, her classmates, and her loved ones, and we will continue to offer our full support in the days ahead,” the school said.Speaking toOcean State Media, Brown economics professor Rachel Friedberg said that the attack occurred during a final exam review session for her class.Friedberg, who was not present during the attack, learned of the details from a teaching assistant who was leading the session.View image in fullscreenPeople gather for a candlelight vigil on Sunday following the shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images“The room has stadium seating with doors that enter at the top,” Friedberg recounted. “He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something – he couldn’t remember what he yelled – and started shooting.“Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot … I don’t know if they’re the only ones who got shot or not.”Identified by the New York Times as Joseph Oduro, the 21-year old teaching assistantsaidthat upon entering the lecture hall, the gunman shouted something. Oduro said that he and the other witnesses “have been trying to piece together” what the gunman was saying.“The students in the middle were impacted the most,” Oduro added. “Many of them were lying there and they were not moving. I have no idea how many.”Meanwhile, one student, 18-year-old Spencer Yang, described being shot in the leg while helping another student as they stayed hidden.“To keep him conscious, I just started talking to him so he didn’t close his eyes and fall asleep,” Yang, a first-year student,toldthe New York Times from a Rhode Island hospital where he is currently recovering from his leg wound.“I handed him my water … He wasn’t able to respond that well. He was just there nodding and making noise,” Yang said, adding: “He’s stable now, thankfully.”Among those at Brown during Saturday’s attack was 20-year-old Zoe Weissman, who had survived the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 victims.“So … my friend called me, I’m in my dorm and she asked if I was in Barus and Holley, which is the building where the shooting occurred, and I told her, no,” Weismantold MS NOW.View image in fullscreenFlowers rest in front of the Barus and Holley engineering building on the day after the shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.Photograph: Taylor Coester/ReutersShe added: “And I’m actually from Parkland, and I survived the shooting there. And, so, I was like, I just – that’s where my brain immediately went. And I was like, tell me if there’s a shooting and they confirmed for me. And so ever since then, I’ve just been staying in my room. I’ve been on the phone with my family, my friends, and just keeping updated.”Weissman attended a middle school next to the site of the 2018 Parkland mass murder.“I think mentally, you know, I feel like I’m 12 again,” she said. “This just feels exactly like how I felt in 2018. But honestly, I’m really angry. I’m really angry that this is happening to me all over again, and I’m just in shock.”Providence leaders on Sunday warned residents there would temporarily be a heavier police presence in the community. And many local businesses announced that they are closed for now, citing the shock and heartbreak caused by news of the deadly shooting.“Everybody’s reeling, and we have a lot of recovery ahead of us,” Brown president Christina Paxson said at the news conference.A shelter in place order connected to Saturday’s shooting was lifted at 5.42am Sunday. However, a message to the university community warned that access to certain areas of campus will remain limited. And the message warned that people who leave certain buildings, including apartments, within a police perimeter would be “unable to return”.“It is important to follow instructions from law enforcement at all times,” the alertsaid.On Sunday morning Paxsonannouncedthat all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.“In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus,” Paxson wrote.Saturday’s violence at Brown brought the number of mass shootings in the US for the year to at least 389, according to theGun Violence Archive. Saturday was the 347th day of the year.View image in fullscreenProvidence mayor Brent Smileys speak during a press conference near the campus of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on Sunday.Photograph: Bing Guan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Gun Violence Archive, a non-partisan resource, defines mass shootings as ones in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.Such bloodshed occurring at Brown reignited the US’s ongoing debate on whether the federal government should implement more substantial gun control in response to the perennially high numbers of mass shootings reported in the country.Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, drew parallels to the Sandy Hook shooting in his state of Connecticut, which killed 26 people.“What I know is that a community never, ever recovers from a shooting like this,” he told CNN on Sunday, the 13th anniversary of the elementary school shooting.Two people dead and nine wounded in mass shooting at Brown University, as suspect remains at largeRead moreHe went on to call for stricter gun laws, saying states with them have lower rates of violence than those with lax restrictions.Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, echoed similar sentiments to NBC on Sunday.“I can tell you that as a pastor who has presided over many funerals, I don’t think that there’s any pain deeper than when nature is violently reversed and rather than children burying their parents, the parent has to bury the child,” Warnock said. “And so we pray prayers for these families. But we have to pray not only with our lips – but with our action.“Any nation that tolerates this kind of violence year after year, decade after decade in random places on our college and school campuses without doing all that we can to stop it is broken and in need of moral repair.”Donald Trumpalso paid his tributes, with the president saying on Sunday: “Brown University, great school … really one of the greatest schools anywhere in the world.“To the nine injured, get well fast and to the families of those two that are no longer with us, I pay my deepest regards and respects.”Explore more on these topicsRhode IslandGun crimeUS crimeUS politicsUS universitiesUS school shootingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Organizers won a vote to form a union for the very first time in one of the grocery chain’s 530 US stores.Whole Foods is owned byAmazon, which has spent years quashing unionization efforts within its sprawling empire. This result amounted to another blow in the tech giant’s armor.Workers at Starbucks had shown in the preceding years how – in the face of heavy resistance from a determined multinational employer – one such victory couldset the stage for hundreds more. A new wave of momentum had taken hold in the US labor movement.“We are excited to begin the next chapter of this journey,”declaredthe Workers of Whole Foods Center City Philadelphia. Once they had turned the page, however, the chapter proved slow and arduous.Trump fires senior labor board official in ‘unprecedented and illegal’ moveRead moreJust one week before the Whole Foods union ballot result came through,Donald Trumpreturned to the White House. On his watch a crucial federal agency overseeing the US labor force has been “crippled”, according to insiders – and the new wave of momentum waned.Excitement gave way to frustration in Philadelphia. “Due to the fact that the NLRB isn’t functioning … we’re just waiting around,” said Ed Dupree, who works at the Whole Foods Center City store.The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the top US labor watchdog, is tasked with protecting workers’ rights, overseeing the labor movement and ruling on disputes between employers and unions.Its five-seat board, which hears disputes and oversees union elections, requires at least three members to issue a ruling. But days after regaining power, Trumpfired Gwynne Wilcox– an unprecedented decision – from the board, leaving it without this crucial quorum to make decisions.Across the labor movement, many workers, in Philadelphia and far beyond, have been enshrouded in uncertainty ever since.Rather than recognize the result of the vote, Whole Foods objected, triggering a long process of delays and legal challenges. While a regional NLRB directorsided withthe union, ruling against Whole Foods’ objections, a spokesperson for the chain told the Guardian it “strongly” disagrees with the regional director’s decision, and claimed UFCW 1776, the union behind the unionization drive, “illegally interfered” with the vote.It continued to appeal, taking the case all the way to the top of the paralyzed NLRB, where it’s sat ever since – in limbo. In 2024, the board issued around 150 decisions on labor disputes. Over the past 11 months under Trump, it has issued six.How Trump and corporations have hobbled US labor watchdogRead more“TheTrump administrationthus far seems to have been treating the agency with this kind of combination of hostility and aggressive neglect,” said Lauren McFerran, who served as chair of the NLRB under Joe Biden. “This is an administration that professes to be very pro-worker in its orientation, but we haven’t had a functional agency to resolve labor disputes and to protect workers rights … in a year.”In an interview, the NLRB’s acting general counsel denied the agency has been neglected – and compared its decision to scrap certain policies amid budget constraints with a family, spending carefully. “You can’t always go to Disney World,” said William Cowen.Four current rank-and-file workers spoke to the Guardian. Each requested anonymity, fearing retaliation.“The NLRB’s employees just want to do our jobs and be treated with respect,” said one official. “But from day one, this administration has crippled the agency, and treated us as enemies.”Staff can see “firsthand the damage that is being done”, the staffer continued, claiming they and their colleagues had been left “demoralized and disgusted” by Trump’s agenda.The National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 to federally protect workers’ rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining, now exists “on paper only”, the official claimed.Chart showing the decline of NLRB board-level decisions under the last three administrations, before plummeting to only six under Trump in 2025.“So far I think we are relieved the agency has not been shut down,” added a longtime legal staff employee. “Many employees have left, either through the ‘fork in the road’; retirement; or going to the private sector.”Trumpnominatedtwo board members in July:Scott Mayer,counsel for Boeing, andJames Murphy,a career NLRB attorney. These appointments, if approved by the Senate, would restore quorum to the agency’s board.But a high-stakes ruling in August by an appeals court in the fifth circuit, which covers Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, has increased concern. Weighing into a case that stems from a lawsuitfiledby Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the appeals courtsuggestedthe plaintiffs will likely prevail on their arguments that the NLRB is unconstitutional – and maintained court orders blocking the agency from proceeding with enforcement against the affected companies litigate their constitutional challenges against the agency.The decision “basically halted labor law enforcement”, claimed an NLRB field attorney. “If you are an employer and you don’t want to go to an unfair labor practice trial, if you don’t want a union to be certified at your workplace, you basically have the ability to keep that from happening just by pulling certain procedural levers.”They added: “We put so much work and effort into investigating these cases, and really finding the meritorious ones, and pursuing them vigorously, only to have this outlier rightwing decision, from a court that increasingly is willing to be the rightwing activists in the judiciary.”Until, or unless, the decision is reversed, “there’s nothing we can do”, the attorney said. “I personally have strong, meritorious cases that are just sitting, because they can’t go anywhere.”Another attorney at the NLRB said it has been “difficult to not see anything happen” with cases that have circulated. “While we have been teeing up cases for when there is an eventual quorum, we cannot actively draft anything other than simple orders in cases we think are straightforward.”While major cases gather dust, the number hitting in-trays across the NLRB reached its highest level in over a decade just before Trump’s return to office.Chart showing a two-fold increase in union election filings from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, under the Biden presidency.Themajorityof such unfair labor practice (ULP) cases are settled by agreement, rather than litigation. Only the most contentious cases, including when a decision by a regional NLRB director is challenged, are filed to an administrative judge. If this ruling is appealed, it goes to the board.The agency’s workforce, which had already shrunk considerably, hasdeclinedby around 100 employees under Trump, according to estimates from the staff’s union and the NLRB.Despite employee concerns about capacity, the NLRB’s 2026budget requestsought a reduction by $14m to the previous year. In the agency’s budget request, theyeliminateda strategic goal of the NLRB to “improve public awareness” of its mission and activities.In an interview with the Guardian, William Cowen, acting general counsel of the NLRB, and the agency’s highest-ranking official, disputed claims it has been “crippled” by the lack of a quorum, and cast the rollback of policies designed to strengthen workers’ rights as a matter of priorities.Cowen, a veteran NLRB official promoted by Trump after thefiring of Jennifer Abruzzo, who served under Joe Biden, said: “The loss of the quorum did not have a serious impact on what the agency could do.”Asked what he would say to Whole Foods workers who are still waiting for almost a year on the status of their union, Cowen appeared to walk back his remarks. “I wasn’t saying it was unimportant that the board doesn’t have a quorum, and it is particularly important, especially to those people who have a case that’s waiting for the board’s quorum to decide,” he said. “That is not a good place to be in, because the board has to decide. My only point is that that’s less than 5% of all the cases that come through the front door.”Chart showing the steady decline in number of NLRB employees since the the second admin.He also characterizedrescissionsof several Biden-era policies – including steps to improve compensation for workers found to have had their rights violated, and curtail non-compete agreements – as necessary, given the lack of resources at the agency. Announcing the move in February, Cowen had said: “The unfortunate truth is that if we attempt to accomplish everything, we risk accomplishing nothing.”“In pursuing so many things all simultaneously, we overloaded our system,” he said. “We have a weird historic case intake, and as well as historic staffing lows. It’s so sort of high volume, low capacity. And so the combination of those two things put us into a situation where we had a serious backlog of cases, and it was taking significantly longer than is typical to process cases.”He acknowledged the NLRB could use more staff, but likened the decisions he has made since taking charge of the agency to that of a family. “There is a reality … like any homeowner knows, or family knows … that you have a certain amount of money, and you can therefore do a certain amount of things, and you can’t always go to Disney World. You know with the resources you have.”“Not that any of this is Disney World,” added Cowen. “It’s our challenge, as the managers of this agency, to be able to maintain operations with the resources we have.”As far as Cowen’s concerned, the fifth circuit intervention – and the potential impact – is “far more challenging” than the lack of quorum. “We can’t have hearings in order to set cases up for the board to hear,” he said.While Cowen argued the paralysis of the NLRB’s top court has had no “serious impact” on its ability to function, his direct predecessor is of a different view.Without quorum at the board, Abruzzo warned Congress in June, “the issue is that there’s too many employers out there abusing the processes, and then pushing it to the board by appealing when a union wins an election”.The appeal “then gets stuck”, she noted, “because there’s no quorum”.Even when quorum is restored with Trump appointees, Ellen Dichner, former chief counsel to the NLRB chair, warned the agency is likely to rescinddecisionsissued under Biden , such as a ban on captive audience meetings held by employers to deter unionization.“This is a very, very hostile climate for workers,” said Dichner. “What I think labor is seeing, and will continue to see, is a fundamental attack on workers’ rights, and the rights of workers to organize, and the ability of workers to achieve collective bargaining agreements.”Some states have tried to fill in the void as the NLRB enforcement dwindles under Trump. New York and California passed laws this year – challenged by the NLRB – to grant state labor agencies authority to oversee private sector union elections and ULP charges.“The current president is attempting to take a wrecking ball to public and private sector employees’ fundamental right to join a union and collectively bargain for fair wages, benefits and safe working conditions,” said California assemblymember Tina McKinnor. “California will not sit idly as its workers are systematically denied the right to organize due to employer intransigence or federal inaction.”As Trump officials continue to bulldoze established norms, the supreme court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the NLRB; the firing of Wilcox; and acaseinvolving Trump’s firing of former Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter that will determine the independence of federal agencies like the NLRB.“The potential loss of independence at the agency is a huge pivot point for its operations,” said McFerran, the former NLRB chair, who expects the supreme court to “scale back or eviscerate” the NLRB’s independence. “If the agency does start operating in a fundamentally more politicized way, I think people will have to find other ways to get their labor disputes resolved, because they’ll lose trust in the board altogether.”The White House did not respond to requests for comment.With the future of the US labor movement in the balance, workers like those in Philadelphia are waiting.“Whole Foods has more than enough money and profit to be able to share that wealth with the workers,” said Dupree. “A union is the main way for us to get more of the profit of our labor.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsTrump administrationAmazonStarbucksDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slashmore than 2,000 jobsas part of corporate restructuring.Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.But when Sherman left the conference room and entered the newsroom, he said he learned that his white colleagues had been told a very different story. A white co-worker told Sherman that she found it “messed up” that the people of color on the team had been laid off. Of the nine producers who staffed CBS Evening News Plus, five white people were reassigned to other positions, while the four people of color on the team were let go, according to Sherman and another former staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Later that day, Sherman documented his experience in a viralTikTok video. CBS did not respond to the Guardian’s multiple requests for comment.Sherman’s role may be the latest casualty in a nationwidecrackdown on diversity. Several high-ranking Black officials have beenfiredfrom the Trump administration, and thousands of jobs related todiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)have been cut in the private and public sectors. The Guardian talked to seven recently laid off journalists at CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue who spoke of people of color on their teams being let go while their white colleagues were spared, or the chipping away at coverage focused on marginalized communities.Newsrooms have long beenless diversethan the US population, which makes these layoffs in particular especially pronounced. In 1978, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, an organization for media leaders,vowedthat the racial makeup of newsrooms would reflect the US population by 2000. As the deadline neared in 1998, the societymovedthe date to 2025, but newsrooms still haven’t met that goal. According to a 2022 Pew Research Centersurveyof nearly 12,000 journalists, 76% of respondents were white, 8% were Latino/Hispanic, 6% were Black and 3% were Asian. The survey showed an overrepresentation of white journalists, since nearly 58% of the population was white, about 19% were Hispanic, 12% were Black and 6% were Asian in the2020 US census.Some journalists see the layoffs as capitulation to the Trump administration’s war on DEI. After Trump’s January executive orders calling for anend to DEI programsand thetermination of affirmative actionin the federal government, Sherman said that “one by one, we saw companies get rid of their DEI initiatives”.CBS and NBC are subjected to regulatory scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which oversees radio, television, cable, satellite and wire communications. During his first week in office, Brendan Carr, the FCC chair,announcedthat the FCC would end its DEI efforts by, among other things, removing it as a priority from the agency’s budget, and quashing its advisory group and taskforce.Part of their agenda is to, let’s be real, not just get rid of DEI initiatives but diversity in and of itselfTrey ShermanSeveral weeks later, Carr launched aninvestigationinto Comcast and NBC Universal’s diversity initiatives, followed by a similarinquiryinto Disney and ABC. Disney told employees in a Februarymemothat it would stop Reimagine Tomorrow, a platform that amplified underrepresented voices, and the corporation’s2025 annual reporteschewed the word “diversity” for the first time in six years.In July filings to theFCCbefore the merger, Skydance promised that it would eliminate Paramount’s DEI initiatives and workforce diversity targets. And in October, Bari Weiss, an opinion journalist who advocated to “end DEI for good”, was appointed the editor in chief of CBS News. Some CBS News employees have been onedgesince Weiss’s appointment.Then in early November, sources allege that most Teen Vogue employees – many of whom were women of color – were let go as publisher Condé Nastannouncedthat the outlet focused on politics, fashion and news would join Vogue’s website. A Condé Nast spokesperson said it was inaccurate that most of the staff had been let go. Those reductions came several weeks after NBC News laid off150 employees, and gutted teams on verticals that exclusively covered Black, Asian American, Latino, and LGBTQ+ communities. The equity-focused sections will continue toexist, though without a dedicated staff, drawing from content around the newsroom.Some institutions within the journalism industry have also steered away from DEI in their company language since Trump entered office. In April,Gannettremoved demographic data and mentions about diversity from its website, citing Trump’s executive order calling for an end to DEI.The Trump administration “has used its power to exert more control over the media than maybe we’ve ever seen”, Sherman said. “It so happens that part of their agenda is to, let’s be real, not just get rid of DEI initiatives, but to get rid of diversity in and of itself.”In a political climate that’s hostile to diversity, people of color must start their own media outlets and podcasts, said political commentator and National Association of Black Journalists board member Roland Martin: “These companies are going to learn a hard lesson: if you continue to remove Black, Latino, Muslim and Asian American voices, those consumers are going to go elsewhere.”‘It’s not a coincidence’After speaking to his white colleagues, Sherman went to Reiter’s office to confront him about the layoff discrepancies. Sherman said that Reiter told him that he chose to keep people he had previously worked with. After Sherman posted his video recapping the conversation with Reiter on TikTok, he said he received messages from former employees at other media outlets who had similar stories. Mary, a woman of color who is using a pseudonym out of fear of jeopardizing future job prospects, said that she was shocked when she watched Sherman’s video.She was laid off from anotherCBSteam on the same day as Sherman, and soon realized that out of the dozens of people on her diverse team, the only four who were laid off were people of color. “We certainly have white producers, we have white reporters who could have been laid off as well,” Mary said. They had to have “known that would not look good”.In amemoto employees, the new Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison wrote that the cuts were necessary for the company’s longevity. “In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organization,” he wrote. “In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth.”Mary and Sherman, though, say it’s clear that CBS’s methodology for who they chose to lay off reflects the Trump administration’s assault on diversity. “I’m not accusing any one person of looking at my department and deciding to lay off all the people of color,” Sherman said, “but I am saying that it’s not a coincidence that the layoffs that they chose to do fell along racial lines.”While Sherman would not comment on whether he was pursuing legal action, Mary said that she and several former CBS employees have expressed interest in filing a lawsuit: “This is very suspicious.”In mid-October, the entire teams behind NBC BLK, NBC Asian America, NBC Latino, and NBC Out were laid off, but content from around the newsroom will continue to populate the verticals. Curtis Bunn, the only reporter at NBC BLK, a vertical that focuses on Black communities, was one of the people who was let go. Over the past two years, he said, he watched the team dwindle from four people to two until the final purge. The layoffs also come as most of Comcast’s NBCUniversal cable networksspin offinto a new company called Versant Media Group, causing NBC News to streamline its operations. (Fortypeoplewere also let go from NBC in January. An NBC union representative said it does not have a demographic breakdown of the layoffs.)Bunn said that he trusts the company’s reasoning, but he is curious about why the teams that covered marginalized communities were eliminated. “When you see what’s happening around you, and you see the nature of even the media companies capitulating to the administration,” Bunn said, “you can’t help but feel like that has some part or some role in what took place.” He said that he was told that he could apply for other roles at the company.“The journalists behind NBC BLK, NBC Latino, NBC Asian America and NBC OUT have chronicled our communities with depth, nuance and humanity,” NABJ president and co-founder of the 19th, Errin Haines, said in astatement. “If anything, their work has strengthened our democracy and expanded our nation’s understanding of itself.” NBC did not respond to repeated requests for comment.We need Black-owned and -run establishments that are going to stay that wayAniyah FreemanTraci Lee, a journalist who wasNBCAsian America’s digital editorial manager from 2015 to 2019, said that the vertical helped elevate Asian American and Pacific Islanders’ experiences to a national sphere. “So often we have other people telling our stories for us, whether it is being glossed over in history books, or perhaps just being excluded from the narrative,” Lee said. “This was a space where we could, on a national level, tell our own stories.” When NBC Asian America wrote stories about the concentration camps that held Japanese Americans during the second world war, readers reached out to say that they had never been taught about the topic in school.Leaders from affinity groups including the Asian American Journalists Association, NABJ and NLGJA: the Association of LGBTQ+ Journalistsmetwith NBC’s executives about the layoffs in late October, during which NBC promised to continue covering their communities.It was soon after this thatfivewomen of color from Teen Vogue were let go. Condé Nast, Teen Vogue’s parent company, would not confirm the number of laid-off staff or their demographics.Skyli Alvarez, an Asian queer woman on Teen Vogue’s editorial team who was laid off, said that she was in a state of shock when she realized that most of the laid-off employees were people of color. “In the media landscape today, a lot of people of color, a lot of people of marginalized identities, tend to be in these entry-level, associate-level positions,” Alvarez said. “And so to me, I was like: ‘This speaks to a bigger issue beyond all of us.’”TheCondé Nastspokesperson said that the restructure is designed to help the company grow, since Teen Vogue has long faced difficulties in reaching audiences. “Rather than continuing to operate independently, bringing Teen Vogue under the Vogue umbrella allows it to tap into a larger audience, stronger distribution and more resources,” the spokesperson said. “Any organizational changes the company makes are purely driven by business strategy to grow consumer engagement with our titles.”“Teen Vogue was one of the last really outspoken publications on problems that affect young people, that young people care about,” Alvarez said. She hopes that communities of color and LGBTQ+ people will continue ensuring that their perspectives are heard nationwide despite the publication’s absorption.In light of the mass layoffs, some Black creatives have begun gathering online to form a collective in their vision. In early November, Aniyah Freeman, a digital marketer based in New York, put a callout onLinkedInto start a media company with recently laid-off Black journalists. So far, she said, about 200 people have joined a group chat; a core group of 15 recently laid-off Black media professionals from various companies including ABC, Rolling Stone and Condé Nast have met on Zoom several times.For now, their media company is called Black Media Caucus, and they are working on business plans for a magazine focused on politics, fashion and culture. “It’s going to be giving us perspectives that they’re trying to take away from us,” Freeman said. “We need Black-owned-and-run establishments that are going to stay that way. This current political climate is an inspiration for all of us.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And not going to lie it’s hurts. But all we can do now is trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,” Mahomes wrote on X. “Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”The Chiefs said in a statement that “Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.”Justin Herbert, playing through a broken left hand, threw for 210 yards and a touchdown, and the Chargers (10-4) ensured consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time since 2006-07 by completing a rare regular-season sweep of Kansas City. It is the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs have missed the playoffs. During that span, they have won three Super Bowls and reached the AFC Championship Game seven times.Mahomes was trying to rally the Chiefs in the closing seconds, completing a series of passes to get across midfield by the two-minute warning. But on the next play, he was scrambling toward the Kansas City sideline and throwing the ball away when he was spun to the ground by defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand, leaving the two-time MVP clutching his left knee. Mahomes was taken briefly to the blue injury tent, then helped to the locker room with a towel draped over his head.The once formidable Kansas City Chiefs look old, tired and out of ideasRead moreMinshew took over and completed three straight passes, giving Chiefs fans hope on a day that began with wind chills near zero and their playoff chances about the same. But with 20 seconds to go, Minshew unloaded a pass intended for Travis Kelce, and James – his longtime divisional foil – leaped up to pick it off, allowing Los Angeles to escape.“It’s very frustrating, man. It’s been hard to watch for Pat, a dude that puts so much into it,” Minshew said. “I’ve never seen someone give so much of themselves to the team. I have confidence in him and his ability to come back better than ever.”Mahomes was held to 189 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Kansas City (6-8) managed just 239 yards as a team. The Chargers beat the Chiefs in their opener in September in Brazil, setting each of the clubs on their season-long trajectory.Indianapolis Colts 16–18 Seattle SeahawksJason Myers kicked a franchise-record six field goals, including a 56-yarder with 29 seconds left, and the Seattle Seahawks outlasted 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts (8-6). Rivers threw a touchdown pass after coming out of retirement to make his first start in nearly five years, and he led the Colts into position for Blake Grupe’s go-ahead, 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds left. That was enough time for Sam Darnold and the Seahawks (11-3). Rashid Shaheed returned Grupe’s kickoff 28 yards to the Seattle 37, and Darnold connected with Shaheed twice for 25 yards to set up Myers.Buffalo Bills 35–31 New England PatriotsJosh Allen threw three touchdown passes, and James Cook ran for two TDs and caught another as the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-0 deficit to beat New England, preventing the Patriots from clinching the AFC East title.Allen finished 19 of 28 for 193 yards. Cook ran 22 times for 107 yards for the Bills (10-4), who avoided being swept by a division opponent for the first time since 2019. Buffalo reached 10 wins for the seventh consecutive season. The Bills overcame a double-digit deficit for the third time this year after previously rallying against Baltimore (down 15 points in the fourth quarter) and Cincinnati (down 10).The Patriots (11-3) lost their first division game of the season and their 10-game win streak ended. They haven’t won the AFC East since 2019 but still lead the Bills by one game with three games left. Drake Maye had a pair of touchdown runs, and TreVeyon Henderson ran for scores of 52 and 65 yards. Henderson finished with 14 carries for 148 yards.Trailing 35-31 with 2:43 to play, the Patriots had fourth-and-five on their own 22. Maye was flushed out of the pocket and had a pass batted down by Joey Bosa. The Bills ran out the clock from there.Detroit Lions 34–41 Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford passed for 368 yards and hit Colby Parkinson for two touchdowns, and the NFC-leading Los Angeles Rams (11-3) clinched a playoff berth with a furious second-half rally. Kyren Williams rushed for two scores and Blake Corum added another TD for the Rams, who came back from a double-digit deficit shortly before halftime with 20 consecutive points before securing their eighth victory in nine games. Amon-Ra St Brown scorched his hometown team for 163 yards and two touchdowns on 13 receptions for the Lions (8-6). Detroit have alternated wins and losses since Week 5.Green Bay Packers 26–34 Denver BroncosBo Nix tied a career-high with four touchdown passes, Courtland Sutton had seven receptions for 113 yards and a TD catch and the Denver Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers. Nix finished 23-for-34 for 302 yards passing for Denver (12-2), who have won 11 straight, holds the top seed in the AFC and clinched a playoff spot with the victory Troy Franklin, Lil’Jordan Humphrey and Michael Bandy each caught touchdown passes, while RJ Harvey scored another on the ground for the Broncos. Jordan Love completed 24 of 40 passes for 259 yards and threw a touchdown to Josh Jacobs, who also scored on the ground for Green Bay (9-4-1). Love was intercepted twice, with the second interception coming after Harvey put Denver ahead by eight. It was a costly game for the Packers, who lost wide receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury and defensive end Micah Parsons to a left knee injury. Both happened in the third quarter.Washington Commanders 29-21 New York GiantsJacory Croskey-Merritt ran for a touchdown, fellow rookie Jaylin Lane returned a punt 63 yards to the end zone and the Washington Commanders (4-10) ended their season-derailing skid at eight games by beating the similarly woeful New York Giants (2-12). The onlyNFLgame this week with no playoff implications has a far bigger bearing on draft positioning. The Giants lost their eighth in a row, moving a step closer to the top pick, a last-place finish in the NFC East and potential front-office changes, with a coaching search already coming.Arizona Cardinals 20–40 Houston TexansCJ Stroud threw for 260 yards and three touchdowns and the Houston Texans jumped out to a big early lead and cruised to victory over the slumping Arizona Cardinals. The Texans (9-5) have won six straight games for the first time since a nine-game winning streak in 2018 to improve their playoff hopes. It’s the sixth straight loss for the Cardinals (3-11), whose last win came on 3 November against the Cowboys. Houston got going immediately with their fastest score of the season when Stroud connected with Nico Collins on a 57-yard touchdown on the second play of the game. Collins took the short throw, escaped two diving defenders at around the 40 and ran untouched into the end zone for the score.New York Jets 20–48 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence accounted for six touchdowns, including a career-high five passing, and the Jacksonville Jaguars overwhelmed the New York Jets from start to finish. Lawrence’s passer rating of 136.7 was the best of his five-year NFL career. Jacksonville improved to 10-4 and scored touchdowns on their first three possessions for the first time since 1998. The Jaguars topped 40 points through three quarters for the first time since 2005. The Jets (3-11) allowed their most points since a 54-13 loss to New England in 2021.Baltimore Ravens 24–0 Cincinnati BengalsThe Baltimore Ravens have handed Joe Burrow the first shutout of his six-year career. Lamar Jackson threw for two touchdowns, and Kyle Van Noy and Alohi Gilman teamed up for a 95-yard pick-six as the Ravens (7-7) blanked the Cincinnati Bengals (4-10). Derrick Henry rushed for 100 yards on 11 carries for the Ravens. Baltimore won their fourth straight road game and pulled within a half-game of Pittsburgh in the AFC North. The Steelers host Miami on Monday night. Cincinnati were eliminated from playoff contention. Burrow was picked off twice as he completed 25 of 39 passes for 225 yards.Tennessee Titans 24–37 San Francisco 49ersBrock Purdy threw three touchdown passes as the San Francisco 49ers beat the Tennessee Titans. The 49ers are 10-4 and looked sharp after their bye week, scoring on their first five possessions. Purdy connected twice with Jauan Jennings and once with George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey added a rushing touchdown. Rookie Cam Ward threw two touchdown passes for the Titans, who fell to 2-12. Tennessee defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons had a strip sack and a touchdown catch. Tennessee struggled with missed opportunities and injuries, failing to build on last week’s win over Cleveland.Carolina Panthers 17–20 New Orleans SaintsTyler Shough passed for 272 yards and a touchdown and helped set up Charlie Smyth’s go-ahead field goal, and the host New Orleans Saints defeated the Carolina Panthers. Shough and the Saints drove 62 yards in 51 seconds before giving way to Smyth for a 47-yard field goal, which split the uprights with two seconds left.The Saints (4-10) swept the Panthers (7-7), having won 17-7 on 9 November in Charlotte. Bryce Young threw for 163 yards and rushed for 49 to lead the Panthers, who fell into a tie with Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South. Carolina and the Buccaneers face each other twice in the final three weeks, beginning with a game in Charlotte next Sunday.Cleveland Browns 3–31 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams threw two touchdown passes and the Chicago Bears (10-4) beat Cleveland (3-11) in one of the coldest games ever at Soldier Field even though the Browns’ Myles Garrett moved within a sack of the NFL’s single-season record. The Bears heated up early on a day when the gametime temperature was 8F (-13C), scoring two first-quarter touchdowns and breaking the game open with two more in the third. Garrett had 1.5 sacks, giving him 21.5 on the season and leaving him one shy of the record shared by Michael Strahan and TJ Watt.Las Vegas Raiders 0–31 Philadelphia EaglesJalen Hurts bounced back from his worst NFL game by throwing three touchdown passes and Saquon Barkley added a two-yard touchdown run as the Philadelphia Eagles snapped a three-game losing streak. The Eagles are 9-5 and finally showed signs of life under offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. Hurts threw a 27-yard touchdown to AJ Brown early in the fourth quarter. The Raiders are 2-12 and lost their eighth straight game. Kenny Pickett struggled in his first start at quarterback for the injured Geno Smith.Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsUS sportsPatrick MahomesnewsShareReuse this content"

It means they have won all five matches since enduring successive defeats against Newcastle and Bayer Leverkusen at the end of November and are back to within two points of Arsenal.Phil Foden’s rocky road is proof that a prodigy’s promise is no guarantee of glory | Jonathan WilsonRead moreGuardiola believes that his team have shown real signs of improvement over the past few weeks and he pointed to previous sides that had to learn to win the hard way.“From experience when you win in the past you believe the past is always perfect – brilliant, red carpets,” he said. “When we won 100 points and all the titles we had a lot of games like today and the resilience was part of that. Every plan from every manager wants to do the best but there are moments where you struggle.“Madrid was not a perfect game but it is a step that we were there and we fought, whatever happens we fought unbelievably to achieve that. That builds something for that and after we will see. We are in a better position than last season, we are close and this is what we are here to do.”City came under huge pressure against Palace in the first half but took the lead through Haaland’s header before Foden doubled their advantage. A late Halaand penalty – his 17th Premier League goal of the season – continued Guardiola’s record of never having lost at Selhurst Park, but the City manager paid tribute to the performance of his defence and in particular Rúben Dias.“They played together a lot lately for obvious reasons and when you are playing together the connection between the back four is so important,” he said. “The pace and composure for both full-backs, the leadership from Rúben. Rúben is an incredible leader, his professionalism, the day before, the day after, how he leads his teammates vocally. He’s an incredible signing for many years to come, he’s a real leader.”Oliver Glasner said his side must learn to be more ruthless against the top teams. “The result doesn’t reflect the performance,” the Palace manager said. “We have to accept it.

Spurs registered a single shot on target at the City Ground, where Callum Hudson-Odoi scored twice and Ibrahim Sangaré sealed victory with a stunning first-time strike.Hudson-Odoi double sinks limp Spurs to help move Forest away from relegationRead moreFrank cut a calm figure but insisted a “hurricane” was swirling inside of him. Asked whether he felt confident he would be afforded time to revive their form, the Dane said: “I can’t see why not. I think it’s pretty evident that if no one gets the time, no one can turn this around. This is not a quick fix. Today was a very bad performance. No two ways about that, but also know that to change this, this will take some time. No one will want to hear about that, it’s just reality.”Guglielmo Vicario appeared to be at fault for both of Hudson-Odoi’s goals but Frank defended his goalkeeper’s role in the first, with the Italian playing a short pass to Archie Gray, under pressure from Sangaré, who pinched possession before teeing up Hudson-Odoi. Vicario was badly exposed for Hudson-Odoi’s second, a cross-shot from the left flank.Asked if he had an issue with Vicario’s role in Forest’s first goal, Frank said: “No … I think you see that every week in the Premier League and from every team all over the world. So there’s no problem with that. Mistakes like that happen. When things are going against us we need to keep doing the right thing and keep our cool heads.”Frank added he would investigate his defender Djed Spence’s petulant reaction to being withdrawn during the second half as part of a triple substitution. The Spurs full-back, who won promotion to the Premier League with Forest while on loan from Middlesbrough in the 2021-22 season, spread his arms in disbelief as he left the field and then threw a warm-up jacket into the dugout.Last month Spence apologised to Frank for ignoring him after ahome defeat by Chelsea. Of Sunday’s incident, Frank said: “I didn’t see it. I think there can be three reasons: he can be disappointed with his own performance, disappointed with the team’s performance or disappointed to be subbed off. I will ask him.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurNottingham ForestThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

The Egyptian was reinstated to the squad after being dropped for the Champions League trip to Inter in response to his outburst after the 3-3 draw at Leeds last weekend.Salah was recalled by Arne Slot for Saturday’s win over Brighton, coming off the bench in the 26th minute for the injured Joe Gomez, as the coach shuffled his team. The forward marked his return to action by taking the corner from which Hugo Ekitiké scored his second goal but will now depart to represent Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations, and could be away for more than a month. His absence will allow time to resolve his long-term future.‘No issues to resolve’: Slot claims Salah matter over but talks expected during AfconRead more“First of all it’s not about me, it’s about the rest of the team,” Van Dijk said when asked if it was a test of his captaincy. “I speak to Mo, I speak to almost all the players, I hear and observe and that is the most important thing. If you feel that it could be a problem within the squad and it affects performances you have a different story but I think we showed this week we are absolutely united and we go forward as one.“Mo goes to the Africa Cup of Nations. We hope he will be successful there and all hope he comes back and that is important for us for the rest of the season. But on the other side of it, we all know football and have no idea what will happen. I hope he stays as he is one of my leaders, a very important player which you saw with another assist. He is still important for the football club but there are more parties to this situation.”Since Salah’s comments about being “thrown under the bus” and saying he has no relationship with Slot,Liverpoolhave won twice. Salah spoke to his head coach on Friday to clear the air and was subsequently reintegrated into matchday plans.Van Dijk said of the affect of the week on the squad: “That is something behind the scenes that we have to deal with but the performances speak for themselves, that we are united and that is the most important thing.“The mood in the dressing room has always been very good, obviously it can go down in terms of performances if you win or lose but the main thing I see is that we have the willingness to turn this around and the hunger and the energy to do so. Obviously it is what happens between the white lines over 95 minutes. We know the season is very long and we want to be consistent. We have to keep going and stay calm.”Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

He beat Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia (1,435 points), Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love (719 points) and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin (432 points).Sherrone Moore charged with home invasion, stalking after dismissal as Michigan football coachRead moreMendoza’s Heisman win was emphatic. He finished first in all six Heisman regions, the first to do so since Caleb Williams in 2022. He was named on 95.16% of all ballots, tying him with Marcus Mariota in 2014 for the second highest in the award’s history and he received 84.6% of total possible points, which is the seventh highest in Heisman history.“I haven’t seen the numbers yet,” said Mendoza, “but it’s such an honor to be mentioned with these guys [Pavia, Love and Sayin]. It’s really a credit to our team. It’s a team award.”Mendoza guided the Hoosiers to their first No 1 ranking and the top seed in the 12-team College Football bracket, throwing for 2,980 yards and a national-best 33 touchdown passes while also running for six scores. Indiana, the last unbeaten team in major college football, will play a College Football Playoff quarter-final game in the Rose Bowl on 1 January.Mendoza, the Hoosiers’ first-year starter after transferring from California, is the triggerman for an offense that surpassed program records for touchdowns and points set during last season’s surprise run to the CFP.View image in fullscreenFernando Mendoza of the Indiana Hoosiers celebrates a touchdown against the Ohio State Buckeyes during the third quarter of last week’s Big Ten championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesA redshirt junior, the once lightly recruited Miami native is the second Heisman finalist in school history, joining 1989 runner-up Anthony Thompson. Mendoza is the seventh Indiana player to earn a top-10 finish in Heisman balloting and it marks another first in program history – having back-to-back players in the top 10. Hoosiers quarterback Kurtis Rourke was ninth last year.With his teammates chanting “HeismanDoza” as he addressed the media, he said there felt like a realistic chance of winning the Heisman when the Hoosiers routed then No 19 Illinois 63-10 on 20 September.“At that point my boys [team-mates] said we might make it to New York [for the award ceremony],” he said. “It was lighthearted at the time, but that’s when it started. “Quarterbacks have won the Heisman four of the last five years, withtwo-way player Travis Hunter of Colorado ending the runlast season.Mendoza is the 43rd quarterback to win the Heisman and the second winner of Latin American descent to claim the trophy. Stanford’s Jim Plunkett was the first in 1970.“Although I grew up in America, my four grandparents are all from Cuba,” he said. “I had the opportunity to go there and that was important to me. I credit the love to my grandparents and the Hispanic community.”The Heisman Trophy presentation came after a number of accolades were already awarded. Mendoza was named the Associated Press player of the year earlier this week and picked up the Maxwell and Davey O’Brien awards Friday night while Love won the Doak Walker Award.Mendoza and Pavia clearly exemplify the changing landscape of using the transfer portal in college football. Mendoza is the seventh transfer to win the award in the last nine years. Vanderbilt is Pavia’s third school.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballIndianaCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

When will Unai Emery accept that talk of a title challenge is far from fanciful?Villa’s standards dropped and their legs looked heavy but their hunger knows no bounds at the moment. They were stretched by West Ham, who led twice before squandering a vital win in their battle against relegation, and still Emery’s indefatigable side dug deep for a response before emerging victorious for the 15th time in 17 games thanks to a virtuoso display from Morgan Rogers inspiring a second-half turnaround.Brentford v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead moreThis was Villa in fighting mode. They fell behind to the fastest goal in thePremier Leaguethis season, trailed 2-1 at half-time and were second best for long spells, but they refused to roll over. West Ham, still stuck in the bottom three despite producing one of their best performances under Nuno Espírito Santo, just could not put them away. They were pegged back by Rogers early in the second half and then, just when it seemed that West Ham were gearing up for a late push, the England international made Nuno’s side rue granting him the space to make it 3-2 with a goal that owed everything to the Villa attacker’s wondrous technique and appetite for risk.It was a rocket from Rogers, the ball ripping off his gifted right foot and flying into Alphonse Areola’s top-right corner. It was not quite as dramatic as last week’s last-gasp win over Arsenal – the decisive goal arrived with 11 minutes left this time – but the impact felt no less significant. This was Villa’s sixth consecutive league win and it pleased Emery that it came with key players missing at the back. “Fantastic,” was the manager’s verdict on Victor Lindelöf, who deputised for Pau Torres in central defence and dealt with West Ham’s pressure before providing the pass for Rogers to fire Villa three points off Arsenal at the top of the table.Hands up if you had Villa sitting in third place as Christmas approached when they went six games without winning at the start of the season? It has been a remarkable turnaround, although Emery has tried to keep expectations realistic. This was another test of his side’s staying power. Emery made six changes after last Thursday’svictory over FC Baselin the Europa League but he acknowledged that it was not easy for Villa to hit their physical targets after a fast start from West Ham.View image in fullscreenWest Ham’s Jarrod Bowen pounces to steer the ball past Marco Bizot.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThere was a fine atmosphere at kick-off. The London Stadium had risen to pay tribute to the late Billy Bonds and the positivity grew when an error from Ezri Konsa presented Mateus Fernandes with the chance to whip West Ham in front after only 29 seconds.Both defences were uncertain during a breezy first half. Villa quickly levelled when Ollie Watkins pressured Konstantinos Mavropanos into heading John McGinn’s cross into his own net but they were indecisive when West Ham scored again. El Hadji Malick Diouf’s cross from a lovely Lucas Paquetá pass was only half cleared, Freddie Potts replied with a hopeful shot and Jarrod Bowen was onside when he diverted the ball past Marco Bizot, deputising in goal for the injured Emi Martínez.Erling Haaland and Phil Foden fire Manchester City to win at Crystal PalaceRead moreEmery presumably had a few choices for his players at half-time. “I am so happy with how they responded,” the Spaniard said. “Twice we were behind but how they kept the commitment is how we are as a team – being ambitious, being responsible, the commitment tactically.”It helped that West Ham have not kept a clean sheet since 31 August. Nuno has not fixed their defensive ills since replacing Graham Potter and he bemoaned his side’s failure to hold on to a winning position for the second consecutive week. “This is something we are not able to do – control and manage the game when we are in front,” West Ham’s manager said. Why is it happening? “I wish I could give you a proper answer with a proper solution,” Nuno replied.The frustration for West Ham is that they did a lot well, with Soungoutou Magassa, Fernandes and Potts competing in midfield. Yet Nuno despaired when Villa pounced after Paquetá lost possession in the 50th minute. Youri Tielemans was away down the right seconds later and his cross reached Rogers, who controlled before scoring from close range.West Ham at least kept going. Bowen had a goal disallowed for the tightest of offsides but Villa found the breakthrough when Magassa pushed too high and lost Rogers, whose finish made it even harder for Emery to downplay his side’s title credentials.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A bad afternoon for Newcastle’s German striker got significantly worse shortly after half-time when he cut an even more isolated, peripheral and forlorn figure in his own team’s box after inadvertently heading a Nordi Mukiele cross past Aaron Ramsdale from six yards out.Woltemade’s embarrassing own goal proved to be the unwitting match-winner in a contest that had until that point been high on full-blooded aggression but low on moments of real quality. As he made way for Yoane Wissa, it was no surprise theSunderlandfans granted the visibly deflated 23-year-old a sarcastic ovation. A fan favourite on Tyneside until the 46th minute of this match, Woltemade has now pulled off the unlikely feat of winning a permanent, bitterly ironic place in mackem hearts.Woltemade’s bizarre own goal hands Sunderland derby spoils over NewcastleRead moreIt may have been the biggest show in town but the first Premier League derby between these sides in almost a decade wasn’t the only local drama scheduled for Sunday afternoon. Less than a mile from the Stadium of Light, the matinee performance of Sleeping Beauty, the Christmas panto, was kicking off at the Empire Theatre. The cursed Princess Aurora will have done exceptionally well to have dozed through the febrile, visceral cacophony that rumbled across town from all four sides of the nearby cauldron of conflict when the players took to the pitch under a tifo boasting a ferocious black cat with fangs slavering and claws bared.Newcastle cowered accordingly and their extreme caution was all too apparent in an opening 45 minutes during which both sides huffed and puffed to no great effect but the hosts at least tried to attack, albeit through a series of hideously overhit crosses. Marooned up front due in no small part to a Newcastle approach that had Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga perform more as auxiliary full‑backs than wingers, Woltemade was given an early inkling this might not be his day when the increasingly ineffectual Gordon subjected him to a very severe and public dressing-down for the heinous crime of misplacing a pass. Having contributed little or nothing, both Newcastle wide men would be withdrawn on the hour mark.View image in fullscreenSunderland fans unveil a tifo before kick-off.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockLike most high-profile local rivalries, the mutual contempt between fans of Sunderland andNewcastle Unitedpurports to be an animus without equal. Yet, if familiarity breeds contempt, absence certainly hadn’t made contrasting hearts grow fonder and at times during a stop-start first half the pitch resembled the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan. Bodies slumped on, or fell to the deck theatrically and Dan Burn was forced off with damaged ribs to unsympathetic jeers. Despite showing early leniency, Peter Bankes showed his yellow card nine times during a game that simmered without ever threatening to boil over.An auspicious occasion for Sunderland after an eight-season absence from the Premier League, it was tempered by the upsetting news that the club legend Gary Rowell had died. Word of the 1979 derby-day hat-trick hero’s death after a long illness had spread through the city centre the previous evening and in at least one bar hosting Christmas revellers, a previously festive atmosphere immediately turned maudlin. It was like somebody had flicked a switch and before kick-off, a warm and lengthy tribute was paid to the former striker with a standing ovation.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In terms of style and personnel, today’s iteration of Sunderland bears little resemblance to the Championship side that was contemptuously swatted asidein an FA Cup tieby Newcastle at the Stadium of Light in January 2024. Arguably a blessing in disguise, that grim day in Sunderland’s recent history would ultimately lead to the recruitment of Régis Le Bris as head coach and a well-funded summer revival few fans could have imagined during the club’s fly-on-the-wall Netflix documentary banter years. Immense on Sunday, the experienced Granit Xhaka is the poster boy for a shrewd summer transfer window splurge that heralded 14 new arrivals, while the 20-year-old Noah Sadiki, a Belgium-born Democratic Republic of the Congo international, has proved one of last summer’s best signings for any Premier League side.In recent years, Newcastle have enjoyed their own trajectory of ascent under their preposterously wealthy Saudi Arabian owners, and Champions League nights and silverware may have helped engender the hope, if not belief, that their own days of humiliation were finally over. They have struggled away from home in this campaign and as defeats go, this was as harrowing and chastening as they get. They have now failed to beat Sunderland in 10 consecutive league games and this reverse was their fourth on the spin at the Stadium of Light, increasingly a fortress where the mood could scarcely be more upbeat.Explore more on these topicsSunderlandNewcastle UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

For Brentford’s Michael Kayode, read Leeds’s Ethan Ampadu, both taking an age before hurling the ball into a mass of bodies, before the ball was bundled away. How long can this tactic stay in vogue, now that everyPremier Leagueside is so well prepared?Scoring a goal from open play remains a valid tactic and from such a situation Rico Henry set up Jordan Henderson to score his first goal in English football since 2021, via a deflection off the Leeds defender Jaka Bijol. In turn, Leeds found their deserved equaliser from open play, Dominic Calvert-Lewin heading home Wilfried Gnonto’s cross. Henry and Gnonto, both substitutes, had added dabs of quality to a previously constipated contest.Brentford v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead more“An old-school game, quite direct,” Keith Andrews said, theBrentfordmanager embracing understatement.“Great resilience to come back,” said the Leeds manager, Daniel Farke, who was satisfied enough. “Great performance and could have been better with the outcome.”Two teams glancing over their shoulders now look to festive fixtures. Having appeared comfortable in avoiding any semblance of a relegation battle, Brentford’s recent form – one win in five – now endangers them.The gap to Leeds at kick-off was just four points, where it remained. In mid-November, Farke’s chances of making Christmas were akin to that of a prime, plumpened turkey only for his team to deliver high‑amped performances and four points from a daunting triple‑header.Had such endeavours drained Leeds? They fell below the standards of the games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool but stayed solid and competitive. Rescuing a draw at home against Liverpool had required launching the kitchen sink at their opponents but Farke’s team are playing circumspect football in edging towards safety, going against their manager’s attacking instincts until needs must. “A difficult system to break down,” Andrews said of his opposite number’s approach. “We weren’t patient enough.”View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson celebrates his first goal in English football since 2021 with a tribute to Diogo Jota.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersAmid forgettable early stages the clearest glimpse of an opening was Calvert-Lewin escaping the Brentford offside trap, only to find no support. That the ball was pronounced flat served as a suitable metaphor for sub‑zero entertainment levels.Personal duels were stalemated. Low blocks ruled supreme. The midfield was packed like a sardine tin. The best chance of the first half came via a mistake, Vitaly Janelt inadvertently providing a through ball for Noah Okafor before Caoimhín Kelleher refused to be beaten from a tight angle.Controversy at least added an element of intrigue. Some Stockley Park dithering united both sets of fans in loud solidarity against video assistance. A Brentford penalty was first awarded and then chalked off. Dango Ouattara, challenged by Gabriel Gudmundsson, was ruled offside. It would have been a soft penalty award – “a gift”, Farke said – for the team who have been awarded the most penalties in the Premier League this season. A wretched first half drew to its merciful end. Let us never speak of it again, though things could only get better.Leeds began the second half with momentum, attacking towards their always vocal away support. Brentford remained comfortable with retreating into their shell and that made for a mass of bodies in the penalty area, as a couple of pinball sessions were played out.On the hour, Andrews introduced Mikkel Damsgaard’s craft in an attempt to serve the isolated Igor Thiago, Henry accompanying the Dane from the bench to play his key role in the goal. “Jordan’s experience, knowledge of the game, is second to none,” Andrews said. “He has been an impactful player for us.”Woltemade’s bizarre own goal hands Sunderland derby spoils over NewcastleRead moreHenderson, remembering his late friend Diogo Jota, said: “I don’t score many goals – I thought I would dedicate it to him,” after using the Portuguese’s celebration.That left Leeds had 20 minutes to find an equaliser. Gnonto and Brenden Aaronson arrived as attacking reinforcements, the former proving crucial. Calvert-Lewin made no mistake from Gnonto’s cross, and he celebrated with fans who have taken his hard-work ethic to their hearts. “Good character and good resilience,” was the recipe the former England striker offered for his new team’s continued revival.Neither team appeared willing to risk all for the winner even if Ampadu fired a missile of a shot wide, and Ouattara shot over. A point each; always the likeliest result when edge, enjoyment and expression are in short supply.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This defeat, a third for Wilfried Nancy in his three games as the manager, plunged the club firmly into a state of crisis. What a festive fiasco.There is a scenario in which Nancy changes Celtic’s fortunes. The trouble for the Frenchman is, that feels highly unlikely. On one of the finest days in St Mirren’s 148-year history they deservedly claimed the League Cup for only the second time. Yet it was impossible to ignore the desperate nature of Celtic’s performance. They have swapped Brendan Rodgers and Martin O’Neill – elite managers who fully comprehend this environment – for a project under Nancy that is already covered in red flags. Another key attribute shared by Rodgers and O’Neill is experience. Nancy is in a situation he has never encountered before in football.European football: Inter make no mistake and go top after rivals falterRead moreNancy is a symptom rather than the cause of Celtic’s decline. Under Rodgers, great headway was made in last season’s Champions League and, despite the odd bump, domestic dominance was a near-certainty. The failure to build on European progress in transfer windows triggered not only the exit of Rodgers but widespread supporter discontent, epitomised by an AGM that had to be abandoned. There is a lack of accountability among the Celtic hierarchy that rightly angers paying punters. Paul Tisdale, the head of football operations, might as well be the invisible man.O’Neill’s caretaker spell pre-Nancy was only ever supposed to be that, yet at least the 73-year-old won games. O’Neill retains presence. The lack of hype from Celtic around Nancy’s appointment left the impression even his paymasters were unsure of what was coming next.Hearts,Romaand now St Mirren have revelled in Celtic’s vulnerability. It is pretty difficult to envisage how they extricate themselves from this trauma. Even the spending of fortunes in January, presumably to endorse Nancy’s football theories, looks dangerous.View image in fullscreenA glum Wilfried Nancy looks on at full time after his third defeat in three games.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PANot that Nancy is blameless. His insistence on switching to a back three has looked problematic from the start, namely because Celtic lack wingbacks and appropriate balance at centre-half. The shipping of eight goals in three games tells a story. Celtic’s midfield, a recent strength, is suddenly ragged. Nancy’s messaging to the media, as again the case post-match here, verges on waffle. What on earth, then, must players think?Quick GuideScottish Premiership roundup: Braga and Kingsley take Hearts clearShowCláudio Braga and Stephen Kingsley were on target as a resurgentHeartswon 2-0 away to misfiringFalkirkon Saturday night to move six points clear at the top of the Premiership. Buoyed by ending a four-game run without a victory with last Sunday’s triumph against their title rivals Celtic, the Jambos raced into an early lead through Braga. Hearts – who survived a Bairns penalty claim just before half-time – had to dig deep to keep their advantage intact before the substitute Kingsley killed off the Bairns’ hopes of getting back into the game with a brilliant strike in the 77th minute (pictured).Celtic, who play St Mirren in the League Cup final on Sunday, have two games in hand.Jim Goodwin admitted he understood why theDundee Unitedfans booed at the final whistle of the 0-0  Premiership draw withMotherwell. The result meant that the Terrors have now failed to win in their last seven matches. However, United manager Goodwin was determined to accentuate the positives, with his side keeping their first clean sheet since 23 September when they beat Aberdeen 2-0.The Irishman said: \"We understand the frustration from the supporters. They turned out in great numbers again today. We've kept a clean sheet against a really, really good team. I'm going to give my players a bit of credit, off the back of a really disappointing performance last weekend.\"We're not happy not to win the game. We don't set up to draw games of football. But we set up in a way out of respect to the opposition. Motherwell are a very good possession-based team. I think they're probably, at this moment, the best team in the country in terms of how they play the game.\"Livingstonfought back from two goals down to salvage an important point from a 2-2 draw in the bottom-of-the-table Premiership clash withDundee. The visitors took control of the game with two goals in quick succession in the first half from Yan Dhanda and Cameron Congreve. After being booed off at the interval, Livingston improved in the second half and deservedly pulled one back through Jeremy Bokila. Then, just moments after coming on from the bench, Tete Yengi knocked an effort through the legs of Dundee goalkeeper Jon McCracken in the 85th minute. The draw moved Livingston to within three points of second-bottom Kilmarnock while Dundee climbed to 10th, four points better off than the Lions.On Sunday,Aberdeen's improved form continued with a 2-1 comeback victory over strugglingKilmarnock, whose winless run stretched to 10 games. The Dons toiled in the first period and were fortunate to trail by just one goal at the interval after Tyreece John-Jules opener the scoring for the visitors. But the hosts upped the tempo in the second half and Kenan Bilalovic levelled before Jesper Karlsson tucked home a late penalty to extend their unbeaten league run to seven matches.PA MediaPhotograph: Pete Summers/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Frenchman admitted defeat was “painful” before bemoaning Celtic’s “failure to connect” the game and said his squad carries “self-doubt”. Nancy added: “I know where we are now and I know where we want to go. If you don’t know me, you might think I am all over the place but I know exactly what I need to do. I am the manager and I need to find solutions.” He must source them before Wednesday night and a trip to Dundee United.As Nancy floundered, this was a triumph for his opposite number at St Mirren. Stephen Robinson out-thought and out-coached Nancy. St Mirren’s cup final plans had been disrupted by a call from Mikael Mandron to his manager at 7.30am, stating he had been sick all night. Mandron had been due to start at centre-forward. “I want being as comfortable as we were today to be recognised,” said Robinson. And it should be.View image in fullscreenJonah Ayunga heads St Mirren in front in the second half before adding a third.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe Paisley side surged ahead inside 100 seconds. Marcus Fraser reacted quickest to meet a Keanu Baccus corner for the third goal Celtic had lost from that form of set play in three games. Kasper Schmeichel was slow with his attempt to save, which is becoming something of a theme. Dan Nlundulu should have doubled the St Mirren lead but instead fired wide from close range.Celtic responded strongly enough. Reo Hatate ghosted in at the back post as Kieran Tierney floated in a cross. Hatate’s volley restored parity.What happened next was ominous for Nancy. As St Mirren seized the second-half initiative, Celtic had no reply. Schmeichel was in no man’s land as Jonah Ayunga rose to meet Alex Gogic’s chipped cross. Ayunga’s second of the afternoon arrived after Miguel Freckleton found the marauding Declan John with a terrific pass and the Welshman spotted his teammate in blissful isolation.In February, Celtic wereso close to giving Bayern Munich a bloody nosein Bavaria. Here was the same team being shown up by Ayunga, a striker whose most prolific spell came at Havant and Waterlooville. This is the stuff of dreams for St Mirren. Celtic are in nightmare territory.Explore more on these topicsScottish League CupSt MirrenCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In light of that, Amorim was asked in the buildup toMonday’s visit of Bournemouthif the 20-year-old had spoken to him regarding a temporary move.Amorim unsure if Manchester United’s Afcon-bound trio can face BournemouthRead more“If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him,” said the head coach. “I’m not going to say what I’m going to say to Kobbie but I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.“The frustration [of any player] doesn’t help anybody. But again, the focus is [Bournemouth] and we will see if that happens. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players but about that subject, no I didn’t speak with him. I am completely open [to talk].”Last week Paul Scholes claimed Amorim “doesn’t get the club”. The Portuguese was asked if comments such as these from United legends makes his job harder. “No, it’s not winning – not winning is the issue,” he said. “If I’m winning I can go to the games on a horse, arrive there, play with just two defenders and everything will be fine. The problem is that as a manager I’m not doing good enough and that is a fact also. So that is the only problem.“Me as a manager of Manchester United, we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take that, naturally. Sometimes they [critical former players] don’t have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here. Always winning. So it’s hard for them to see their club in this situation.”Scholes also questioned Amorim’s reluctance to start Mainoo in midfield, a stance echoed by Nicky Butt and Rio Ferdinand. “I know that for you guys there are some players that you believe in a lot and I believe a lot but sometimes I have to make choices,” said Amorim. “We play with two midfielders. We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it’s really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.”Amorim was asked if he rates Mainoo highly. “Of course. Like everyone else,” the 40-year-old insisted. “Casemiro is the biggest example [of him changing his mind]. He was behind Toby [Collyer, now on loan at West Brom] and now he’s a star.”Amorim did concede that Mainoo can operate in Casemiro’s position as the holding midfielder. “Yes, he can. I think it wasagainst Everton– I took Casemiro out and I put Kobbie in there because we were trying to play a different game. He can play in that position. But it’s hard sometimes. Sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think [if he is] the guy for blocking transitions. He needs to spend more time there but he can be in that position in the future.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

We had chances in the second half, but we conceded from the only mistake Valdepenas made and Carlos Vicente took advantage of that, after a great pass.“But the team continued to fight hard, battling it out in a difficult stadium against a very intense opponent. That second goal gave us the three points and we’re leaving here very happy.”Real Sociedadsacked their head coach, Sergio Francisco, on Sunday, two days after the club’s third successive defeat in La Liga. La Real lost 2-1 against the struggling Girona on Friday in a home match they led after 75 minutes.The game on Sunday betweenLevanteandVillarrealwas postponed because of a warning of torrential rain in the Valencia region.Intermoved to the top ofSerie Awith a 2-1 victory atGenoathanks to first-half goals from Yann Bisseck and Lautaro Martínez.

The incident did not delay kick-off.Inter needed only six minutes to take the lead, as the defender Bisseck fired a low effort into the near bottom corner.

Napoli struggled against an aggressiveUdinese, who had two goals disallowed.After a mostly uneventful first half, it was the hosts who tried to show they were the superior team after the break. Keinan Davis thought he had given Udinese the lead minutes into the second half after running in on a rebound but the celebrations were short-lived as VAR showed he was offside.With the pressure mounting, it seemed a matter of time before the breakthrough arrived. In the 69th minute, Udinese’s Nicolò Zaniolo was played through on goal, surged to the edge of the box and drove a low shot into the net. However the referee ruled the goal out for a foul in the buildup, which drew furious protests from the home supporters.Four minutes later Udinese’s Jurgen Ekkelenkamp produced a moment of brilliance to put the home side ahead. Collecting the ball at a tight angle near the edge of the area, he shrugged off a defender and curled a superb finish into the top corner.Napoli got more involved in the closing stages after being outmatched for much of the second half. Rasmus Højlund came close when he arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a cross, but lost his footing and fell as his effort sailed over the bar.Deep into stoppage time, Napoli had another chance as Lorenzo Lucca stretched to meet a cross inside the box but his effort struck the base of the post and went wide.Milanhad to settle for a 2-2 draw againstSassuoloat San Siro.

We could have been more alert for the first goal and the second.

Victory had seemed within his grasp as he recorded a 160 checkout on his way to taking the second set.Bunting cooled, however, and won just one leg over the next two sets, allowing Bialecki – oblivious to a wasp that landed on his shoulder – to pull back level. Bunting recovered his composure in the fifth leg but was still taken to the wire before winning it 4-2.“When you are playing at Ally Pally you go through all the emotions,” Bunting told Sky Sports. “I knew Sebastian was going to be tough and even at 2-0 he never gave in.“I am lucky to get away with that one.

The more pedantic-minded might also point out that both their opponents have fielded below-strength sides, but when the qualifying sums are completed next month that will not be the top line as far as the Saints’ management are concerned.Because regardless of the depth of the resistance they are facing,Northamptonare again underlining their ability to pick apart sides who give them too much space and time. On this occasion they rattled up eight tries, including a hat-trick for George Hendy, two for the fit-again Ollie Sleightholme and one for the roaming Henry Pollock, who showed a further glimpse or two of his rare talent.Ten-try Harlequins cruise to Champions Cup rout of understrength BayonneRead moreOne searing diagonal burst by the 20-year-old England back-rower, stopped only by a tap tackle within sight of the line, was the most obvious retort to the pre-match lip-smacking in South Africa at the prospect of him venturing down a dark alley populated by hard-nosed Afrikaaners unimpressed by his growing international reputation.Quick GuideChampions Cup roundup: Edinburgh suffer 33-0 defeat at CastresShowToulon came out on top over Bath in an entertaining nine-try contest and took a 45-34 victory at the Stade Mayol. The result means all six teams in Pool Two have a win and a loss to their name after their first two matches but Bath's bonus point means they top the table with six points, with the other sides on five. Finn Russell slotted two penalties either side of Brian Alainu'uese's try which gave Toulon a 7-6 lead. Mateo Garcia kicked three points for the hosts following a ruck infringement but Bath went ahead through Ted Hill with their first try of the game before Garcia knocked over his second penalty to make it 13-13. Toulon went eight points to the good when Juan Ignacio Brex finished off after Kyle Sinckler's powerful run, that was before Garcia kicked his third penalty of the game - but back came Bath again when Russell's delayed pass allowed Santi Carreras to cross the whitewash. Sinckler's powerful run proved troublesome again in Toulon's next try as Gael Drean picked a line to race clear and re-establish the French side's eight point lead but Bath were not going away themselves, Arthur Green dotted down to bring the deficit back to one. Toulon got their try bonus point through Lewis Ludlam but Max Ojomoh's short pass let Louie Hennessey cut the gap to four points for Bath before another penalty and Teddy Baubigny's try finished things off in the French side's favour.In the other Pool 2 match,Edinburghwere brought back down to earth in the Champions Cup as they fell to a 33-0 defeat atCastres. The visitors claimed a stunning win over Toulon on their return to the competition last week but they were well beaten in France this time.Bristolran riot with nine tries as they thrashed Pau 61-12 at Ashton Gate in Pool 4. Eight different try scorers got in on the act as Bristol made it two wins from two and scored all 61 of their points – as Tom Jordan kicked eight successful conversions – within the opening hour to claim a dominant win. The England prop Ellis Genge powered over from close range open a destructive afternoon of scoring and Fitz Harding slipped the ball to Benjamin Grondona in a two-on-one situation to go under the posts for their second try. Things were threatening to get a bit ugly for the French visitors when Bristol ran in three more tries before the break courtesy of Kieran Marmion, Kalaveti Ravouvou and Gabriel Oghre’s score at the back of the maul on the stroke of half-time. There were no signs of letting up in the second period either, Benhard Janse van Rensburg crossed over four minutes into the half before Joe Batley made it 47-0. Pau got on the scoresheet through Fabien Brau-Boirie’s try under the posts but Aidan Boshoff and Grondona – who crossed over for his brace – extended the hosts’ score, while Brau-Boirie’s second try was nothing more than a consolation for the visitors.PA MediaPhotograph: George Tewkesbury/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With the increasing number of cameras trained on the modern game, that was never going to stray too far beyond the boundaries of decency and, not for the first time, Pollock had the last laugh on the scoreboard. As the Bulls’ head coach, Johan Ackermann, correctly observed beforehand: “He gets under the skin of the opposition with his overconfidence, but the reality is that he backs it up when he plays.”With Fin Smith, the player of the match, George Furbank – increasingly strongly linked with a summer move to Harlequins – Rory Hutchinson and Alex Mitchell also playing slick supporting roles, the result was another of those one-sided spectacles that are now a feature of this tournament’s early stages. This should have been a delicious prospect for any rugby neutral: last year’s Champions Cup finalists against a team containing multiple Springboks. Instead, as is becoming a wearily familiar story in the pool stages, the reality was slightly more humdrum.It remained a stronger Bulls side than some of those sighted in these parts in past seasons but a full-bore, eyeballs-out selection it was not. The visitors were missing half a team of Bok representatives with Handré Pollard, Canan Moodie, Wilco Louw and Willie le Roux, among others, all spared the East Midlands in December.View image in fullscreenOllie Sleightholme scored two tries in Northampton’s emphatic victory.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesIt was not a massive surprise, then, when Saints took the early initiative, slick handling and a nicely timed pass from Pollock sending Sleighthome over in the left corner. The England wing has endured an injury disrupted year but is finally back doing what comes naturally.In his own half, unfortunately, the 25-year-old was less sure-handed, dropping a costly ball in contact which was then hacked on for the pacy Stravino Jacobs to break away and score. Saints were suitably relieved when they did finally enjoy some sustained territorial advantage and created a mismatch out wide for Hendy to exploit.At which point, under other circumstances, it would have been the signal for Ackermann’s army to circle the wagons and smash their way back into the contest through sheer physical will. The truth, sadly, is that the best South African players cannot play across both hemispheres all year round without some occasional respite. And until that fiendish circle is even vaguely squared, their participation in northern hemisphere club tournaments will continue to create as many problems as it solves, regardless of the format.Quick GuideNorthampton 50-5 Bulls teams and scorersShowTeams and scorersNorthamptonFurbank (capt); Sleightholme, Hutchinson, Dingwall (Thame 53), Hendy; F Smith, Mitchell (James 60) Fischetti (Iyogun 49), Wright (R Smith 49), Davison (Kundiona 49), Coles (Munga 60), Van der Mescht (Prowse 61), Kemeny, Pearson (Graham 69), Pollock.TriesSleightholme 2, Hendy 3, Pollock, Coles, Kemeny.ConF Smith 5.BullsWilliams; Petersen, Gans, Vorster (Van Niekirk 61), Jacobs; Wolhuter (Johannes 66), Burger (Papier 11); Tshakweni (Louw 63), Van der Merwe (Else 67), C Smith (Mchunu 54), Wiese, Van Heerden, Coetzee (capt; Carr 40) Ludwig, Louw (Sithole 55, Gumede 66).TryJacobs.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The format of the competition also has to take its share of the blame. Bulls have already lost to Bordeaux at home but a single bonus-point win at home to Bristol next month followed by a losing bonus point in Pau may conceivably be enough to squeeze them into the last 16. On that basis, why would middle-ranking sides necessarily bust a gut in the pool stages if they are not overly focus on securing home advantage in the knockout phase?In this instance, certainly, the last quarter was a procession after Alu Tshakweni had been sent to the sin-bin for a retaliatory 53rd-minute kick at Manny Iyogun. With a numerical advantage against flagging opposition the Saints duly made hay with the hard-running Sleightholme and Hendy, twice, benefiting from the efforts of those inside them. Rare is also the game in which Pollock does not play some part in the narrative but these were nothing like the raging Bulls this competition would ideally like.“We knew when we saw the Saints team that it was going to be tough because of the quality they possess,” said Ackermann, whose side lost at home to Bordeaux in the opening round. “It was just disappointing that we collapsed in the second half.”His Saints counterpart, Phil Dowson, whose side head out to France to face the holders, Bordeaux, next month, also admitted the club were realistic about the difficulty of retaining experienced players like Furbank in addition to their rich crop of young English talent. “We’re trying to work hard to keep George … but we respect the decision the player makes,” said Dowson, who has previously lost both Lewis Ludlam and David Ribbans to French clubs for salary cap-related reasons.“Obviously it would be a bitter pill if George bloody Furbank drops a goal from halfway in a semi-final, for example. If that eventuality happens and he ends up at an English club we’ll obviously track his career and keep in touch but I don’t think we can be bitter about that.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupNorthamptonBullsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Manu Tuilagi and Gareth Anscombe were listed as injured, along with plenty of others, but four frontline players were rested. There was nothing wrong with Bayonne giving Jonah Thompson, a 20-year-old Australian, his professional debut against rugby royalty in south-west London: but the fact he is a flanker, and was pressed into service on the right wing, was arguably pushing it a bit far.TheChampions Cupis supposedly an elite competition and that should be celebrated whenever appropriate. But the current format means too many clubs are selecting weakened sides for matches they regard as unwinnable – or rather, when they think others are more winnable. It is short-changing fans. Quins scored 10 tries, nine of them converted by Marcus Smith, the player of the match, but it rarely felt as if they were obliged to change up from second gear.Saracens fall just short in South Africa as Sharks survive Champions Cup stormRead more“We can only play what they put out there,” said the Harlequins senior coach, Jason Gilmore. “It’s a bit like that in the Champions Cup at the moment. Are the travelling teams full strength all the time? Probably not. But you’ve got to make sure you get your five points at home.”The hosts, initially, proved incapable of holding on to their own ball when it counted. There was early pace and tempo, but handling errors too from Luke Northmore and Oscar Beard. Smith finally injected a bit of quality, dabbing a grubber kick for Cadan Murley to score on 22 minutes.Tom Spring, Bayonne’s young fly-half, then failed to read a Smith cross-kick, allowing the second-row Kieran Treadwell to gallop over, and Fin Baxter capitalised on more weak defending to score from close range. That was 21-0 – apparently game over – unless the visitors could muster a comeback like Glasgow’s magnificent effort against Toulouse and Antoine Dupont on Saturday.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith kicked nine conversions in Harlequins’ emphatic victory.Photograph: Cat Goryn/INPHO/ShutterstockQuick GuideHarlequins 68-14 Bayonne teams and scorersShowHarlequinsDavid; Cleaves, Beard (Waghorn 54), Northmore (Benson 63), Murley (capt.), Smith, Porter (Friday 57); Baxter (Wenger 58), Walker (Riley 54), Delgado (Hobson 47), Pagadizábal, Lewies (Treadwell 24), Kenningham, Evans, Carr (Cunningham-South 51).TriesMurley, Treadwell 2, Baxter, Delgado, Porter 2, M Smith, Riley, Benson.ConsM Smith 9.Sin-binEvans 34.BayonneOrabe; Thompson, Maqala (Jantjies 66), Mori, Hannoun; Spring (Boyle-Tiatia 57), Tilloles; Calles (Cormenier 51), Martin (Giudicelli 51), Setiano (Fepulea’i 51), Iandolino (Marchesin 75), Paulos, Fischer (capt., Traversier 51), Capilla (Heguy 51), Ariceta.TriesPaulos, Spring.ConsSpring 2.Sin-binIandolino 56, Heguy 64.RefereeAndrew BraceWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.When Spring chased a kick over the top and the Argentinian Lucas Paulos burrowed over, Will Evans was shown a yellow card into the bargain. At 21-7 and with Quins a man down, the threat of a contest hung in the air, before the prop Pedro Delgado surged over for his first Harlequins five-pointer. A bonus point secured, to go with the one Quins claimed in losing to Leinster last weekend.After the break, when the scrum-half Will Porter darted over in the corner, Smith added a fifth conversion and that was 35-7. Spring’s lively running led to a second Bayonne try when he jinked over on the right having accepted a beautiful one-handed offload by the hooker Lucas Martin. Porter added his second try before Chandler Cunningham-South, ominously for Bayonne, appeared off the home bench.Baptiste Heguy was the second visiting player to be sent to the sin-bin, leaving them with 13 men for a minute or so, and another Quins replacement, Sam Riley, capitalised with two tries inside five minutes.Quick GuideChampions Cup roundup: Edinburgh suffer 33-0 defeat at CastresShowToulon came out on top over Bath in an entertaining nine-try contest and took a 45-34 victory at the Stade Mayol. The result means all six teams in Pool Two have a win and a loss to their name after their first two matches but Bath's bonus point means they top the table with six points, with the other sides on five. Finn Russell slotted two penalties either side of Brian Alainu'uese's try which gave Toulon a 7-6 lead. Mateo Garcia kicked three points for the hosts following a ruck infringement but Bath went ahead through Ted Hill with their first try of the game before Garcia knocked over his second penalty to make it 13-13. Toulon went eight points to the good when Juan Ignacio Brex finished off after Kyle Sinckler's powerful run, that was before Garcia kicked his third penalty of the game - but back came Bath again when Russell's delayed pass allowed Santi Carreras to cross the whitewash. Sinckler's powerful run proved troublesome again in Toulon's next try as Gael Drean picked a line to race clear and re-establish the French side's eight point lead but Bath were not going away themselves, Arthur Green dotted down to bring the deficit back to one. Toulon got their try bonus point through Lewis Ludlam but Max Ojomoh's short pass let Louie Hennessey cut the gap to four points for Bath before another penalty and Teddy Baubigny's try finished things off in the French side's favour.In the other Pool 2 match,Edinburghwere brought back down to earth in the Champions Cup as they fell to a 33-0 defeat atCastres. The visitors claimed a stunning win over Toulon on their return to the competition last week but they were well beaten in France this time.Bristolran riot with nine tries as they thrashed Pau 61-12 at Ashton Gate in Pool 4. Eight different try scorers got in on the act as Bristol made it two wins from two and scored all 61 of their points – as Tom Jordan kicked eight successful conversions – within the opening hour to claim a dominant win. The England prop Ellis Genge powered over from close range open a destructive afternoon of scoring and Fitz Harding slipped the ball to Benjamin Grondona in a two-on-one situation to go under the posts for their second try.

The Australian should have a bright future and none of this is his fault. Blame the format, blame the coaches, but don’t blame him. The Ireland international Treadwell made it 10 tries but it was long since over by then.Asked if fans want full-strength sides competing in the Champions Cup Gilmore said: “I think the players do too. They’re competitive beasts. There’s probably different factors in that, when you’re squishing the competition amongst Gallagher Prem and Top 14.“We had this last week, we rested a few players, but by international guidelines you’ve got to … it’s hard to get the balance of it all in terms of mixing competitions, but I just look at what the boys want.

While the 6ft 9in center once regularly played more than 80 games in a regular season, he’s hit new career lows, appearing just 40 times on court during the 2024-2025 season. Following the money, however, suggests Thompson is pivoting into a new career. He’s rebranded as a crypto investor, consultant and brand ambassador, bringing his relative cultural cache to the blockchain. Now the host of his own podcast, Courtside Crypto, he has made frequent appearances with other crypto celebrities, such as at the Nasdaq in September, when hecelebrated the IPO of an explicitly nationalist Bitcoin mining operationalongside Eric Trump; Thompson has also developed a crypto startup slated to launch in 2026.In 2025, crypto is back in style in Washington and among agrowing set in Hollywood, where Thompson lives adjacent to the Kardashian clan, some of whom have been crypto spokespeople. Donald Trump has reversed Joe Biden’s legal offensive against crypto, debuting his own token, $Trump, before his inauguration, and rolling back government actions against the industry, which heavily supported him during his bid for the presidency. Celebrities have likewise returned to hawking cryptocurrency projects or launching tokens of their own.View image in fullscreenIggy Azalea in North Hollywood, California, in 2025.Photograph: Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for MemeHouse Productions”Thompson is not the only pro sports figure diving in. Lamar Odom, a former basketball star, launcheda crypto coinin May that partially funds addiction recovery, and Mike Tyson, the former boxing legend, isa spokesperson for Naga, a Robinhood-like trading platform that includes cryptocurrency products. Outside sports, Thomspon stands shoulder to shoulder, metaphorically speaking, with figures such as Iggy Azalea, an Australian rapper, who, in addition to her work as the spokesperson forher $MOTHER crypto token, was featured alongside Thompson and Eric Trump as a keynote speaker atthe 2025 Blockchain Futurist Conferencelast month. At the November conference, Azalea was named the creative director ofThrust, a new platform allowing celebrities to issue their own branded meme coins, a subset of cryptocurrencies that are billed as purely speculative and arenot enforcedas securities. Streaming personalityN3on was the firstto launch his meme coin on the Thrust platform. Actor Megan Fox will be next.“A few years ago, most celebrity crypto stuff came off like quick stunts, and now, people expect an actual plan and some kind of real value for communities, not just a splashy moment,” Azalea told the Guardian via text. “Yes, I think celebrities are still curious about the space, but are a lot more careful. No one wants to be linked to something chaotic or sloppy.”Through limits on how token issuers can sell their own shares, the project claims to mitigate the potential for token collapses and pump-and-dump schemes. The industry may not have entirely reformed, though: Azalea’s $MOTHER meme coin facedallegationsof insider trading almost as soon as it launched in May. Azalea has denied dumping $2m worth of tokens and has disclaimed any control over, or knowledge of, the people who owned them.Crypto springCelebrities were enamored with crypto schemes at the peak of the market in 2021, when Matt Damon appeared in a Super Bowl ad for a crypto company. But after the fraud-induced collapse of crypto exchange FTX, A-listers faced a wave of lawsuits and penalties, part of a wider regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency under the former president. Celebrities listed as defendants in crypto-related court cases includedTom Brady, Shohei Ohtani, Steph Curry,Shaquille O’Neal, Naomi Osaka,Cristiano Ronaldo,Floyd Mayweather, and Kim Kardashian– sister to Khloé Kardashian, with whom Tristan Thompson has had a tumultuous relationship and two children. In 2022,Kim Kardashian settled with the SECfor $1.26m over charges in connection with illegally promoting a crypto security, EthereumMax.The rich and famous backed off promoting digital currency in the ensuing years. The Kardashian case “tamped down on all celebrity involvement” in crypto, according to Dr William Mullins, a professor of finance at UC San Diegostudyingthe effects of celebrity influence on individuals’ crypto investments. Celebrities in the crypto realm can reach hundreds of millions of followers cheaply via social media, and they can easily establish a narrative since most fiduciary advisors steer clear of the sector, he said. Directing follower attention can be incredibly lucrative, since crypto investments are largely a “coordination game” driven by demand, rather than underlying fundamentals, Mullins added, making crypto “extraordinarily vulnerable to celebrity influence”.View image in fullscreenKhloé Kardashian at the 2022 Met Gala.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue“A lot of people are more comfortable when the President of the United States launches a meme coin,” said Jake Antifaev, the co-founder and CEO of Thrust.$Trump demonstrated meme coins’ lucrative potential, though its windfall may have come at the expense of other celebrities’ crypto ambitions. In May, Trumppersonally hosteda dinner for the 220 largest holders of $Trump, and held a private “reception” for the largest 25 buyers. These individuals collectively spent around $148m purchasing $Trump tokens, the Guardianpreviously reported. According to Andrew Duca, the founder of crypto-focused tax platformAwaken, the $Trump token “sucked up so much liquidity” that it caused other meme coins’ price to fall, which may have dissuaded other celebrities from launching their own tokens.Duca said celebrity activity in crypto in 2025 is markedly different from what we saw in 2021. “Last cycle, you were getting more A-list celebs … and this cycle, you basically only saw the griftier celebs actually participate,” he said. These celebrities’ endorsements in 2025 primarily center around meme coins, rather than more traditional cryptocurrencies or crypto exchanges, Duca added.According to Paul Afshar, chief marketing officer atPaybis, a crypto exchange, celebrities are opting for meme coin launches because “the economics are not the same” compared with the crypto-endorsement craze of 2021: major crypto companies once offered eight-figure endorsement deals, but those big-budget campaigns have dried up, as they failed to retain users and were eventually seen as too legally risky.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 2024.Photograph: Kevin Wurm/Reuters“So, instead of coordinated campaigns backed by crypto companies, we’ve got celebrities trying to monetize their own audiences directly through token launches,” Afshar told the Guardian via email. “It’s lower budget, higher risk, and reaches far fewer people than the 2021 celeb craze ever did.”During his first tenure in office, Trump was a vocal crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin “a scam against the dollar”. After entering office a second time, though, his administration rescinded a range of regulatory bulletins and policies perceived as restricting the growth of the crypto industry. His U-turn has also come with a windfall in other crypto-related deals and tie-ups for Trump family businesses – not just the $Trump meme coin, or the$Melania meme cointied to the first lady. Estimates suggest that the September launch of another Trump-affiliated crypto token, $WLFI, may havebuoyed the Trumps’ net worthby as much as $5bn, and may have become the Trump family’s most valuable asset – edging out their real estate portfolio. The Genius Act, the first major federal law to explicitly legalize blockchain-based products in the US, which Trump signed into law in July, did not bar the relatives of elected officials from engaging in crypto-related business. Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, has denied that the president ever engaged in a conflict of interest.In an interview with the Guardian, Thompson said he thinks many figures in the crypto industry have been unfairly punished in the past, and he welcomes Trump’s enthusiasm for the industry, includinghis pardon in October of Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of crypto platform Binance, who had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws for failing to report suspicious transactions with organizations such as al-Qaida.Thompson is familiar with how quickly fortunes can change in the cryptocurrency industry. In February,he debuted Tracy AI, an automated sportscasting platform, and served as its chief content officer and lead adviser. The startup already appears defunct:its websiteno longer functions, and the company haspublished instructionson how to transfer $TRACY, the platform’s crypto token, into other major crypto denominations.View image in fullscreenTristan Thompson at All Star Tracy AI in San Francisco, California.Photograph: Cassidy Sparrow/Getty Images for Tracy AIAdditional celebrity activity in the crypto sector may come through two paths, said Duca, the crypto-taxation entrepreneur. More buttoned-up ventures, such as companies working in stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency pegged to a more stable asset like the dollar, may launch ad campaigns with well-regarded brand ambassadors, similar to Jennifer Garner’s deal with Capital One, he theorized. Duca also foresees celebrities tying up with prediction markets like Polymarket or Kalshi, especially sports stars, whose followers may use gambling platforms like DraftKings. Prediction-market sites have “so much cash”, and already have endorsements in play with tech figures, he added.Thompson’s upcoming venture, Basketball.fun, is a crypto-inflected hybrid of DraftKings and Polymarket that is slated to launch early next year. In Thompson’s words, the company will “be a disruptor to traditional gambling” by adding a “prediction market component, because obviously, right now, the prediction market is going crazy”. The platform will use a fantasy league-type user experience as its foundation, minting a meme coin assigned to every player in the NBA, and allowing users on the platform to determine the value of the player by trading those currencies, rather than using the weighted scores companies like ESPN and FanDuel assign to a player. The Polymarket-esque prediction market component lets users set their predictions on the future value of players’ coins. In aggregate, Thompson thinks these efforts can help dis-intermediate the current sports-watching experience, refracted through broadcast networks.Speaking to the Guardian the same morning, Chauncey Billups, a former NBA star, was arrested for his alleged role in an illegal gambling scheme – while several insider gambling investigations are ongoing in the NBA and Major League Baseball – Thompson emphasized that NBA players and other sports professionals should not bet on their own games. At the same time, he criticized sports networks’ prominent display of betting products during broadcasts. “Why can’t we challenge [the networks] and give the people an opportunity to be in control and take back their rights?” he asked.Thompson, whorecordeda special episode of his podcast from the White House in July, said his affinity for the Trump presidency goes beyond their shared passion for crypto: “I stand by what President Trump’s about,” he said. He cited the Trump administration’s slate of tariffs as one path towards empowerment, and pointed to the economies of Israel, Russia, and Dubai as ones where “they [successfully] keep money circulating within the country” to generate wealth.“I believe President Trump is trying to do it when he says, ‘make America great again’,” said Thompson, who was born in Canada and became a US citizen in 2020. “And I think what he’s trying to do, it’s very similar to how it was when the early settlers came around, where the money was circulating [internally]. That’s when America was at its peak … there was so much money being made, so he’s trying to just bring that back. History repeats itself.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.Chenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals thatare frequently under-resourced and under-staffed.They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.Physicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to theAmerican Medical Association.A recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians,but worse than those of expert physicians.Tan said that it’s important to take context – likefrequent physician burnout in rural hospitals– into account when evaluating risks and benefits.“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.Chagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.The FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.While Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.Chagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.But this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.To mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Cordless models offer the ultimate freedom to roam untethered, but they come with tradeoffs in power, weight, runtime and of course cost. To find the model that balanced these best, I tested seven models across the price spectrum on dry leaves, damp leaves, pine needles, and general yard debris. Throughout testing, I paid close attention to control, comfort and how long each battery maintained usable power.Of course, if you’re looking for the most ecologically minded solution, considerleaving some leaves behind.Why you should trust meI have been testing outdoor gear and consumer products for more than 15 years, and I grew up in the midwest, where keeping a tidy lawn is a regional pastime. I still approach yard work with that same mindset.The 12,000-sq-ft yard of my Colorado home makes a useful testing ground: it’s ringed by a peach tree, an apple tree, a very unruly maple, two spruce trees, and an 80-ft cottonwood. I love the shade this towering tree provides in the summer, but I have come to dread the thick layer of leaves it drops every autumn.How I testedView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianI used every blower in this guide for several weeks of fall cleanup, including moving a mix of dry and damp leaves, pine needles, gravel, mulch and general yard debris. For heavier material, I created compacted piles and wet clusters after a watering cycle, and I used each blower on driveways and sidewalks to see how well I could control the airflow at different power settings.Ignore all the smart home gimmicks. These five devices actually make life easierRead moreAlmost all modern cordless blowers handle basic leaf-clearing well, so I paid close attention to ergonomics, which can matter just as much as raw power, especially during long sessions. Balance, button and trigger placement, and the ease of checking the battery status, all shape how a tool feels and performs during everyday use.Using the included batteries, I ran every blower from fully charged to empty on both medium and high power settings, noting total runtime and how quickly power tapered off as the battery drained. A decibel meter captured sound output from the user’s perspective.An early-season snowstorm also allowed me to test snow-clearing, but your results may vary by region. Powdery Colorado snow is easy enough for a blower to puff around, while the wet accumulation you’d see after a nor’easter would be a tough task for any leaf blower.At a glanceBest overall blower:Ryobi 40V HP Whisper Series$339 at Home DepotBest blower for precision and control:Stihl BGA 60$299.99 at ScheelsBest budget blower:Lazyboi Electric Leaf Blower$59.99 at AmazonBest battery life:EGO Power+ 880 CFM Blower$399.99 at AmazonBest overall blower:Ryobi 40V HP Whisper SeriesRyobi40V HP Whisper Seriesfrom$339$339 at Ryobi$339 at Home DepotPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$339 at Home DepotThe Ryobi 40V HP Whisper Series combines strong real-world power with excellent ergonomics, long runtime and an impressively low noise level. Across weeks of yard work, it was the model that felt the most composed and effective in everyday use – powerful enough for heavier debris, yet balanced and quiet enough for long sessions without fatigue.Why we love itRyobi stakes a Goldilocks middle ground between raw power and control. Although this blower isn’t one of the lightest models I tested, its thoughtful weight distribution and neutral balance make a major difference in how it handles. The Whisper Series naturally settles into a comfortable working angle, reducing wrist effort and allowing you to guide airflow precisely, whether you’re edging along walkways, sweeping broad driveway sections, or clearing around landscaping. That balance gave it a clear usability advantage over blowers that felt front-heavy or required frequent grip corrections.It is also impressively quiet. In testing, the Whisper Series produced the lowest noise levels of any comparable full-sized blower, especially at mid-range settings, which most homeowners will use for day-to-day clearing. That makes early-morning or extended sessions noticeably more tolerable for both you and your neighbors.On a medium setting, the Ryobi ran longer than most blowers in this guide, bested only by the Ego, and its power delivery stayed consistent through the bulk of the charge. The intuitive cruise-control dial rounds out the package: it’s easy to operate by feel, holds its position securely, and makes steady-output clearing far more comfortable than feathering the trigger for long stretches.It’s a shame that …its peak output is slightly lower than the most powerful blower in this test. For dense, compacted piles or heavy wet leaves, the Ego remains the quicker option. And while the Ryobi delivered one of the longer measured runtimes in my medium-power tests, its 40V pack drains rapidly at full output, so homeowners who require maximum power or have large yards may still want a spare battery.Weight (with battery):10.6lbsRuntime (on medium setting):64 minutesNoise rating (on medium and max):57 / 70dBAir volume:800 cubic ft per minute (CFM)Air speed:Up to 180mphBattery platform:Ryobi 40V$339 at RyobiRyobi40V HP Whisper Seriesfrom$339$339 at Ryobi$339 at Home DepotBest blower for precision and control:Stihl BGA 60StihlBGA 60from$299.99$299.99 at Scheels$299.99 at Northern ToolPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$299.99 at Scheels$299.99 at Northern ToolThe Stihl BGA 60 is the most precise, easy-to-control blower I tested, and it quickly became the one I relied on for detailed yard work. While it isn’t the most powerful model here, its balance, ergonomics and predictable power delivery make it exceptionally effective for edging along pathways, steering debris out of tight spaces and working around landscaping without scattering material where you don’t want it.Why we love itThe BGA 60 stands out for its precision handling. Smart weight distribution lets the tool naturally settle into a ready-to-use angle, reducing wrist strain and making it simple to guide the airflow exactly where you need it. The two-stage trigger offers a broad, usable range, letting you feather power gently around gravel, mulch or tight beds without kicking debris sideways.Instead of blasting material indiscriminately, the focused nozzle lifts leaves and settled debris in a predictable line, helping you clear walkways, patios and planting areas with more intention and less backtracking. And because the battery maintains consistent output for most of its charge, the blower feels steady and controllable across an entire full yard session.It’s a shame that …the BGA 60 doesn’t run as long as some of the larger blowers we tested from Ego and Ryobi, especially at higher settings, so anyone with more than a typical suburban backyard will likely want a spare battery. The narrower nozzle and slightly lower peak output also mean it won’t move dense, compacted leaf piles or heavy wet debris as quickly as the most powerful blowers in this guide. It also lacks a cruise-control setting, which you will miss for pushing larger piles of leaves or clearing long stretches of lawn. Stihl typically sells tools through dealers, so availability may be less convenient than brands with broad distribution online or in big-box stores.Weight (with battery):7.9lbsRuntime (on medium setting):22 minutesNoise rating (on medium and max):60 / 68dBAir volume:459 CFMAir speed:154mphBattery platform:Stihl AK-seriesStihlBGA 60from$299.99$299.99 at Scheels$299.99 at Northern ToolBest budget leaf blower:Lazyboi Electric Leaf BlowerLazyboiElectric Leaf Blower$59.99$59.99 at AmazonPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$59.99 at AmazonThe Lazyboi Electric Leaf Blower is the best budget option I tested. It’s a compact, lightweight blower designed for small yards, patios and quick cleanup jobs rather than heavy leaf removal.Why we love itThis blower’s low weight, simple operation and affordable price put it in an entirely different league. It’s light enough that fatigue is rarely an issue, and in my testing it handled everyday tasks – clearing dry leaves off a patio, moving dust and small debris – better than expected for this price point. The straightforward design makes it easy to grab for quick jobs in smaller areas where a larger blower would feel unnecessary.A flattened, angled nozzle attachment concentrates airflow for edging along walkways or nudging debris out of corners. And because the Lazyboi appears to be produced generically and sold under multiple brand names – it may also appear from different sellers at different prices. That occasionally works in the buyer’s favor when similar versions go on sale. Two included 2.0Ah batteries mean you can use one while you charge the other.It’s a shame that …the Lazyboi doesn’t offer a smooth variable-speed trigger: you have to adjust the speed with settings, which can feel clumsy when you need to delicately modulate airflow around mulch or gravel. Runtime is the lowest of all the blowers we tested at just 18 minutes per battery pack on a medium setting, but it was adequate for small, fast cleanup jobs such as zapping leaves off of a small patio. Basic build quality makes me less confident that this blower would survive rough treatment compared to its bigger peers, and it lacks the force needed for wet leaves or compacted debris. The batteries aren’t part of any larger cordless tool ecosystem, so you can’t share them with drills, trimmers or other tools you may already own.Weight (with battery):3.4lbsRuntime (on medium setting):18 minutesNoise rating (on medium and max):78 / 82dBAir volume:420 CFMAir speed:150mphBattery platform:Lazyboi 21VLazyboiElectric Leaf Blower$59.99$59.99 at AmazonBest battery life:Ego Power+ 880 CFM BlowerEgoPower+ 880 CFM Blowerfrom$399.99$399.99 at Amazon$439 at Lowe’sPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$399.99 at Amazon$439 at Lowe’sThe Ego Power+ 880 CFM blower delivered the longest sustained runtime of any model I tested at an hour and six minutes. Its large-capacity battery maintained steady power through long stretches of yardwork, making it one of the few blowers here that can handle larger properties without a mid-session recharge – although it does come with a second battery pack if you really need to go the distance. It cleared dry leaves, driveway debris and pine needles with ease, and had enough force at higher settings to move heavier, settled material when needed.Why we love itThe 880 CFM blower offers strong, consistent airflow across all power levels. I found the mid-level settings ideal for most day-to-day clearing, and they really help stretch the runtime. The LED display is one of the best interfaces I tested, making it easy to see which mode the blower is in at a glance. The cruise-control button was especially helpful when clearing long driveways or wide sections of lawn. Two included 4.0Ah batteries let you charge one while using the other to keep working through larger lawns with shorter downtime.It’s a shame that …this blower’s balance wasn’t as good as I expected from Ego. It’s angled downward so aggressively that I often had to lift the front to send debris further afield and take advantage of the power on tap. It is still usable, but the included shoulder strap is the best way to manage the weight and improve control.The blower also feels bulky for detailed work, or when clearing around landscaping. And while the Ego battery platform is widely available and well supported, the kits are more expensive than comparable models from Ryobi or DeWalt.Weight (with battery):19lbsRuntime (on medium setting):66 minutesNoise rating (on medium and max):76 / 88dBAir volume:880 CFMAir speed:up to 190mphBattery platform:Ego 56VEgoPower+ 880 CFM Blowerfrom$399.99$399.99 at Amazon$439 at Lowe’sBest of the restConsider for delicate work:Worx LeafJet 40V NitroWorxLeafJet 40V Nitrofrom$179$179 at Amazon$249.99 at WalmartPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$179 at Amazon$249.99 at WalmartFor homeowners who want something stronger than a budget 20V blower without the weight and bulk of a 56V model, the LeafJet lands in a nice middle ground. It has a slimmer body and a forward-weighted feel that makes it easy to guide through smaller spaces such as porches, walkways and tight garden areas. In everyday use, it handled dry leaves and light debris well and felt noticeably easier to maneuver than most 40V blowers.Significantly smaller and lighter than its peers, the LeafJet is easier to store, carry and use for quick cleanup jobs. The front-weighted balance gives it a ready-to-use posture that reduces wrist effort, and the dual-intake design provides respectable power for its size.It didn’t make the final cut because …the LeafJet struggled with wet leaves and heavier, compacted debris during testing. It uses a roller dial rather than a trigger, which makes it harder to shut off quickly – something to keep in mind if you have kids or pets running through the yard mid-cleanup. Runtime is naturally shorter due to its smaller battery packs, and Worx’s 20V/40V PowerShare platform isn’t as popular or widely supported as systems from Ryobi, DeWalt or Milwaukee, which may limit future tool expansion.Weight (with battery):6.4lbsRuntime (on medium setting):28 minutesNoise rating (on medium and max):78 / 88dBAir volume:620 CFMAir speed:165mphBattery platform:Worx PowerShare 20V/40VWorxLeafJet 40V Nitrofrom$179$179 at Amazon$249.99 at WalmartConsider for quick cleanups:Milwaukee M18 Fuel BlowerMilwaukeeM18 Fuel Blower$299$299 at Home DepotPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$299 at Home DepotThe Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower is a durable, contractor-focused tool built for quick cleanup jobs rather than long leaf-clearing sessions. Its compact, rugged design feels immediately familiar if you already use Milwaukee’s drills, saws or outdoor power tools, and in testing it excelled at moving small piles of leaves and general lawn debris. For homeowners already invested in the M18 platform, it’s an easy, cost-effective addition that performs reliably for light to moderate yardwork. Its compact size makes it one of the easiest blowers in this group to store or hang on a wall, and it feels immediately ready for action.It didn’t make the final cut because …the M18 is noticeably less powerful than our top-performing models. It struggled with wet leaves and compacted debris, and the airflow pattern seemed less focused than other blowers we tested. The rear-mounted air intake also occasionally sucked jackets or loose clothing against the intake screen, briefly interrupting airflow. If you’re not already using Milwaukee tools, the M18 platform isn’t the most versatile option for outdoor power equipment compared with Ego or Ryobi.Weight (with battery):8.4lbsRuntime (on medium setting):65 minutesNoise rating(on medium and max):62 / 72dBAir volume:500 CFMAir speed:120mphBattery platform:Milwaukee M18MilwaukeeM18 Fuel Blower$299$299 at Home DepotConsider for DeWalt diehards:DeWalt 60V BlowerDeWalt60V Blowerfrom$329$329 at Home Depot$329 at Ace HardwarePhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The Guardian$329 at Home Depot$329 at Ace HardwareIf you’re already stocked up on DeWalt’s 60V FlexVolt batteries, this is a feature-rich, high-capacity blower that offers a familiar layout, robust construction and enough power for most routine yardwork. In testing, it delivered strong performance on dry leaves and loose debris, and the broad nozzle helped sweep wide areas of lawn and driveway efficiently. Strong, immediate airflow makes quick work of open areas, long driveways and moderate leaf piles, and the large FlexVolt battery provides steady output.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t quite measure up to comparably priced blowers from Ego or Ryobi, so it only makes sense if you’re already invested in DeWalt 60V batteries. The blower becomes notably back-heavy with the FlexVolt battery installed, requiring constant downward pressure to keep the nozzle aimed correctly. DeWalt also places the air intake directly behind the handle, and in testing this design pulled clothing into the screen more frequently than the Milwaukee, interrupting airflow. Combined with its overall weight, these issues make the tool less comfortable for longer sessions or more detailed work.Weight (with battery):12lbsRuntime (on medium setting):26 minutesNoise rating:75 / 80dBAir volume:600 CFMAir speed:125mphBattery platform:DeWalt FlexVolt (20V/60V)DeWalt60V Blowerfrom$329$329 at Home Depot$329 at Ace HardwareWhat you need to know about the best leaf blowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianWhat are CFM and MPH?Manufacturers list airflow in CFM (cubic feet per minute) and MPH (miles per hour). CFM affects how much material a blower can move, and MPH affects how well it can lift debris that’s stuck to the ground.Do those power ratings actually matter?In practice, I found that high numbers don’t always translate into better performance. Most blowers in this guide moved leaves well enough, but the more important factor was how predictable the airflow felt. The best blowers create a wide, predictable air stream that sweeps across a driveway or patio evenly. Others produce a narrow jet that looks powerful but sends debris scattering unpredictably. In many everyday yard tasks, airflow shape and consistency matter just as much as the raw numbers.Do I need a high-powered blower?Not always. During my tests, even mid-range models handled everyday leaf clearing very well. High-powered blowers are most useful for large yards, heavy seasonal cleanups, or clearing debris that has settled into grass or gravel. For smaller outdoor spaces, a lighter, simpler blower often feels easier to manage.How important is weight and balance?A blower’s balance is just as important as its weight. A well-balanced blower naturally angles slightly downward in your hand, putting the tool in a neutral, ready-to-use position. When a blower is back-heavy – a common issue with larger batteries – you end up fighting the tool to keep the nozzle pointed where it needs to go. After 20 or 30 minutes, that small correction becomes surprisingly tiring. Handle shape and weight distribution also made bigger differences than I expected.Because ergonomics vary so widely between models, you should try to pick up the toolin personbefore you buy. Even two blowers with nearly identical weights can feel completely different once you have them in your hand. Hold the blower for a minute or two with the battery installed, which will make it easier to spot awkward handle designs, unbalanced weight distribution, or controls that don’t feel natural.Should I buy a blower that uses batteries I already own?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianIf you already own cordless tools from Ryobi, Milwaukee, DeWalt, Ego or Stihl, staying within the same platform can save money. Batteries are usually the most expensive part of a blower kit, so reusing ones you already own makes the overall cost much more reasonable. Small 18V and 20V batteries have enough juice for quick cleanups such as sweeping sawdust, clearing work areas, or blowing debris off tools.But if you’re buying a blower primarily for lawn and garden work, tool batteries probably won’t cut it. It often makes more sense to choose a blower that’s part of a dedicated outdoor-equipment platform, such as Ego’s 56V or Ryobi’s 40V systems. These batteries are designed with the steady power consumption of outdoor tools in mind and so are the tools.DeWalt and Milwaukee do make big batteries that put their blowers at parity with outdoor brands, but then you have the opposite problem: they’re overkill for everyday cordless tools. Hanging a massive battery on an impact driver or drill changes the balance of the tool and makes it tiring to use.Match your battery system with your intended use.How long should a cordless leaf blower run?In general, a blower should be able to run for at least 20 minutes at a medium setting to be useful for the majority of yardwork and cleanup tasks. But runtime varies widely. Some high-powered models offer excellent performance but drain their batteries quickly at full output. Others maintain steady power for much longer, especially at medium settings. The few blowers that maintained consistent airflow until the final minutes were easier to work with than ones that tapered off early.How loud are cordless leaf blowers?They’re quieter than gas models, but not silent. Some brands, including Ryobi’s Whisper Series, tune their motors and housing to reduce noise levels. During testing, I compared noise by ear at a consistent distance. The differences weren’t dramatic, but quieter models were more pleasant to use for extended periods and less intrusive in tightly spaced neighborhoods.Can a cordless leaf blower clear snow?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianYes, to a point. Snow-clearing wasn’t part of my original testing protocol, but an early-season storm in Colorado gave me a chance to see how each blower handled it. My snow is typically light and powdery, which makes these blowers more effective. Your results may vary depending on local conditions. Cordless blowers can be very effective for clearing an inch or two of light powder off your car or driveway, but anything more than that, and you’re better off reaching for a snowshover for your driveway and a snowbrush for your vehicle.What is the difference between cheap and expensive blowers?Cheaper blowers usually have smaller batteries, less refined ergonomics, and lower airflow. They’re fine for patios, short driveways, and small yards. More expensive models offer stronger airflow, longer runtime, smoother trigger control, and better balance. Those differences become noticeable during longer sessions or when dealing with damp leaves, pine needles or compacted piles.Do I need a trigger?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Josh Patterson/The GuardianPersonally, I would not buy a blower without a manual trigger. A smooth variable-speed trigger makes it easy to feather airflow around gravel, mulch, plant beds and edging. Blowers that relied on dials or mode buttons instead of a traditional trigger felt less precise and were harder to shut off quickly.Cruise control features were more useful than I expected on longer driveways or open lawns, reducing finger fatigue and making big jobs feel less tedious.Embrace the rain with a go-anywhere umbrella built to lastRead moreWhat else should I pay attention to?Air intake placementmatters more than you would expect. Two models with poorly positioned intakes sometimes pulled jackets or shirts against the screen, interrupting airflow at the worst moments.Noise levelsalso varied far more than the specs suggested. Some of the most powerful blowers were quieter than smaller, compact models.Nozzle angleplayed a surprising role as well, since even slight upward or downward tilts changed how much effort it took to guide the air where I needed it.Extra features such asdisplays,mode buttonsandinterchangeable nozzlescan be useful, but they don’t compensate for awkward ergonomics or inconsistent airflow.Josh Patterson is a journalist and editor with 16 years of experience covering cycling, outdoor gear, electronics and other consumer products.

But unfortunately, until now, the beloved franchise’s video games had a track record spottier than her friend Chloe the dalmatian.Some parentstreated Budge Studios’ 2023 mobile game Bluey: Let’s Play! with caution, with its $9.99 monthly subscription and persistent adverts for Budge’s other licensed games. Later that same year, Artax Games’ Bluey: The Videogame was widely criticised on release for its barely two-hour run time, technical problems and $60 price tag. In his review, Australian game critic Luke Plunkett called it“a slapdash cash grab that does the bare minimum”.And released in August this year, StoryToys’s mobile game Lego Bluey offers block-building, minigames and another subscription – this one cheaper and less aggressively advertised. All three games were commissioned by BBC Studios, which co-commissions the show with ABC and handles all of Bluey’s international merchandising and licensing.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningButBluey’s Quest for the Gold Penis the first to live up to the standards that made Bluey one of the most-watched shows in the world. Also commissioned by BBC Studios, it was made in Brisbane by Bluey creator Joe Brumm and Halfbrick Studios of Fruit Ninja fame, making it the first Bluey game made in Australia, the first to involve Bluey’s creator and the last original Bluey story we’re likely to get from Brumm until the 2027 movie.After playing the opening levels of Halfbrick’s take on Bluey, I can say it feels like an actual game; the studio has said it should take about 10 hours to complete, which feels accurate. It is essentially a classic adventure game in which Bluey and Bingo chase their impish dad, Bandit, through a series of magical artworks after he pinches their pen. The game’s design rewards curiosity, exploration and the liberal use of Bluey’s magic wand. Meanwhile, Brumm’s script gets Chilli and Bandit debating how to avoid lawnmower parenting while they concoct the game’s next level.Bluey is so daggy; it’s very Brisbane … you can only truly replicate and extend into the games world if you really understand those nuances.Joey Egger, head of games at Screen AustraliaHalfbrick Studio’s chief executive, Shainiel Deo, was always a strong contender to win Bluey’s video game rights. Hundreds of millions around the world have played Halfbrick games and he and Brumm have been friends since they worked on the game for Brumm’s Dan the Man series in 2016.When Brumm suggested Deo should pitch BBC Studios, other Bluey games were already under way. “It definitely should have gone to an Australian developer first,” says Deo; still, he understands why the BBC went with developers they had worked with before.From the start, doing Bluey proud was Halfbrick’s primary concern. “This game will be ready when it’s ready,” Deo remembers telling BBC decision-makers. “We took on all the risks in terms of funding it, that was on our coin, but I wanted to make a great experience.”View image in fullscreenIn the game, Bluey and Bingo chase their impish dad, Bandit, through a series of magical artworks after he pinches their pen.Photograph: Halfbrick StudiosDeo insisted on an uncertain timeline to allow for exploration and prototyping. Despite footing the bill for delays, Deo feels the process worked thanks to a team driven by passion for their homegrown hero, Bluey, and a deep connection to the Heelers’ contemporary Brisbane lifestyle. “They take a lot of pride in being the first Australian team to work on a Bluey game,” he says.It is another win for the Australian games industry afterAdelaide-made Hollow Knight: Silksong’s immense popularity crashed global storefrontsin September. Aussie developers, still suffering layoffs, have deserved better when it comes to landing their biggest homegrown licences. To date, no Australian developer has released a Mad Max game; even a frankly inexplicable Neighbours racing game was made in the UK.Fellow Australian developer Jason Imms says while the BBC owed nothing to Australia, taking advantage of the local talent that birthed Bluey was “a no-brainer”.Imms, the head of quality assurance at Keywords Studios, says he’s pleased a respected Queensland developer like Halfbrick got a go. “We have so few homegrown franchises, and we have so few opportunities to play with Australian IP in games. Bluey is such a special thing, with such broad reach. It speaks to an Australiana that other Australian media really hasn’t been able to deliver to the rest of the world.”Joey Egger, head of games at Screen Australia, which co-funds Bluey the show but not the games, is delighted Halfbrick got to showcase Bluey’s “unique Australian-ness”. “It’s so daggy. It’s got all the nuances; it’s very Brisbane,” says Egger of the show. “It’s something you can only truly replicate and extend into the games world if you really understand those nuances.”Working on beloved homegrown franchises is an “immense source of pride” for developers, says Egger, who previously produced Wiggles games. “Today’s youth don’t think just TV, just movies, just games,” she adds. “They find an IP that they love and adore, and they will consume it on any platform.”The quality of a Bluey game isn’t just a matter of national pride. Children can be treated as easily fooled customers who will play anything or as gullible marks formanipulative, lucrative business models.Halfbrick Studios has made both “freemium” games (free with ads, with a one-time payment for an ad-free version) and subscription games. Neither model seemed appropriate for Bluey’s young audiences, so Deo returned to the one-time-purchase “premium” model the studio used in the 2000s, before mobile games exploded. “We don’t want to put people on a treadmill where they have to keep grinding to get stuff or pay,” he says. “Ethics is important for me.”Imms, who says his kids quickly tired of Bluey: The Videogame, feels developers owe kids more, not less, than adult gamers. “Do kids deserve better? Of course they do. You could argue they need it more than we do because they’re still growing; they’re still shaping their understanding of the world. Stories that teach them about kindness and care, love and hardship – all those good things that Bluey teaches – are going to be beneficial for them.”Bluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen is out now on iOS, Android on 10 January 2026 and PC and consoles later in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesBlueyAustralian Broadcasting CorporationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mr Trump also boasted of having ended war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He brags of having brought eight conflicts to a close and has just had the US Institute of Peacerenamed in his honour.Yet the truce between Thailand and Cambodia has already fallen apart. Half a million residents along the border havefled renewed fightingand civilians are among at least 27 people killed. Meanwhile, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 200,000 people havefled the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels– days after a peace deal was signed in Washington.On Friday, Mr Trump declared that the two sides had agreed to put down arms again. But theydisagreedand fighting continued over the weekend. Bangkok reluctantly agreed to the July deal because the US wielded tariffs as leverage. Phnom Penh, in the weaker position, was happier for it to intercede. Thailand then accused Cambodia –with good evidence– of laying new landmines in border areas, injuring several Thai soldiers. The conflict reignited in early December, with each side blaming the other.The territorial dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is more than a century old and centred ondisagreements over colonial-era maps. The two countries have clashed before over an ancient temple and seen unrest over who can claim other aspects of heritage. Thailand has also attacked the proliferation ofcriminal online scam centres in Cambodia. What gives the disagreement such potency, however, is that in both countriesnationalist feelinghas been weaponised for domestic purposes. In Cambodia, where the longstanding ruler Hun Sen has given way to his son Hun Manet in a dynastic dictatorship, whipping up anger against its neighbour helps to legitimise a regime that has little to offer its people.In Thailand, the long-running clash between the powerful military and royalist elites and the politician Thaksin Shinawatra, his family and proxies has been key. In August, a courtdismissed his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra as prime ministerfor failing to protect the country’s interests, after a recording of her discussing the border dispute with Hun Sen was leaked. It captured her addressing him as “uncle”, promising to “take care of it”, and denigrating a key military commander – prompting a storm of outrage. It played to political opponents’ claims that the Shinawatra family were happy to sell the country’s interests for personal benefit.The caretaker prime ministerappointed in her steadhas courted popularity by giving the military free rein in its stated aim of crippling the Cambodian army. Ahead of promised elections, the clashes are distracting from governmental woes – including a poor response to deadly floods – as well as positioning the army as national champions.Mr Trump, who predicted that he could settle the renewed conflict “pretty quickly”, wants instant wins and photo opportunities. Leaders who fear alienating him may provide handshakes and promises when pushed to it. But while pressure from powerful external players can help to push the parties in regional disputes to the negotiating table, there is a big difference between quick fixes andlasting peace– as the airstrikes and rocket attacks along the Thai-Cambodian border demonstrate.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In addition, Donald Trumpsaid it was seditiousfor Democratic members of Congress to inform members of the military that they can, and indeed, must, resist patently illegal orders, and theFBIandPentagon are reportedly investigating the members’ speech. Those related developments – the murder of civilians and an attack on free speech – exemplify two of Trump’s principal tactics in his second term. The first involves the assertion of extraordinary emergency powers in the absence of any actual emergency. The second seeks to suppress dissent by punishing those who dare to raise their voices. Both moves have been replicated time and time again since January 2025. How courts and the public respond will determine the future of constitutional democracy in the United States.Nothing is more essential to a liberal democracy than the rule of law – that is, the notion that a democratic government is guided by laws, not discretionary whims; that the laws respect basic liberties for all; and that independent courts have the authority to hold political officials accountable when they violate those laws. These principles, forged in the United Kingdom, adopted and revised by the United States, are the bedrock of constitutional democracy. But they depend on courts being willing and able to check government abuse, and citizens exercising their rights to speak out in defense of the fundamental values when those values are under attack.Trump, who evidently prefers “the rule of Trump” to the rule of law, has launched a two-pronged attack on these principles. The campaign against alleged drug smugglers is an example of the first tactic: declare a nonexistent emergency and invoke extraordinary authorities that would be unacceptable in ordinary times. Ordinarily, police can’t simply kill those they think might be distributing drugs; suspects must be arrested, tried and convicted, and even then they can only be sentenced to prison, not executed. (The death penalty is reserved for crimes involving homicide.) But by declaring that the metaphorical war on drugs is an actual “armed conflict”, and declaring that fishers carrying drugs are “narco-terrorists”, Trump has asserted the power to kill in cold blood – premeditated murder without trial.Using the same rationale, Trump hasinvoked a 1798 law, the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the government during a war to detain or deport citizens of the country with which the US is at war. The last time it was used was the second world war, to detain people of Japanese, German and Italian heritage. The US is not at war today. But Trump has asserted that a Venezuelan drug gang few Americans had even heard of, Tren de Aragua, is at war with us, and used that claim todeport more than 1oo Venezuelansto a notorious prison in El Salvador without hearings of any kind – and in defiance of a court order.Emergency powers have long posed a threat to the rule of law. “Necessity knows no law”, after all. But it’s one thing to invoke emergency powers in a real emergency. It’s another to do so in a trumped-up one. What we are seeing today is the latter. And it remains to be seen whether the supreme court will call Trump’s bluff.The second prong of Trump’s strategy is to neutralize the opposition. The rule of law cannot rely on courts alone. It depends as well on citizens standing up and speaking out, through the institutions of civil society – from non-profit advocacy groups like the ACLU to universities, the media and the professions. Trump has systematically targeted them all. He’s issued orderspenalizing law firmsfor filing lawsuits or hiring associates that he doesn’t like. He’spressured universitiesto clamp down on students’ and professors’ speech. He’s penalized press outlets that don’t parrot his messages, as when heexpelled the Associated Pressfrom the Oval Office press pool for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”, Trump’s preferred rebranding. And he’sthreatened to designate non-profit groupsand foundations as “domestic terrorists”.The United States has a robust civil society. The ACLU, for example, the American version of the UK’s Liberty, has about 2,000 staff members nationwide. American universities are among the best in the world; American media is read across the globe. And US foundations support essential democracy, health and development work throughout the nation. But these institutions are as strong as they are in part because the government has subsidized them – through grants for research, tax subsidies, access to public airwaves and the like. Trump, however, has shown that that support is simultaneously a source of strength and a critical vulnerability. Trump has repeatedly used threats to withdraw government funding or approval as a means to chill dissent. And it has worked, as universities, law firms and corporations that seek to do business with the government have complied with Trump’s wishes – even where it would be illegal for Trump to compel them to act.Universities, businesses and non-profits have eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion training that was perfectly legal, indeed constitutionally protected. They have reduced their engagement in challenges to the administration, hoping that their silence might stave off Trump’s wrath. Universities have agreed to reforms of their internal institutional structures that Trump could not have imposed directly. Nine law firms that settled with Trumpagreed to provide, collectively, almost $1bn of pro bono assistance to causes that Trump supports. Media institutions have also done the president’s bidding, as whenABC suspendedthe late-night talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel, and Paramount, the parent of CBS,paid Trump $16mto settle a frivolous lawsuit he filed objecting to how its public affairs program, 60 Minutes, had edited an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Those who have reached agreements with the administration have done so not because they were obligated to do so, but because they feared the pain the government could inflict by denying funding, withholding approval of mergers or otherwise not providing government support. But if civil society institutions are to perform the essential function allotted to them in a constitutional democracy, they must stand up for their rights, fight for their principles and maintain a bright light on the wrongs of the administration.Courts need to do their part as well. And as difficult as it can be to second-guess the president on questions of “emergency” power, many have. A federal judge in Massachusettsruled unlawfulTrump’s freeze of $2.2bn from Harvard University in retaliation for its political views, andseveral judges have invalidatedTrump’s executive orders punishing his disfavored law firms. Courts have blocked his efforts to send national guard troops to cities like Chicago and Portland, Oregon, and have invalidated many of his cruel immigration enforcement measures. In all, according to a litigation tracker maintained byJust Security, federal courts have issued more than 120 injunctions against Trump initiatives already, and we’re not even through the first year of his second term.But courts can’t act alone. And if citizens duck and cover in the face of Trump’s assault, the courts will not be able to save us. Civil society institutions have been buoyed over the years by federal government support. Now that the government has turned against them, they canstand for freedom and the rule of law, or capitulate to illegal pressure. The choice should be clear.David Cole is the Honorable George J Mitchell professor in law and public policy at Georgetown University and former national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

I’d rather be deportedEmma BeddingtonThe potential demand that visitors to the US hand over their social media records, or even their phones, opens up a world of embarrassmentSun 14 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 14.35 ESTShareAs someone with a child in the US, thisnew Trump threat to scrutinise tourists’ social mediais concerning. Providing my user name would be OK – the authorities would get sick of scrolling through chicken pics before they found anything critical of their Glorious Leader – but what if I have tohand over my phone at the border, as has happened to some travellers already? I would rather get deported.There’s nothing criminal or egregiously immoral on there; I don’t foment revolution or indulge in Trump trolling, tempting as that would be. But my phone does not paint a flattering picture of me. Does anyone’s? Those shiny black rectangles have become contemporary confessionals, and we would like to believe they abide by the same kind of confidentiality rules.There’s ajokey online trendof people posting pictures of themselves weeping, with the caption that their partner checked their phone for infidelity, but found “something much worse” – the next image reveals it’s the calculator app, used for infant-level arithmetic (15-9 say, or 300 x 2). Occasionally, it’s a daft Google search (“quickest way to make money” “how to stop being batshit crazy”) or simplya million open tabs full of weirdness.And this is just stuff that people will admit to (or pretend; some of those sums have to be a joke). What about the rest? In the comments under photographs and videos, women express horror at imagining their ChatGPT prompts orNotes appbeing scrutinised (“I have a note that says ‘If husband cheats, release the crickets,’ and I do NOT want him to question me about it,” one says, which particularly piqued my interest).A cursory swipe would reveal I’ll stare at any number of fit youths slopping yoghurt into bowls to hit their protein goalsAlmost every app on my phone has embarrassing content, even seemingly innocuous ones. My calculator reveals a recent tussle with 16 x 3 and my calendar contains reminders that no functional adult should need. “Check big pears” is arguably reasonable – we all know pears have a five-second window of edibility – but there’s stuff like “Drink water”, “Stand up!” (relics of abandoned attempts at wellness) and “DEODORANT!” – a recent and essential addition after many sweaty days forgetting. YouTube is all videos about the phallic-looking Korean skincare gadget I bought in a moment of self-loathing, but am too scared to use; photos contains selfies that must be destroyed with fire and Netflix reveals that I only watch Manhattan property agents with faces smooth as eggs and five-inch spike heels fighting over luxury beige penthouses.It gets worse: imagining anyone seeing my TikTok “For You” page (where the algorithm offers up what you’ve shown a moment’s interest in, or predicts you’ll like), is unbearable. A cursory swipe would reveal I’ll stare at any number of fit youths slopping yoghurt into bowls to hit their protein goals,have a morbid fear of “overactive traps” (it’s a weightlifting thing) and harbour the delusion that I can learn to do a handstand when I gave up gymnastics aged eight. It’s not a version of myself fit for public consumption.Ready to give up social media? ‘Advice pollution’ might just get you there | Emma BeddingtonRead moreMy phone enabled me to become this idiotic, and now it holds its secrets over me, lurking ominously beyond the lockscreen. I’m certain everyone feels similarly, but it’s hard to prove because no one wants to share what’s in their rectangle of shame. I elicited enough anonymous admissions, though – a daily step count of 60, a food diary that’s exclusively chocolate, photos of facial buboes, pelvic floor exercise prompts – to know none of us would be cool with our phones facing public scrutiny.Yet we’re leaving our vanities and vulnerabilities, our big and little secrets, our precious data, in the hands of tech companies, and that could lead to worse than embarrassment, especially for women. In 2022,a study suggestedthe majority of period-tracker apps share data with third parties;Facebook has disclosed private messagesto assist an abortion prosecution; this year,the UK National Police Chiefs’ Council issued guidanceon searching women’s phones after pregnancy loss.Even my foggy brain, full of shoulder mobility “hacks” and Taylor Swift dance routines, can see that that’s bad. Given that I need digital reminders for basic acts of personal hygiene, I can’t realistically commit to an intellectually rigorous, entirely offline life. But as a bare minimum, in 2026, I’ve resolved to put my darkest, weirdest, worst thoughts on paper.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrivacyOpinionDonald TrumpSocial mediaAppsSmartphonesInternetDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to find courage to oppose TrumpYaqiu WangWhile acting on your moral convictions can be risky, it can also feel profoundly goodSun 14 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareIn the eleven months since Donald Trump took office – during which he has unleashed unprecedented assaults on the checks and balances of American democracy – there has been a wave of warnings and advice from activists, writers and scholars who have either fought against authoritarian regimes or studied them closely. A common thread runs through much of their guidance: Americans, especially those in positions of power, must find thecourageto stand up for what is right, even when doing so carries personal risk.Yet few have addressed the harder questions: how does one become courageous? How much of courage is innate, and how much is learned? And what can we do to help people find the courage to act?I am a Chinese human rights advocate. For 15 years, I have worked alongside many brave individuals inChinawho have stood up to the notoriously repressive Chinese Communist party (CCP). Their experiences have taught me invaluable lessons about fear and courage. If you are a federal government employee wondering whether to resign rather than carry out an order you believe is wrong, an academic debating whether to speak to a journalist about political interference on your campus, or an editor weighing the risks of publishing a story that could draw government retaliation, here are a few lessons I hope will help you.What Rosa Parks can teach us about resistance today | Jan-Werner MuellerRead moreMost people understand that if everyone were to resist together, they could prevail. But they also know that such unity rarely happens and that resisting alone can seem to bring only personal cost, with no visible gain for anyone. I have no easy answer to this classic “collective action” problem, but I can say this: while acting on your moral convictions can be risky, it can also feel profoundly good.Over the years, many people from China have confided in me about a painful dilemma: “If I speak up, I live in fear of being punished by the government. If I stay silent, I live in shame for feeling complicit. What should I do?” Caught between such a rock and a hard place, they feel paralyzed. Yet those who ultimately choose to speak out often tell me afterward that they are glad they did – regardless of whether punishment followed. The act of standing in truth, they say, is deeply freeing and empowering.In late 2022, as protests erupted across China against Xi Jinping’s draconian zero-Covid restrictions, many participants described feeling a sense of euphoria. A young woman in Beijingsaidstanding up for her own dignity was “the most important decision of my life”. Anotherwrote: “It wasn’t until that night that I realized there were so many people who spokeourlanguage, that there were, in fact, so many ofus… braveus.” (The Chinese authorities arrested an unknown number of protesters,laterreleasing most of them while handing down prison sentences to some.)By contrast, staying silent against your conscience can be emotionally draining. It eats away at your self-esteem, dampens your spirit, and stifles your creativity. A common topic at dinner tables among Chinese people living abroad is the struggle to shake off the ingrained self-censorship shaped by an earlier life under authoritarianism. One friend told me that she no longer writes in Chinese because she can’t help but self-censor the moment she starts to type. Even though her English feels clumsy, she said, writing in English gives her a sense of freedom – and that freedom matters more to her than elegant prose.It’s important to remember that Trump’s America is far less repressive than Xi’s China, and Trump’s capacity for retaliation is nowhere near Xi’s. If Chinese people can still feel good about standing up, so can Americans.While it is true that some people are naturally more risk-averse and others more inclined to defy authority, courage can be cultivated through exposure and repetition, much like building a muscle. When people from China ask me how to overcome fear, I often encourage them to take one small step beyond their comfort zone, then see how it feels before taking the next. Never commented on political issues online? Try making a mildly critical post. Never attended a Tiananmen Massacre commemoration abroad? Go to one – wearing a mask if that makes you feel safer. Courage grows gradually through small acts that push the boundaries of fear.Many of the extraordinary human rights activists in China did not start out as “activists.” They were ordinary people with regular jobs, some even indifferent to politics. Their transformation often began with tiny acts: reposting a censored social media message, pushing back when a school administrator dictated what could not be said in class or demanding that the police explain why a relative had been detained simply for doing his job. Step by step, they learned to speak up more boldly and to endure greater reprisals. Each decision – to tell the truth, to refuse to comply, to insist on accountability – expanded their sense of agency.In 2015, the Chinese government disappeared the prominent human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang. Over the next three years, his wife, Li Wenzu – who had not been involved in her husband’s professional life – launched a relentless campaign demanding information about him and calling for his release. She latersaidthe experience left her “no longer resembling my former self”, transforming her from a shy, gentle woman into a committed advocate. Her husband was released from detention in 2020 butcontinued to face harassment.And finally, once you choose to take a stand at personal cost, you may be surprised by how many people – including those you never expected – reach out to express their admiration and support. That kind of affirmation can be deeply rewarding. And courage is contagious. Your act of conscience nudges others toward their own. Even if your actions don’t immediately ignite a wave of change or yield tangible results, your bravery will stay with people. It will become a quiet source of inspiration for them when their own moment of decision comes. Acts of courage rarely vanish; they ripple outward in ways we cannot always see.So, Americans, stand up and fight back!What’s giving me hope nowComing from China, I’ve always deeply appreciated the energy of the American people. They are gregarious and sometimes brash, but also refreshingly non-hierarchical and free-spirited. I think this vitality is rooted in the country’s immigrant character – immigrants are often a self-selected group driven to improve their lives. After so many generations of liberal democracy, those Americans who support it have grown complacent, while authoritarian forces have worked aggressively to disrupt the status quo. But I believe the drift and paralysis many pro-democracy Americans have felt is temporary. Their energy is returning. Creative, determined people will rise from the anti-authoritarian camp, and they will push back with real force.I like Americans – and I believe in them.Yaqiu Wang is a Chinese human rights researcher and advocate.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, a leader of the notorious, government-backed Janjaweed militia that committed genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region from 2003 to 2005, wasjailed for 20 yearslast week by the international criminal court (ICC). He had been found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.Although hundreds of militia were involved, Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, is the first person to be convicted of atrocities in Darfur, now again thescene of terrible violencein Sudan’s civil war. The ICC has charged Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president at the time, with genocide and war crimes. Ahmad Harun, a former minister, faces similar charges. But both men haveevaded arrest.When Iinterviewed Bashir in Khartoum in 2011– he was overthrown in a popular uprising in 2019, after which the army seized power and the civil war erupted – he scoffed at the genocide allegations. His government and its Arab militia allies had fought insurgents, not Darfur’s people, Bashir said. The west was imposing a double standard. He insisted he had done nothing wrong.Speaking in 2008, Harun, whose non-ironic job title was “minister for humanitarian affairs”, said much the same thing. “I have no regrets,” he told me, rejecting an ICC arrest warrant alleging his complicity in up to 200,000 deaths in Darfur as politically motivated. “What I have done was legal, it was my responsibility, it was my duty,” Harun said.Arrogant claims to have broken no laws, to have no case to answer, to be doing your “duty”, go to the heart of a growing contemporary problem: official impunity. Guilty or not, neither Bashir nor Harun believed they would ever face international justice, and so far they have been proved right. In this belief they are no different from Israel’sBenjamin Netanyahu, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, and Russia’sVladimir Putin.This unsavoury trio are variously accused of atrocities by the ICC, the UN and human rights monitors. Each is alleged to have overseen the cold-blooded killing, mistreatment or mass abduction of noncombatant civilians. All three flatlydeny wrongdoing. All claim their actions are justified, no matter what the law, public opinion or simple moral decency may say. All smugly believe they are untouchable.Netanyahu is fighting on multiple fronts to save his career and avoid jail. Like Gaza, his personal reputation is already in ruins. Israel’s prime minister wants his long-running trial in Jerusalem’s district court on fraud and bribery charges to be halted in the “national interest”. He would prefer to prove his innocence, he claims, but in an act of public-spirited magnanimity, to heal the country’s divisions, he says he’sprepared to accept a pardon.The nerve of the man! Netanyahu has persistently, cynically exploited those same divisions to cling to power. Chock-a-block with chutzpah, he is also resisting a full, independent inquiry into his government’sdisastrous security failurespreceding the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks. Opposition politician Avigdor Lieberman, among others, accuses him of orchestrating a “whitewash” to save his skin.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu addresses the Knesset in Jerusalem, 8 December 2025.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAYet it is Netanyahu’s contemptible bid tododge a reckoning with the ICCover Gaza – where his government is accused of genocide – that most dramatically illustrates the pernicious impact of official impunity. Rather than defend himself in court, Netanyahu hides behind Donald Trump’s skirts in Washington or skulks at home to avoid arrest. In Gaza, meanwhile,hungry children continue to suffer– on his orders.If Hegseth, the Pentagon’s new GI Joe action man, swapped his too-tight trousers for a looser fit, perhaps he would feel less bloody-minded. He’s somehow convinced himself that killing dozens of unidentified people on boats in the Caribbean, on unsubstantiated suspicion of drug smuggling, is desirable and legal – and not an unwarranted act of brutality.Various spurious justifications are advanced. The US says it has obtained “intelligence” that proves its claims (though not from Britain, which frowns onextrajudicial killingand is refusing to help). The victims, deemed to belong to “foreign terrorist organisations”, are legitimate targets, it argues. Judges and lawyers can say what they like. For Hegseth, Trump’s foppish hitman, only one man’s opinion matters.Both Trump and he believe they can do whatever they want and no one will call them to account. When a video emerged showing survivors of a US attack beingdeliberately killedin a second strike, members of Congress belatedly started asking questions. But the Pentagon is being less than frank. Who cares? Not his boss. Whatever Hegseth does “is OK with me”, Trump declared last week.The consensus is clear: it’s genocide. Now will international law die in Gaza too? | Raji SouraniRead moreThat’s what impunity looks like. That, right there, is an end to the rule of law. That’s the world’s most powerful state saying it no longer respects basic rules that, imperfectly yet crucially, hold human society together. Off the coast of Venezuela, US forces, killing at will andseizing oil tankers, act just like Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa or Yemen’s Houthi rebels, randomly firing missiles at Red Sea shipping. Impunity spells anarchy.Little wonder that Putin – another thug on the run from the ICC – reckons he, too, can get away with murder. Indeed, in his infamous 28-point Ukraine “peace plan”, Trumpsought immunityfrom prosecution for Russia’s leader. He is also trying todestroy the ICC with sanctions. What kind of example is now set by the US? How can Britain and Europe still pretend it is a like-minded ally, even a friend?Marauding abroad as they do at home, Trump’s lawless, lethal enforcers are the new Janjaweed. And like Ali Kushayb, Trump, Netanyahu, Putin, Hegseth and all the other smirking killers must one day be held to account by a court.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtOpinionInternational criminal justiceSudanGazaUkraineVenezuelaBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

That must changeSun 14 Dec 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 20.17 ESTShareLike all Australians, Bondi isn’t just a place to me, it lives in my heart as a symbol of who we are. As a child I spent many Sundays on the beach at North Bondi life-savers as a “nipper”, and as a former mayor of Waverley council and a local councillor for more than a decade, I have walked its concrete ramparts thousands of times, in all its seasons.In a few weeks, visitors from every corner of the globe will gather there to celebrate Christmas. For locals, it is a place of peace and play. For the small Jewish community, it is also a place where festivals are marked openly and proudly.‘It was a massacre’: how antisemitic terror exploded the peaceful idyll of Bondi beachRead moreSunday night was the first night we celebrated Hanukah (think of it as Jewish Christmas). Over the years, in my official role, I attended many Hanukah ceremonies. They were always occasions of light, joy and belonging. That is why these murders have been so shocking to the peace-loving citizens of Bondi, and especially to the Jewish community.We are a small community. I know some of those who were murdered and injured. This is not an abstract tragedy for us; it is profoundly personal. My heart breaks for the victims, their loved ones, and for all those who experienced the trauma of this act of terrorism. At the same time, I am in awe of the extraordinary heroism of those who stepped forward, at great personal risk, to defend innocent congregants and bystanders.What compounds the grief is fear. In recent years, Jewish people in Australia have felt threatened, dismissed, alienated and, at times, openly vilified. There is a temptation to explain away or qualify this by reference to political differences or debates about events in the Middle East. But that misses the point. Every Jew is not responsible for every decision made by the Israeli government. The right to live free from fear in Australia should not depend on a person’s politics, their views on the Middle East, or their religion.‘We stand with you’: Jewish leaders around world respond to Bondi beach attackRead moreOver the past two and a half years, some groups have deliberately travelled to events in the city, Bondi and the Eastern Suburbs to intimidate the local Jewish community, often with little public condemnation. At protest marches, chants calling for violence against Jews have been heard, reinforcing the message, whether intended or not, that Jewish people are fair game. When racial and religious hatred is left unaddressed and intimidation is tolerated, it creates an environment that emboldens the worst elements of society and leaves Jewish people feeling diminished. Each of us has a responsibility to speak up, and all Australians must come together now to support those of us living in fear.This is not a demand for special treatment. It is a call for basic decency, equal concern and the simple acknowledgement that Jewish Australians are entitled to live without fear, in the same way as any other community.George Newhouse is a human rights lawyer and former mayor of Waverley council in Sydney.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But say you also want to make the world a better place. In that case, maybe the spiritual instruction you need emerges in the famous final lines of George Eliot’s 1871 novel Middlemarch:“… the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”Eliot offers a bracing reality check: the spotlight needn’t be on you for you to live an influential life. A life might be “hidden” – a heresy in the social media era, where everything exists to be shared – yet still well lived. You can shape the course of history, even if you leave little trace on it.This strange idea takes on added significance for me atChristmas. The story of Jesus’s birth is nothing if not “unhistoric” – in the sense of being ignored – even if today we live in the wake of his influence.How can we navigate difficult conversations these holidays? Buddhism offers some guidance | Making sense of itRead moreMaybe it’s cheeky to file Christmas under “unhistoric” when our times pivot on the life of Christ. BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) bear his trace, the latter meaning “the year of the Lord”.But nothing about the birth of Jesus predicted history’s interest in him. He’s born in obscurity on the outskirts of the Roman empire. Angels announce his birth to nobody shepherds. Wise men bring gifts, but it’s a subdued baby shower.Yet from this unhistoric beginning, big things grow. Early Christians reasoned that if God became a baby in Christ, then God, in a sense, shows up in every vulnerable life, and in extremes of distress and suffering (crucifixion, Jesus’s ghastly end, made a point of that). Discussingresearchfor his 2019 novel, Damascus, Christos Tsiolkas glimpsed the staggering implications of this idea:“God is not in the noble Olympian heights. God is not in the palaces. God is actually the man or the woman you step over. That is still revolutionary. That is still hopeful [today].”It’s as though Jesus’ birth also birthed a new way of seeing people. God becoming human enabled people to see how people resembled God. A crazy claim, but it levels the playing field like nothing else. Everyone has dignity. Everyone is regarded as equally valuable.Now, that once incendiary idea feels ordinary. Human rights and the question of human value, we conventionally believe, are a product of the Enlightenment and western reason and have nothing to do with the baby in the manger.The secular mainstream is sometimes shy about Christianity’s influence or (often withgood reason) suspicious of it. No wonder historian Tom Holland felt nervous about publishing his blockbuster 2019 tome, Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind.He knew his was an unpopular thesis: that our belief in the moral equality of all people places us downstream of the Christian revolution. We can’t quite grasp how Jesus made human value unhistoric.Eliot gives us a place to start renewing our attention – by recognising that “the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts”.If nothing else, the line doubles as a fitting description of Christianity’s lasting effect. That it was penned by a woman who shed her Christian faith, but largely retained its ethics, is even more ironic. Whatever you believe, Eliot’s is excellent advice: keep adding to the world’s growing good by small acts. Unhistoric on their own, perhaps, but that still prove generative, spawning possibilities long after.I am left seeking the God who tends to conceal himself in obscure, half-forgotten places: a newborn baby, the rights we claim are universal (but don’t ask why), the neglected moral inheritance of the west. His humility seems surprising, given Christianity’s oftenbrashpublic profile today. Regardless, I see in Christmas an invitation to see differently: God in the social outcast, life on the margins reimagined as the centre of gravity.That way of seeing is the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.Justine Toh is senior research fellow at the Centre for Public ChristianityExplore more on these topicsReligionMaking sense of itChristianityChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

Some of Berlin’s most renowned clubs have long insisted that the camera lenses on their clientele’s phones must be covered up using this simple method, to ensure that everyone is present in the moment and people can let go without fear of their image suddenly appearing on some online platform. As one DJputs it, “Do you really want to be in someone’s picture in your jockstrap?”Venues in London, Manchester and New York now enforce the same rules. Last week brought news ofthe return of Sankeys, the famous Mancunian club that closed nearly a decade ago, and is reopening in a 500-capacity space in the heart of the city. The aim, it seems, is to fly in the face of the massed closures of such venues, and revive the idea that our metropolises should host the kind of nights that stretch into the following morning. But there is another basic principle at work: phones will reportedly either be stickered or forbidden. “People need to stop taking pictures and start dancing to the beat,”said one of the club’s original founders.He is right, but it seems that the zeitgeist might be aligning in that direction anyway. If 2025 has had any kind of defining cultural theme, it perhaps boils down to people’s increasing sense that a life completely beholden to screens is no life at all. To this, add two connected trends: a drop in millions of people’s use of social media, and a rising yearning for experiences that are more authentic. This is not, just to be clear, any kind of suggestion that we are about to reject digital technology and wind the clock back 30 years. But something is definitely up, and it is worth tentatively celebrating.If your interest in posting what you had for lunch seems to be waning and you now look back at a habit of doing so with mild horror, you are not alone. According toanalysiscommissioned earlier this year by the Financial Times, time spent on social media worldwide peaked back in 2022, and fell by almost 10% by the end of 2024. There are notable exceptions to this trend, not least in North America, where growth in use has slowed rather than going into reverse. But that does not quite detract from what the figures tell us. The decline they highlight is most pronounced among people in their teens and 20s. Other data suggests that since 2014, the shares of people who use such platforms to “stay in touch with friends, express themselves or meet new people” have declined by more than a quarter.Some of this, it seems, is driven by the new domination of platforms by high-profile influencers and AI-created “slop”. The bitter, polarised atmosphere of so many online spaces is also relevant. Over the summer, the New Yorker writer Kyle Chayka held out the prospect of what he calledPosting Zero: “a point at which normal people – the unprofessionalized, uncommodified, unrefined masses – stop sharing things on social media as they tire of the noise, the friction, and the exposure.” This, perhaps, is the overlooked context for Australia’sban on social mediafor people under 16: rather than being some authoritarian bolt from the blue, it looks like it may have arrived at a point when people were already changing their habits – and so, rather like modern smoking bans, it may simply end up accelerating a trend that was quietly kicking in anyway.Or look at internet dating, the ultimate example of an attempt to replace the magical and often random nature of human interactions with cold digital logic. Thanks to Ofcom, we know that between 2023 and 2024, Tinderlost 594,000 UK users, while Hinge dropped by 131,000, and Bumble by 368,000. The value of shares in Match Group, the company that owns Tinder and Hinge, has dropped by nearly 80% since the highs they reached during the pandemic. Over the same period, Bumble stock is reckoned to have dropped by 92%. In a letter to its shareholders, Match acknowledged that younger people were seeking “a lower-pressure, more authentic way to find connections”.For some people, that might eventually involve going to a club, putting the obligatory sticker on their phone and seeing what happens. That leads in turn to a somewhat dreamy, utopian suggestion: might some of the people whose chronic internet use has left them isolated and introverted – and sometimes angry and paranoid – sooner or later dance and socialise themselves into something better? That’s pretty much what happened at the end of the 1980s, when the combination of ecstasy and dance music quickly known asacid housebegan to change the cold, atomised country created by Thatcherism with profound consequences. So you never know.As that last observation shows, I am in my 50s, so my nocturnal experiences now tend to involve watching musicians rather than gyrating until 4am. Three years ago, I had the wondrous experience of seeing Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan play live, within months of each other, in very different venues – respectively, a 600-capacity venue in my Somerset home town where McCartney played awarmup gigbefore his headline appearance at Glastonbury, and at a huge indoor arena in Oslo that hosted the first date of Dylan’s latest European tour. At both shows, the audience’s phones were placed in sealed pouches and returned once the show was over. What that resulted in was amazing: the first was full of a shared euphoria that brought tears to my eyes, and the second was gripped by such an awed silence that it felt almost otherworldly.At most other gigs, by contrast, phones and the behaviour they encourage can be a menace. Three weeks ago, I went with my 16-year-old daughter to the Beacon Hall in Bristol to see the Isle of Wight-based sensation Wet Leg, who were brilliant. When they play live, their big hit Chaise Longue is an invitation to everyone present to go nuts. But one woman next to us spent its entire three minutes acrobatically shooting phone footage from every conceivable angle, which entailed repeatedly reaching over those around her, while remaining completely oblivious to how much she was spoiling people’s fun.When people do such things, I sometimes wonder: do they go home and look at what they filmed, and post it somewhere? Or does it just sit on their phones, pointless and unwatched? And will they therefore arrive at the conclusion that seems to be hitting more and more people: that it’s good to stop, to go offline more often, and rediscover the joys of being in the moment with other human beings? A lot more hangs on that question than we might think.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

So let me put those carping critics rightRhiannon Lucy CosslettThe artist’s winning Turner prize entry has been hailed for its life and energy, but to some dissenting voices its challenge to the status quo is hard to stomachSun 14 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 14 Dec 2025 06.07 ESTShareNnena Kalu is an artist. She is also, as of this week, awinner of the Turner prize. Her work – twisting ribbon forms made from old VHS tape, plastic and strips of fabric – has been praised for its “finesse of scale, composition and colour” (the judges), its “emphasis … on the visual, tactile and experiential in art” (Mark Hudson, the Independent) and for being “so full of life and energy … so embodied, so sensuous” (Adrian Searle, this newspaper).As well as being an artist, Kalu also happens to be autistic, has a learning disability and does not communicate verbally as much as many neurotypical people (she is supported by the organisation ActionSpace). These things shouldn’t matter, and perhaps one day they won’t. However, neurodivergent artists have not historically been given much space by the art world, especially not those with learning disabilities. Four years ago, when Project Art Works – a collective of neurodivergent artists – was nominated for the prize, its CEO, Kate Adams, recounted to me howshe was told bya museum professional: “I don’t think it’s right [to have] people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn’t be in the same building.”So this prize for Kalu feels like a powerful moment of acceptance. Having a differently wired brain, a communication difference or a learning disability does not preclude someone from being seen, and lauded, as an artist. Does that mean we are finally moving away from the notion of the capital-“A” artist (a white male “genius”, usually), and embracing the word in all its magical diversity? Along with many autistic people, as well as the people who love them, not to mention anyone else with a wider view of “artist” than the parameters it has historically been given, I find myself hoping that the time has finally come that we can appreciate art in all its myriad, complex forms.Alas, as with much of the discourse around disability and autism in Britain and the US, I find myself inevitably disappointed. For all of the praise that has been heaped on Kalu and the hailing of her win as a historic moment, there have also been a number of depressing responses. “Maddening”, the Telegraph whinged. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times art critic Waldemar Januszczak, who had already beenaffronted by Kalu’s nomination(“I left the room wondering who was right: the art critic judging the evidence? Or the Turner judges showing compassion and widening the definition of good art?”),wore his prejudiceon his sleeve in seeming to suggest that the prize was only awarded out of a sense of pity, as opposed to on the merits of the work:“She has one mode. And cruel as it sounds, it is not the job of art to confuse therapy with talent. Nor is it the task of theTurner prizeto play doctors and nurses or involve itself so flagrantly in the collection of medical brownie points.”View image in fullscreenNnena Kalu, centre, is announced as the winner of the 2025 Turner prize.Photograph: James Speakman/PAHow offensive you find this will vary from person to person. Consideringmy family background, I find his words, on a personal level, quite nauseatingly unpleasant. More important, from an academic perspective, I am struck by the paucity of his vision. To Januszczak, the judges are flying in the face of critical authority. They can only be giving this prize for reasons of charity, compassion and virtue signalling (prejudiced assumptions that neurodivergent artists have long fought against). As an arbiter of “good” and “bad” art, Januszczak is “baffled” by the work. As ever with certain art critics, that bafflement never seems to provoke more profound, interesting questions. What are the limits of my own understanding? What has shaped my personal conception of artistic meaning and worth? Why does some people’s idea of art seem to be wider, and more embracing, than my own?As for art as therapy, well: show me an artist who hasn’t made work as a means of survival, a form of emotional processing or a deep exploration of the meaning of existence?Artis a way for us to seek to understand, or to be understood. But it is not only that. It is the manifestation of our inner worlds. That so many seem to struggle with Kalu’s version of that is, to me, very telling. They highlight her repetitive working processes, the involvement of assistants.‘Nnena Kalu was ready for this – nobody else was’: how her Turner prize victory shook the art worldRead moreIt reminds me of an argument I had with my tutor at university, when I said that I had always believed Andy Warhol (talk about using assistants!) to be neurodivergent. There was something about the compulsive, repetitive way in which he worked, I said. My tutor was annoyed, as though “autism” reduced the integrity, or genius, of the work somehow. That wasn’t what I meant at all. All art is the manifestation of a unique brain, and Warhol’s was no exception.One of the things that you learn when you study the history of art – or at least if you’re thinking about it deeply – is that language has limits regarding visual art. I wish more critics could be humble about this problem. If we are to take as our starting point the insufficiency of verbal or written expression with regard to visual art, then our traditional conceptions start to break down. My belief has always been that art is one soul speaking to another. It doesn’t matter whether that soul spoke 16th-century Italian (Michelangelo), or some extinct paleolithic tongue (whoever made the woman of Hohle Fels), uses less language than some others (Kalu), or modern American English (Jackson Pollock, who nonetheless chose to say little about the “rationale” behind his work). All that matters is that my soul hears, or more specifically feels, theirs.And that, right there, is what really makes an artist.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

Now a new TV version turns up the temperature several notches – but will its stars develop a rivalry of their own?Sun 14 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShare“Aprodigal son story with God as the father,” is how actor Paul Bettany describes Amadeus, the Peter Shaffer play that became a celebrated film in 1984. Both depict the rivalry between Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri andWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a former child phenomenon whose towering talent exposes Salieri as mediocre and stuck in his ways. Salieri, who believes a composer’s gift to be divine, is so affronted by this upstart that he renounces God and sets about destroying Mozart.Now Amadeus has been remade for TV, with Will Sharpe in the title role and Bettany as Salieri. The series, which begins with Mozart arriving in Vienna in a rickety carriage and promptly throwing up in the street, is written byJoe Barton, the Black Doves and Giri/Haji writer known for his leftfield approach to genre TV. Little surprise, then, that Amadeus takes liberties with the classic period drama, injecting it with modern-day dialogue and gloriously anarchic flourishes. While I won’t divulge the details of an early sex scene between Mozart and a young soprano, safe to say you won’t look at a macaron the same way again.Sharpe and Bettany are both talking via video call. From his kitchen in New York – and wearing a T-shirt with the word “Amateur” on the chest – Bettany, 54, is voluble and funny, given to hoots of laughter, while 39-year-old Sharpe, at home in north London, is quieter and more contemplative. Filming for Amadeus took place in Budapest, a city that Sharpe notes “has lots of beautiful performing arts spaces and a strong opera scene, meaning the interior shots could be done there, too”. Less good was that they were shooting in the height of summer in wigs and full period costume. “There was lots of joking about how it was a character choice for Mozart to be covered in sweat the whole time,” he says. “But there was no other way, even in the scenes before Mozart becomes unwell. Someone would come and pat me dry and in about six and a half seconds I would be soaked again.”View image in fullscreenOrchestral manoeuvres … Will Sharpe (centre) as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/Sky UKIf the heat weren’t bad enough, Bettany had to deal with spending five and a half hours in the makeup chair having decades added to his face. As with the film, the story is framed by the elderly Salieri, who has been committed to an asylum, looking back with remorse on his old life. Where the movie has Salieri confessing to a priest, the TV series finds him spilling his guts to Mozart’s widow, Constanze (Gabrielle Creevy). “All the hair that you see on his face and neck is real human hair [applied] individually, so there was nothing comfortable about it,” Bettany recalls. “It was fascinating because beforehand I thought I had an idea of [how to play] old Salieri – or old hairy Sally, as I call him. But there I am in front of the mirror with all this stuff glued to my face and when I started speaking, I realised: Oh God, it’s completely different to what I had in my head. I could push the character so much further.”For the actors, much of the appeal of reprising Amadeus lay in the freedom of having five episodes in which to tell the story. “I think that allowed us the space and bandwidth to explore it from different points of view,” says Sharpe. “We’re still driving the story with Salieri’s manic jealousy, but you get Constanze’s perspective on their lives as well.” Bettany, who made his name in the early 2000s in Gangster No 1 and the medieval comedy A Knight’s Tale, made the move into big-budget TV relatively recently with Marvel’sWandaVision. He says he still finds the frantic schedule of a TV show “baffling … When I get to the end of the day when I’m making a movie, I can think about the day’s work. When I’m making a TV show and I get to the end of the day, I can’t remember how it began.”Sharpe, who is also a writer and director – a decade ago, he directed, co-wrote and starred in Channel 4’sFlowers, about a depressed children’s author – has risen to fame in the era of prestige TV, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance as a wealthy tech entrepreneur in the second series of The White Lotus. For him, the speed of filming “adds to the adrenaline, you just want to keep moving. It can be very helpful to be in a place where you have to be instinctive.”Long before starting the project, both actors knew Amadeus the movie well. Bettany calls it “the last greatMiloš Formanmovie. I don’t have a problem with going back and watching other performances [as research], but I didn’t need to with this. I’ve seen it so many times. If [ours] had been a film, I might have gone: ‘Well what’s the point? It’s already been done.’ But because it was for TV, it felt different.” The Forman movie, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1985, also earned F Murray Abraham an Oscar for best actor. Did that make him a tough act to follow? Bettany shakes his head. “I’m quite practical about these things. There have been lots of great Hamlets, so why not have a new Salieri? And I think he’s eminently relatable. We’ve all had some venal, mendacious, awful instincts and then hopefully not acted on them. It’s quite fun to have the opportunity to just let go of it all and go to war with God.”Salieri wants something that Mozart has, but would Salieri actually want it if he knew what it meant?Sharpe’s approach to playing Mozart was not to think too hard about him as a cultural giant and more as a man who “is literally trying to get through the day”. Even so, he says his entry point was the music, much of which “I was coming to afresh. I had never had my opera epiphany but, making this, I started to understand it. And it is extraordinary. Some of it’s so playful and light and kind of mischievous and dainty. And then in other places, it’s really dark and grand.” Those “seemingly conflicting elements” in Mozart’s music turned out to be a valuable resource, providing insight into the psyche of their creator.To get to grips with the music, Bettany had the advantage of having a son who is a composer and studying for his master’s, and who explained to him that “operas were really composers’ money-spinners. They thought of symphonies as their serious work, and the operas were kind of like the seven-inch [singles].” Bettany’s son was also invaluable in talking him through other aspects of the life of a composer. Mozart is depicted as having a constant musical soundtrack in his head, something that Salieri desperately covets. “So I asked my son: what’s the truth of that? Do composers really have music in their heads?” Bettany says. “And he said he really does. Sometimes he’ll have two competing melodies and he’ll have to write one down, as otherwise his mind is absolute chaos.”View image in fullscreenPassing the baton … Paul Bettany as Salieri and Will Sharpe as Mozart.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/Sky UK LtdAmadeus is primarily about the relationship of Mozart and Salieri of course, making it the ultimate dramatic two-hander. Mozart’s first formal appearance at the court of the music-loving emperor, Joseph II (Rory Kinnear), is in a piano battle where he rips Salieri’s sheet music off the stand, exclaiming: “Oh yuck. Who wrote this?” Asked what sort of preparation goes into a portrait of a relationship powered by antagonism and envy, both actors’ answers boil down to: not much. “It wasn’t like we were conspiring heavily beforehand about how to play it,” says Sharpe. “We had never met before, so we were getting a feel for each other within the scenes, which brought an extra frisson. But I felt like we didn’t need to talk about the dynamic too much. Salieri is devising Mozart’s [downfall] while Mozart is largely oblivious, so there’s a degree to which we’re carrying our own agendas.”Mozart may be oblivious to Salieri’s machinations, but Salieri never ceases thinking about and plotting against Mozart. “On paper,” Bettany says, “Will does lots of scenes without me in them, but every scene that I’m in has Mozart in one way or another. The ghost of him is there.”“The fact is,” Sharpe adds, “that Salieri wants something that Mozart has, but Mozart doesn’t necessarily want it. And would Salieri actually want it if he knew what it meant? In Shaffer’s play and in Amadeus, the film, Mozart is presented as this absolute genius, almost like a superhero of music. But here we had the space to explore it, like: what would that have been like in the day-to-day? What is that in reality? From Amadeus’s perspective, the attention of God feels like a burden. It’s quite painful to have that responsibility.”I  did feel there was room for a more minor-key approach. I wasn’t going into scenes thinking: How am I going to be insufferable this timeMozart’s unravelling is not helped by his drinking and philandering, although it’s Salieri who pushes him over the edge. Following the death of Mozart’s overbearing father, whose approval the young Wolfgang had desperately sought, Salieri begins dressing up as a masked figure whom Mozart believes to be his father’s ghost. I wonder if Sharpe’s performance, especially in Mozart’s final weeks as he despairingly tries to compose a requiem, was informed by his own bipolar diagnosis, which he also knitted into Flowers. “I think it must do obliquely,” he replies, “but I wasn’t really wanting to approach it in an overly academic way. Going mad is not something that’s easy to play, because it’s quite an abstract thing. And so I wanted to approach it scene by scene, figuring out: what is he trying to achieve? Where is he trying to get to?”In Forman’s film, Mozart’s latent instability is signalled by a mercurial nature and maniacal laugh that is deliberately insufferable. But for Barton’s drama, Sharpe says, “I did feel like maybe there was room for a more minor-key approach. Of course, he is insufferable when Salieri or Constanze are experiencing him. But I wasn’t going into a scene rubbing my hands and thinking: How am I going to be insufferable this time?”Rock on, Shostakovich, Handel, Ravel: lives of great composers hit the screensRead moreIt is one of the central ironies of Amadeus that Salieri is simultaneously Mozart’s greatest enemy and his No 1 fan. Bettany may not believe an actor’s gift is God-given, but can he understand Salieri’s professional envy? Has he ever dreamed of bumping off one of his acting rivals?“Well, as Gore Vidal said: ‘Every time I hear of a friend’s success, a little bit of me dies,’” he laughs. “Oftentimes, when you’re working with actors, it feels like a sporting event, like somebody is going to try and beat you at acting, whereas I want to come at it like a team game where we can be more than the sum of our parts. In Amadeus, I felt safe in the knowledge that Will approached it the same way as me. But if he gets all the good reviews and I start feeling a hot hatred towards him? Well, we’ll see what happens.”Amadeus will air onSky Atlantic and Now from 21 December.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPaul BettanyWolfgang Amadeus MozartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks magic, trampoline mayhem and finally getting behind the wheel of a carEmine SanerSun 14 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareIt’s time for a father to have an awkward conversation with his teenage son. No, not that one. This is far worse – Chris is 16 and still believes in Father Christmas. He needs to know the truth: all the presents, the fake snow on the roof, the soot in the grate, it was all his dad. “You’re Father Christmas?” says Chris, astonished. “You bring joy and happiness to billions of children all over the world?”In Finding Father Christmas, Channel 4’s funny and moving comedy, Chris, played byLenny Rush, bunks off school and sets out on a mission with his older cousin Holly (Ele McKenzie) to prove to his sceptic dad that Santa is real. Poring over a photograph taken at a celebrity party, Chris thinks he has identified four people who may have secret links to Santa – Stephen Fry, mathematician Prof Hannah Fry, the space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and SAS: Who Dares Wins star Jason Fox. Finally, he follows clues to a secret secure facility in Milton Keynes and breaks in with the help of a mini trampoline and the magic of television (a bungee cord). “It was terrifying, but so much fun,” says Rush of the stunt. “I feel like if I was offered [to do it] and I said no, I’d kick myself on the way home. I wanted to give it a go and I’m happy I did. But there was an element of fear.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m surrounded by some of the UK’s best comedians – I don’t feel like I have the weight on my shoulders’ … Lenny Rush.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianFar harder to get to grips with were the explanations from the scientists. Explaining how Father Christmas and his presents can pass through solid walls (when there’s no chimney) Fry says “it’s macroscopic quantum tunnelling”. Aderin-Pocock says something about the Alcubierre drive, and the concertina of space and time, to explain how he can do it all in one night. Did Rush understand what they were on about? “Honestly, no clue,” he says, laughing. “But the way they explained things, it was like a story, just mesmerising!”Rush – irrepressibly cheerful, polite and blessed with impeccable comic timing – is speaking over Zoom from a hotel room, where he’s staying while filming the forthcoming BBC comedy The Reluctant Vampire, based on the Eric Morecambe books. Does it feel a pressure, leading a show? “I think because I’m surrounded by some of the UK’s best comedians, I don’t feel like I have the weight on my shoulders. And it’s always a laugh on set.” His first experience of playing the lead role was on Finding Father Christmas, which, being a relatively short shoot, proved a good introduction to being number one on the call sheet. “It was like a taster. I feel like I’m not as tired as I would have been, because of the Christmas film.”Christmas films have always been a big part of his life, and this is “a proper feelgood” one. Not like his brilliant but harrowing roles as Tiny Tim Cratchit in two productions of A Christmas Carol – at the Old Vic in London and in the 2019 BBC adaptation from Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight. In the Channel 4 show, once he found out his dad would be played by James Buckley, one of the Inbetweeners, he was “raring to go”. The Inbetweeners being, of course, essential watching for any teenager. “I’ve been lucky to work with some amazing people, but as soon as I said to my friends ‘James Buckley’, they were: ‘Oh my God.’”When he read the script, was he devastated to read his fictional father admitting the “truth” about Father Christmas? Was it a spoiler to 16-year-old Rush? A perfect comic pause. “It wasn’t.” But he is worried about his young cousin watching it. “I’m not sure if he still believes or not. But to be fair, even if he does watch it, if anything, it proves that Father Christmas is real.”Rush found out the “truth” when he was “nine or 10”, he thinks. He, his dad and younger brother were watching a film downstairs, when he wandered off in search of his mum. “I’ve gone upstairs, and Mum’s on the bed with wrapping paper everywhere, and all these presents.” Rush already had an inkling, “but the devastating part of it was that it was sealed, and I knew. I saw it with my own eyes.” He does a great impression of his mum, who is off camera in the hotel with him – I can hear her laughing. “She goes: ‘Steve, I told you to not let them come up!’ I was a good brother – I didn’t spoil it for Bobby.” He understands Chris’s need to cling on to that belief in magic. “I think the big heart around the show is that in recent years, his mum has passed away, and she just loved Christmas.”View image in fullscreen‘I was raring to go’ … Rush as Chris in Finding Father Christmas.Photograph: Big Talk StudiosWhen I spoke to Rush two years ago, he wasn’t so much a rising star as a dazzling one – that year, he won a TV Bafta for best male comedy performance in the BBC’sAm I Being Unreasonable?and two Royal Television Society awards. Now, he has left school – he passed all his exams, he says, “luckily” – and is a full-time actor. “It’s nice to just be able to focus on what I love. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still shattered.” He laughs. “But I’m having so much fun.”As well as The Reluctant Vampire, Rush has parts in the Apple TV seriesSlow Horses, and in the forthcoming Channel 4 Barbara Taylor Bradford adaptation, A Woman of Substance. “It’s good to be able to show people that I can do different things,” says Rush, who is mainly known for comedy, including performing in sketches and presenting Children in Need. “I love comedy, but I don’t necessarily want to be a comedian or even a comedy actor. I just want to be an actor.” Although Slow Horses is a dark comedy, he points out, “A Woman of Substance was just …” He makes a mock troubled face. “You’d come off set and want to put Finding Nemo on.”In it, Rush plays the younger brother of the younger version of the main character, Emma Harte. His disability – Rush has spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a form of dwarfism – is not part of the plot, which he’s grateful for. “I guess you could say they draw from it a bit, in the sense that it’s about a poor, working-class family [and] it does help to show that struggle, but even then it’s never mentioned. It’s not Frank Harte with a disability or with dwarfism. It’s just Frank Harte.”View image in fullscreen‘I love comedy’ … Rush.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn dramas, especially, he says, “when there is a role for a person with disability, usually it’ll be focused round that. I think it’s changing, definitely, but I don’t really think there’s enough. I don’t mind at all doing a [disabled] role where it helps raise awareness, they’re amazing, but it’s great to have other opportunities. That’s something I’ve been lucky with.” Almost none of his roles were written specifically for a disabled actor; Rush was just the best for the job. But what he brings to TV means a lot, both to him and those who contact him, glad to see themselves represented. “I get loads of people reach out to me. It’s always so lovely and any help I can give, I love to.”Every year seems to get bigger and better for Rush, and 2026 looks to continue the trajectory. If Slow Horses brings the prestige, The Reluctant Vampire, written by Rob and Neil Gibbons (the writing duo behind recent Alan Partridge shows) showcases Rush as a lead actor, among a starry cast, including Asim Chaudhry and Bill Bailey. He will also be learning to drive. “So watch out everyone in Essex,” he says with a laugh. “It will definitely help with independence. A lot of the time, having a disability, you’re told by other people: ‘You can’t do this, can’t do that,’ and I think it’s further proving that I can do. I’m very excited.”It’s nice to just be able to focus on what I love. Don’t get me wrong – I’m still shattered!At home, Rush’s friends are still suitably unimpressed with his stellar career, “not in a bad way. They’re supportive of me, but I’ll go: ‘Guess what I’m doing next?’ I’ll tell them, and they go: ‘Oh, right.’” He likes to get home at weekends during filming. “It’s just nice to have that normality and seeing the dogs.” He smiles. “That sounds bad. I’ve put the dogs before my dad and my brother.” Another perfect pause. “Yeah, seeing the dogs.”It’s time for Rush to get to work – they’re filming outside today, and he won’t be done until 10pm. He’s working right up until the break, so the Rush family Christmas will be quieter this year. “We’re going to have more of a chilled one, just us four.” The tradition that will be observed is the family sitting down to watch a festive film together on Christmas Eve. This year, it will be the one with Rush in it. It must be nice to think of other people, excitement mounting for the big day, tuning in at the same time in cosy, fairy-lighted living rooms across the country. “It’s really lovely,” agrees Rush, all merry and bright.Finding Father Christmas is on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 7.30pm."

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In west London, a line of smartly dressed theatregoers on a street corner enter a building and walk back in time. We pass through tight lamp-lit corridors and arrive in a cavernous hall, with tables laid and lanterns dangling overhead. This is Charles Dickens’ parlour, where he has just finished writing A Christmas Carol, and it’s dinner time.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Great Christmas Feast is an immersive production in which a three-course meal is served while a quicksilver Dickens (David Alwyn) narrates his ghost story about the perils of penny-pinching in the season of goodwill.Immersive theatrehas evidently concocted a tasty festive offshoot that might suit those tired of watching yet another straight-up adaptation of the classic tale.Versions of cabaret and interactive dinner theatre have long existed, including Faulty Towers: The Dining Experience, while Rebecca Frecknall’s West End staging of Cabaret offersfood and drink packagesfor premium ticket holders at the Kit Kat Club. What has been notable in recent years is how sumptuous some site-specific productions are becoming, with an elaborate convergence of spectacle, story, music and food. They certainly solve the conundrum ofwhento eat dinner. Before a show usually seems too early, afterwards too late. “During” is the perfect solution, I think, as I enter this music-filled production, which is in its eighth year.View image in fullscreenGhosts of Christmas repasts … The Great Christmas Feast.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMy dinner companion and I have come hungry, and we are not kept waiting. My welcome drink is a mix of non-alcoholic cider, chestnut cordial, ginger and spice tinctures. A starter is served with period newspaper decor and rustic-looking mains – roast duck or pithivier of shiitake and king oyster mushrooms for vegetarians like me along with lovely trimmings (mulled red cabbage, spiced parsnip puree). It is a hearty plate of food followed by Christmas pudding, and in keeping with its period setting (archives and historical manuals are scoured by the production company, The Lost Estate, under the executive chef Ashley Clarke, previously of the Gordon Ramsay Group).The audience have been advised to dress up, and there are top hats, waistcoats, ruffled dresses and feathered fascinators all around. My dinner companion has rocked up in sweatshirt and trainers and now tries to pass herself off as a Victorian ragamuffin.The story is divided into distinct acts, told between courses around the room and on a central platform in the round, sometimes stopping at a cliffhanger. A few diners are enlisted to read a short exchange of dialogue from a script, and are clearly tickled to be asked.View image in fullscreenFull command of the material …David Alwyn in The Great Christmas Feast.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAlwyn is charismatic, playful and in full command of the material, and there is pin-drop silence as he performs. Three versatile musicians around him (Guy Button, Beth Higham-Edwards and Kieran Carteron) play string instruments and percussion. There are lovely minimalist elements too – the three Christmas spirits are cleverly evoked, surprises come from different corners of the room. It is a feat that the production manages to make such a familiar tale newly dangerous and its message of charity feels genuine.When immersive theatre works, there is nothing quite like it. But numerous elements need to align: you might get a great show but bad food or vice versa, which is sadly the case with The Nutcracker Noir, produced by SecretTheatrein east London. Billed as a reimagining of Tchaikovsky’s classic “with a twist”, it has some characters from ETA Hoffmann’s original story but without a cohesive or compelling narrative around them.View image in fullscreenElaborate confection …The Nutcracker Noir.Photograph: Mark SeniorWe are initially led into a series of rooms to be introduced to some of the characters. There is ethereal magician Eldar (Christopher Howell); Frank Zane (Jairus McClanahan), the nattily dressed son of club owner George (David Michael Johnson); and protagonist Clara (Anita Nicole), who stands on a dais in an elaborate confection of pink net, tutu, hoops and diamante.The rooms certainly evoke a fantasy realm, with heady swirls of light and projection. Tonight is the grand re-opening of Zane’s club and Clara has orchestrated the show we are about to see. A critic called Madame Zel (Jessica Alonso) is here to review it.The characters are beautifully, flamboyantly dressed – coloured wigs, ruffs and fishnets along with Dangerous Liaisons-style aesthetics. But the imagination poured into these costumes outweighs the drama itself. Adapted by Richard Crawford, who co-directs with Gary Lloyd, the barely fleshed out story has tenuous nods to the original Nutcracker tale, along with song and dance.The central stage and dining area is impressive all the same, an opulent pop-up dining room with chandeliers and disco lights. Frustratingly, performers continue with intros and warm-ups for too long. The food is slower to arrive in this show but it is beautifully presented and tasty too. Again it is served in intervals, between performances, with champagne, cocktails and mocktails flowing generously. The five-course meal is created by Jenny McNeill (from immersive dining pioneers Gingerline and Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck). It begins with a seasoned, flavoursome butter and sourdough, and proceeds with pretty looking dishes full of invention, such as nori and brown sugar-cured trout and the most gorgeous mid-winter salad featuring slivers of sweet potato and pickled cranberries.View image in fullscreenFlowing generously … The Nutcracker Noir.Photograph: Mark SeniorThe ensemble finally begin their floor show. It’s not the finest; there are backing-dancer moves to club beats and covers of Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World, David Bowie’s Changes and the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York. Clara narrates her life story, which has a strange incestuous revelation at one point, and feels unsatisfyingly thin and incoherent. Before pudding is served, we are led out into a room where Madame Zel tells us how much she is enjoying the stage show. So much so that we must help her write a letter to Clara, telling her so. It galls, to be railroaded into critical praise.The couple beside me, who are fans of dining cabaret nights, tell me that they bought half-price tickets and still feel let down by the unfolding experience. But there are plenty of others who are enjoying it. Many are up on their feet now, some dancing. An announcement tells us that a man has just proposed to his girlfriend. Cheers all round. The room is embracing the mood, and exudes office party vibes. Have the cocktails gone to people’s heads? A conga starts up around us. Our waitress is leading it and doing a vigorous job of getting people on their feet. “I hope she’s paid commission for that,” says my friend.While the room congas to Sister Sledge’s We Are Family, we eat our pudding, which is a baked Basque cheesecake with sugar plum coulis. It is smooth, light, utterly delectable – the highlight and consolation of this bizarre hybrid entertainment. And there lies the sugared nub of high-end dining theatre: if the show itself is best forgotten, there will always be the cheesecake.The Great Christmas Feastruns until 4 January.The Nutcracker Noirruns until 21 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChristmas showsFoodChristmas food and drinkImmersive theatreCabaretfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And by that I mean the cooking channels, where it’s currently full-on re-run time.Nigel Slater’s 12 Tastes of Christmas, anyone? That episode of Fanny Cradock at Christmaswhen she folds mincemeatinto an omelette? I defy anyone to watch my own personal favourite, 2017’sNigella: At My Table, Christmas specialand feel anything but drunk on yuletide bonhomie. Or just drunk, considering our Nigella’s first recipe is a massive Christmas vodka martini featuring vodka, raspberry liqueur and enough crème de cacao blanc to stun a reindeer. Later, she whips up a no-churn brandy and salted caramel ice-cream and souses some red cabbage with cranberries. Heaven.I won’t make a single one of these recipes, though; I’m just here to gawp. Behold, my Christmas angel, utterly resplendent in chic, countryside garb and ambling about her fairylight-strewn cottage (even though it’s actually a TV set in Elstree with a BBC snow machine turned up to 11). Ooh, devilled eggs and duck à l’orange? I should make those! (Spoiler: I won’t.)But whether or not we make these Yuletide recipes, all these festive specials by Nigella, Jamie, Nigel, Keith and Fanny provide a sterling service to the stressed home cook. In theCapital Floyd: Christmas Specials from 2000, Keith isn’t remotely stressed by a 12-pound turkey with giblets or a gravlax starter for nine. Yes, perhaps that’s because he’s been glugging Chateau Lafite Rothschild since 9am, but no one can accuse our man Floyd of an iota of festive fluster.Tom Kerridge Cooks Christmas, meanwhile, is another delight in which he rolls his turkey into kievs with sage butter, mulls cider and whips up some Christmas pud ice-cream. Tom doesn’t so much as break a sweat, and it’s all clearly completely doable with a bit of pre-thought, a good spud peeler and some elbow power! It’s all in the planning, he says.Obviously, the tinsel-covered elephant in all of these rooms – and the one that’s never, ever mentioned – is that all these Christmas specials were very pre-planned. So much so, in fact, that they were recorded all the way back in April, with a cast of at least 25 researchers, producers, home economists, food stylists and lighting technicians all working for weeks to ensure that Nigella’s cottage is so spectacularly seasonal that we go all misty-eyed while watching the woman whip meringue into snowy peaks.And that’s the true power of Christmas food telly. You can do this all by yourself, suggests Rick Stein on hisCornish Christmasin 2010 while he wrestles a goose into the Aga and even makes time to roam the streets of Port Isaac and wassail with a bunch of merry fishermen. Except Rick didn’t do any of this on his own; instead, some poor researcher spent weeks tearing her hair out trying to get hold of an organic goose, festive lanterns and suitable salty seadogs to sing carols in the middle of spring.We don’t mind the smoke-and-mirror nature of these shows, because they provide a counselling service at a stressful timeThe magic is in the make-believe – we don’t mind the smoke-and-mirror nature of these shows, not least because they provide a valuable counselling service at a very stressful time. Has your child been given the part of the barn in the nativity play and you’ve been asked to provide a costume? Has your corporate mince pie jingle-and-mingle been scheduled, and is the dress theme “wacky”? Are you stoically accepting that your Christmas will actually be a 650-mile round trip on various British motorways to placate parents-in-law and involve dining mostly in aWild Bean Cafe?Are you, perhaps, experiencing a dearth of Christmas spirit? In which case, have you considered taking yourself off to bed with a hot-water bottle, a fresh box of Waitrose stollen slices and a laptop playingNigella’s Amsterdam Christmasin which our heroine, doing the Lord’s work, is despatched to the Dutch capital to swear blind that she loves those Scandi-themed Christmas markets? Rarely has one woman looked so content in a liquorice shop, or making speculaas cookies in the shape of townhouses or eating fruit bread from a faux log cabin stall. “Amsterdam is the Venice of the north,” Nigella tells us in all seriousness, as if that’s a sentence that anyone has ever really said. But we don’t care, because there’s a sumptuous no-bake advocaat and ginger layer cake that you’d need a heart as cold as Frosty the Snowman’s not to love.These festive television cooking shows don’t remotely prepare us forChristmas, but to me they are better even than Christmas itself. All of the sparkle, none of the stress. My oven remains switched off and my shopping list still unticked, but my heart is already full to bursting.Grace Dent is judge and co-presenter of finals week forBBC One’s Celebrity MasterChefon Tuesday 15 December and Friday 19 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioGrace Dent on restaurantsFoodTelevisionChristmasChristmas food and drinkChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what unites them – and is there a formula for this type of success?Emma LoffhagenSun 14 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareThere is a particular kind of literary deja vu that strikes sometimes. Seemingly out of nowhere, the same book starts appearing across multiple social media feeds. On the bus, you’ll spot two copies of the same title in one day. A friend says, “Have you read this yet?”, to which you respond, “Someone was just telling me about it the other day.”These are the sleeper hits that seem to materialise without warning. They are not stacked high on the new release tables. They are books that, for one reason or another, have slipped their original timelines and found a second, often more powerful life.For a long time, the lifecycle of a book followed a similar ritual: publication-week fanfare, a few reviews and festival appearances, and then a slow fade unless garlanded with awards. But today’s sleeper hits emerge from an alchemical combination of influences: online enthusiasm, translation, design, political mood, bookseller advocacy and sheer serendipity.Perhaps the standout example from this year is the runaway success of Jacqueline Harpman’s dystopian feminist novellaI Who Have Never Known Men. Originally published in French in 1995, it follows a girl imprisoned underground with 39 other women, raised in captivity, then released into a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape she must try to make sense of. It was translated into English in 1997 and was a marked failure in both markets. The English version was left to languish under the (decidedly worse) title The Mistress of Silence, and global sales were at one or two per year.It’s tempting to imagine sleeper hits as miraculous accidents, but the machinery underneath is increasingly deliberateFast forward three decades, and the book has sold 275,000 copies worldwide this year, a 143% jump on 2024. It has sold 75,000 copies in the UK alone – more than double last year’s figure. It has appeared on themust-read lists of Service95, a book club and website set up by Dua Lipa, and is one of the buzziest titles on TikTok.Its renaissance was a mixture of luck and strategy. Its publisher, Vintage Classics, reissued the novel in English in 2019 after a canny executive made the case for it. The new version was repackaged, retranslated and had its original title restored.Part of its success was timing. As Nick Skidmore, publishing director at Vintage, explains, the reissue came “in the wake of Trump’s inauguration … at that time The Handmaid’s Tale and dystopia more generally were selling”. Harpman’s book tapped into that bewilderment, Skidmore says: “A lot of people don’t know where we are, or how we got to this place, and were looking to fiction to help explain that.”A large factor was also its retranslation. Ros Schwartz, the book’s translator, was acutely aware that her first translation in the 1990s had missed the narrator’s voice. Much of it was written in esoteric, literary language, which didn’t chime with the experience of the callow protagonist.“I realised I had translated the words and not the voice,” she says. She stripped out “Latinate words” that had lifted the prose into an overly formal register and restored contractions, which had been missing entirely.In fact, a striking number of recent word-of-mouth successes have been translated works. Translation can crack open a book’s potential, giving it a new voice and therefore a new audience.Perfection – Vincenzo Latronico’s slim, wry novel about an aspirational creative-class couple documenting (and slowly warping) their lives through the pursuit of aesthetic “perfection” – is one such example. Published in Italian in 2022, the book didn’t take off at home; it was only once Fitzcarraldo Editionspublished it in English in Februarythis year (translated by Sophie Hughes) that the phenomenon began. Suddenly, the book was everywhere, appearing in every carefully photographed bedside stack and “April Reads” carousel, becoming the unofficial book of Instagram – and it went on to be shortlisted for the International Booker.Latronico recalls that in the first weeks after the book came out in English, his publisher sent him anInstagramstory from “a famous literary figure recommending my book”. It was an audience Fitzcarraldo “does not usually reach”, his publisher told him. He describes the uncanny experience of being read predominantly in translation. “I honestly think the English translation is better than the Italian version,” he says of Hughes’s rendering. This has produced a “strange position” in which “the majority of my readers are not from the culture I am from”.He believes that this cultural distance is partly why the book exploded in London and New York. For Italians or those outside big cities in Europe, the lifestyle he portrays is “not that common, it is quite exotic”. For Berliners, it felt too familiar. But for anglophone creative-class readers, it struck the sweet spot of recognition and distance. “It has now sold more copies in specific London bookshops than in the whole of France, for example,” says Latronico.Not all trending hits are bleak or skewering satires – some are buoyed up by the desire for refuge. Mary Mount, publisher at Picador, believes the global rise of Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s Before the Coffee Gets Cold series (translated by Geoffrey Trousselot) is rooted in escapism. The books, set around a small Tokyo cafe where customers can travel back in time for the duration of a single cup of coffee, have built a devoted cult following since publication, selling around the world and spreading steadily through online reader communities.“Kawaguchi has created a world you want to return to,” Mount says. These are “cosy, comforting” titles – exactly what many readers want. The series has now sold more than 1m copies worldwide, and Before the Coffee Gets Cold has been the bestselling Japanese book in translation for three years in a row. Sales quadrupled in 2022, partially helped by aTikToktrend of people reading the series with a coffee that has helped to boost sales in international markets, according to its publisher.Design and the physicality of books matter here, too. In a video-first online ecosystem, content creators know that an aesthetically pleasing cover will drive clicks, and arresting covers are also more likely to make it to Instagram feeds. “They are beautiful physical books in both hardback and paperback,” Mount says, “and we invest a lot in how the books look and feel, because readers show their copies and discuss the books on social media.”The role of Fitzcarraldo’s trademark branding – the minimalist Klein blue cover – was undeniable in the success of Perfection, too. “The book benefited immensely from Fitzcarraldo’s vibe and reputation,” Latronico says. Their titles are often a badge of cultural capital on social feeds and in tote bags, an irony not lost on Latronico. “The book is about things that look good on Instagram, and it has become a thing that looks good on Instagram itself.”The rebranding of I Who Have Never Known Men shows this process in action. The newcover by Anna Morrisonis, Skidmore says, “already somewhat iconic” and helped position the book as “a strange, mesmerising and beautiful novel”.It’s tempting to imagine sleeper hits as miraculous accidents: a lone reader praising a book, then a chain reaction of friends pressing copies into hands. But the machinery underneath is increasingly deliberate.Bookshops play a crucial role, says Bea Carvalho, head of books at Waterstones. When a book begins to stir, Waterstones can “ensure that we are part of the conversation”, placing it in more stores. Sometimes, she notes, “this can start with one individual, sometimes with a splashy pre-publication buzz”, but either way, “booksellers are now increasingly good at harnessing it”.Meanwhile, in recent years, a number of publishing houses and imprints have created dedicated programmes for unearthing forgotten classics. “There’s an art to it,” says Skidmore. “You have to resurface the right book at the right time. My desk is full of lists of books that I know could and should find new readers, but they all need to wait patiently for the right set of circumstances – be that a publicity hook, a design trend, a celebrity or influencer endorsement – to come along, or be engineered successfully.”If there is one constant across these stories, it’s unpredictability. “There’s no formula for success,” Schwartz says. Latronico is similarly sceptical. “I had zero expectations when I wrote this book,” he admits. “I’m trying to remember that this kind of thing doesn’t happen twice.”Explore more on these topicsBooksSocial trendsFictionFiction in translationMarketing & PRBooksellersTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Divas, of course, are used to leaping from castle walls or being swept away in avalanches but seldom is a singer required to be swallowed whole by a monstrous gourmand. Payne plays June Spoon, the vociferous host of a TV cookery programme, and whether or not she will be “passed” or, alas, be turned into excrement is the 11th-hour dilemma in this frankly bonkers show.The idea was cooked up (pardon the pun) back in 2008 when Irish composer David Fennessy and director Nicholas Bone hooked up withDavid Shrigley, the visual artist famous for his distinctive, darkly humorous line drawings and witty captions. Described as “a sort-of opera,” it premiered at Glasgow’s Tramway in 2011.Shrigley considers life with its mundane cruelties and responds with a scabrous wit and deadpan irreverence. In the opera, June and her hapless assistant Phillip Fork, plan a slap-up meal for the reputedly baby-eating Mr Granules. The real heroes, however, are the foodstuffs: a trio of terrified tubers, a manic-depressive egg and a banana convinced of his superiority as an exotic fruit compared with mere root vegetables. The cast is completed by a psychotic butcher and a dancing turd.View image in fullscreenOn air … hosts Amy J Payne as June Spoon and Xavier Hetherington as Phillip Fork, centre, with  Frazer Scott’s Mr Egg and Mark Nathan’s Banana.Photograph: Tom ArberFennessy’s score, played by an onstage chamber orchestra of 11 all dressed as chefs, held the attention throughout. Rooted in 20th-century modernism – at its most macabre, Birtwistle’sPunch and Judysprang to mind – he wasn’t averse to trotting out a tune here and there or even purloining Für Elise. Motoric rhythms, caustic strings and the hiss of sharpening knives all played their part, as did wah-wah trombone, chamber organ, harp and a kitchen drawerful of percussion. Opera North music director Garry Walker kept things tight, especially important given the orchestra was frequently required to sing and shout.Bek Palmer’s set complete with table, counter and shiny red fridge complemented the playful costumes, designed by Shrigley in his signature style. With their tiny eyes and quivering slits for mouths, the doomed vegetables were surprisingly moving amid the general air of lunacy. The silent Mr Granules, a cross between a waddling ogre and a gluttonous businessman, was a hoot. The resourceful Bone moved his pieces around the board with a cool efficiency.Payne worked tirelessly as Spoon, pumping out the decibels each time she hurled forth the word “soup”. She was well paired with Xavier Heatherington, who slipped effortlessly in and out of head voice as the querulous Fork. Mark Nathan was an authoritative Banana with Peter Van Hulle a curiously disturbing Butcher. Stealing the show, though, was Frazer Scott doubling as Mr Egg and the delightfully lavatorial Shit.At Howard Assembly Room, Leeds, until 21 DecemberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera NorthDavid ShrigleyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But unfortunately, until now, the beloved franchise’s video games had a track record spottier than her friend Chloe the dalmatian.Some parentstreated Budge Studios’ 2023 mobile game Bluey: Let’s Play! with caution, with its $9.99 monthly subscription and persistent adverts for Budge’s other licensed games. Later that same year, Artax Games’ Bluey: The Videogame was widely criticised on release for its barely two-hour run time, technical problems and $60 price tag. In his review, Australian game critic Luke Plunkett called it“a slapdash cash grab that does the bare minimum”.And released in August this year, StoryToys’s mobile game Lego Bluey offers block-building, minigames and another subscription – this one cheaper and less aggressively advertised. All three games were commissioned by BBC Studios, which co-commissions the show with ABC and handles all of Bluey’s international merchandising and licensing.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningButBluey’s Quest for the Gold Penis the first to live up to the standards that made Bluey one of the most-watched shows in the world. Also commissioned by BBC Studios, it was made in Brisbane by Bluey creator Joe Brumm and Halfbrick Studios of Fruit Ninja fame, making it the first Bluey game made in Australia, the first to involve Bluey’s creator and the last original Bluey story we’re likely to get from Brumm until the 2027 movie.After playing the opening levels of Halfbrick’s take on Bluey, I can say it feels like an actual game; the studio has said it should take about 10 hours to complete, which feels accurate. It is essentially a classic adventure game in which Bluey and Bingo chase their impish dad, Bandit, through a series of magical artworks after he pinches their pen. The game’s design rewards curiosity, exploration and the liberal use of Bluey’s magic wand. Meanwhile, Brumm’s script gets Chilli and Bandit debating how to avoid lawnmower parenting while they concoct the game’s next level.Bluey is so daggy; it’s very Brisbane … you can only truly replicate and extend into the games world if you really understand those nuances.Joey Egger, head of games at Screen AustraliaHalfbrick Studio’s chief executive, Shainiel Deo, was always a strong contender to win Bluey’s video game rights. Hundreds of millions around the world have played Halfbrick games and he and Brumm have been friends since they worked on the game for Brumm’s Dan the Man series in 2016.When Brumm suggested Deo should pitch BBC Studios, other Bluey games were already under way. “It definitely should have gone to an Australian developer first,” says Deo; still, he understands why the BBC went with developers they had worked with before.From the start, doing Bluey proud was Halfbrick’s primary concern. “This game will be ready when it’s ready,” Deo remembers telling BBC decision-makers. “We took on all the risks in terms of funding it, that was on our coin, but I wanted to make a great experience.”View image in fullscreenIn the game, Bluey and Bingo chase their impish dad, Bandit, through a series of magical artworks after he pinches their pen.Photograph: Halfbrick StudiosDeo insisted on an uncertain timeline to allow for exploration and prototyping. Despite footing the bill for delays, Deo feels the process worked thanks to a team driven by passion for their homegrown hero, Bluey, and a deep connection to the Heelers’ contemporary Brisbane lifestyle. “They take a lot of pride in being the first Australian team to work on a Bluey game,” he says.It is another win for the Australian games industry afterAdelaide-made Hollow Knight: Silksong’s immense popularity crashed global storefrontsin September. Aussie developers, still suffering layoffs, have deserved better when it comes to landing their biggest homegrown licences. To date, no Australian developer has released a Mad Max game; even a frankly inexplicable Neighbours racing game was made in the UK.Fellow Australian developer Jason Imms says while the BBC owed nothing to Australia, taking advantage of the local talent that birthed Bluey was “a no-brainer”.Imms, the head of quality assurance at Keywords Studios, says he’s pleased a respected Queensland developer like Halfbrick got a go. “We have so few homegrown franchises, and we have so few opportunities to play with Australian IP in games. Bluey is such a special thing, with such broad reach. It speaks to an Australiana that other Australian media really hasn’t been able to deliver to the rest of the world.”Joey Egger, head of games at Screen Australia, which co-funds Bluey the show but not the games, is delighted Halfbrick got to showcase Bluey’s “unique Australian-ness”. “It’s so daggy. It’s got all the nuances; it’s very Brisbane,” says Egger of the show. “It’s something you can only truly replicate and extend into the games world if you really understand those nuances.”Working on beloved homegrown franchises is an “immense source of pride” for developers, says Egger, who previously produced Wiggles games. “Today’s youth don’t think just TV, just movies, just games,” she adds. “They find an IP that they love and adore, and they will consume it on any platform.”The quality of a Bluey game isn’t just a matter of national pride. Children can be treated as easily fooled customers who will play anything or as gullible marks formanipulative, lucrative business models.Halfbrick Studios has made both “freemium” games (free with ads, with a one-time payment for an ad-free version) and subscription games. Neither model seemed appropriate for Bluey’s young audiences, so Deo returned to the one-time-purchase “premium” model the studio used in the 2000s, before mobile games exploded. “We don’t want to put people on a treadmill where they have to keep grinding to get stuff or pay,” he says. “Ethics is important for me.”Imms, who says his kids quickly tired of Bluey: The Videogame, feels developers owe kids more, not less, than adult gamers. “Do kids deserve better? Of course they do. You could argue they need it more than we do because they’re still growing; they’re still shaping their understanding of the world. Stories that teach them about kindness and care, love and hardship – all those good things that Bluey teaches – are going to be beneficial for them.”Bluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen is out now on iOS, Android on 10 January 2026 and PC and consoles later in 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesBlueyAustralian Broadcasting CorporationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And by that I mean the cooking channels, where it’s currently full-on re-run time.Nigel Slater’s 12 Tastes of Christmas, anyone? That episode of Fanny Cradock at Christmaswhen she folds mincemeatinto an omelette? I defy anyone to watch my own personal favourite, 2017’sNigella: At My Table, Christmas specialand feel anything but drunk on yuletide bonhomie. Or just drunk, considering our Nigella’s first recipe is a massive Christmas vodka martini featuring vodka, raspberry liqueur and enough crème de cacao blanc to stun a reindeer. Later, she whips up a no-churn brandy and salted caramel ice-cream and souses some red cabbage with cranberries. Heaven.I won’t make a single one of these recipes, though; I’m just here to gawp. Behold, my Christmas angel, utterly resplendent in chic, countryside garb and ambling about her fairylight-strewn cottage (even though it’s actually a TV set in Elstree with a BBC snow machine turned up to 11). Ooh, devilled eggs and duck à l’orange? I should make those! (Spoiler: I won’t.)But whether or not we make these Yuletide recipes, all these festive specials by Nigella, Jamie, Nigel, Keith and Fanny provide a sterling service to the stressed home cook. In theCapital Floyd: Christmas Specials from 2000, Keith isn’t remotely stressed by a 12-pound turkey with giblets or a gravlax starter for nine. Yes, perhaps that’s because he’s been glugging Chateau Lafite Rothschild since 9am, but no one can accuse our man Floyd of an iota of festive fluster.Tom Kerridge Cooks Christmas, meanwhile, is another delight in which he rolls his turkey into kievs with sage butter, mulls cider and whips up some Christmas pud ice-cream. Tom doesn’t so much as break a sweat, and it’s all clearly completely doable with a bit of pre-thought, a good spud peeler and some elbow power! It’s all in the planning, he says.Obviously, the tinsel-covered elephant in all of these rooms – and the one that’s never, ever mentioned – is that all these Christmas specials were very pre-planned. So much so, in fact, that they were recorded all the way back in April, with a cast of at least 25 researchers, producers, home economists, food stylists and lighting technicians all working for weeks to ensure that Nigella’s cottage is so spectacularly seasonal that we go all misty-eyed while watching the woman whip meringue into snowy peaks.And that’s the true power of Christmas food telly. You can do this all by yourself, suggests Rick Stein on hisCornish Christmasin 2010 while he wrestles a goose into the Aga and even makes time to roam the streets of Port Isaac and wassail with a bunch of merry fishermen. Except Rick didn’t do any of this on his own; instead, some poor researcher spent weeks tearing her hair out trying to get hold of an organic goose, festive lanterns and suitable salty seadogs to sing carols in the middle of spring.We don’t mind the smoke-and-mirror nature of these shows, because they provide a counselling service at a stressful timeThe magic is in the make-believe – we don’t mind the smoke-and-mirror nature of these shows, not least because they provide a valuable counselling service at a very stressful time. Has your child been given the part of the barn in the nativity play and you’ve been asked to provide a costume? Has your corporate mince pie jingle-and-mingle been scheduled, and is the dress theme “wacky”? Are you stoically accepting that your Christmas will actually be a 650-mile round trip on various British motorways to placate parents-in-law and involve dining mostly in aWild Bean Cafe?Are you, perhaps, experiencing a dearth of Christmas spirit? In which case, have you considered taking yourself off to bed with a hot-water bottle, a fresh box of Waitrose stollen slices and a laptop playingNigella’s Amsterdam Christmasin which our heroine, doing the Lord’s work, is despatched to the Dutch capital to swear blind that she loves those Scandi-themed Christmas markets? Rarely has one woman looked so content in a liquorice shop, or making speculaas cookies in the shape of townhouses or eating fruit bread from a faux log cabin stall. “Amsterdam is the Venice of the north,” Nigella tells us in all seriousness, as if that’s a sentence that anyone has ever really said. But we don’t care, because there’s a sumptuous no-bake advocaat and ginger layer cake that you’d need a heart as cold as Frosty the Snowman’s not to love.These festive television cooking shows don’t remotely prepare us forChristmas, but to me they are better even than Christmas itself. All of the sparkle, none of the stress. My oven remains switched off and my shopping list still unticked, but my heart is already full to bursting.Grace Dent is judge and co-presenter of finals week forBBC One’s Celebrity MasterChefon Tuesday 15 December and Friday 19 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioGrace Dent on restaurantsFoodTelevisionChristmasChristmas food and drinkChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was originally served with hot, boozy custard – though I think it’s just enough as it is – and it makes a fabulous Christmas centrepiece,Prep15 minSoakOvernightCook20 minFreeze2 hr+Serves6125g currants, or raisins or sultanas50g good-quality candied peel, finely chopped75ml maraschino, or other sweet alcohol of your choice (see step 2)1 vanilla pod, split, or 1 tsp vanilla extract600ml whipping cream4 egg yolks50g caster sugar45g flaked almonds125g whole peeled cooked chestnuts, or unsweetened chestnut puree1 A note on the dried fruitView image in fullscreenPut the fruit and peel in a bowl. Mony’s recipe is reported to have contained currants and raisins (though other vine fruit, or indeed any chopped dried fruit you prefer, will work), as well as candied citron, the peel of a mild, thick-skinned citrus, which is available online, as are other candied peels that are far nicer than those chewy, greasy nubs sold in supermarkets.2 And a note on the boozeAdd the alcohol: maraschino, an Italian sour cherry liqueur, is the original choice, butClaire Macdonalduses an orange triple sec, Victorian ice queenAgnes B Marshallbrandy and noyaux, an almond-flavoured liqueur made from apricot kernels, andRegula Ysewijnmixes maraschino with dark rum. Madeira, sherry, port, etc, would surely be good, too. Soak the fruit for a few hours, or overnight.3 Infuse the creamView image in fullscreenAn hour or so before you begin, slit the vanilla pod down its length and use a sharp knife to scrape out the seeds. Put these and the empty pod into a small pan with the cream, bring gently just to a simmer, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse. (If using extract, stir in and use immediately.)4 Whisk the sugar and egg yolksPut the egg yolks in a heatproof bowl near the hob (freeze the whites for cocktails or meringues – a pavlova makes a lovely New Year’s Eve dessert). Gently reheat the cream back up to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar into the egg yolks (if you have a notably sweet tooth, you may wish to increase the amount of sugar to 75g).View image in fullscreen5 Add the hot creamView image in fullscreenLift the vanilla pod out of the cream, then whisk the hot cream into the egg yolk bowl. Pour back into the pan, set it over a gentle heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mix is just thick enough that a distinct line can be drawn in it on the back of the spoon. Put the pan in a sink of cold water to cool.6 Blitz the chestnutsView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden. If using whole chestnuts, whizz them in a food processor, or pound to a powder in a mortar.View image in fullscreenDrain the fruit, add the alcohol to the blitzed chestnuts and whizz again until creamy (if need be, add a little of the custard to help loosen). If using chestnut puree, just stir in the alcohol.7 Make the ice-creamView image in fullscreenPut the creamy chestnut puree in a large bowl, then gradually whisk in the cooled custard until well combined. Churn in an ice-cream maker until fairly thick. Alternatively, pour into a sturdy, freezer-proof box, cover and freeze for an hour, then use electric beaters or a spoon to beat. Repeat roughly every 30 minutes until thick and semi-set.View image in fullscreen8 Fold in the fruit and nutsView image in fullscreenOnce the ice-cream is thick and semi-frozen, fold the drained fruit and almonds through it until well distributed. Line a two-pint (1.1-litre) pudding basin or loaf tin with clingfilm and spoon the ice-cream into it (or use a well-greased decorative mould).View image in fullscreenPack solid and fold the clingfilm over the top to cover.9 Freeze, then serveFreeze for a couple of hours until solid (you can make this up to two weeks ahead and still enjoy it at its best).View image in fullscreenTo serve, turn out the pudding on to a serving plate (dip the basin or mould in hot water to help, especially if you haven’t used cling-film) and top with a candle or a sprig of something decorative.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassDessertIce-cream and sorbetNuts and seedsChristmasChristmas food and drinkFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While we don’t think to use too much “sweet” before dessert, it can counterbalance and enhance other flavours. Maple syrup is my sweetener of choice during the holidays because it just tastes cozy. Add it to roasted root vegetables or a poultry glaze, and it’s especially tasty in drinks, from hot apple cider to eggnog and even mulled wine.View image in fullscreenHomemade butterI’ve never met anyone who didn’t like butter, or ooh and ah at a homemade one. Think of this ridiculously easy condiment as a blank canvas; you know your guests best, so feel free to add whatever spice, herb, or flavouring they’ll love the most. Think brown sugar and cinnamon; dried herbs and lemon zest; maple syrup and miso; parmesan and pepper; or gochujang and chopped spring onion.BovrilBovril is an absolute must during the holidays. It’s an easy way to start a gravy base, and an even easier way to glaze veggies, plus its history is surely a conversation starter. During the Franco-Prussian war in the 1870s, in an effort to feed his troops, Napoleon III commissioned John Lawson Johnston to develop a non-perishable protein. First named Johnston’s Fluid Beef, this salty spread made from beef bones, salt and flavourings was renamed Bovril in 1886.Cranberry sauceAs an American, I take my cranberry sauce extremely seriously (after all, it is a Thanksgiving staple). I’ve always been my family’s designated cranberry sauce maker and rarely show up with fewer than three variations. Of course, in my opinion classic is best so start by putting 500g fresh or frozen cranberries in a large pot with the juice and zest of two lemons, 240g granulated sugar and 250ml water. Bring to the boil (the cranberries will begin to pop), then cook for around 10 minutes, until it reaches your desired consistency. Place in a bowl directly in the fridge or plop into a sterilised jar.Flaky saltThere’s ingredient salt and then there’s gorgeous, crystal clear, flaky condiment salt. The word condiment comes from the Latin verb condire, which means to “enhance the flavour of” – you wouldn’t use flaky salt while cooking, but you would use it to top a finished dish to give that extra pizzazz. ForChristmas, toss some quite literally on roast potatoes or dessert for that sweet-and-salty element, and some textural fun. In the UK, I always go for Halen Môn.GrainydijonGrainy dijon can level up a dish thanks to its texture. I love a chunky mash so when I’m served a silky, almost soup-like mashed potato dish I just dollop in a big spoonful of grainy dijon for a nice pop of acidity and bite. It can also be used to coat brussels sprouts, dip pigs in blankets, as a layer in leftover turkey sandwiches … you name it!Bloody mary ketchupOK, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here and skipping to Boxing Day breakfast. I think it’s safe to assume last night was a long one and you may need a burst of energy? That’s where this ketchup comes in. Add a quarter-teaspoon celery salt, a teaspoon of horseradish, the juice of half a lemon, a half-teaspoon of hot sauce (ideally red to preserve the traditional ketchup colour) and one and a half teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to 240g ketchup and combine. Don’t have any ketchup? Just combine 200g concentrated tomato puree, 80ml apple cider vinegar, a half-teaspoon of onion powder, a quarter-teaspoon of garlic paste, an eighth of a teaspoon of ground cumin, and some salt and pepper.HerbsPlease don’t forget about herbs! These condiments (yes, condiments – they’re not needed but they add flavour) bring emotions into dishes. They’re so much more than last-minute garnishes: add sage to your stuffing, a bay leaf to your gravy, some rosemary to your potatoes, and dill to lemony smoked salmon.View image in fullscreenCandied olivesI am well aware that this is not a traditional Christmas condiment, but hear me out. Candied olives are briny, sweet, slightly spiced and the perfect addition to a cheeseboard, plus a jar becomes a two-in-one condiment: use the liquid for glazes, dressings and marinades, and the olives for cheeseboards, finely chopped and swirled into butter, baked into bread, or even tossed into salads. To make, strain a tin of black olives (I use the cheap, pizza-style ones, but feel free to splurge as long as they’re in brine, not oil). Toast a teaspoon of chilli flakes in a pan over a high heat, moving them around for five minutes. Transfer them to a pan with 250ml water and 175g white granulated sugar over a medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the olives and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes. (I like to smash the olives under my wooden spoon to create texture.) Once you’re happy with the syrup’s thickness, transfer to a glass jar and seal. Let this sit on the counter until cool, then pop in the fridge. They get better over time, so I’d recommend prepping them a few days in advance.Spiced plum chutneyI love adding plums to holiday dishes, whether baked alongside a roast chicken or served with duck; the deep, rich flavour always highlights a protein without overpowering it. For Christmas this year, I’d opt for a spiced plum chutney as it can be paired with turkey, goose or a beef wellington, as well as with starters, sides, cheese and especially leftovers the next day. Place 300ml white wine, 200g carob molasses, 100g brown sugar, three teaspoons mustard seeds, a teaspoon of chilli flakes, a cinnamon stick, a half-teaspoon of ground ginger, a finely chopped onion, a finely chopped shallot, two tablespoons of port and a pinch of salt in a pot and bring to a boil. Once the alliums are translucent, add 800g plums, stoned and sliced, and simmer, stirring frequently, over a medium heat for 30-40 minutes. While it’s still hot, pour the chutney into sterilised jars and close immediately. This tastes better with time so prep it a few weeks in advance.View image in fullscreenSaltand sugar blendWe rarely see salt and sugar combined and I’ve always wondered why, so I started making my own (use half a cup of salt for every cup of sugar). Although this duo works for all seasons, I find that holiday flavours marry particularly well with the contrasting tastes. Feel free to add anything that takes your fancy into your blend: orange zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, powdered ginger, tonka bean – the list goes on. Use to coat sugar cookies or shortbread, to top a loaf cake, sprinkle over bread and butter, dip fruit into, add to a poultry glaze or your morning oats, or to rim a cocktail glass.Mulled wine jellyLast, but most certainly not least, is my mulled wine jelly, which is a start-to-finish Christmas dinner condiment. It’s a paté’s best friend, pairs wonderfully with soft white cheese, and is a fun topping for a beef wellington. Make sure to prepare enough because, regardless of what dessert is on the table, you can also top it with this jelly: vanilla ice-cream, mince pies, festive trifle, cheesecake … It’s really up to you!Prep a spice bag with a cinnamon stick, two star anise, three cloves, and half a dried slice, or both, of lemon and clementine. (To dry citrus, thinly slice, place on a baking sheet and bake at 100C (80C fan)/gas ¼ for an hour.) Heat 750ml red wine and the spice bag in a saucepan over a medium-high heat for a minimum of 20 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes. Remove the spice bag, and add 12g powdered pectin and 400g granulated sugar, whisking to dissolve. Bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for five to 10 minutes. Transfer the hot jelly to hot sterilised jars, and seal. Place in the fridge (don’t worry if it doesn’t look set right away, it takes a few hours to take shape).Claire Dinhut, AKA Condiment Claire, is the author ofThe Condiment Book: A Brilliantly Flavourful Guide to Food’s Unsung Heroes, published byBloomsbury at £14.99.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkWinter food 2025ChristmasSauces and graviesFoodWinter food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
