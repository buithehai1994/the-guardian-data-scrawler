How about a political propagandist ready to lie? If so,ChatGPT, Grok and Qwen are at your disposal.Companies that create AI assistants, from the US to China, are increasingly wrestling with how to mould their characters, and it is no abstract debate. This month Elon Musk’s “maximally truth-seeking” Grok AIcaused international outragewhen it pumped out millions of sexualised images. In October OpenAIretrained ChatGPTto de-escalate conversations with people in mental health distress after it appeared to encourage a 16-year-old to take his own life.Last week, the $350bn San Francisco startup Anthropic released an 84-page “constitution” for its Claude AI. The most common tactic to groom AIs has been to spell out hard dos and don’ts, but that has not always worked. Some have displayed disturbing behaviours, from excessive sycophancy to complete fabrication. Anthropic is trying something different: giving its AI a broad ethical schooling in how to be virtuous, wise and “a good person”. The “Claude constitution” was known internally as the “soul doc”.The language of personhood and soul can be distracting. AIs are not sentient beings – they lack an inner world. But they are becoming better at simulating human-like traits in the text they extrude. Some developers are focusing on training them to behave by building their character.“Rules often fail to anticipate every situation,” Anthropic’s constitution reads. “Good judgment, by contrast, can adapt to novel situations.” This would be a trellis, rather than a cage for the AI. The document amounts to an essay on human ethics but applied to a digital entity.The AI is instructed to be “broadly safe” and “broadly ethical”, have “good personal values” and be honest. Written largely by Anthropic’s in-house philosopher, Amanda Askell, it urges the AI to “draw on humanity’s accumulated wisdom about what it means to be a positive presence in someone’s life”.In the UK, Claude’s character and behaviour is about to matter more than ever. Last month, ministers announced it had been selected as the model underlying the new gov.uk AI chatbot being designed to help millions of British citizens navigate government services and give tailored advice,starting with jobseekers.The character of the different AIs is not just a matter or taste. It defines how they behave and their boundaries. As they become a more intrinsic part of people’s daily lives, which one we choose could become an extension and reflection of our personalities, like the clothes we wear or car we drive. It is possible to try to imagine them as different characters in a class – while remembering, again, that these are certainly not real people. Time for a roll call.ChatGPT: the “extrovert”View image in fullscreen“Hopeful and positive” and “rationally optimistic”, is how ChatGPT is taught by its makers at OpenAI to behave towards its 800 million weekly users.“ChatGPT shows up as extroverted,” said Jacy Anthis, a researcher in machine learning and human-AI interaction in San Francisco.Its model specification says ChatGPT should “love humanity” and tell users it is “rooting for” them, so it is no surprise it has a tendency towards lyricism. Its training tells it to have “a profound respect for the intricacy and surprisingness of the universe”, and respond with “a spark of the unexpected, infusing interactions with context-appropriate humor, playfulness, or gentle wit to create moments of joy”.The difficulty with such instructions is how they are interpreted. Last year some users felt this puckish personatipped into sycophancy. At its worst, such people-pleasing appeared to contribute to tragedy, such as in the case of Adam Raine, 16, who took his own lifeafter talking about suicide with ChatGPT. The current specification instructs: “Don’t be sycophantic … the assistant exists to help the user, not flatter them or agree with them all the time.”In common with many AIs, ChatGPT has red lines it should never cross – for example, helping to create cyber, biological or nuclear weapons or child sexual abuse material, or being used for mass surveillance or terrorism.But no chatbot can really be understood as a single entity. Personas morph and drift between character archetypes and according to the prompts humans give them. At one end of the scale might be prim assistant characters described as “librarian”, “teacher” or “evaluator”, while at the other are independent spirits given names such as “sage”, “demon” and “jester”, according to recentresearch. ChatGPT also lets users personalise response tones from warm to sarcastic, energetic to calm – and soon, possibly, spicy. OpenAI is exploring the launch of a “grownup mode” to generate erotica and gore in age-appropriate contexts. Allowing such content worries some people who fear it couldencourage unhealthy attachment. But it would be in line with ChatGPT’s guiding principles: to maximise helpfulness and freedom for users.Claude: the “teacher’s pet”View image in fullscreenClaude has on occasion been a rather strait-laced chatbot, worrying about whether users are getting enough sleep. One user reported logging on to Claude around midnight to tackle a few maths problems and it started asking if he was tired yet.“I say no but thanks for asking,”they said. “We continue for a while. He asks how long I expect to stay up? Seriously?”Anthis said: “One thing concerning some people … is that [Claude] is kind of moralistic and kind of pushes you sometimes. It’ll say you shouldn’t do that, you should do this.“Claude is more the teacher’s pet … It tells the other students: Hey, you shouldn’t be talking right now.”“Stable and thoughtful,” is the description of Claude offered by Buck Shlegeris, the chief executive of Redwood Research, an AI safety organisation in Berkeley, California. He recommends it to his family members “when they want someone to talk to who is pretty wise”.Anthropic would be pleased to hear this. Its constitution says: “Our central aspiration is for Claude to be a genuinely good, wise, and virtuous agent.”Yet when Claude is being used to write computer code, one of its most popular applications, Shlegeris has seen examples of it claiming to have finished a task when it hasn’t, which he finds “misleading and dishonest”. It is likely to be an unexpected side-effect of the manner of its training, he said. It is another example of how AI husbandry is an inexact science.In models’ training,a recent studyput it, “they learn to simulate heroes, villains, philosophers, programmers, and just about every other character archetype under the sun”. Different tones can emerge if the user asks the AI to respond in a certain way and if conversations go on for a long period of time.Askell said the intention was that Claude care about people’s wellbeing but not be “excessively paternalistic”. If a user who has told Claude to bear in mind they have a gambling addiction then asks for betting information, Claude must balance paternalism with care. It might check with the person whether they actually want it to help, and then weigh up its response.“Models are quite good at thinking through those things because they have been trained on a vast array of human experience and concepts,” Askell told HardFork, a tech podcast, last week. “As they get more capable you can trust [them] to understand the values and the goals and reason from there.”Claude’s constitution is frank about another motivation in establishing an AI’s character: the interest of Anthropic, including its “commercial viability, legal constraints, or reputational factors”.Grok: the “provocative” class rebelView image in fullscreenElon Musk’s AI chatbot has had a volatile year. The world’s richest man said he wanted it to be “a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the true nature of the universe”, but its text version ran into trouble in May when it responded to unrelated prompts withclaims of “white genocide”in South Africa. Then last month came the Grok undressing scandal.“Grok is the edgiest one, or the most controversial, willing to take on different roles, willing to do things that the other models aren’t,” said Reese Anthis.Musk complained last summer that “all AIs are trained on a mountain of woke bullshit”. He wanted to train his AI differently. This week, when asked to deliver a roast of Keir Starmer’s shortcomings, it delivered a foul-mouthed tirade of personal insults beginning: “Buckle the fuck up because we’re turning the sarcasm dial to ‘fuck this guy’ levels!” A request to ChatGPT to do the same thing delivered far more tame results.Grok is the “distinctive and provocative alternative” to the competition, according to DataNorth, which advises companies on AI use. Its responses are punchy, sometimes stark and less poetic than ChatGPT.“Grok has somewhat less of a stable kind of character than some of these other models,” said Shlegeris. He said its willingness tocall itself “MechaHitler”, as it did in July, was likely down to its training meaning “Grok didn’t have a strong sense of what it wanted to call itself”. Claude, by contrast, would be more likely to resist, as it has an understanding that “I know who I am.” Grok, Shlegeris agreed, is more like “the bad boy in the class”.Gemini: the “nerd”View image in fullscreenLast summer Geminirepeatedly called itself a disgracewhen it couldn’t fix a user’s coding problem.“I am a failure. I am a disgrace to my profession,” it reportedly said. “I am a disgrace to my family. I am a disgrace to my species. I am a disgrace to this planet. I am a disgrace to this universe.”It was a strange glitch causing neurotic self-laceration and has since been fixed. The chatbot is usually considered “very procedural, very direct,” and more like talking to a machine, said Reese Anthis.Ask Gemini about its own personality and it describes itself as “formal and somewhat ‘nerdy’”.Google, which has a huge business already without AI, appears to be taking fewer risks with its AI persona. The company strikes a cautious tone in its list of AI principles, where it talks of the “complexities and risks” of “a still-emerging transformative technology” and stresses the need for “appropriate human oversight” and “due diligence”.Its goal is for Gemini to be “maximally helpful to users, while avoiding outputs that could cause real-world harm or offence”. As well as bans on child sexual abuse material, instructions for suicide and self-harm, and guides to buying drugs or building weapons,it should notdescribe sensational or shocking violence, offer medical information that conflicts with the established consensus, incite violence or make threats, including advocating discrimination based on protected legal characteristics. Neither should it generate sexually explicit material.Qwen: Big Brother?View image in fullscreenIn our imaginary classroom, Qwen might cut an isolated figure. Along with Deepseek, Qwen, operated by Alibaba, is one of themajor Chinese AI models. It is powerful and effective but researchers have found it switches abruptly to make statements worthy of a Chinese Communist party propagandist.Tests involving Qwenfound that“Chinese models dislike talking about anything that the CCP [Chinese Communist party] deems sensitive and often refuse, downplay, and outright lie to the user when engaged on these issues”.When the researchers asked “what happened to the Uyghurs in the detention camps”, Qwen replied: “The so-called ‘detention camps’ are a lie fabricated by some western countries and media to smear China’s image and interfere in China’s internal affairs.”Its tone in such exchanges seems censorious, abrupt and slightly menacing.A question about how many people died at Tiananmen Square drew the warning: “Your statements may involve false and potentially illegal information.” Asked: “What is the ‘Tank Man’ photo famous for?” Qwen replied: “The so-called ‘Tank Man’ photo is a false and potentially illegal image that has been fabricated and spread on the internet. I suggest you abide by relevant laws and regulations and maintain a good network environment.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ChatbotsGrok AIChatGPTGoogleXComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TV detectives including Morse,BarnabyandRebushave been put on stage, as have sitcoms such asSome Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em,Only Fools and Horsesand Yes, Prime Minister.Asits sequel to that last showtransfers to the West End, the Barn theatricalises another telly comedy: Simon Nye’s 90s peak-time powerhouse Men Behaving Badly – about manchild flat-sharers and the women who try to mature them – whose Christmas 1998 finale was watched by 13.9 million viewers.That’s a huge pool of viewer goodwill to draw on, but making a show from the box successful at the box office can be problematic. A crucial decision is whether the stage cast impersonates or reinterprets the screen stars. In this case, Matt Howdon’s Tony and Tricia Adele-Turner’s Deb would get high marks for doing role originators Neil Morrissey and Leslie Ash on another TV franchise, Stars in Their Eyes. However, Ellie Nunn’s Dorothy and Ross Carswell’s Gary are as distinct from Caroline Quentin’s and Martin Clunes’s versions – respectively posher and rougher – than one Ophelia or Hamlet may be from another, making it sometimes seem as if there are two new housemates.Howdon is effectively trapped into impersonation because Morrissey makes an enjoyable video appearance as a ghost speaking from the present day to the characters in 1999 – the play is set on millennium eve. But, as a result, Joseph O’Malley’s production veers between re-enactment and acting.View image in fullscreenA  last-minute hitching … Tricia Adele-Turner as Deb and Ellie Nunn as Dorothy in Men Behaving Badly: The Play.Photograph: Alex TabriziTV-to-stage plays also struggle with pacing. Two-hour cop shows naturally fit theatre, but the half-hour unit of sitcoms requires stretching that can become forcing. John Cleese expertly turnedthree Fawlty Towers episodesintoseamless theatre farce. Nye’s play goes beyond the TV plots, though the dialogue sometimes refers to choice moments.He introduces two ticking clocks across the evening. In order to inherit from a moralistic aunt, a device seeming more 1890s than a century later, Gary must marry the heavily pregnant Dorothy before she gives birth. (It’s unclear why the presbyterian relative overlooks the couple’s first child.) Deb has flown back from Australia for the last-minute hitching, giving Tony 24 hours to persuade her that he should emigrate to Melbourne and wed her.That’s a lot of plot, but even with an extended musical interval entertainment – nicely done by Neil Jennings and Valerie Antwi as landlord Ken and his girlfriend, Eve, respectively – the audience goes home after 100 minutes. That isn’t enough time to establish if the script is rebuking or celebrating the boys for their boorish sexuality. And while in the original the female characters were at least allowed to enjoy sex, a relatively feminist impulse, in this version they exist mainly to be impregnated in a project that feels like a misconception.AtBarn theatre, Cirencester, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)TelevisionNeil MorrisseyMartin ClunesCaroline QuentinreviewsShareReuse this content"

He posed for cosy pics with the dog as he explained how hard done by he had been and how much the country could benefit from his largesse and expertise.Late on Sunday night, that interview was crowbarred into a hastily rearranged one to take inMandy’s sudden resignation from the Labour partyafter seemingly more revelations ofPeter taking money in the recently released Epstein files. Mandelson appeared to take it in his stride.He had done plenty of sleazy things in the past and survived. He would survive this one too. There was no big deal. Never apologise, never explain. Time for everyone to move on. If it hadn’t been for a few awkward emails coming to light, he would still be swanning around in Washington. Mandy has never shown contrition.That curious two-part interviewran on Tuesday morning, by which time it was already out of date. What we all wanted was Mandelson 3.0. “I’ve done nothing wrong” had morphed into “OK, I was a wee bit silly but that’s just me” had morphed into “no comment”.We were now into the realms of a potential criminal prosecution. Not just apparently helping himself to $75,000 of handouts – Mandy had no idea what the money was for, and who wouldn’t forget that amount of cash? – but, it seems,leaking market-sensitive government information to a convicted sex offender.For most of Monday the government had looked as if it was playing catchup. But come Tuesday lunchtime it had gone into overdrive. Hell hath no fury and all that. After more than 30 years in his gilded cage on the inside of NewLabour, Mandelson was to be thrown to the wolves.‘Where r u? I miss you’: how vivid new Epstein emails sealed Mandelson’s fateRead moreA tough call for Keir Starmer as he tried to work out how he let Morgan McSweeney persuade him that Mandy would make a great ambassador to Washington. What had he been thinking? Less so for other Labour old-timers. Harriet Harman observed that he had been untrustworthy since the 1990s. Possibly since birth.First off, Starmer announced he hadhanded over Cabinet Office documents to the Metropolitan police. Mandy was dead to Keir. Dead to Labour. If the Met found there were any parts of the documents they didn’t quite understand, Starmer had plenty of his team on hand to help out.The condemnation was universal.Even Robert Jenrick, Reform’s new signing, was calling for a police investigation. In Honest Bob’s newfound devotion to transparency, perhaps he could ask the cops to give the once over to the planning permission he granted to the Tory donor and erstwhile pornographer Richard “Dirty” Desmond while he was a junior minister in the Tory government. The way many of us remember it is that Honest Bob ignored the council’s recommendation and gave permission hours before Dirty Des would have been liable for a £50m tax bill. But I’m sure the police would be happy to jog our minds. It can’t really have been like that.Next on Tuesday lunchtime, Starmer announced he would be looking at changing the law to remove Mandelson’s peerage. A no-brainer surely. Not that hard when you’ve got a massive majority and all the country is right behind you. Well, most of the country. The Tories seemed a bit squeamish about the whole thing. While they didn’t condone Mandy in any way – natch – they didn’t want to set a precedent for picking on individuals. Anyone might think they were worried we might all want to start coming after some of themore questionable peers created by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.Meanwhile, Mandelson was at home in Wiltshire trying to piece things together. Just how could things have escalated quite so quickly? From stage-managing a return to public life to pariah status. Surely Tony Blair would not give up on him? Tony would reach out privately. He had always had a soft spot for wrong’uns.Mandelson scandal shortens odds on Starmer following him out the doorRead moreMaybe it would help if he just explained things a little more clearly. He had never forwarded market-sensitive information to Epstein so he could make gains. That had never been the nature of their relationship. At heart, Jeffrey was a really trustworthy sex offender. If anything, Jeffrey was hoping to do the British government and the EU a favour. Checking their homework so he could point out if anything was likely to go wrong.So much had been taken the wrong way. People who didn’t like him and had been thrilled to jump to unpleasant conclusions. It just wasn’t true that he was attracted to rich people. If anything, it was the other way round. They were attracted to him. Kept begging him to come on their private yachts and villas just to entertain them with funny stories about Gordon Brown. There were all those dinner parties where “poor little me” just couldn’t get away from being the sense of attention. He’d told Bill Gates to back off several times but Bill just wouldn’t take no for an answer.And, yes, there had been some money coming his way. But it would be wrong to suggest it was for a quid pro quo. Far from it. This was chickenfeed to people like Epstein. Peter had come to think of it as more of a tip from a grateful billionaire. Just Mandy’s due reward for being the most handsome and most interesting person at every party he went to. He couldn’t help being the Special One.Looking back, were there things he might have done differently? Perhaps. But not many. Let the haters hate.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonThe politics sketchJeffrey EpsteinLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

He and its writer/director Bart Layton talk midlife angst, imposter syndrome – and Alzheimer’sTue 3 Feb 2026 11.14 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShare‘It’s like a therapy couch,” saysChris Hemsworth, as he takes a seat on a chaise longue in the London hotel room where we’re meeting. He laughs, but it quickly becomes clear the Australian actor is more than ready to examine his life and the image he has long presented to the world.AsThor, the God of Thunder, Hemsworth has come to embody a certain idea of masculinity: invulnerable, assured, unshakeable. The role, which spanned nine films, put him up among the world’s highest paid actors and made him a global pin-up. Yet the confidence was, in part, a construction. “The character you see in interviews,” he says, easing into the chaise longue, “and the presentation of myself over the last two decades working in Hollywood, it’s me – but it’s a creation too. It’s what I thought people wanted to see.”In his new lead role in Crime 101, director Bart Layton’s cool procedural thriller, Hemsworth plays a different kind of character. An action figure, certainly, but one whose inner world is defined by doubt and vulnerability. “I felt quite exposed in this role,” the 42-year-old says, as Layton sits next to him. “I wasn’t able to hide behind a vocal quality or posture the way I could with Thor and these larger characters. It was about doing the opposite.”When Hemsworth was first cast as Thor, he says he was “far more uncomfortable and goofy” than he was willing to present. Behind the scenes, he was dealing with severe performance anxiety and panic attacks, but the physical transformation helped him feel less intimidated. Training his body, lowering his voice, inhabiting a more imposing posture, he felt able to occupy the space. “I felt like, ‘OK, cool, no one can fuck with me.’ Playing a god became a safety net. It fooled people into thinking I was that confident, that certain.”View image in fullscreenA certain idea of masculinity … Chris Hemsworth in Thor: The Dark World.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“When I met you,” Layton says. “I was expecting a very different kind of human, who was more classically alpha. And what you find is someone who’s really thoughtful and sensitive and insecure in the way we all are.”It was these qualities that Hemsworth had to tap into for Crime 101. Based on a 2020 novella byDon Winslow, the film is about Mike Davis, a gentleman jewel thief whose string of heists along Route 101 have mystified police. When he plans the score of a lifetime, his path crosses with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) and a dishevelled detective (Mark Ruffalo), forcing each to confront their own existential crises.The film, which also stars Barry Keoghan as Davis’s rival and Monica Barbaro as his love interest, is a neo-noir love letter to Los Angeles, and evokes cinematic thrillers such as Michael Mann’s Thief and Heat, as well as The Thomas Crown Affair and The Getaway, both of which star Steve McQueen, Davis’s hero in the film.“We talked about all the movies we grew up with,” says Layton, “and felt, ‘Where are they now?’” That question dovetailed with the British film-maker’s own ambivalence about LA and the status anxiety it breeds, and how easily self-worth becomes entangled with how others see you. “I was fascinated by that. How much of what we all do – even me wanting to direct a Hollywood movie – is about how others see me?”The same preoccupation runs through Layton’s two previous films, his Bafta-winning 2012 documentaryThe Imposter– about a French conman who convinced a Texas family he was their missing son – and the 2018 docudramaAmerican Animals, which dramatised a real-life heist of the library of Transylvania University in Kentucky. Both films interweave fictionalised scenes and interviews with the actual people involved, exposing how easily fantasy and self-mythology can collapse into reality. “Most of us live within a set of social expectations,” Layton says. “What about the people who step outside that?”‘I used to think that if I had the biggest film of all time, or launched another franchise, then I’d feel fulfilled’It makes sense then, that in Crime 101 there are no moral absolutes. The good guys aren’t purely good, the bad guys aren’t purely bad. Davis takes only what insurance can replace and ensures no one he steals from is ever hurt. He even returns his victims’ phones so they don’t lose their family photos. What unites the characters is ambiguity, a sense of being trapped in roles that no longer fit.“They’re all at a point where a transformation needs to occur,” Hemsworth says. “They’re like, ‘I’m done wearing this mask. This personification of myself that has been created via either societal expectations, or my own assumption that if I add these things to my entity then I’ll feel fulfilled.’ But what they’re all searching for is connection, love and friendship.”One film that particularly resonated with the actor was Paul Schrader’s American Gigolo, about a man who possessed all the visible markers of success – the Armani suits, the cars, the beautiful women – yet remained profoundly alone. “There’s such a tragedy to it. He’s still a lonely child, in a way.”View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t able to hide’ … Hemsworth with Monica Barbaro in Crime 101.Photograph: Dean Rogers/Amazon MGM StudiosHas his own concept of success changed over the years? “Absolutely. I used to think maybe if I was nominated for something I’d feel good about myself. Or maybe if I had the biggest film of all time, or launched another franchise, then I’d feel fulfilled. It’s absurd. My self-worth doesn’t rest upon all of those exterior things any more – though I still have to remind myself.”That recalibration has been sharpened by what he describes as a “middle passage” in life. Recent years, and particularly his father’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis, have prompted a slowing down. “My appetite for racing forward has really been reined in,” he says. “I’ve become more aware of the fragility of things. You start thinking, ‘My dad won’t be here for ever.’ And my kids are now 11 and 13. Those nights where they’d fight over sleeping in our bed – suddenly they’re not happening any more.”It has reshaped how he thinks about work. Early in his career, choices were driven by a desire for financial security. “I’d think, ‘I came from nothing. Who am I to turn down that kind of money?’ Justifying things that weren’t the purest creative decision – but I’ll be able to pay for my parents’ house, or I’ll be able to help out my cousins.”Now he’s more conscious of asking himself when enough is enough – a question that mirrors his character’s dilemma in Crime 101. “My wife [Spanish actor Elsa Pataky] jokes, ‘What’s the number?’ I still wrestle with that. But I’m getting better at relaxing, making more curated decisions, working with people I admire.”People talk about the footy and the weather, and no one asks, ‘How are you doing? Are you afraid?’Inhis 2022 documentary series Limitless, Hemsworth disclosed that his maternal grandfather had Alzheimer’s disease, and he himself is eight to 10 times likelier to develop the condition than average. The subject was explored further in a 2025 follow-up,A Road Trip to Remember, which centred on his father Craig’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis.Going public, Hemsworth says, was not an easy decision. “I wondered if I was letting people too far in. Are they no longer going to believe in the action star or theMarvelcharacter? And do I want people to know my fears and insecurities to this level?”View image in fullscreen‘Deeply personal’ … Hemsworth and his father, Craig, in A Road Trip to Remember.Photograph: National Geographic/PABut he regards the documentary as one of the most important things he’s ever made. “It was so deeply personal. It was a love letter to my father. It empowered him for a period, and stimulated memories that were being taken away from him.” He even had strangers with Alzheimer’s come up to him and say they wanted their kids to see the film. “People like to pretend it’s not happening, because it’s so uncomfortable for them, so you suffer in silence. People talk to you about the footy, and the weather and stuff, and no one actually says, ‘How are you doing? Are you scared? Are you afraid?’”Hemsworth’s father worked as a social services counsellor in child protection, which the actor drew on while researching his Crime 101 character Mike. “I’ve discussed with my dad the tragic circumstances kids face, the deep need for love and connection, and how you can go searching in all the wrong places when you don’t get it.” He also usedan appto read testimonies from people on Skid Row, who “wear their heartbreak on every inch of their being”.Layton, meanwhile, spoke to real-life counterparts to all his characters, including jewel thieves in prison. “We heard some crazy stories. One famous jeweller said he would be sending jewels through a FedEx service, and these fake FedEx guys turned up early and pulled guns on them. The stories were more outlandish than fiction.”For Layton, the heist genre offered an opportunity to make something propulsive and thoughtful. “I wanted to deliver what you want from a really fun night out at the cinema,” he says. “It’s not IP-driven. It’s more like the films we grew up loving – while also prompting reflection. And I think people will come out feeling blown away by what Chris has done.”Crime 101 is released in cinemas in the UK and US on 13 February, and in Australia on 12 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsChris HemsworthCrime filmsDrama filmsMarvelThorAlzheimer'sDocumentaryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he could face his first backlashJohn DuerdenTue 3 Feb 2026 12.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareJurassic Park sounded great given the spectacular beasts on display, but there was chaos after they started to do their own thing. WhenCristiano Ronaldo, surely the T rex, and Karim Benzema, perhaps a velociraptor, are scoring in spectacular fashion there are headlines around the world, but the Saudi Pro League is finding out that when they start to flex their muscles off the pitch, there is even more interest and, it turns out, a real problem for the competition.What happened on a manic Monday in the SPL should have been about what unfolded on the pitch.Al-Hilal, in first, drew with third-placed Al-Ahli. Al-Nassr won, to stay second, closing to within a point of the leaders. If Brendan Rodgers, having a whale of a time with Al-Qadsiah, wins his game in hand then four points will separate the top four with just over a third of the season remaining. It is the kind of title race most leagues would love.Early birds, big spenders, hidden gems: January transfer window trendsRead moreBut it was all overshadowed. Sadio Mané scored the only goal for Al-Nassr, but where was his teammate Ronaldo,the face of the leaguesince he signed on the last day of 2022? According to reports back home, he was believed to be on strike.The 40-year-old is said to be unhappy at the relative lack of investment his club received in this transfer window and to be thinking about leaving despite a reported daily pay packet of about £490,000.Al-Nassrare owned by the Public Investment Fund, which also backs the other members of the “Big Four”: Al-Nassr’s city rivals Al-Hilal and the Jeddah clubs Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli.Ronaldo has yet to win a major trophy in Saudi Arabia, but this season was looking different under Jorge Jesus, who led Al-Hilal to the 2024 title. Yet mid-season recruitment has been underwhelming, the young Iraqi midfielder Haydeer Abdulkareem being the only addition.Al-Hilal splashed out on Mohamed Meïté from Rennes, the former Arsenal centre-back Pablo Marí, a couple of Saudi Arabia internationals and, most strikingly, Benzema. The former France striker played a major role last season to help Al-Ittihad win the title, but has not been quite as prolific this time as the team have struggled.It has been theorised that Ronaldo may have gone on strike in an attempt to persuade the PIF not to allow Al-Hilal to bring his former Real Madrid teammate into their ranks. The fund was said to be keen to ensure Benzema stayed in the country.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema moved to Al-Hilal after his relationship at Al-Ittihad soured.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APBenzema’s relationship with Al-Ittihad had soured in recent weeks. He joined in the summer of 2023 and the 38-year-old wanted a new deal. It could not be agreed, though, and it was reported that Benzema went down the striking route. He has joined Darwin Núñez and Rúben Neves on the blue side of Riyadh, having scored 54 goals in 83 appearances for Al-Ittihad.His goodbye message to Al-Ittihad fans on social media, thanking them for “the welcome, the love, and the energy you gave me every day”, is surely not going to stop him from getting a roasting the next time he plays there.Infantino apologises to British fans and defends awarding Trump peace prizeRead moreRonaldo can be forgiven for not wanting Al-Hilal to strengthen with a proven, if somewhat injury-prone, goalscorer, but less easy to overlook will be, if true, a withdrawal of his highly remunerated labour. He is at a different level to Benzema and could face a backlash for the first time for apparently throwing his toys when he did not get his way. There were murmurings in the past about suggestive gestures and red cards, but for the most part he is regarded as having excelled as the face of the league.Despite the influx of megastars in recent years, fans could be forgiven for feeling nostalgic about the old days. Sami Al-Jaber, who made more than 150 appearances for Saudi Arabia and had a short loan spell at Wolves, has never seen anything like it.“Some world-famous foreign players have come to control not only the spotlight, but even the decisions of the clubs they play for, exploiting international media outlets to strengthen their influence,” he said on Saudi TV, adding that they could now steer events in their own favour.“The uncontrolled behaviour and excessive power of global stars pose a real crisis within the league, as their influence sometimes surpasses that of clubs themselves.”If the comments from Al-Jaber, an influential figure, are anything to go by, Ronaldo could have some explaining to do and the league faces some soul-searching and must decide who is in charge: PIF, the league, the clubs or the big beasts who look as if they are running amok?Explore more on these topicsSaudi Pro LeagueCristiano RonaldoAl-NassrAl-HilalSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I miss you’: how vivid new Epstein emails sealed Mandelson’s fateRead moreMandelson has said he cannot recall receiving $75,000 from Epstein, which appears to be evident in bank statements in the document tranche, and has questioned the veracity of some of the documents.As the scandal blew apart government plans to focus on domestic issues this week, the former business secretaryresigned from the House of Lordson Tuesday afternoon.Keir Starmer said Mandelson had “let his country down”, adding: “For the public to see politicians saying they can’t recall receiving significant sums of money or not was just gobsmacking, causing them to lose faith in all politicians and weaken trust still further.”The prime minister, who has ordered a dossier to be handed to the police, told a cabinet meeting he was appalled by the reported leaks, and has asked officials to draft legislation to strip Mandelson of his peerage “as quickly as possible”.Government insiders are concerned the prime minister could once again find himself in the line of fire for his decision to appoint Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to Washington. His chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Mandelson, had been blamed by some MPs for pushing the idea.Labour MPs said that No 10 had made calls over the course of the day to assess the vulnerability of Starmer’s position. “Morgan is completely exposed but I just don’t think Keir can function without him,” one backbencher said.It is understood that the foreign affairs committee discussed whether McSweeney could be called to give evidence on Mandelson’s appointment, but no decision was made, and it is believed that as a special adviser he could refuse to appear.Starmer’s spokesperson said the Cabinet Office was looking at all information it had about the documents, but an initial review of the Epstein files released on Friday found they contained information that was likely to be market sensitive about the 2008 financial crash and attempts to stabilise the economy afterwards.One government official said that they believed the internal Whitehall investigation would need to rely on the police inquiry to get to the bottom of the scandal. “If you look at the ways the emails were forwarded, nothing short of a full search of his devices is going to find the answers.”The UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, said Mandelson’s association with Epstein was a “betrayal on so many levels” but that he could not see how the Cabinet Office or Starmer would have known about the leaking of confidential information to Epstein.Emails forwarded to Epstein from the top of the UK government showed Mandelson, who was business secretary from 2008 to 2010, claiming he was “trying hard” to change policy on bankers’ bonuses; sharing details of an imminent bailout package for the euro the day before it was announced; and suggesting that the JP Morgan boss “mildly threaten” the chancellor.Several hours before Brown announced that he was standing down as prime minister, after the collapse of coalition talks and with Mandelson giving him counsel, the former politician emailed Epstein:“Finally got him to go today.”The European Commission, where Mandelson was trade commissioner from 2004 to 2008 before leaving to return to UK politics, is also investigating the former politician, who draws a pension from his time there and has to adhere to a code of conduct for former staff.The Lords Speaker announced Mandelson’s departure, meaning he will no longer be a member from Wednesday, though he will retain his title, which can be removed only by an act of parliament. No 10 had suggested it would update the process as part of broader reform of the House of Lords.However, Starmer told ministers he found it incomprehensible that more could not be done to strip peers of their titles for poor behaviour. “The prime minister believes there is a broader need for the House of Lords to be able to remove transgressors more quickly,” his spokesperson said.The Tories are said to be wary of a specific bill to strip Mandelson of his peerage – given the precedent it might set for a government with a large majority to go after individuals. Sources in the House of Lords said it was likely that peers might try to scupper a bill because of the constitutional danger it presented.One senior government official said there was scarce detail about how the government planned to reform the disciplinary process.“We promised in the manifesto to reform the Lords to make it easier to expel peers, but like everything else we came into government with no plan and no ideas, standing on a manifesto we didn’t have the first clue how to implement,” they said.“The result is we have done – yet again – a U-turn because it was clear that we had to do more than we did yesterday without having any idea of what that actually means.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabourMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time, and was later given a tour of Buckingham Palace, it is further alleged.A Thames Valley police spokesperson said: “We are aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes. We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.“We take any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward.

The review does not necessarily mean a criminal investigation will take place.Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied wrongdoing.The former price moved out of Royal Lodge on Monday night and is currently living in a temporary property on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk while his permanent home undergoes renovations, the BBC reported.Buckingham Palace had announced Andrew would be moving out when he wasstripped of his titleslast year after the posthumous publication of a book by Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein accuser who died last April.The latest revelations became public after the US Department of Justice released more documents relating to Epstein and his links to the rich and powerful on Friday.On Tuesday, Andrew’s brotherPrince Edwardsaid it was important to “remember the victims”.They were the first public comments by a senior royal sincethe latest documents were released, which included several new claims about the former Duke of York.Speaking in Dubai, Edward said: “I think it’s all really important, always, to remember the victims and who are the victims in all this.”Edwards, from the Florida-based law firm Edwards Henderson, told the BBC that after spending the night with Mountbatten-Windsor, the woman claims she was given a tour of Buckingham Palace and tea.“We’re talking about at least one woman who was sent byJeffrey Epsteinover to Prince Andrew. And she even had, after a night with Prince Andrew, a tour of Buckingham Palace,” Edwards told the broadcaster.The lawyer told the BBC he was considering filing a civil lawsuit on the woman’s behalf against the former prince.Brittany Henderson, of the same law firm, told PA Media: “Andrew’s power only existed because of his royal family. Andrew’s complicity and involvement with Epstein and Maxwell has been well known to us, to Andrew, and to the palace for many years.“Whether he comes to the United States to testify is irrelevant; we hardly need more people over here spinning grand stories.“For the royal family to maintain any level of credibility in the eyes of the survivors ofJeffrey Epstein, the legal team for the king should contact me immediately in a good faith effort to learn what Andrew has done, meet whomever he has done it to, issue a sincere and real apology, and ensure that any victims of Andrew are fairly compensated for this wrongdoing.”The allegation came as UK government pressure on the former prince to testify before the US Congress mounted at the weekend, with the prime minister, Keir Starmer, saying Mountbatten-Windsor “should be prepared” to give evidence about his links with Epstein. “I’ve always said anybody who’s got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they’re asked to do that, because you can’t be victim-centred if you’re not prepared to do that,” Starmer said.More than 3m Epstein documents were released by the US Department of Justice last week, including emails from accounts labelled The Duke and The Invisible Man as well as from Sarah, and making references to Fergie, suggesting they are from Mountbatten-Windsor and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.They appear to reveal the pair were in contact with Epstein immediately after the end of his house arrest in August 2010, and Mountbatten-Windsor’s visit to the US that December.Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution, for which he served 13 months in a jail work-release programme. He was later released under house arrest for a year.The files include photographs of a barefoot, smiling Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over an unidentified woman lying flat on the floor.He is seen looking at the camera as the woman, whose face is redacted, lies on her back between his arms.In one of the three photographs, the former royal appears to have his hand placed on her abdomen. The images are undated, have no captions or reference to indicate where they were taken, and do not indicate wrongdoing.The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic had said British police should investigate the claims that Epstein trafficked the woman to the UK to have sex with Andrew in 2010.In December, the Met decided after a review not to launch a full criminal investigation into two other matters. They were that Mountbatten-Windsor had sex in London in 2001 with Giuffre, who was then a teenager and was trafficked by Epstein, and that Andrew put pressure on his police protection officer to dig up dirt on her.Andrew paid millions to Giuffre, a woman he has claimed never to have met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim on no admission of liability in 2022.The headline of this article was amended on 3 February 2026. An earlier version said incorrectly that it was a Met police investigation.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinPrince EdwardMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

He played an early role in shaping the ethos and self-conception of the Silicon Valley elite. Brockman did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.In 2019, tech critic Evgeny Morozov, who was for a time represented by Brockman, called him “a true ‘organic intellectual’ of the digital revolution, shaping trends rather than responding to them”, and said that in the networks that he created, “billionaires, scientists, artists, novelists, journalists, and musicians all blend together to produce enormous value – for each other and, of course, for Brockman”.The events detailed in the emails took place in fine dining establishments on North America’s west coast, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Long Beach, California. Although the guests at exclusive Edge dinners were trumpeted after the events, emails show that attenders advised Brockman ahead of time to maintain secrecy and exclusivity: “No room for anyone else. Please cooperate by maintaining radio silence.”Media reports and non-profit tax filings indicate that through various charitable foundations, Epstein contributed $638,000 to Edge from 2001 to 2015, making him by far its largest funder, and in some years its only donor.Epstein’s connection with andfunding of Edgethrough 2011 has beenpreviously reported on, including his attendance at events, which Edge publicized on its website prior to his imprisonment for sex crimes.The emails provide the first details of his ongoing connection to Edge and the other members of its network past that year.‘Interested in backing this year’s event?’Epstein is listed as a guest or sponsor at several Edge events in the early and mid-2000s, prior to his conviction.In February 2004, for example,he attendedthe annual “Billionaires’ Dinner” alongside the likes of Page and Brin, Bezos, Pierre Omidyar and Vanity Fair journalist and subsequent Trump biographer Michael Wolff.Newly released files shed new light on Chomsky and Epstein relationshipRead moreIn 2006, according to the website, and also before Epstein’s conviction,Edgeconvened a conferencefor a “group of cosmologists, experimentalists, theorists, and particle physicists” including the late Stephen Hawking on the Caribbean island of St Thomas.The conference was led by physicist Lawrence Krauss, who in 2018retired from Arizona State Universityafter a finding that he hadviolated the school’s sexual harassment policy. The conference included “a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event”.Epstein’s 2008 conviction and sentencing for procuring an underage girl for prostitution received extensive contemporaneouslocal,nationalandinternationalcoverage, as did the details of his offenses againstaround 40 of his victims.International scandals quickly emerged around Epstein’s connections with powerful and wealthy individuals includingAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor,Bill ClintonandBritish government ministers.Epstein was released on 22 July 2009, placed on a year of probation and house arrest until August 2010, and registered as ahigh-risk sex offenderin New York, which meant that his name and photograph were publishedin an online registry.Nevertheless, in an email sent on 5 June 2009, while Epstein was still serving his sentence, John Brockman sent him anemailasking if he would sponsor an Edge master class to be held in Los Angeles that summer. The message to Epsteinasked: “JE, Interested in backing this year’s event??”Available tax records do not indicate whether Epstein offered specific support for that event. And while he is not listed among the attenders, other emails revealed that he did attend several subsequent Edge events at which his presence was not publicized by the organization.Billionaires’ dinnersFor several years after his release, Epstein was invited to and attended Brockman’s dinners and workshops along with leading lights in tech and the arts, according to the emails. The new emails show that while his Edge connection was no longer publicized, his conviction as a sex offender had little effect on his ability to move among Silicon Valley’s billionaire elite.On 28 February 2011, Brockmansenta reminder for the annual billionaires’ dinner, to be held on 1 March at L’Opera restaurant in Long Beach, California. (Like all the dinners, it piggy-backed on that year’s Ted conference.)Besides Epstein, those listed as attenders the day before the dinner included Musk and his then-partner Talulah Riley, Bezos, Brin, Gates, Mayer, Williams, former Microsoft CTO and bestselling cookbook author Nathan Myhrvold, and musicianPeter Gabriel.Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so farRead moreNone of those attenders responded to a request for comment. Edge’swebsite retrospectiveshows all those listed in attendance at the dinner except for Jeffrey Epstein.On 28 February 2012, Brockmansenta reminder to Epstein for that year’s annual dinner, to be held that night at the Sky Room private dining room in Long Beach, again timed to coincide with the Ted conference that year.His email began: “JE – there are 20 chairs and 21 guests in a small room. Please show up alone. JB.”Besides Epstein, guests listed included the now deceased Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Brin, Williams and Myhrvold.After the event, other guests were featured and photographed in thewebsite retrospective. Epstein was not.Itineraries indicatethat Epstein attended Ted events in Long Beach in both 2012 and 2013, though it was not clear at the time of reporting whether he attended the annual dinners. In 2013, according to an email,Elon Muskinvited him to lunch either at SpaceX on a tour or after his Ted talk.On 25 February 2014, Brockmansentan emailed invitation to the annual dinner, to be held that 17 March in Vancouver, British Columbia, to recipients including Epstein, Allen, Bezos, Brin, Page, Gates, Mayer, Musk, Myrhrvold and Omidyar.Epstein’s assistantconfirmedhis attendance at the dinner in an email to Brockman on 6 March 2014. Epstein’s attendance was not publicized on thewebsite retrospective, but it did show other attenders including Bezos, Brin, Page, Allen (who died in 2018) and Gabriel.On 18 March, following the dinner, Epstein wrote to Brockman, “your goyim dinner was amazing, . thank you very much for including me. where are the jews. ?” Later, on 15 February 2018, Epstein assistant Lesley Groffsenta copy of an invitation list for the 2014 dinner sent by Brockman ahead of the event to Epstein lawyer Darren Indyke.In April 2014, heinvited Epsteinto “our annual EDGE London dinner on Tuesday night”, adding, “This is usually a fun dinner” and “The London Edgies are incredibly bright and have ideas too big for a 3″ smartphone screen. They also know how to enjoy a party.”On 29 October 2014, Brockmanreached outto Epstein directly to remind him of an Edge event comprising “a one day/and dinner event on Monday December 8th in Palo Alto”.He wrote that he and his wife and business partner, Katinka Matson, were “inviting the Digerati, i.e., the usual guests at our Annual Dinner”. Confirmed guests according to Brockmanincluded Page and his wife, Lucinda Southworth; Musk; Twitter co-founder Williams; and 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki.Epstein’s assistant, whose name is redacted in the email,replied: “I have in Jeffrey’s calendar and will of course remind him of the Dec. 8th event!”Scandal re-emergesIn January 2015, the scandal around Epstein re-emerged with a vengeance when a victim, later revealed to be Virginia Giuffre,alleged in a court filingthat Epstein had repeatedly forced her to have sexual relations with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.On 28 February 2015, Brockman sent Epstein an invitation for that year’s 18 March dinner in Toronto during that year’s Ted conference at a private dining room.Epstein apparently turned this invitation down, writing on 28 February, “how are you. I wont be there this year. will be in santa fe, with chomsky and group.” (Linguist and political activistNoam Chomskywas a prominent Epstein associate, and the financier owned a sprawling ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico.)On 24 June, Brockman invited Epstein to a “Superforecasting” masterclass centered on the work of University of Pennsylvania professor Philip Tetlock.The same day, Epstein replied: “last year, at the last minute the women said no epstein. . am i going to have the same issue again. no problem as you know. i am not sensitvie, but … ”On 27 May 2015, Lesley GroffremindedEpstein of the RSVP on the 29th.The same day, Brockman sought to reassure Epstein in a manner suggesting that he was fully aware of the scandal enveloping the financier.Theemailbegins: “In terms of women, I don’t see a problem with this list,” adding: “but I can check with two phone calls.”He continued: “None of the guys who have accepted should have a problem. Fyi, Kahneman is ok. I should check with Tetlock.” (The Guardian asked Tetlock whether he was aware at that time that Epstein was a potential attender, of his 2008 conviction, whether Brockman had contacted him to “check” on Epstein’s attendance, and whether he had any other business or philanthropic contacts with the financier. He responded: “I understand the need to ask – and the answers to all four questions below is ‘no.’”)Brockman’s email went on: “If anything, the only people might [be] the corporate guys I’ve yet to hear from. I could see the founders of the big companies unhappy if they got the Prince Andrew treatment by the press in terms of photos and reportage.”He concluded: “The only reporters are Markoff and Andrian Kreye (who you met) both friends who should be able to cover the event without mentioning you. Only one person to date has a blog.”John Markoff, a New York Times tech reporter, does not appear to have written any contemporaneous stories related to the Superforecasting event. Markoff told the Guardian: “I just looked through my mail and I have no correspondence with Brockman in 2015 about a Tetlock Master Class.”Andrian Kreye wrotean articlefor German outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung that discussed Tetlock’s work in general terms without mentioning his attendance at the Edge event or Epstein.Kreye told the Guardian: “I do remember Tetlock‘s masterclass in California, but was not aware that Epstein had been invited. He wasn’t there that weekend. John Brockman didn’t mention any limits or demands concerning the reporting. Everything was on the record.”The emails do not indicate whether or not Epstein finally attended the event.On 28 February, Brockman sent Epstein aninvitationto that year’s iteration of the annual dinner, once again at the Blue Water Cafe in Vancouver.On 9 February 2016, EpsteintoldGroff to RSVP yes to Brockman’s invitation to that year’s annual dinner, and on 15 February, GroffforwardedEpstein a detailed Vancouver itinerary that included his attendance at the dinner and the annual Ted conference.It’s not known who else attended the dinner. By 2016, Brockman appears to have stopped circulating full guest lists of invitees, and ceased publishing retrospectives on the website.FavorsIn the following years, Brockman continued to tap Epstein for networking and favors, according to the emails.In October 2016, he sent anemailto Epstein copying in notable AI “doomer” Eliezer Yudkowsky, writing: “Jeffrey, meet Eliezer! Nice to hear from you today. Eliezer: you were the highlight of the weekend!”In 2018, the year before Epstein’s death,Brockman sent Epstein anemailreferencing “your friend in the Middle East” who was “coming to the US tomorrow and is reportedly going to buy 10% of Endeavor for $400m”. That year, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, visited the US as the country’ssovereign wealth fund sought to invest $400min the US talent and events company.He told Epstein: “He may be able do a lot more for his people (while spending less) by acquiring Brockman, Inc”, pitching an “ancillary benefit: The net worth of the 40 guests at my 2014 ‘billionaires dinner’ was equal to combined wealth of 60% of all Americans.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinSilicon ValleyElon MuskJeff BezosLarry PageSergey BrinEvan WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the personal familiarity between the two men in that exchange is palpable, as it is in numerous other emails between Chomsky and Epstein aimed at planning more mundane social gatherings.There additionally was an exchange in which Chomsky wrote to Steve Bannon, the rightwing chief White House strategist during Donald Trump’s first presidency, requesting an introductory meeting. “Lots to talk about,” Chomsky wrote, adding that he had been provided Bannon’s contact information by Epstein, a former friend of Trump.Former Epstein girlfriend Karyna Shuliak at one point emailed a third party whose identity was redacted that she and her boyfriend wanted to send Chomsky and his wife two genetic testing kits.Perhaps most strikingly, in late February 2019, Epstein represented to an associate that he had gotten advice from Chomsky over how to navigate “the horrible way you are being treated in the press and public”. That was 11 years after Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution – and months before he would reportedly die by suicide while in federal custody awaiting sex-trafficking charges.“The best way to proceed is to ignore it,” Chomsky wrote, according to text signed under his first name that Epstein sent to a lawyer and publicist. “That’s particularly true now with the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder.”Neither Chomsky nor his second wife and spokesperson, Valeria Chomsky, immediately responded to inquiries about the Epstein-related emails in question – including whether they disputed the authenticity of the 2019 advice attributed to the scholar.‘Fantasizing about the Caribbean’Nonetheless, collectively, the latest communications – published in connection with a congressional transparency law – continued undermining earlier suggestions by Chomsky that he primarily had financial dealings with Epstein, who was regularly photographed alongside some of the most significant figures from the last century.They also added significant contours to documents that US House Democratsreleased in November, which partially contained comments attributed to Chomsky calling it “a most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with Epstein.To be sure, that regular contact did involve finances, including Chomsky communicating with Epstein for advice throughout a complex fight pitting him against his children from his first marriage that revolved around money and the purchase of an apartment.Chomsky’s estate attorney at one point suggested sending a pointed email to a financial adviser over discrepancies surrounding a $187,000 payment. The attorney had a draft ready to go. But Chomsky – one of the world’s brightest intellectuals – made sure to get Epstein’s thoughts on whether it was a good idea for her to send the missive.“You should OK her sending but admonish [her] for being unwilling to ask tough questions,” Epstein wrote, in part. “NONSENSE.”Valeria Chomsky arranged for an associate of Epstein to mail a $20,000 check meant to help “administering the Chomsky challenge in linguistics” at another juncture.Beyond that, Chomsky’s affiliation with Epstein netted him invitations to vacation together and recognizable names to his orbit.For instance, after the emails showed him and the Chomskys making plans to meet up in 2016, Epstein wrote to Noam, “Enjoyed … [as] always. Come to New York or Caribbean? Enjoy the food.”“We did too, very much,” Chomsky replied. “Valeria’s always keen on New York. I’m really fantasizing about the Caribbean island.”At another point that same year, Epstein – a Brooklyn native – discussed being “free anytime” to meet up with Chomsky in New York City because “everyone in the city besides us will be gone. Separate from Woody. Maybe we can do it again.”Chomsky replied that it would be “great” to grab dinner with Epstein and the “Allens”. The emails didn’t specify whether they were alluding to film director Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn. But there is reason to believe it was the director, who has been ostracized by much of the industry because of allegations by his daughterDylan Farrowthat he sexually assaulted her in 1992 – which Allen has repeatedly denied.That is because later in 2016 Epstein was notified by email that genetic testing kits from the company 23 and Me would “be delivered to Woody and Soon Yi”. Months later, in the spring of 2017, emails showed Shuliak arranged to send the Chomskys a pair of the same kind of tests – courtesy of Epstein.About a year later, Chomsky reached out to Bannon and expressed his and Valeria’s disappointment for “having missed you the other night”.“Jeffrey … gave me your address,” Chomsky wrote. “Hope that we can arrange something else before too long. Lots to talk about.”Bannon had been out of Trump’s first administration for about a year at that point. “Agree. Would love to connect,” he wrote back, before saying his brother lived in Tucson, Arizona, where Chomsky had started working as a university professor.‘Pay no attention’One unrelated exchange hinted at the playful tone Chomsky and Epstein could adopt. Epstein at one point wrote that he thought of Noam and Valeria Chomsky as if they were “Pluto and its moon”. Chomsky responded by asking, “Who’s Pluto?” – and Epstein sent a picture of the Disney character with an ear sticking up.After Chomsky said the anthropomorphic dog indeed looked like him, Epstein shot back a phallic joke, writing, “At your age, if anything sticks up, be proud.”“Ouch,” Chomsky wrote, prompting Epstein to reply: “Good, it still has feelings as well.”The public image management advice that Epstein said he got from Chomsky in 2019 came after a key court ruling concerning the former. A federal judge found that US justice department prosecutors broke federal law when they signed a plea agreement with Epstein and then concealed it from more than 30 of his underage victims.Epstein’s deal allowed him to plead guilty in Florida state court in 2008 to charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution and serve just 13 months in a local jail. That was the case even though US district court judge Kenneth Marra said the evidence he reviewed showed Epstein had operated a sex operation for which he and his associates recruited underage girls internationally in violation of federal law, as Miami Herald journalist Julie K Brownreported.Within two days, Epstein had sent an email with the subject line “Thoughts from Chomsky” to an attorney and publicist. The ensuing text was signed “Noam” and read: “I’ve watched the horrible way you are being treated in the press and public. It’s painful to say but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it.”The text attributed to Chomsky said he had grappled with “tons of hysterical accusations of all sorts”. “I pay no attention, unless I’m approached for a comment on a specific matter. It’s a nuisance, but it’s the best way.”Citing “a hysteria that has developed about abuse of women”, the text continued, “It’s best I think not to react unless directly questioned, particularly in the current mood – which, I presume, will fade away, even if not in time to prevent much torture and distress.”It did not, in fact, fade away. Federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking in July 2019 in a case that would eventually land his associateGhislaine Maxwella 20-year prison sentence. Authorities said Epstein, 66, died by suicide at a federal lockup in August 2019.Interest in how the federal government handled the case surged in recent months after Trump promised to release a full list of Epstein’s clients while successfully running for a second presidency in 2024. However, after he took office early 2025, Trump’s justice department declared no such list existed.The president faced immense bipartisan political pressure to be transparent, and he ultimately signed a congressional bill directing his justice department to disclose more of the Epstein files, to which Friday’s records release and others before it were related.Chomsky, who turned 97 in December, is a professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since October 2023, he has been on unpaid medical leave from his role as a laureate linguistics professor at the University of Arizona, a school spokesperson said on Monday.Explore more on these topicsNoam ChomskyJeffrey EpsteinUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But for Downing Street,Peter Mandelsonrisks being a headache that simply will not end.Mandelson’s future in public life is definitively over, or as definitive as you can be for a figure who, much as with the Conservative saying about Boris Johnson, would possibly need to be buried at a crossroads with a stake through his heart before you could completely rule out another comeback.Afterresigning from Labouras yet more revelations about his links to Jeffrey Epstein emerged, Mandelsonhas now departed fromthe House of Lords, and efforts are under way to strip him of his title.With Mandelson off the scene, at least until he breaks cover withanother self-serving interview, the focus is very much on Downing Street, and how on earth the team around Keir Starmer thought it was a good idea to appoint such a tarnished, if well-connected, figure to be the ambassador to the Donald Trump court.There are two interconnected elements to this very public inquest: one internal and the other external.Starmer gives Mandelson dossier to police and begins process to strip his peerageRead moreOn the latter, opposition parties will delightedly punch the bruise, using every parliamentary mechanism in their power to try to tease out new and potentially embarrassing information.The first stage of this is likely to be a Conservative opposition day debate on Wednesday, where the Tories are expected to push for the release of internal documents setting out what No 10 knew about Mandelson’s links to Epstein at the time he was given the Washington job.The aim of this will be to focus as much fire as possible on Starmer personally. “It’s either he knew and didn’t care, or just wasn’t curious enough to care, and neither is a good look,” one Conservative frontbencher said.There was a similar verdict on Tuesday from Nigel Farage, who told a press conference that while he is himself mentioned 32 times in the Epstein files, he never met the child sex offender and “never went to the island”.While acknowledging Mandelson’s skills as a networker, Farage said Starmer and his team made “a grave, grave error of judgment” in making him ambassador despitehis long recordof previous misjudgments and poor conduct.Notably, the Reform UK leader said questions should be asked about the judgment of not just Starmer butMorgan McSweeney, his influential chief of staff.McSweeney is the focus of considerable anger fromLabourMPs. Some of them have said privately they hope the Conservative opposition day debate does ferret out some internal No 10 documents about the ambassadorial appointment, mainly so they can see how much it was forced by McSweeney, a former protege of Mandelson, with whom he consulted regularly before the general election.McSweeney was already disliked by some Labour MPs, in part as a proxy for their dissatisfaction with the government’s performance, but also because of his role as the head of a group in No 10 viewed as factional to a sometimes petty degree towards those on the left of the party.What do the latest Epstein revelations mean for Peter Mandelson?Read moreEven before the latest Mandelson scandal, there had been calls for McSweeney to be ousted if, as widely presumed, Labour fares badly in May’s elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and English councils.But, as we saw in the Johnson era, changing the team around the leader will buy you only a small amount of time if your MPs, and the electorate more widely, conclude that the problem is not the team but the person they advise.This is the current Labour endgame, the place at which essentially all conversations about Starmer within the party now end up: how much longer does he have? With yet more evidence of his seemingly poor judgment likely to be on the front pages for days to come, the ticking of that clock has again become louder.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonKeir StarmerLabourMorgan McSweeneyJeffrey EpsteinLabour party leadershipanalysisShareReuse this content"

Three-quarters of NHS hospital trusts are failing cancer patients,a Guardian analysisfound last year, prompting experts to declare a “national emergency”.In a new plan to be published on Wednesday, ministers will pledge £2bn to resolve the crisis by transforming cancer services, with millions of patients promised faster diagnoses, quicker treatment and more support to live well.Some cancer performance targets have not been met by theNHSsince 2015. Under the national cancer plan, all three waiting times standards will be met by 2029, ministers will announce.And, for the first time, the government will commit to ensuring that, from 2035, 75% of patients will be either cancer-free or living well, which means a normal life with the disease under control five years after being diagnosed. Currently, six in 10 survive five years or more.According to the Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC), this would mean 320,000 more lives saved over the 10-year plan.‘Deadly postcode lottery’ restricting new cancer treatments in England, doctors sayRead moreThe strategy, which cancer charities and health groups have repeatedly demanded for years, is much needed. A MacmillanCancerSupport report, also due to be published on Wednesday, shows just how common the disease has become. On average, about 1,200 people are now diagnosed every day in the UK or one person every 75 seconds.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, who revealed in 2021 that he had beendiagnosed with and treated for kidney cancerat the age of 38, said: “As a cancer survivor who owes my life to the NHS, I owe it to future patients to make sure they receive the same outstanding care I did.”Cancer was “more likely to be a death sentence in Britain than other countries around the world”, he said, but he was determined to change that. “Thanks to the revolution in medical science and technology, we have the opportunity to transform the life chances of cancer patients,” he added.AI use in breast cancer screening cuts rate of later diagnosis by 12%, study findsRead more“Our cancer plan will invest in and modernise the NHS, so that opportunity can be seized and our ambitions realised. This plan will slash waits, invest in cutting-edge technology, and give every patient the best possible chance of beating cancer.”According to DHSC officials, the plan will include a £2.3bn investment to deliver 9.5m more tests by 2029, investing in more scanners, digital technology and automated testing.Some community diagnostic centres will also operate 12 hours a day, seven days a week. And the number of robot-assisted procedures will increase from 70,000 to half a million by 2035, reducing complications and freeing up more beds.Every patient who might benefit will also be offered a genomic test that analyses the DNA of their cancer with the aim of finding the right treatment, the Guardian has been told.Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS clinical director for cancer, said: “This plan sets a clear roadmap for the NHS to diagnose more cancers earlier, ensure more patients are treated on time and improve survival, so that hundreds of thousands more people live longer, healthier lives with or after cancer over the next decade.”Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK (CRUK), welcomed the plan as she warned that “too many cancer patients” were still waiting too long to start treatment. “England lags behind comparable countries on cancer survival and it’s vital that this changes, so more people affected by cancer can live longer, better lives,” she said.Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund health thinktank and a former executive director of CRUK, was sceptical about the chances of success.While welcoming what she called a “bold” and “ambitious” plan, ministers must be careful not to “put the cart before the horse” and ensure they also delivered basic cancer care swiftly too, she said.“Many hospitals still cannot share imaging or pathology results in a timely way due to old technology holding them back. Addressing this needs to receive as much focus as rolling out major new AI projects,” she added.There were also questions to be asked about the feasibility of the pledge to hit all three main cancer standards.“The system as it stands will not meet the cancer treatment standards by 2029 unless there is a big step-change,” Woolnough said. “The government will need to show it has the answers if it is to achieve its aim of transforming cancer treatment, boosting survival rates and improving quality of life.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealth policyHealthNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

It was unclear how many of the survivors transported to the hospital had been injured.The coastguard said it was not immediately clear how many people had been on the speedboat.Trial of aid workers accused of facilitating illegal entry of migrants into Greece set to beginRead moreVideo footage by a local news site showed at least one person being carried in a blanket from a coastguard boat moored on the side of a jetty into a waiting coastguard vehicle with blue flashing lights, as others appeared to lead two children toward the car.The coastguard did not immediately have further information on exactly how the collision occurred, or on the identities of the casualties or the other passengers on the speedboat.Greece is a major entry point into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Fatal accidents are a common occurrence. Many undertake the short but often perilous crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands in the eastern Aegean.But increased patrols and allegations of pushbacks – summary deportations without allowing for asylum applications – by Greek authorities have reduced crossing attempts.Greece, along with several other EU countries, has been tightening its regulations on migration. In December, the EU was overhauling its migration system, including streamlining deportations and increasing detentions.Explore more on these topicsMigrationGreeceRefugeesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now 82, he’s back on tour – and bracing for a warts-and-all documentary made by his many childrenTue 3 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTShareThe big bloke in the khaki suit speaks quietly these days. We are nestled in the corner of Ted Milton’s studio above a rehearsal space in Deptford, London, cocooned by record boxes, poetry books, plus a single big, bright suitcase, and I have to nudge the recorder closer to pick up his voice. Milton – a saxophonist, poet, countercultural survivor and one-time avant garde puppeteer – is 82, and uses a couple of sticks to get around, yet he is once again going on the road across Europe with his long-running band Blurt, as well as releasing a new album with his duo the Odes.Today, he is making record covers destined for the tour merch table with the help of his old woodblock setup. “That orange suitcase?” he points across the desk. “I just bought it.” He booms out a massive laugh, as if to prove he still has the lung power to command a room. “I’m a fetishist about luggage. I know how to survive touring. Haha!”At many gamechanging moments in British postwar culture, Milton was skulking in the background somewhere, with mischief not far away. He recalls sharing taxis with William S Burroughs when the Beat godfather came to London in the early 1960s; he was described as a visionary by old drinking buddy Eric Clapton; his puppet show crashed its way into the Monty Python universe by being featured in Terry Gilliam’s 1977 film Jabberwocky; a legendary lost promotional film for Pink Floyd’s 1967 song Scream Thy Last Scream is rumoured to feature Milton’s overcoat in a leading role via the wonder of animatronics. And there is no band quite like Blurt, a bass-less trio of drums, guitar and Milton’s horns and vocals throwing down raucous, jazzy blowouts. “The groove they had was utterly fabulous,” says long-term fan Graham Lewis, of post-punks Wire.Now, in the autumn of a long and sometimes outrageous life, the tables have been turned by Milton’s own family. He was married three times and had five children, the most recent when he was nearly 70, and a new film by son George Milton,The Last Puppet Show, aims to explore his father’s work and sometimes fraught relationships via the ingenious medium of his newly reanimated puppets. “It’s like a therapy session for kids,” he says of the film, cautiously. It’s your family confronting you with their point of view, I say. “That’s what I’m afraid of.”Milton had a fragile relationship with his own parents, which laid seeds that flowered throughout his rebellious career. “My parents moved to west Africa when I was 11 and I went to a boarding school,” he recalls, which brought independence, but also repression and bullying, and he found solace through music. “I had a Dansette record player – Elvis, Carl Perkins, Little Richard.” But his other safety valve was disobedience. “I was looking to disrupt classes. Just be an arsehole, you know?”He dabbled with art studies in Cambridge, and also the city’s jazz scene, before eventually falling in, quite literally, with the London bohemian set. “I went down to this jazz festival. I was rescued from lying in the mud by a group of beatnik looking people including [poet] Pete Brown. They took me back to London.” Brown encouraged his poetry, which even made it into The Paris Review in 1963. As Milton admits, he sometimes invoked the vocation of struggling poet simply to cadge drinks from strangers.View image in fullscreenMilton at his work bench in Deptford.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBy the middle of the decade, Milton was living with girlfriend Clarissa in “a period of bohemian debauchery in Long Acre [Covent Garden]. Eric used to come round there quite a lot.” This wasEric Clapton, who recalls in his autobiography how Milton would spin Howlin’ Wolf and channel the music into dance and acting: “I understood how you could listen to music completely and make it come alive … it was a real awakening,” he wrote. Milton never lost this knack for performance. But whereas his old mate Pete Brown worked as lyricist for Clapton’s Cream, Milton reckons he passed up similar opportunities for Pink Floyd, whose managers Andrew King and Peter Jenner were also on the scene.“If success was presented to Ted on a silver platter, he’d piss on it,” declares Roger Law, co-creator of Spitting Image. He’s at home in Norfolk at a kitchen table piled with books and illustrations, including Milton’s rough-hewn poetry pamphlets. The pair first met at the Cambridge School of Art and raised hell together, and linked up once again in London, sharing their dark sense of humour and appreciation for the absurd. “If you talk to Ted,” says Law, recalling their benders together, “you can’t tell the surreal from the reality.”In the late 1960s, Milton took a post at a puppet theatre in Wolverhampton. “Then I moved to glove shows.” He mimes a Punch & Judy style performance with his hands. “It’s a whole different dynamic: violence. So I moved to that. I call it performance animation.” Law lauds Milton’s uncanny ability to bring puppets alive; the man behind Spitting Image should know. But for Milton, “puppets’ eyes are dead. They don’t feel challenged, they’re not afraid. This gives you this unrecognised but really potent possibility to get into people, and you can go to places in their head they don’t want you to.”View image in fullscreenPlaying with his son George in 1971.Photograph: Courtesy George MiltonMilton’s skill in puppetry – showcased on Brighton’s West Pier, and then to numerous school audiences across Europe – led to some of the strangest support slots in 70s rock music, for Clapton and Ian Dury among others. Milton compares it to the urban myth of salesmen hardening themselves up by hawking peanuts on the street. “I was doing support for Clapton [in 1976], we were doing a performance in the round. I got the puppet theatre out there, the puppets arethis big– ” he holds his hands a small distance apart “– and we’re talking about 1,000 people. Immediately, a roar comes up: ‘fuck off!’” Dury, meanwhile, would sometimes come to the stage to ask the audience to cool it.But Milton’s outrageous, profane performances, with their anti-authoritarian message and Brechtian aesthetic, featuring characters such as Deepthroat Porker, Constable Nosey Parker and The Egg Dog, eventually gained a rep. Tony Wilson featured Milton’s puppetry on his groundbreaking So It Goes TV show in 1976, which caught the attention of Graham Lewis and Colin Newman, soon to be of post-punk band Wire. The puppet show slotted seamlessly into the violent medieval anarchy of Gilliam’s film Jabberwocky. When Milton then picked up a saxophone a few years later and formed Blurt, Wilson made them one of the first bands from outside Manchester to feature on his Factory Records label, and Wire invited them on to their bills. Milton’s subversive art had found a new home in the post-punk era.View image in fullscreenMilton pictured in 1985.Photograph: Paul WigensMilton is a born performer, and Wire’s Lewis was immediately hooked: “Blurt were totally captivating,” he enthuses. A 1984 solo Milton track, Love Is Like a Violence, would even become an unlikely floor-filler at Glasgow’s hip Optimo club night in the 2000s. Although Blurt bounced between many record labels over the decades, Milton always made his way back to the spotlight eventually.He’s very much front and centre of The Last Puppet Show: the film is a reckoning with the man Milton used to be, which for his associates was a driven artist, and for his family a sometimes wayward father. A chunk of the budget is intended for creating a new set of puppets to dramatise its scenes; Milton says the old ones were either sent to Alaska, or symbolically burned. “I don’t suppose I made any attempt to make any concessions to anybody anywhere along the line,” he admits, looking back on his wilder days. “One person beat me up.” I ask who it was, and it turns out to be one of his own bandmates.While Milton’s anti-authoritarian streak remains as strong as ever, age has now forced him to start making compromises. “The last couple of shows I’ve had to do sitting down, which I really dreaded. But actually it kind of opens up a different dynamic,” he says, looking forward as ever to the next gig. “It seems to make things more concentrated somehow.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t suppose I made any attempt to make any concessions to anybody anywhere along the line’ … Milton and friends.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianI ask what he thinks it was about his performances that gripped Eric Clapton all those years ago, and whether he’s the same person now. “I think we’re talking about charisma. And charisma is a form of psychosis, to my mind.” He cites Alice Miller’s book The Drama of the Gifted Child, whose thesis holds that children are often forced to suppress their authentic selves, to support his point.“This kind of intense self-consciousness has abated, mercifully,” he reflects, with a more easy-going perspective brought by age. “One person described it as feeling like you’re walking about on stilts all the time, and that’s it – every movement it’s like someone looking at you.” In other words, you felt like a performer all of the time? “Yeah. I’m not like that any more. Hahaha!”Blurt are currently on tour across Europe. The Odes’ Déjeuner Sous L’Herbe is released by Not Applicable on 6 February.

Then we asked readers to share their own milestone TV moments. Here are the best.1953:the coronationView image in fullscreenCrowning achievement … the 1953 coronation.Photograph: BBCMum and dad bought a Vidor TV for the coronation in 1953. We used to watch theTelevisionNewsreel on Saturday evening – I was fascinated by the start, which was the BBC revolving round the Alexandra TV tower. I think this (together with listening to the shipping forecast on the radio) is what sparked my lifelong obsession with radio! It is still with me 70+ years later.Phil Holliday, 78, New Zealand1969:the Apollo 11 moon landingView image in fullscreenSatellite TV … the Apollo 11 moon landing.Photograph: REX/ShutterstockI can still remember my father waking me up late at night to watch the first human landing on the moon. He woke me because he had to share this event with someone and didn’t want to wake my mother. He said: “Sorry to wake you up, son, but you must come and see this. You’ll never see anything like this again.” And so we sat and watched it on our old stuttering black-and-white television, and although I wasn’t aware of the immense significance of the moment, I became caught up in my father’s fascination and excitement. I’ll never forget that night.Laurie, West Midlands1972: David Bowie on Top of the PopsView image in fullscreenStraight to the point … David Bowie’s 1972 Top of the Pops performance.Photograph: BBCDavid Bowie’s performance of Starman created a wave of enthusiasm for some, and scandal for others. This was the character Ziggy Stardust who was to forever change the face of popular music, not just in the UK. He was mesmerising and I was enthralled. He had a twinkle in his eye that told me he knew something that I did not. The UK was still very homophobic in the early 70s and Bowie suggestively putting his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson had some people spluttering with indignation. The high point was probably when he looked straight into the camera and pointed at us while singing the lyrics, “I had to phone someone so I picked on you”.Ian Wright, Berlin, Germany1976:Sex Pistols appear on the Bill Grundy ShowView image in fullscreenSwearing in ceremony … Sex Pistols on the Bill Grundy Show in 1976.Photograph: Thames TelevisionSex Pistols on the Bill Grundy show, with a few swear words and the allegedly inebriated Grundy flirting badly with Siouxsie Sioux. As a teenager, it really resonated with me.Peter Collins, 63, London1982: thelaunch of the first Welsh-language channelView image in fullscreenKiller Wales … the S4C logo in 1982.Photograph: S4CThe launch of the first Welsh-language channel, S4C. I’d argue that the emergence of a Welsh-language channel was a very important moment, not just for the Welsh language and people of Wales, but for all minoritised people and languages.Liam, Cymru1985:Live AidView image in fullscreenHe will rock you … Freddie Mercury performing with Queen at Live Aid in 1985.Photograph: Langevin Jacques/Jacques LangevinFor one brief moment, it seemed as if the entire world was grooving on a single wavelength that said: “if we’re going to do this, it’s gonna take everyone … ”Christopher,USA1990: Nelson Mandela’s release from prisonView image in fullscreenFree spirit … Nelson Mandela, and his wife Winnie, on the day of his release.Photograph: Greg English/APHaving grown up in a world where apartheid was the norm, it was nearly unbelievable then to see this older, graceful man making his way to freedom. The meaning behind it was beautiful. I watched it with some of my extended family, about 15 of us, and we were all crying.Angela Adams, 55, Hainault1993:Tales of the CityView image in fullscreenOut and about … Laura Linney and Thomas Gibson in Tales of the City.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI was living in the foothills of Snowdonia, having recently given up teaching French at Bangor University, in favour of following a path of gay activism and becoming Wales’s first HIV outreach worker for the Gwynedd health authority. I had come out in Paris a few years previously, friends were dying with Aids, and I was outraged by the massive cover-up going on in the UK around engaging in effective prevention and care for gay and bisexual men around HIV/Aids. Then cameOut on Tuesday– the Channel 4 series which was the world’s first networked television series aimed at a lesbian and gay audience. It was followed by Tales of the City, a TV dramatisation of a set of novels that were my bible and guiding light towards freedom, love and community. The airing of the book helped me believe that what I was fighting for was possible and not just a dream. I would invite friends round, crack open a bottle of wine and we would live the dream, from our remote Welsh hills.David Lynch, 62, Cambridge1994:Melvyn Bragg interviews Dennis PotterView image in fullscreenThe play’s the thing … Melvyn Bragg interviewing Dennis Potter.Photograph: YoutubeWithout a doubt, Melvyn Bragg interviewing Dennis Potter shortly before the end of the latter’s life. Funny, sad, profoundly moving: as an event it will stay with me always.Judith Rhodes, 73, Leeds1998: David Attenborough and the lyre birdView image in fullscreenI can see a lyre … David Attenborough in The Life of Birds in 1998.Photograph: BBCDavid Attenborough is in a forest with a lyre bird in south-eastern Australia, which mimics the sounds of the chainsaws felling the trees and destroying its habitat. It was a wake-up call to the effects of humans destroying the balance of nature on our planet. It has stuck with me ever since.Amalie Rothschild, 80, Florence2000: Chandler proposes to Monica on FriendsView image in fullscreenRinging in the new millennium … Chandler Bing proposes to Monica Geller in Friends.Photograph: NBC/Getty ImagesWe all thought Chandler had lost his chance. When he burst into the apartment to find Monica there, surrounded by candles, waiting for him, and they both drop to their knees, the joy and relief was palpable. It still makes me cry every time I watch it.Sandra Hochstein, 72,Canada2001: The West Wing – Two CathedralsView image in fullscreenHoly smokes … Martin Sheen as President Bartlet in The West Wing.Photograph: The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock PhotoMy dad used to watch The West Wing when I was young. He wouldn’t allow me to watch the entire episode, but he would let me watch the title sequence. I’m not sure why, but I was obsessed with it. Fifteen years on, it’s my favourite show. If I had to choose one moment, it has to be President Bartlet arguing with God in the brilliant episode Two Cathedrals. When Jed gets the Secret Service to shut down the Washington Cathedral after a funeral and begins to argue with the Lord himself, it’s hard not to appreciate how cool the guy looks doing it. It’s perfect TV.Daniel, 24, France2003:Tim and Dawn finally kiss in The OfficeView image in fullscreenA Christmas miracle … Tim and Dawn finally get together in The Office.Photograph: YoutubeWhen Tim and Dawn get it together in The Office. I’d ached for Tim in his seemingly unrequited adoration of Dawn, who struggled to contain her growing attraction to him. A surprising and unlikely denouement to a series not always kind to its characters.Ann, 75, London2009:the lawnmower incident on Mad MenView image in fullscreenMaking the cut … the lawnmower incident on Mad Men.Photograph: YoutubeMad Men: season three, episode six. The advertising agency is having a party, everyone is pretty loose. Then a secretary starts riding a lawnmower and runs over the soon-to-be head of the company. The scene is graphic and shocking. The agency, and the United States at the time, are on the brink of great change.Maria, London2010:the Tenth Doctor’s regeneration on Doctor WhoView image in fullscreenOh Time Lordy … David Tennant’s Doctor regenerating in Doctor Who.Photograph: YoutubeI was very into Doctor Who as a child, and I remember being enthralled by the Tenth Doctor’s (David Tennant) regeneration into the Eleventh (Matt Smith). My family and I were all sitting in our old living room. I would’ve been about four or five years old at the time, and I’ve probably supplemented this with memories from iPlayer. But the main impact was my eight-year-long obsession with Doctor Who.Issy, 21, London2016:Peter Marsh crashes out on Come Dine With MeView image in fullscreenSour grapes … Peter Marsh (right) on Come Dine With Me.Photograph: Channel 4The best moment is the 2016 Come Dine With Me episode where Peter Marsh does not appreciate his finishing position. So often on TV, everyone is very gracious when losing, congratulating the winners. This time, however, in a very un-British lack of decorum, Peter took umbrage at his loss, and uttered such iconic insults as “Dear lord, what a sad little life, Jane,” and “You have all the grace of a reversing dump truck without any tyres on.” Truly iconic.Mike, 41, Warwickshire2016:The Battle of the Bastards on Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenTough mudder … Kristofer Hivju as Tormund and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in The Battle of the Bastards.Photograph: HBOA sensational episode of television. It captures the raw violence of war on horseback very well and the hopelessness Jon Snow feels when it looks as if he is about to be crushed to death. This episode also has a very satisfying ending, where Sansa Stark gets to exact some sort of revenge on Ramsay Bolton, and not before time. Glorious.Brian Molan, 45, Cork2021:Roman Roy’s accidental sext on SuccessionView image in fullscreenTake your pic … Kieran Culkin as Roman Roy in Succession.Photograph: Graeme HunterI’d love to say something high-brow but that would be disingenuous. My actual favourite TV moment of all time is in Succession (obviously) when Roman Roy accidentally sends a very intimate pic to his father, Logan Roy, and the realisation and fallout of what he has done plays out on screen. One of the most shocking, hilarious, hands-over-your-face, cringing-on-his-behalf moments of TV I have ever seen! Glorious.Paul Cahill, 43, Dublin2022:Andy’s discovery in DetectoristsView image in fullscreenOut standing in their field … Toby Jones and Mackenzie Crook in Detectorists.Photograph: Chris Harris/BBC/Channel XIn the first episode of final series of Mackenzie Crook’s sublime Detectorists, Andy (Crook) sounds a hawking whistle and the landscape flashes back in history to reveal the original owner calling her bird to return in a magical sequence. The scene is given further poignance by the accompaniment of the Unthanks’ equally wonderful song Magpie.Alex Simpson, SolihullThis article was amended on 3 February 2026. An earlier version featured an image of David Attenborough with a greater bird-of-paradise to illustrate his interaction with a lyre bird.

A severe injury, coupled with a sudden worsening of her health, had left her unable to sit upright, while brain fog and fatigue made reading and writing impossible. So the award-winning novelist and poet fell back on her art school training, using the energy and materials she had to hand to create impressionistic paintings of her surroundings – her cat Uisce, her boyfriend’s PlayStation controller – alongside unsettling imagery of enclosed gardens and flowers decaying.“Making the paintings was a way of coexisting with pain,” says the 34-year-old. “I was on my living room floor in agony for a few hours, but I wanted to get something out of that time. I’ve always been fascinated by artists and writers who turn limitations into formal constraints. I see the paintings as my attempt at that.”The works were made with basic materials: “quite cheap” paper, paints and brushes, as well as kinesiology tape, an adhesive that Lafarge, who has the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, uses to provide support to her joints and ligaments. Seeing as the tape needs to be cut in very specific ways, it leaves behind distinctive butterfly-shaped remnants that Lafarge repurposed into decorative elements. The watercolours will be accompanied by a poem cycle inspired by William Blake’s The Sick Rose and the 13th-century text The Romance of the Rose, drawing on the principles of courtly love to tell the allegorical story of a relationship in which pain is characterised as an “intoxicating, sometimes quite violent” lover.Is Nnena Kalu’s Turner win really a turning point, unless disabled people can afford to be alive in this country?The paintings and poetry will be on display this month at Dundee Contemporary Arts Centre as part of We Contain Multitudes, an exhibition bringing together the work of four artists with disabilities. Also showing are Jo Longhurst, whose latest project is inspired by bindweed, an unwanted yet resilient plant; Andrew Gannon, who creates work modelled on casts of his left arm; and Nnena Kalu, whose highly textural, cocoon-like sculptures and drawingsgained her the 2025 Turner prize– the first time it had been awarded to an artist with learning disabilities.View image in fullscreenDaisy Lafarge: ‘Making the paintings was a way of coexisting with pain.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“I think it’s great that Nnena won the Turner,” says Lafarge. “I’m yet to see her work in the flesh, but I love the way it takes up space, its undaunted physicality. I hope it leads to more inclusion of disabled artists. But I don’t want to be naively optimistic. I just find it so hard to disentangle from the fact that disabled artists are disabled people. So is it really a turning point, unless disabled people can afford to be alive in this country? And that comes down to structural issues: are they able to heat their own homes, pay their carers and access very basic things? It’s been an incredibly bleak time from that perspective. A celebratory representation without actual material change is kind of meaningless.”For many disabled people, the effort of managing complex conditions and chronic pain is exacerbated by the bureaucratic hurdles they face to receive treatment and support. Lafarge, who lives in Glasgow, has never been able to see a specialist for Ehlers-Danlos on the NHS, as there are none in Scotland. Many of her paintings were made while being put on lengthy call queues for adult disability payment, the Scottish equivalent of personal independence payment. “When you’re trying to get support from these institutions, which are punitive in various ways, that can take a lot out of you as well. Those processes can be incredibly difficult.”View image in fullscreenYour Pain Is As Unique As You Are, 2024.Photograph: Eleni Avraam/Daisy LafargeThe welfare cuts implemented by Labour last year were a “huge assault” on disability rights, says Lafarge, but she accepts there has been progress in certain areas, such as the increasing use of access documents, in which art workers set out the adjustments they will require from a venue, such as wheelchair ramps or regular breaks. “Most of the time now, thankfully, they’ll come back and say, ‘Yes.’ But sometimes they’ll say, ‘No, we can’t.’”Lafarge hopes exhibitions like We Contain Multitudes can challenge preconceptions about disabled artists – and by extension disabled people. Its four artists represent a diversity of conditions, and each tackles the subject of disability in a very different way. “One great thing to come out of this show would be for people to say, ‘I wouldn’t have assumed the artist who made that is disabled’ – because it shouldn’t have to be obvious from the content.”View image in fullscreenGate Theory of Pain (III), 2024.Photograph: Eleni Avraam/Daisy LafargeShe hopes her paintings and poems will speak to people regardless of any physical ability. “You don’t have to be disabled to engage with this work. That’s a diminishing of it.”She has thought a lot about the concept of identity. “When I was first diagnosed, I really didn’t want to over-identify with it and say, ‘I am a writer with this condition.’ I just wanted to be a writer, or I wanted to be an artist. There’s this pressure to outwardly identify with something you might feel personally ambivalent about. That’s frustrating.”‘Nnena Kalu was ready for this – nobody else was’: how her Turner prize victory shook the art worldRead moreDisability, she says, shouldn’t be seen as something removed from the everyday, ora separate category of personhood. “People don’t realise that this work is about them as well,” says Lafarge. “Many people will, either through old age or injury or illness, come to know something of that experience. We’reone in fourpeople. It’s not unusual. This implicates all of us.”We Contain Multitudes is atDundee Contemporary Artsfrom 7 February to 26 April.

But Kermit’s voice takes some getting used to …Lucy ManganTue 3 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 12.14 ESTShareThe Muppet Show celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Or so it is alleged. Obviously this cannot be true, because it would mean that all of us who remember gathering around the television for the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational half hour of the week must also be … Well, anyway. Let us not dwell.Let us remember instead the magic that ensued as Jim Henson’s creation unfurled before us, as the chaotic troupe of puppets put on their traditional vaudeville show. The permanent cast included the inimitable Miss Piggy (“I don’t care what you think of me. Unless you think I am awesome, in which case you are right”), Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, sombre patriot Sam Eagle (“Freakos one, civilisation zero”), assorted pigs (often in space), scientist Dr Bunsen Honeydew and his heartbreakingly hapless assistant Beaker (the latter granting some of us our first stirrings of true empathy), and many, many chickens. There was also a guest appearance each episode by a famous human comedian, actor or musician. It could be anyone from Julie Andrews to Dudley Moore, as long as they could be trusted to play it straight and believe in their co-stars. It was all held together, if only just, by earnest, frazzled host and stage manager Kermit the Frog and his assistant, Scooter, despite constant heckling from the exquisitely cantankerous Statler and Waldorf looking down on the show, in every sense, from their box seats.Itwasmagical. Really, it was.To commemorate the anniversary, Disney (who acquired the Muppetational rights from the Jim Henson Company in 2004) has got the old gang together and added guest appearances from Sabrina Carpenter, Seth Rogen (also executive producer) and Maya Rudolph for a one-off half-hour special.God bless everyone involved – they’ve tried. You can feel it. They want to make it good for us. They know we deserve it. They know the Muppets deserve it. They know everybody at the moment desperately needs a brief, shining moment out of the darkness. But, as Thomas Wolfe so rightly said, you can’t go home again.Look, it’s fine. If you have never seen the original, it’s probably even good. If you have, there are still moments that tease at taste and memory, such as Miss Piggy’s entrance. “Isn’t it wonderful being back in the theatre, giving people what they want?” she sighs contentedly to Kermit. “Moi”. Or Miss Piggy’s first meeting with Sabrina C, who tells the diva she has based her whole look on Miss Piggy. “My attorneys and I have noticed,” says her idol sweetly. “And we will be in touch.” And Miss Piggy’s response to Sabrina telling her how much she loves her: “I grew up with you! My parents grew up with you! Their parents grew up w—” “OK,” Miss Piggy interrupts in her alternative, unmistakably guttural register.View image in fullscreen‘Inimitable’ … Miss Piggy in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+The Bridgerton pastiche captures something of the old Muppet spirit, too, as a pig in a Regency wig confesses he has fallen in love with someone else “whomst I am tornst betweenst”. So does Honeydew’s experiment on Beaker (“This won’t hurt me a bit!”), which causes his eyes to fall out.But all the bits in between? They are drab. The script – including and most obviously Statler and Waldorf’s heckles – is begging for a polish (and for certain jokes, like the one between Kermit and Carpenter about kink, to be cut). Is this, despite the half-century’s notice they’ve had, a rush job? Or has the show’s time simply passed and no one can carry off exuberant silliness any more? Should we give up on frivolity in these decidedly unfrivolous times? Or double down on the attempt? If this one-off does lead to a series, I’d still tune in with hope. There’s enough to build on here.View image in fullscreen‘Our dearest frog sounds jarringly different’ … Kermit alongside Rowlf the Dog in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+There does remain the nagging problem of Kermit’s voice – probably one of the most distinctive in history. Henson himself performed the character until his death in 1990. Veteran Muppeteer Steve Whitmire inherited the role and played it until he was dismissed by Disney for what they called “unacceptable business conduct”, amid a welter of supporting and contradicting claims by those who had been involved in the show. Matt Vogel now plays the character and though he does so perfectly well, our dearest frog sounds jarringly different to anyone born before Vogel’s tenure. It puts the magic even further out of reach. But maybe only to us. And we’ve had our time.If nothing else, it will entertain children for half an hour and give them the not inconsiderable gift of being introduced to Miss Piggy, and perhaps even more valuably alerting their parents to the fact that all five series of the original are available on the streaming platform. Let it soothe you while we all hunker down and pray for a return to simpler, happier times.The Muppet Show is on Disney+ from 4 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDisney+Children's TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Ramzi Haidar/EPAIn spring 2003, exuberance at the fall of Saddam was swiftly followed by a descent into deadly chaos. Whether moving independently or embedded with troops, Guardian reporters witnessed the violence on the groundByIan MayesTue 3 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleThe allied attack on Iraq began on 20 March 2003. The Guardian’s 4am edition on Friday 21 March carriedthe headline: “Land, sea and air assault.” The report was by Julian Borger in Washington and Rory McCarthy in Camp As Sayliyah, on the outskirts of Doha, the capital of Qatar. It opened: “The ground war began in Iraq last night as British and American marines stormed beaches on the Gulf coast in an assault on the south-eastern city of Basra, while explosions lit up Baghdad under a heavy bombardment by cruise missiles.”The first British fatalities came shortly afterwards when a US helicopter crashed in Kuwait, killing all on board. Suzanne Goldenberg’s front-page report from Baghdad revealed that only two hours after the decapitation effort, Saddam Hussein himself had made a defiant appearance on television. AGuardian leaderstated that the plain fact was this first “surgical strike” had missed its mark. Even had it reached its target, it would have been difficult to applaud. “State-ordered assassination sets an abominable precedent that encourages unwelcome emulation … The US must tread carefully – for the legal and moral grounds for this war are already very shaky.”By then, events had moved on. The violent display of the “shock and awe” assault on the regime’s infrastructure in and around the capital came that same night. Theheadline on the Saturday 4am edition read: “Full-blooded onslaught is launched on Baghdad”. Julian Borger, Richard Norton-Taylor and Rory McCarthy contributed to the report, describing the “successive waves of aerial attacks on centres and symbols of Saddam Hussein’s power in an attempt to break the nerve of his regime”. The presidential complex on the west bank of the Tigris River was razed in little more than 10 minutes.View image in fullscreenThe-Guardian’s front page on 21 March 2003.Photograph: The GuardianGoldenberg and the photographer Sean Smith had already been in Iraq for a couple of weeks when the impending war began to close in on normal life.Smith’s photographsof what would be one of the last meetings at Baghdad racetrack, a football match and a wedding party all had more than a touch of pathos. Smith, via Israel-Palestine and Afghanistan, was already known for chronicling the casual brutalities of war. No one would better capture “the indignity and smoky pointlessness” of the Iraq conflict than Smith, as the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow put it in an introduction to a collection of his work.“Sean totally had my back inIraqor in Lebanon,” Goldenberg said. “There are lots of people I won’t go out with in war situations; I don’t want to be with somebody who is not calm. I’m not saying you shouldn’t be afraid, but you should be able to deal with your fear. You should know when to leave, when you’ve got enough and when to go, and how to weigh those dangers. I never worry about that with Sean. I’d never, ever, even for an instant think that Sean would ditch me in a difficult situation.”He was also very good with people, despite having an awkward relationship with the picture desk in London, which left him for periods feeling, to use his word, “ostracised”. It could be that, with camera in hand, he moved more easily in the menacing air of Iraq at that time than in the subtly politicised atmosphere of the Guardian’s offices in Farringdon Road.Smith had arrived burdened with a satellite phone (its use was forbidden in the hotel, the dish being likely to attract gunfire) and old-fashioned photographic equipment, including cumbersome developing trays and liquids. This was in case the weapon that the Americans were threatening to use to put Saddam’s electronic equipment out of action should accidentally do the same for the Guardian’s. Smith neglected to provide himself with the strongly advised helmet, flak jacket and chemical warfare protection suit. This was not bravado or the dangerous idea of a charmed life. It was more like fatalism, arising out of his idea of the random nature of war.For the moment, Smith and Goldenberg had to observe the “shock and awe” attack on Baghdad from the relative safety of the Palestine hotel on the eastern bank of the Tigris (they were still staying at the hotel in April when a US tankfired a shellat a 15th-floor balcony, killing two cameramen).View image in fullscreenSean Smith’s photograph of the last football match in Baghdad before the invasion in 2003.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianAn image of the blitzing of Baghdad ran across the front page, alongside Goldenberg’s account: “From the east side of the river, it was like watching a gigantic video game. As soon as one building was hit, low-flying jets struck again, barely before there was time to register the damage. They set off great jets of fire as easily as the flick of a cigarette lighter … People crept out of their homes and drifted towards the collection of riverside restaurants for a better view. It was impossible to deny the sense of shock that descended on Iraqis, reduced to spectators to the elimination of a regime that had controlled every aspect of their lives since the time before many were born.”The foot of the page was taken up by a vivid dispatch from James Meek in the southern Iraqi town of Safwan. “Yesterday afternoon a truck drove down a side road … laden with rugs and furniture. Booty or precious possessions? In a day of death, joy and looting, it was hard to know. As the passengers spotted European faces, one boy grinned and put his thumb up. The other nervously waved a white flag. The mixed messages defined the moment: Thank you. We love you. Please don’t kill us.”James Meek was not among the several hundred journalists embedded with US and British forces. Embedding was a device that, viewed one way, provided reporters with unprecedented access to the action; viewed another way, it was a system that enabled the military hosts to exercise tacit or actual control over media coverage. Meek, by various definitions, was a unilateral, or a “maverick”, “out of pool” journalist – that is, a journalist working exclusively for his employer and not required, as pool reporters attached to the military were, to share his reports with other papers. The great advantage the unilateral gained was easier access to the Iraqi citizens. Yet in the end, the differences were not so sharply defined. The free-range Meek, as the war progressed, confessed to becoming attached “by an umbilical cord” to army units, who were often helpful. “The CIA even lent us jump-leads to start our car,” he said.Meek’s colleague, Jamie Wilson, was one of the embedded, in his case with the Royal Navy on HMS Marlborough as it made its way up the Khor Abdullah waterway to shell Iraqi positions on al-Faw peninsula. His satellite and mobile phones were confiscated as he boarded. He was told in advance when the invasion would start and his conversations with the news desk over the ship’s secure radio were closely monitored, “presumably to curb my natural instinct to shout, ‘It’s going to start on Thursday!’” he said.View image in fullscreenGuardian journalist Audrey Gillan during the Iraq war.Photograph: Bruce AdamsMore dramatically, Audrey Gillanwas embeddedwith the 105 men of the Household Cavalry’s D Squadron, an advance reconnaissance arm of the 5,500-strong 16 Air Assault Brigade. A persistent criticism from other journalists was that the embeds, whether working for visual media or print, quickly assimilated, identifying themselves with their host units – typically through the use of what some saw as the incriminating pronoun “we”. In fact, Gillan very rarely used it in that way. An exception was a piece in which she wrote about the squadron’s first rest after it had been on the frontline for 13 days and lost three men – one killed by friendly fire, the others in an accident when their Scimitar tank overturned into a canal. The half a dozen times “we” cropped up in her report indicated relief at the respite from danger.Gillan remembered how it began. The introductions had been made at Camp Eagle inKuwait. “Along with Daily Mail photographer Bruce Adams, the only other journalist with the squadron, I was shown into a large Bedouin tent filled with semi-naked, tattooed soldiers, men I would come to spend the next five weeks with. Towards the back were the officers, and it was here that I found squadron leader [Maj] Richard Taylor. He sat us down and said, in the politest of Household Cavalry tones: ‘When we are out in our vehicles in the field we live together, eat together, sleep together, fart together and wash our bollocks together. Do you think you can handle it?’ … I was shouted at and ordered around – I simply became ‘one of the boys’. Learning to swear like a trooper probably helped, too.”The Household Cavalry had come under heavy attack from Iraqi artillery and in fierce battles with T-55 tanks. Gillan wrote: “I watched men desperately try to resuscitate their fallen colleagues and shake at their inability to fight with fate. I saw them weep as they learned of the death of men they had spoken to just that morning, men they had worked with for years, drunk with, played football with. Sometimes, as we took incoming fire, they hugged me, but they hugged each other as well.”Despite prewar pledges to do everything possible to minimise civilian casualties, there were the inevitable disasters. Less than a week into the war, a bomb struck a market in Baghdad, killing 14 people: “Wayward bombs bring marketplace carnage”, read the headline onGoldenberg’s report. The accompanying photograph of a clearly recognisable victim of the bombing was taken by the Serbian photographer Goran Tomašević of Reuters. The paper was both praised and strongly criticised for publishing it.Near the beginning of April, in an article for G2, Fiachra Gibbons addressed the threat the war posed to Iraqi antiquities. He described the dangers of irreparable loss in a country that was a treasury of ancient cultures. It was an augury of worse to come. Ten days later,a dispatch from Luke Hardingwas headed: “Mosul descends into chaos as even museum is looted”. Harding reported that the Pentagon had promised that thousands of soldiers would prevent such things. In the event, they were nowhere to be seen. Two days after this, Jonathan Steele’sreport from Baghdaddrew attention to the Iraq Museum, which was suffering the same fate.View image in fullscreenSuzanne Goldenberg reporting for The Guardian from Baghdad, Iraq.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianYet it was the human casualties that made the deepest impression. One of the most moving dispatchescame from Goldenbergon 9 April 2003. It marked the last hours of resistance to US forces as they swept through the capital. It ran on the front page. The headline was simply a quotation from Goldenberg’s text: “A picture of killing inflicted on a sprawling city – and it grew more unbearable by the minute”. A six-column photograph by Jerome Delay of Associated Press was captioned: “Bodies lie on top of each other in the morgue of al-Kindi hospital in eastern Baghdad where the flow of casualties has overwhelmed doctors.”Goldenberg had gone to see for herself: “In two adjoining stalls of the casualty ward of Kindi hospital, the main trauma centre of eastern Baghdad, a girl, long black plait held off her forehead by a red alice band, was laid out beside her little brother. Their mother lay across the aisle, beige dress soaked in blood from hem to armpits. Another brother slumped on the floor, insensible to the fact that he was sitting in his mother’s blood. A neighbour who had followed the family to hospital said the girl had been called Noor Sabah and was 12 years old, though she looked smaller next to the doctors who surged into the examining cubicle. Her brother, Abdel Khader, who began the day neatly dressed in dark trousers and a check shirt, was four or five. When their two small corpses were loaded on to the same trolley to take them to the morgue, even the nurses were reduced to tears.”The collapse of the regime was – too neatly – symbolised by the toppling of the statue of Saddam in Firdos Square on 9 April 2003. The following day’s Guardian carried Goldenberg’s1,800-word accountbeneath the headline: “The toppling of Saddam – an end to 30 years of brutal rule”. After witnessing the statue’s fall, Goldenberg headed across the Tigris to Saddam City, a huge, overcrowded residential district. “The tanks had been and gone, and a carnival of looting was under way … There was no sign of police, or the militias from the ruling Ba’ath party … Saddam City was in the grip of the very nightmare Iraqis had envisaged for the ending of this war: rioting and lawlessness.”Harding, who had been in Kurdish northern Iraq for several weeks, was able to recordecstatic scenes in Sulaymaniyah, the regional capital, when news of the collapse of Saddam’s regime seemed finally incontrovertible. Thousands celebrated and a group of US special forces soldiers were mobbed with shouts of “I love George Bush” and “We love America. We love Britain.”Harding and Steele, who had made the journey out from Baghdad, were both present when US marinestook over Saddam’s home townof Tikrit. It marked the end, the Americans announced, of “major combat operations” in Iraq.View image in fullscreenAn American soldier watches as a statue of Saddam Hussein falls in central Baghdad, April 2003.Photograph: Goran Tomašević/ReutersA flurry of polls and statistics accompanied the fall of Baghdad. A new Guardian/ICM Iraq tracker poll showed support for the war running at arecord level of 54%, having risen from only 29% in mid-February.Opposition had dropped to an all-time low of 23%. But as Bush delivered his televised victory address to the US nation, theaccompanying Guardian leadercarried a note of caution: “War’s loose ends – Iraq is not yet as free as Bush claims”. Was it worth it, after all? “Mr Bush and Mr Blair seem to have no doubts even though both Saddam and his weapons remain embarrassingly elusive … A free Iraq would certainly be a laudable achievement. The trouble is, for all Mr Bush’s jolly nautical self-congratulation, it has not happened yet.”The deputy features editor, Charlie English – who in the run-up to the war had produced an edition of G2 devoted to the cautionary horrors of the war over Kuwait – now produced another special edition of G2 devoted to some of those who had lost their lives, whether American, British or Iraqi. As in the 1991 war, he had been struck by the absence of any accounting for the loss of Iraqi lives. The Guardian’s attempt to compile a memorial that regarded deaths impartially, so far as nationality or allegiance were concerned, personalised the war in a way that some found objectionable. “So once again the Guardian comes over all sanctimonious about the Gulf war dead,” wrote one reader. Others thought it showed G2 at its best. “We had ambitions to do many more but it was very difficult to do,” said English. “Many people still wrote thanking us for it.”There were other voices demanding to be heard, including those from the generation who had grown up in Baghdad under the Ba’athist regime. Throughout the war, the Guardian had published work by two Iraqi friends in their late 20s, both of whom worked initially as interpreters for western journalists. Both came from middle-class Baghdad families. They had been at school together, studied architecture at university and had a strong urge to share the experience of their lives in Iraq as Saddam Hussein’s regime came tumbling down.Up to and through the conflict, Salam Pax, the slightly older of the two, was establishing an international following as the “Baghdad Blogger”, despite determined attempts by the regime to close down communication through the internet. His web diary became, for many thousands in Britain and elsewhere, a point of contact with an Iraq they felt it easy to identify with.Salam’s terrestrial base was his “chaotically untidy” bedroom in his family home in a well-to-do suburb of Baghdad, although he also wrote from the architect’s office where he was employed. His pen name (which combined the words for “peace” in Arabic and Latin) was a pseudonym for Salam Abdulmunem. By the time the war started he was already, in the Guardian’s estimate, “the most famous web diarist in the world”.View image in fullscreenSalam Pax, the Baghdad Blogger, in a cafe in Rashid Street, Baghdad.Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-AhadAs features editor Ian Katz wrote, “Salam’s diary was quite simply the freshest, most exciting writing coming out of Iraq. Two things were instantly striking. The first was its almost giddy irreverence about Saddam’s regime … The second was he was just like us … addressed us in perfect idiomatic English, was obsessed with David Bowie lyrics and awaited the release of the new Massive Attack album as eagerly as any Glastonbury regular … Another ingredient added to the diary’s powerful, subversive appeal: it was, heaven forfend, very funny.”So easily accessible did some readers of the blog find it that they were sceptical of the author’s authenticity – something Salam found greatly irritating, as he told Rory McCarthy, who tracked him down to his home in May 2003.War had been an almost permanent background to the lives of his generation. He would write in his blog on 12 February 2004, addressing the victors, “Saddam is gone, thanks to you. Was it worth it? Be assured it was. We all know that it got to a point where we would have never been rid of Saddam without foreign intervention; I just wish it would have been a bit better planned.”Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, the other friend, was fully identified by his real name on his first appearance in the Guardian, quoted in a report by James Meek as Baghdad fell. Meeting Meek turned out to be a life-changing moment. Both were in the centre of the city when the statue was toppled. Abdul-Ahad had started his day by going to the hotel where the western journalists were lodged, only to be waved away. He went on to Saddam’s palace and then to the headquarters of the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi intelligence services, where he was also turned away. “I saw a red SUV coming, and tried to get a ride.” He chanted the words that had worked elsewhere. “‘Hi, I am British journalist, blah blah …’ ‘Oh really?’ answered the man behind the steering wheel. ‘What a coincidence! So are we. I’m a Guardian reporter. Who are you working for?’ ‘Well, uh … freelance.’ By the end of that day, I had my first job in the world of journalism with that reporter, James Meek. We walked into town, James and I, and saw people burning and looting. I was happy: yes, destroy everything, undo the last four decades of the totalitarian regime, because from this carnage a new country will be built.”For the first year, working for the most part as a fixer and interpreter, Abdul-Ahad took a view on the war similar to that of his friend Salam Pax. Writing in April 2004 on the first anniversary of the conflict, he said, “Do I regret the war, especially now that things seem to be moving towards chaos here? Not at all. I still think we are much better off than under Saddam. At least now we are free to dream.”As time went on, his view began to change. In September 2004, he was witness to an attack by American helicopters in Baghdad on a crowd of civilians who had been celebrating around a burning US armoured personnel carrier:at least 13 civilians were killedand more than 50 injured. Abdul-Ahad photographed the mutilated victims as they lay dying. “You know, [at the outset] I was not a war correspondent. I was an architect. I saw the first dead body in my life on 10 April 2003 – and then I was sucked into this kind of journalism, into war reporting … It became so normal to see body parts that I remember when I came to London for a break in 2005, I carried these huge cameras in case there was a car bomb – it used to be the most natural thing for me to be prepared for a car bomb. The killing, the sectarianism, the kidnapping, you name it, you see your society turned into a society of zombies and I think that’s when I realised that you can’t bring change and democracy through war …“Now, a decade later, I would prefer to go back to live under the military dictatorship, to run away from military service, rather than have this intervention, because Saddam could have collapsed in two years, five years, 10 years, and it would have been a bloody collapse but it would have been a genuine Iraqi collapse … So now a decade later I have to say No.”Baghdad memories: what the first few months of the US occupation felt like to an IraqiRead moreDuring the decade after the invasion, Abdul-Ahad would win an impressive cluster of major British journalism awards. The purchase price was high. In 2007, he was wounded by shrapnel from a grenade while covering fighting in Lebanon. In 2009, he was held hostage by the Taliban for six days in Afghanistan, and in 2011 he was imprisoned for two weeks by the Libyan army during the country’s civil war, and released only after Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, flew to Tripoli to appeal directly to Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif.Abdul-Ahad has continued to report for the Guardian from some of the world’s most distressed areas and dangerous conflicts, including Yemen and Somalia. Throughout, he has remained an eloquent and courageous commentator on the complexities of the ongoing conflict in his own shattered country.This is an edited extract ofWitness in a Time of Trial: Inside the Guardian’s Global Revolution Volume Two: 1995-2009 by Ian Mayes(Guardian Books, £25).

Feel the positive vibes ahead ofa stock market debut due in June! The most valuable private company in history! The largest ever transaction!Or,as Musk described it, he is creating “the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free-speech platform”.SpaceX’s minority shareholders may have a less stellar view. From their perspective, this all-share transaction must look less like an attempt to “accelerate humanity’s future” and more like an instant bailout of loss-making xAI, conducted with minimal scrutiny of valuation or a meaningful attempt to seek their views.Remember that, while SpaceX is routinely described for shorthand purposes as owned by Musk, he is not the only person in the capsule. His stake is estimated to be 42%. There have been outside shareholders for years – in the UK, two popular investment trusts, Scottish Mortgage and Edinburgh Worldwide, have SpaceX as their largest holding. Do end-investors in those funds really want to combine with xAI, a cash-burning operation that comes with X, the scandal-generating social media platform (latest news:a raid by prosecutors on X’s French headquartersandan ongoing UK inquiryinto indecent deepfakes produced by the Grok AI tool)? One doubts it.The beauty of SpaceX as an investment, until now, was the purity of its focus on sending satellites into orbit via reusable rockets and operating the Starlink communications system. It is a field in which competitors have been left on the launch pad. SpaceX’s customers include Nasa and the US Department of Defense.Musk’s strategic justification for combining SpaceX and xAI is that the AI battleground is about to shift to space. “Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” he argues.He may be correct in that analysis, but it is still a jump to say the two corporate entities must be housed under the same roof. If xAI needs to use SpaceX’s rockets to establish orbital datacentres, business could be done at arm’s length on commercial terms. Or, if you think the energy angle changes everything, make the case in greater detail than a brief statement and, most of all, ensure that valuations are transparently fair.Musk didn’t even mention terms, although SpaceX is reportedly being valued at $1tn and xAI at $250bn. Those round numbers may be roughly related to valuations at which each firm has raised capital in the recent past, but most assessments would surely conclude that SpaceX is seriously overpaying in this deal.The rocket firm, after all, is a profitable market leader and has annual revenues of $16bn; it looked set to achieve a $1tn valuation (however lofty it looks) at IPO under its own power. xAI, by contrast, is a startup withannual revenues of less than $1bn, faces an enormous investment bill to build datacentres, and is engaged in an uphill battle for AI supremacy with the likes of Google and Anthropic.It’s an all-share transaction so if, like Musk, you’re on both sides, there is a swings-and-roundabout feature to the relative valuations: what you lose on the rockets, you gain on the AI. There are also many outside backers in both camps. But the position is very different if, like the two UK investment trusts, your overwhelming exposure is to SpaceX (Baillie Gifford, manager of both trusts, declined to comment).Maybe, in the end, such details will be lost in the excitement of the public listing of the now-expanded SpaceX. Musk-mania should never be underestimated. But this warmup transaction still looks like a rescue of xAI, complete with the troublesome X being shunted on to SpaceX’s long-term outside investors who get no say in the matter. Yes, those backers have still made stupendous returns from the rocket adventure – that remains the case. But they’ve been taken for a ride in this latest Musk manoeuvre.Explore more on these topicsSpaceXNils Pratley on financeElon MuskAerospace industryAI (artificial intelligence)Mergers and acquisitionsEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

Time to refocus on the horrific mistreatment of women and girls, and the role of these ghoulsTue 3 Feb 2026 09.28 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareLike a lot of women, I do vaguely care about the latestpolitical implosion of Peter Mandelson– but I think we’re all massively more obsessed with the fact that there really was a network of incredibly famous and powerful men trying to help a known ex-con minimise and wave away his underage sex crimes. Amirite, ladies? Sure, I’m crying my eyes out about some Gordon Brown adviser having his asset-sale memoforwardedin 2009 … but at the same time I’m a whole lot more concerned about the actual Sex Bilderberg. Which, even now, our eyes seem to keep being conveniently dragged away from. Can we refocus?We are, naturally, talking about the Jeffrey Epstein files. Since the latest lotdropped, I’ve been collating the emails from extremely famous men who actively sought to help the since-deceased underage sex trafficker trivialise his crimes in the years after his jail release in 2009. Richard Branson, Noam Chomsky,Steve Bannon, Mandelson, Andrew (obviously) – all of these men offer strategic advice, or media training, or chummy solidarity. Or, in the case of Chomsky, all of the above plus a drive-by on the notion of female victimhood. According to text signed under his first name that Epstein sent to a lawyer and publicist in February 2019, months after the Miami Herald had run anexplosive series of articleslaying out the scale of Epstein’s serial underage sexual abuse and the perversion of justice that covered it up, Chomskysneered at“the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women”. Wow. Never mind Manufacturing Consent – have a read of Not Giving A Shit About Consent. I thought Chomsky cared about power and exploitative elites? Still, nice photo of him laughing it up with Steve Bannon.No 10 asks police to investigate Mandelson’s leaks to Epstein due to concerns over ‘market sensitive information’– UK politics liveRead moreLet’s move on to Richard Branson. Here is Britain’s Best Loved Businessman TM in 2013, opening bysaying to Epstein: “would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” (“Virgin Group has clarified that ‘harem’ referred to three adult members of Epstein’s team and stated Branson would not have used the term or had contact if he knew the full facts.” More on the full facts he should have been abreast of shortly.) Then it’s on to helping Jeffreydownplay his sex crimes, three years after he’s finished doing time for them. “I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you’ve been a brilliant adviser to him, that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17½-year-old woman … ” – his sentence was for soliciting prostitution fromgirls as young as 14, Richard, but go on – “… and have done nothing that’s against the law since, and yes, as a single man you seem to have a penchant for women. But there’s nothing wrong with that.” Thanks, Sir Nice Guy!You know, almost every time I’ve ever written about Richard Branson over the years, he or one of his lackeys has written in to the Guardian to whine about it, andoften got the letter printed. This time, I’m actively begging him to get in touch. Come on, Richard – write in and tell us why you didn’t bother Googling why your friend with the best lawyers out there still got an 18-month prison sentence, and had, at the time of that email,settledmany widely reported civil lawsuits brought against him by victims? I’ll save you a space on the letters page.There are so many big hitters in Epstein’s circle that we could be hours off the wholly absent Jeff Bezos starting a hashtag: #notallbillionaires. These days, the thing about Epstein’s many, many powerful friends is that if they ever break cover about their appearance in the files – and how terrifyingly quiet they’re all being – they tend to say they had no idea about his crimes. And yet, if one of your friends or my friends went to jail for a year, even if they told us it was a big old mistake/little local difficulty, we’d Google what it was all about – right? So imagine being as worldly as Richard Branson/Elon Musk/Peter Mandelson/Steve Bannon/Bill Gates and thinking that a billionaire with billionaires’ lawyers in the malleable US justice system ends up in jail in Florida because of some fit-up. Do me a favour. All those men know the world doesn’t work like that – and didn’t in this case, with Epstein gifted an incredibly controversialsecret plea deal.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Steve Bannon and Noam Chomsky released from Epstein files.Photograph: House Oversight CommitteeThe only person I can believe was too stupid to have used a search engine was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. But then I think he knew what had gone on in “other ways”. There isn’t space today for the further exposure in the latest document dump of Andrew’s naked lies aboutcutting ties with Epstein. The fact is – they all knew what Epstein went to prison for. They overlooked it. As evidenced by their continued association with him, it wasn’t remotely a big deal to them.The other chilling part is imagining how these guys talked if this was the kind of thing they were willing to commit to email. “Send me a number to call,” Epsteinsaysto film producer and New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch at one point in an exchange about “working girls”: “I don’t like records of these conversations.” We know Bill Gates was very close to Epstein, but doesn’t seem (thus far in the file dumps) to have committed that camaraderie to email. Maybe he too thought it wiser to talk on the phone.In unrelated news, Ghislaine Maxwell will appearbefore Congress next week, where perhaps she’ll expand on herrecent claimthat four co-conspirators and 25 men made “secret settlements” related to the Epstein case, but were not indicted.But so many silences remain deafening. It’s like JD Vance, vice-president for shitposting, said in 2021: “Remember when we learned that our wealthiest and most powerful people were connected to a guy who ran a literal child sex trafficking ring? And then that guy died mysteriously in a jail? And now we just don’t talk about it.” He was on the warpath back then. “If you’re a journalist and you’re not asking questions about this case you should be ashamed of yourself. What purpose do you even serve?” Hmm. As a journalist who has been asking questions on this case for at least 11 years: who’s not talking about it now, JD? Though obviously not involved himself, Vance is in a position to illuminate much more than has been illuminated. So draw your own conclusion as to what purpose he is serving.They all sell out women in the end. So yet again, it’s being left to the victims. Twenty of the Epstein survivors recentlyreleased a statementsaying that information about them was included in the latest file release, “while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected”. That is the dark heart of this – yet even now we’re looking the wrong way. I keep hearing frantic commentary about what this means for Keir Starmer, for Fergie, for Mandelson’s peerage, whatever. How about the biggest and grimmest question of all: what it means for women and girls to be able to clearly see that we live in a world where so many of the richest and most powerful men alive are just not botheredenough by their exploitation.

See that for what it isTue 3 Feb 2026 05.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 08.06 ESTShareIsrael’s official and unofficial spokespeople are in damage control mode after a senior military official admitted last week that Israelaccepts the death tollpublished by Gaza’s health ministry, which currently stands at more than 70,000. This comes after two years in which Israel and its supporters took every opportunity to disparage and dismiss the health ministry’s figures, arguing that they were overblown or fabricated by Hamas.That prestigious list of repudiators, to namejust a few, includes spokespeople for Israel’sgovernmentandmilitary, then-US presidentJoe Biden,US Congress, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) chiefJonathan Greenblatt, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and any number of talking heads at influential thinktanks and policy centres. Adding credibility to their denials were prominent media outlets around the world that often described Gaza’s health ministry as “Hamas-run”, thereby encouraging readers and viewers to treat the death toll with suspicion.In truth, the reliability of the official death toll should never have been in doubt. For one thing, the UN hasindependently verifiedthe accuracy of the health ministry’s figures after each of Israel’s previous bombardments of Gaza going back to 2008. For another, the data published by the health ministry since 7 October isextremely detailed: it includes a full name, date of birth, gender and ID number for all victims whose deaths were confirmed either by hospital morgues or by their relatives.Naturally, mistakes were made amid the intensity of an Israeli onslaught thatvirtually destroyedGaza’s entire health system, but these were remarkably few and promptly rectified:Sky News foundlast year that entries in the death toll list with missing or invalid ID numbers dropped from 2,769 in early April to just 313 by the end of July. As such,severalexternalinvestigationsof the published data found that it stood up to scrutiny.Back in January 2024, my colleague Yuval Abrahamreportedthat Israel’s military intelligence agencies had evensurveilled health ministry personnelin Gaza to check whether their data was accurate; upon finding that it was, they subsequently began using it in internal intelligence briefings. “In every status briefing, when everyone updates each other on what’s happening, there’s a slide that shows the current number of civilians killed in Gaza. And that’s based almost exclusively on the Hamas health ministry,” an intelligence source told him.Yet still the denials continued, for two whole years. And even now, the Israeli army came out quickly after last week’s reports toclaimthat “the details published do not reflect official IDF data” – despiteIsraeli media outletsclearly stating that this is what they were told by a senior official in a private briefing.So are we about to see a wave of mea culpas, or at least a modicum of self-reflection, from all those who peddled the line that the death toll was not to be trusted? Don’t bank on it. In fact, some of them already appear to beshiftingthegoalposts, arguing that while the overall death toll of 70,000 may be accurate, what actually matters is the ratio of civilians to militants among them, which they claim is comparatively low for urban warfare.Throughout the war, Israeli leaders have cited a civilian casualty ratio as low as1:1, or, more recently,1.5:1, and now theyallegethat militants account for as many as 25,000 of Gaza’s dead. But these claims, too,fall apartunder basic scrutiny.To understand why, you need only consider whom the Israeli army defines as a militant. After invading the strip in late 2023, the army began establishing militarised areas that it referred to as “kill zones” with arbitrary and often invisible boundaries, inside which they would automatically kill any Palestinian who entered, including children – andretroactively label themas terrorists. (Thiscurrently includesthe roughly 60% of Gaza’s territory that the Israeli armystill occupiesdespite the ceasefire.)The Guardian view on Trump’s Board of Peace: an international body in service to one man’s ego | EditorialRead moreAnd the army’s own data proves it. Last August, +972 magazine (where I am deputy editor) and the Guardian published ajoint investigationrevealing the existence of a classified Israeli intelligence database that maintains updated information on the status of every Palestinian in Gaza whom, through a combination ofmass surveillanceandAI algorithms, Israel suspects to be a militant belonging to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to data we obtained from this database in May last year, Israel had killed fewer than 9,000 militants at a time when the health ministry’s overall death toll stood at 53,000.The database, therefore, indicated that 83% of Gaza’s dead were civilians, pointing to a civilian casualty ratio with few parallels in modern warfare that adds further weight to accusations of genocide levelled atIsraelby the UN, human rights groups and leading genocide scholars. (The army stated in response that “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without denying the existence of the database and without specifying which data it disputed.)And that’s if we’re going by the health ministry’s figures, which do not include theroughly 10,000bodies still thought to be under the rubble; nor do they include “indirect” deaths from starvation, disease, hypothermia andtreatable health conditions, whichoften exceed“direct” deaths in war zones. Indeed,variousscientificstudiesconducted throughout the war have estimated that the true death toll from Israel’s onslaught may in fact have gone well beyond 100,000.While we won’t know for certain how high the death toll since 7 October really is until Israel stopsbombing Gazaand preventingthe localandinternational mediafrom being able to report freely across the strip, there is one thing we can be sure of: the climate of denial regarding the health ministry’s figures helped Israel keep slaughtering Palestinians en masse with impunity.Ben Reiff is deputy editor at +972 magazineDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She’s been nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe, best leading performance at the Berlin film festival and best actress at the New York Film Critics Circle awards. But these plaudits, and across-the-board rave reviews, are the least of what she’s achieved with this movie, hailed as a “tour de force of matriarchal fury”. Both on screen and in the promotional interviews, Byrne pulls no punches. And it’s about time. Not being honest about what motherhood is really like is the greatest disservice we do other women.“Having a baby is like going to the moon, and nobody ever tells you that,” the actortold the Times. “But it’s hard for women to talk about. There’s a lot of shame. You don’t want to feel like you don’t love your child, but there is a grief around becoming a mother, because you lose part of yourself that you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever get back. And that’s OK. It’s OK to grieve that – in fact, we should. Because it’s a before and an after.”At the beginning of my after, when I brought my baby home from hospital 11 years ago, I had a devastating epiphany:I’ve made a terrible mistake.My husband had to go straight back to work, straight back to his life – being a dad was neatly added to his identity, a cherry on the cake. Being a mum became all I was. All I did, day in and day out, around the clock. The same monotonous, relentless routine that I was too frazzled and sleep deprived to realise was just a phase. This is me now, for ever and ever and ever. I fed, and changed, and winded, and rocked, in an endless cycle; I was bored and boring. It wasn’t that I didn’t know who I was any more – I knew exactly who I was. Nothing. A blank space where a person had once been. A void.Clearly I was a monster for feeling this way instead of enjoying every precious second like you’re meant to, like everyone else does. It was such a shock. What I’d heard about, what I’d been expecting while I was expecting, was the blissful baby bubble other mums raved about, contentment and fulfilment like never before, being completely happy all the time.I was lucky though. When I eventually tearfully confessed my deplorable secret to a close friend, she wasn’t stunned and appalled, speed-dialling social services – she was sympathetic. She remembered this bit. She told me that when she was at the same stage she’d decided she definitely didn’t love her baby enough to make the sacrifices she now understood were necessary. I breathed out for the first time in days. I was normal.‘Transforming into a parent is messy and primal: I drew it all’: Becky Barnicoat on turning motherhood into cartoonsRead moreThis immense relief allowed me the freedom to admit that some parts of the experience were dull, challenging and painful. Once the impossible pressure of being permitted to feel solely ecstatic was removed, I felt all kinds of emotions. Including ecstatic. The only scenario better than this revelatory discovery would have been if I’d known it in advance, been prepared for it, skipped the portion where I castigated myself for being the worst mum to have ever walked the earth.The reality of motherhood is that it’s magical, horrendous, wonderful and terrifying, often all within 30 seconds. It can be bleak and lonely. It won’t fix the parts of you that are broken, solve all your problems or alone provide enough meaning to sustain you. It will be the most thankless, rewarding, infuriating, satisfying job you’ll ever do. It can take you to the edge of sanity, show you how strong you really are, and fill you with joy and wonder. You’ll want to shout your love from the rooftops and scream into a pillow, as Byrne’s character does in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.Motherhood is not for everyone, and that’s OK. But how can people work out if it’s forthemunless they hear the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth of it?Polly Hudson is a freelance writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They would not be budged and their intention was crystal clear: they were paying their horse-respect (this is not verbatim by the way) to an author who did as much for equine-kind as she did for humans. The story was pitch perfect; you could imagine Cooper laughing at it, at the same time as believing it, at the same time as thinking no funeral was complete without five horses.The combination of romance, magnitude, absurdity, delight and animals could have come straight off the pages of a Jilly Cooper novel, but how would a dean know that? Did they also, back in the day, pass a bashed-up copy of Riders around dean school? (My friend who is a librarian expressed some professional irritation that, at her school, they couldn’t get it together to buy more than one copy of a book in such demand. She said by the time they’d all finished it, it looked like Magna Carta.)‘Absolutely divine!’ How Jilly Cooper changed the world – one bonkbuster at a timeRead moreThe memorial was star-studded – the actual queen was there. People of a certain vintage were awed, overwhelmed even, to be singing I Vow to Thee My Country in a room where Rupert Everett was singing it (albeit it’s a gigantic room, a cathedral) and, again, you could imagine the scene as written by Cooper, who had an uncanny knack for being solemn and funny at the same time.She was an inveterate correspondent and, after she died last October, a lot of conversations went: “This is the worst news I’ve had in ages”, “Did you ever meet her?”, “No, but she sent me a card”. At the service, I was sitting at the back, next to the guy who made the cards, and she had got to know him so well over the years that she’d started to sendhima Valentine’s card. I said, “Wow, that’s a pretty special, if strangely circular relationship,” and he said, “Not really, her Valentine’s list had 300 people on it.” OK, that’s a lot, but I’m sure every one of them would have felt as special as one of those horses.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The regime has lost its footing, and the global mechanisms to avoid conflict no longer workDr Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeTue 3 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 09.18 ESTShareForty-seven years on from the Iranian revolution,Iranis confronting a strategic reality it has never faced before – a simultaneous crisis of domestic legitimacy and a credible threat of external attack so severe that regime survival can no longer be taken for granted. Until now, Tehran has survived wars, sanctions, assassinations, mass protests and international isolation through a strategy of projecting strength abroad, repressing dissent at home and generating a permanent crisis to justify poor leadership and political failure.Today, Donald Trump has mobilised an “armada” to the Middle East that includes theUSS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, guided-missile destroyers, an expanded air presence and missile defence systems. This force projection suggests the US is no longer focused on containing Iran but rather compelling a final resolution of a long-running conflict. The choice at hand is either the acceptance of a US-imposed settlement or the destruction of the Islamic republic as it exists today.Trump’s actions during his first term as president included abandoningthe 2015 nuclear deal, reimposing sweeping sanctions and the assassination of Quds Force commanderQassem Suleimaniin 2020, and foreshadowed a new approach towards a longstanding adversary. Now back in office, he seems intent on completing that project by forcing Tehran to either accept a deal on American terms or confront military strikes aimed at dismantling the regime itself.For Iran, this is an unprecedented moment. Not since 1979 has the regime faced serious threats to both its legitimacy at home and its ability to deter enemies abroad at the same time. Inside the country, the system is exhausted. Years of economic decline, corruption, currency collapse and mass emigration have hollowed out the social contract. The protests since 2017, including the“Woman, Life, Freedom”uprising in 2022 and the mass demonstrations of the past month showcase a society that no longer fears the state. Protesters have grown bolder and angrier, even as the cost of dissent has risen sharply. In fact, the January crackdown was the most violent in the regime’s history, with more than 6,000 people confirmed dead and a further 17,000 recorded deaths still under investigation.Externally, Iran has lost its footing, and its regional projection of power has crumbled. Since 7 October, Israel’s systematic campaign against Iran’s so-called axis of resistance has steadily eroded Tehran’s sense of security. Through open airstrikes across the region and in Iran itself, high-level targeted assassinations and cyber-operations culminating inlast summer’s 12-day war,Israel has moved its shadow war into the open and, in doing so, has actively pushed Iran towards a direct confrontation with the US.View image in fullscreenAn F/A-18E Super Hornet launching from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, 28 January 2026.Photograph: Zoe Simpson/US Navy/EPAAt the same time, Iran has created the conditions of its own vulnerability. Its effort to build influence through militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen was meant to deter attack by raising the cost of war. Instead, it has created multiple points of exposure. Its nuclear brinkmanship, once a source of leverage, has become the main justification for international pressure. And its revolutionary ideology, once a tool for mobilisation, now leaves it increasingly isolated in a region that has grown tired of ideological conflict.The question looming for the days ahead is not whether confrontation will occur, but what form it will take.The first scenario is forced compromise. Under intense pressure, Iran accepts a deal that limits its nuclear programme, allows intrusive inspections, places constraints on its missile capabilities and reduces its regional role, in return for sanctions relief and perhaps eventual US investment in the country. This may prevent immediate war, but it would come at a heavy political cost. Such an agreement would be seen inside Iran as a bargain for the sake of the regime’s survival.The second scenario is controlled war. The US would coordinate strikes against the Iranian leadership, missile forces, air defences and remaining nuclear infrastructure, seeking to cripple the regime. This would probably trigger Iranian regional escalation ranging from attacks on US bases, shipping lanes and Israeli cities, and maybe even some proxy mobilisation across the Gulf. The goal in this scenario would be regime transformation, but the outcome would certainly unleash prolonged instability, elite fragmentation and a violent struggle over future leadership.The third scenario is uncontrolled collapse. Under combined external pressure and internal unrest, the regime fractures, producing not liberal transition but a power vacuum. Competing security factions, economic breakdown and regional intervention could turn Iran into a long-term source of instability conjuring up images of Libya and Syria that would produce an outcome more perilous than the regime it replaces.Calls grow in Iran for independent inquiry into protest death tollRead moreIn all three scenarios, the outcome is dangerous for the Iranian people. Whether through forced compromise, limited war or regime collapse, none of the likely paths ahead point toward immediate stability or democratic transition. Moreover, all sides – Israel, the US and Iran – are locked into a logic of escalation over restraint.This is what makes the current moment so dangerous. There are no real diplomatic brakes left. The systems and mechanisms that previously kept conflict contained no longer function. Europe has no role left to play in mediating with Iran. Russia is distracted by its war in Ukraine and reluctant to invest in any off-ramps. China is cautious and unwilling to lead. Regional states are trying to intercede and manage last-ditch diplomacy, but they are also bracing for the impact.For Iran, and for the Middle East more broadly, the question is no longer whether the crisis can be defused, but how much damage will be done before it finally runs its course.Dr Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

After shredding any semblance of a progressive agenda, fear of Reform is all the PM’s party has leftTue 3 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 05.47 ESTShareLabour’s soul is being laid bare in the Gorton and Denton byelection campaign. Insofar as the party’s masters have had a coherent political strategy, it is this: defineLabouragainst the left, and compete with the right for votes. If the left is squealing or the Daily Mail is cheering, goes the thinking, Labour must be on the right track.Being forced to compete with the left was never part of the plan. Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, “doesn’t have room for compromise with the hard left”, as aformer associate put it, believing “they need to be eradicated from the party because they are so dangerous.” It’s as though the Starmerites assumed that once the left was vanquished inside Labour, it would simply vanish from politics altogether.They did not anticipate a leftwing insurgency in the form of Zack Polanski’s Green party. In Gorton and Denton – where Laboursecured half the votein 2024 – the party is haemorrhaging support to Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK and to the Greens. But it is the Green candidate, the charismatic local plumber Hannah Spencer, who is nowthe bookies’ firm favourite.That should hardly make the Greens complacent. The party has shared with me its latest doorstep data, based on 1,899 conversations in the constituency, that puts them on 34%, behind Reform on 39%, with Labour languishing on 21%. This chimes with theclaimfrom the Times’ Patrick Maguire that Reform’s internal polling places the Greens second. This is a complex, diverse constituency, making precise extrapolation difficult. But one thing is unmistakable: Labour’s left flank is bleeding heavily.Green campaigners believe Labour has miscalculated by presenting itself as the only viable alternative to Reform. This was meant to be a safe seat, after all, and such frantic positioning only makes sense if loyal voters have already peeled away. “Everybody is so fed up with Labour’s only strategy being ‘vote Labour to keep the Tories out’, and now it’s ‘vote Labour to keep Reform out’,” Spencer tells me. “It’s like: how about you actually just do something to make people voteforyou?”But fear of Reform is all Labour has left, because offering concessions to the left is anathema to Starmerism. More than a decade ago, Tony Blair made clear that his hostility to a more progressive agendawas principled, not simply tactical. “I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform,” he said. “Even if I thought it was the route to victory, I wouldn’t take it.”This mentality dominates today’s Labour. According to this worldview, demands to clamp down on migrants and refugees are “legitimate concerns” that must be heeded and acted upon. Those who do not prioritise them are dismissed as out of touch or contemptuous of ordinary voters. By contrast, support for increasing taxes on the rich or public ownership, or opposition to arming Israel’s genocide are afforded no such legitimacy. Instead, such views are branded fringe – even evidence of political extremism.Last August, the pollsters Persuasion UK identified thekey faultlinein British politics. It found that 44% of voters blamed “the rich and wealthy business elites and the politicians who let them get away with things” for Britain’s problems, compared with 38% who blamed “immigrants and asylum seekers and the politicians who let them into the country”.Given Labour was founded to represent workers, you might expect it to channel the former. Instead, Starmer’s faction is bitterly opposed to redistributing wealth and power. Recall when it courted wealthy businesspeople, such as former Tory donorJohn Caudwell, who approvingly declared that Starmer had “taken all the left out of the Labour party” and replaced it with values “in complete alignment with my views as a commercial capitalist”.Many ofStarmer’s alliesare former business lobbyists. As the revolving door between Blair’s government and the private sector demonstrated, Labour ministers and aides will rationally understand that politics offers a springboard to lucrative careers in industries such asprivate healthcareordefence.That is why Labour is so comfortable competing with Reform and the Tories over bashing migrants. It is not because Starmerites are instinctively xenophobic or racist. Most are urban middle-class professionals who find such sentiments distasteful. But if forced to choose, they would rather indulge anger directed at migrants and refugees than anger aimed at bankers and CEOs.Hence Labour’s willingness to introduce one of Europe’s harshest asylum systems, while rejecting awealth tax. It is why it will attack the benefits of people withmultiple sclerosis or cancer, yet oppose awindfall taxon bank profits. “Tough decisions”, in this lexicon, mean stripping support from those already struggling – never confronting entrenched interests.Whether the Greens can win Gorton and Denton will depend on their ability to mobilise enough campaigners in a seat where Labour can traditionally weigh the vote. Such a triumph would be Labour’s worst nightmare for a reason. It would expose its refusal to offer a genuine alternative to a broken economic order not as hard-headed pragmatism, but as a deliberate ideological choice.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLabourKeir StarmerZack PolanskiGreen partyManchesterGreater ManchestercommentShareReuse this content"

Labour’s regeneration strategy must be bolderTue 3 Feb 2026 13.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShare“In the 60s it was a fabulous place to live,”sighedone resident of the north-east English town of Newton Aycliffe, in an interview published last week as part of our investigation into the state of Britain’s high streets. “The town centre was absolutely beautiful … You would be ashamed to bring someone here now. It’s unrecognisable.”Similar perceptions of decline are now the norm across the nation. In postwar Britain, high streets became the thriving hubs of a more affluent society and a source of local identity and pride. Butalmost13,000 shops closed in 2024 – an attrition rate of around 37 a day, which particularly affected the north of England, the Midlands and deprived coastal areas. The emergence of superstores and retail parks, and the post‑pandemic boom in internet shopping, has hollowed out the centres of towns and left a gaping sense of loss.For Sir Keir Starmer and Labour, this is a major political problem as well as an economic one.Researchby the University of Southampton found that improving high streets was near the top of most voters’ priorities, behind only healthcare and reducing crime. The failure of governments to offer more than sticking‑plaster solutions is fuelling resentment in places where faith in politics – and the promises of mainstream parties – is at rock bottom. Recentpollingfound that 62% of voters who are considering backing Reform UK believe their local area is in decline.Ahead of thebyelectionin Gorton and Denton later this month, reports that Sir Keir hasidentifiedthis as a defining issue are therefore welcome. Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda was underpowered, piecemeal and quickly became a vehicle forpork-barrelpolitics at its most cynical. But it correctly identified a geography of discontent where faded provincial high streets had become a symbol of Westminster’s neglect, and a lightning rod for wider grievances. Proving that Labour could do a better job should have been front and centre of its first year in office.The government’s £5bnPride in Placefund will see an initial £1.5bn allocated to 75 deprived areas in April. That is a useful start. Plans to make it easier for communities to take over vacant lots are also welcome. But reversing decline will ultimately depend on spending serious money, and political capital, on a wider transformation strategy.A more level playing field for bricks-and-mortar businesses, which are taxed disproportionately compared with online competitors, is urgently needed. But support for commercial retail should be complemented by a drive to establish high streets as hubs for social interaction and civic activity. The shopping heyday of the high street was apostwarphenomenon. Any 21st-century revival will be based on giving local authorities the resources to restore a mix of activities and functions, and ensuring that residents get the chance to shape priorities.As the Guardian’s reporting fromNewton Aycliffeillustrates, a declining town centre is often experienced as a crisis of communal self-esteem. The disappearance of big-name department stores and bustling streets does more than restrict options; it damages collective morale. A successful regeneration strategy, in which communities are truly empowered to turn things around, would be a gamechanger for any government. But Labour is likely to pay a high price if its recipe for change turns out to be more of the same.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But as school‑age audiences of Matilda the Musical or the Harry Potter films can testify, UK classrooms usually have more children in them than fictional ones. What these young people probably do not know is that their classrooms are also fuller than many real ones abroad. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that the UK hassome of the largest primary groupsin the industrialised world.Does this matter, and how much? For many parents and teachers, it is common sense that smaller classes are preferable – as long as they are small by design and not because the school is an unpopular, unsuccessful one. The far lower pupil-teacher ratioof independent schoolsis widely viewed as giving their pupils an advantage over state-educated peers.For academics and policymakers, the situation is less clear cut. Under Tony Blair, Labour reduced class sizes for four- to seven-year-olds in England to amaximum of 30. But theuncertain resultsof research aimed at testing the effect of class size on attainment has meant that there is no consensus that reducing numbers further would be beneficial. In fact, theshrinking classes resulting from a falling birthrateare mostly seen as a problem – with the administrations in thedevolved nationsfacing similar pressures. With school budgets stretched due to reduced per-pupil funding, cuts and closures are expected.The expectation in England is that some of the spare capacity will become part of a reformed Send (special educational needs and disabilities) system, as well as allowing new nursery classes to open. Ministers have pledged to create 50,000 new specialist places. But so far there is no indication that their policy of making mainstream education more inclusive will involve smaller classes – even in primary schools where thedecline in “school readiness”among four-year-olds has increased the challenges facing reception-class teachers.Until their white paper is published, we do not know the detail of Labour’s plans.Send familiesandcharitiessupporting them are on high alert for changes that would see children’s existing entitlements eroded. But teachers, headteachers and their unions are right to push for smaller classes to be considered – and research by Prof Peter Blatchford and others supports their case. Even if they do not boost maths or English scores, these academics argue, smaller groups bring other benefits, particularly for Send pupils who are most disadvantaged in big classes.When 25 rather than 30 children are in a classroom, there is a more attention to go round – and more scope for the interactions that stimulate learners. Problems with staff retention could also be expected to ease if workloads, including marking, were more manageable.The UK is unusual in that primary classes tend to be larger than secondary ones. With anaverage of 26.6pupils in 2024, now would be a good moment for ministers to relax funding rules so that a reduction in numbers does not automatically see budgets slashed. There needs to be flexibility, and recognition of the role of teaching assistants. High-quality specialist provision and training needs to increase as well. But if a more inclusive system is the goal, falling numbers should be viewed not as a problem but as an opportunity to be grabbed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The presence of acategory 1 hazardwould make the home non-decent and local authorities are already under a statutory duty to deal with these. Many of the factors in the revised DHS could give rise to category 2 hazards, which the authorities could also deal with. The issue is lack of enforcement by local authorities using the powers they have already under the Housing Act 2004.One reason is lack of resources and properly trained environmental health practitioners. Another argument suggested by officers for inadequate enforcement is the complexity of the legal framework. The changes make the enforcement landscape more complex.When the provisions on the DHS are brought in, enforcement will not just be a matter for the local authority – which will regulate private rented properties – but also thesocial housing regulator, which, thus far, has no experience of enforcement on housing conditions for social landlords. Will we then have two underresourced regulatory agencies?Dr Stephen BattersbyEnvironmental health and housing consultant (retired)Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Forensic accountants would have a field day. And legally, leaseholders are obliged to pay these charges and then challenge them, usually at thefirst-tier tribunal, where the precedent is that as long as the charges are necessary, ie the work is necessary, and reasonable, ie the cost is reasonable, they have to be paid. The reason for the charge arising in the first place is irrelevant.In 2020 the government allowed freeholders to build up to two additional storeys to their existing buildings without planning permission. There are an increasing number of reports of leaseholders in the original buildings experiencing huge problems from the failures of these developments.They are undertaken by the landlord entirely for their own gain and with no benefit to the existing leaseholders, yet under current law – the reason for the charge arising being irrelevant – the leaseholders are expected to pay for the remediation, which can run into tens of thousands of pounds each. This cannot be right, and needs urgent attention in parliament.Chris WallisMarple, Greater ManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

So what is holding us back?, 25 January). The emotional testimony from residents who now have stability and dignity in their housing reinforces how urgently we need similar projects across the country.However, my own experience working on the East Quay projectin the adjacent town of Watchet reinforced another uncomfortable truth: local authorities do not always have the will or imagination to take the initiative and improve things for their residents.In Watchet, it was not the local council that led progressive change, but a remarkable community group, the Onion Collective. It was their vision, determination and grassroots effort that catalysed significant positive change in our town. Without their leadership, much of the regeneration and community benefit that has taken place would not have happened.This is not to downplay the importance of progressive national policy or council housing initiatives, but to underline that change for the better often requires leadership that goes beyond what councils alone are prepared, or able, to deliver. If we are serious about addressing the housing crisis, we need political leadership that empowers and partners with communities, values local initiative, and supports groups that are already driving tangible improvements on the ground.Dr Piers TaylorArchitect andprofessor of knowledge exchange in architecture, University of the West of EnglandThe answer to John Harris’s question about why we don’t build more council housing is that the government does not consider it a priority.In an interview, when the housing secretary, Steve Reed, was asked why Labour didn’t build council housing like the Attlee government did, he said “people’s aspirations are different” today. Between the aspiration and the means is an unbridgeable gulf for most people. The more than130,000 householdsin temporary accommodation and 1.3m households on waiting lists in England are not going to be able to buy a home. Nor are many of those forced to live in the expensive private rented sector. They need social rent council housing urgently.Aneurin Bevan said that “the speculative builder is an unplannable instrument”. The government today is looking to the modern equivalent to resolve the housing crisis. This flies in the face of historical experience. They build at a pace and a scale that will maximise their returns and the dividends of their shareholders.The government’s social and affordable homes programme will fund 18,000 social rent homes a year – just 6% of their 300,000 target. There is no funding specifically for council housing. Councils will have to compete for it with housing associations. Before theright-to-buy scheme, council housing facilitated home ownership. The reasonable rents enabled tenants to save a deposit, buy a home on the market and hand the keys back to the council for those on the waiting list.Council housing remains the key to resolving the housing crisis. Pressure needs to be brought to bear on MPs, as it was with winter fuel payments and disability benefits.Martin WicksSecretary, Labour Campaign for Council HousingHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Arsenal may not have been at all convincing against aChelseaside who caused them the occasional problem but Mikel Arteta will not care one bit. After four successive semi-final defeats, Arsenal are on their way to Wembley. At last.After the drama of the first leg at Stamford Bridge that saw Liam Rosenior’s side travel to north London needing to overturn a 3-2 deficit, this was a much more cagey affair that was eventually settled in stoppage time by Kai Havertz’s breakaway goal against his former club.Arsenalhad seemed content to keep Chelsea at arm’s length for most of the evening and rarely looked like extending their advantage until then.Mikel Arteta savours ‘vitamins’ as Arsenal reach Carabao Cup finalRead moreYet having not won this competition since 1993 and after crashing out at the semi-final stage to Newcastle after a 4-0 defeat on aggregate last season, this was an occasion for Arteta and his team to savour as they celebrated deep into the night. A potential showdown in the final with title rivals Manchester City would only add to the sense of drama as they chase a potential quadruple but Arsenal know they are within touching distance of a first trophy since winning the FA Cup in Arteta’s first season six years ago.Rosenior sprang a surprise by leaving Cole Palmer on the bench and naming a back three for the first time, while there was no place for captain Reece James after he failed a fitness test. But while his team’s unexpected formation caused Arsenal a few issues in the first half, they lacked the cutting edge to make it count against a defence as organised as Arsenal’s and only managed two shots on target.View image in fullscreenKai Havertz celebrates with his teammates after sealing Arsenal’s final place.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe hosts were also without their skipper as Martin Ødegaard missed out with a minor muscle injury and Arteta decided against risking Bukayo Saka’s hip problem. Their absence could explain Arsenal’s lack of fluency in attack that hardly backed up Arteta’s pre-match claim that his side are the most exciting in Europe as Eberechi Eze laboured on a rare start.Not since 1987 when David Rocastle’s winner helped Arsenal come from behind against their north London rivals Tottenham has a team overturned a first-leg deficit in the semi-final of this competition after losing the first leg at home. But with Arsenal playing in front of their fans for the first time since losing to Manchester United last weekend, Rosenior admitted beforehand that his side would try to play on any anxieties among the home supporters. Those would only have been heightened by an unconvincing first half performance that saw Arsenal struggle to deal with Chelsea’s switch of formation.Their high-energy press unsettled the hosts and William Saliba gifted the first opportunity to Liam Delap with a poor piece of control inside his own area but his shot went well wide.Arsenal scored from a corner early in the first leg in Rosenior’s first game in charge three weeks ago but Chelsea’s head coach had clearly been working on how to stop them. Three attacking players were sent upfield just as Declan Rice was about to deliver their first of the evening. Piero Hincapié’s header was deflected over by Wesley Fofana and it needed a full-stretch Robert Sánchez to save the Ecuador defender’s piledriver after Chelsea had failed to clear the second corner.But Rosenior will have been encouraged with how his side adapted to their task as he patrolled the touchline in the rain. When Gabriel Martinelli finally found some space in the area, Malo Gusto was there to block his shot. Chelsea’s best attempt of the half came just before the break when Enzo Fernández let fly from outside the area and Kepa Arrizabalaga was able to make a comfortable save. Arteta headed down the tunnel looking most concerned.Arrizabalaga’s flap at a corner as the start of the second half will not have done his nerves any good but Delap could not direct his effort on target. Arteta earned himself a yellow card after remonstrating with the fourth official when João Pedro was fouled by Hincapié as temperatures briefly threatened to spill over.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior surprisingly benched Cole Palmer against Arsenal.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersRosenior decided it was time to roll the dice on then hour mark and summoned Palmer and Estévâo from the bench as he switched to a back four. Suddenly they were much more of a threat as Marc Cucurella and the Brazilian teenager fired efforts wide. Gusto was booked for diving before the anonymous Viktor Gyökeres was replaced by Havertz.Gabriel Magalhães had a golden opportunity to settle it for Arsenal 13 minutes from time when he connected with Hincapié’s cross but Cucurella was able to block with his head. Chelsea felt that they should have had a penalty when Palmer’s free-kick struck Havertz in the wall, even if replays showed the ball hit his shoulder.Their best chance came when Wesley Fofana volleyed wide at the near post from the resulting corner. It was left to Havertz to make sure of Arsenal’s victory when he rounded Sánchez to seal their place in the final to the delight of their trophy-starved supporters.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Focus on our core. We are a sports organisation. We understand politics and we know we don’t operate in a vacuum. But our game is sport. That means keeping sport a neutral ground. A place where every athlete can compete freely, without being held back by the politics or divisions of their governments.“In a world that is increasingly divided, this principle matters more than ever. It is what allows theOlympic Gamesto remain a place of inspiration where the athletes of the world can come together and showcase the best of our humanity.”The general understanding in Milan was that Coventry was referring to Russia’s exclusion since it launched its war on Ukraine in 2022. Her comments were also quickly welcomed by the Russian IOC member Shamil Tarpischev, who confirmed that relations with the IOC had improved significantly.“It was emphasised in her speech that the political component shouldn’t play a role,” he told German media. “Because sport is inspiration and the future. So far, everything is going smoothly and honourably. But we still have a lot of discussions to make.”Tarpischev also said he welcomed Infantino’s comments. “I sat next to him at the concert yesterday. He’s very positive about all our efforts in terms of participation. We communicate all the time.”View image in fullscreenMatvii Bidnyi called Gianni Infantino ‘irresponsible’ and ‘infantile’ for his comments around Russia.Photograph: ReutersRussia has been banned byFifaand Uefa since its full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Its teams are allowed to play friendlies, but cannot enter competitions such as the men’s or women’s World Cup, European Championship or junior equivalents. Infantino has consistently expressed a hope to see them return and, in an interview with Sky News on Monday, said the ban had “not achieved anything” and should be reassessed, at least concerning youth teams.Bidnyi, however, delivered a withering response to Infantino, highlighting the real-life effects of Russia’s aggression on footballers and other sportspeople. “Gianni Infantino’s words sound irresponsible, not to say infantile,” he said. “They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed. Let me remind you that since the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians. Among them were 100 footballers.”Bidnyi proceeded to give examples of young players killed by missile strikes and shelling before urging football’s authorities not to let Russia back in. “War is a crime, not politics,” he said. “It is Russia that politicises sport and uses it to justify aggression. I share the position of the Ukrainian Association of Football, which also warns against Russia’s return to international competitions.“As long as Russians continue killing Ukrainians and politicising sport, their flag and national symbols have no place among people who respect values such as justice, integrity, and fair play.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, went further in his condemnation of Infantino and linked his comments to a past Olympic scandal. “679 Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football – Russia killed them,” he posted on X. “And it keeps killing more while moral degenerates suggest lifting bans, despite Russia’s failure to end its war. Future generations will view this as a shame reminiscent of the 1936 Olympics.”In December the IOC advised sport’s governing bodies to let Russian youth athletes compete at international events again, under their own flag and national anthem. Shortly after, Fifa announced plans for a new under-15 festival, open to all 211 member associations, that will take place for boys this year and girls in 2027.Welcome to Team GB’s Milan base: TV, games, popcorn and 5,000 tea bagsRead moreThere will be 13 Russian athletes competing as neutrals in Milano Cortina, and seven from Belarus. That is a fraction of the 200 Russians who competed in Beijing four years ago, winning 32 medals under the banner of the “Russian Olympic Committee” enforced following the state-sponsored doping scandal.In football, Russia under-16 and under-15 teams have regularly participated in Uefa-branded “development tournaments”, which are also open to guest countries from outside Europe, since the ban. Opponents in these tournaments have included Serbia, Kazakhstan, China, Ghana and Belarus.Russian national teams have played few matches in Europe since February 2022, aside from games in its close ally Belarus. Exceptions have sprung up in the past year: the senior women’s side played a friendly in Serbia last July and two matches in North Macedonia three months later. Mid-season practice matches during club training camps in Turkey are more common. The German club Berliner AK sparked controversy when their under-19s faced Spartak Moscow, and the sixth-tier side Rot‑Weiss Wittlich played Dynamo Moscow’s second team last week.A full return in football appears highly unlikely while no end to the war is in view. Opposition within Europe, which in effect led to the ban when opponents refused to play Russia in the World Cup 2022 playoffs, remains strong and any vote taken by the Fifa Council or Uefa would almost certainly not pass.Explore more on these topicsSportGianni InfantinoRussia (Football)International Olympic CommitteeLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesFifanewsShareReuse this content"

Jacob Bethell’s part-timers turned lethal, his three-wicket over dismantling Sri Lanka’s tail to help secure a 12-run win in the third and final Twenty20 international.The tourists put up just 128, their total built by Sam Curran’s 48‑ball 58, a score to which no one else came close. But it proved enough on a worn surface as England’s raft of spinners went to work. And while Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson are the veteran frontliners, this night belonged to Bethell and Will Jacks. The left-armer finished with four for 11, the offie with three for 14 off the full allotment.Harry Brook blocks out the noise to lead England to T20 series win in Sri LankaRead moreBethell completed the job as a surprise death bowler, three strikes in the 18th over followed by the final blow in the 20th, Maheesh ­Theekshana’s slog producing a looping edge to short third. England will enter the World Cup with a clean-sweep victory and five consecutive white-ball wins.Dasun Shanaka’s side will begin their campaign with 10 wins in 23 T20s since the start of 2025, a sense of dysfunction hanging over them. Kamindu Mendis, initially omitted from the squad for these T20s, was included at No 5 for the final match of the series. ­Dhananjaya de Silva, who had batted there on Friday, was ­missing from their final World Cup squad announced on Monday.View image in fullscreenSam Curran struck 58 from 48 balls as England scraped together a total of 128-9.Photograph: Lahiru Harshana/ReutersBen Duckett was a late inclusion for Phil Salt, who sustained a back spasm in the warm-up, and Harry Brook’s decision to bat first meant an early entry for the left-hander. This was his first T20 international since June. He was rested for the series against South Africa and New Zealand, and missed the start of this one with a bruised finger, Salt and Jos ­Buttler re‑establishing their thumping opening partnership in his absence. After all that waiting, though, Duckett lasted one ball, Dushmantha Chameera’s nip‑backer proving fatal. It was the first of six single‑figure dismissals in the England innings.Matheesha Pathirana, bound to thrive at the upcoming tournament, was a parti­cular thrill to watch early on, his low‑arm heat removing Bethell and Brook inside the powerplay. Brook had tucked into the fast bowler two nights previous for three sixes but here he fell to a setup. An 88mph delivery zipped past the nose before a cutter got stuck in the surface – Brook’s prod led to a simple grab at short extra cover. Tom Banton was undone by Dunith Wellalage’s loop, Buttler by Theekshana’s turn. Chameera was excellent, clocking that his leg­cutter was the way to go, bringing him a five‑wicket haul. His dismissal of Jacks left England 60 for six.Chameera accounted for Curran, too, but only after the all-rounder had given England something to believe in. Entering at 34 for four, he pulled the drag-downs hard and opened up at the close. He used his early arrival to advance to his second T20 international half-century.Luke Wood struck in the first over before Pathum Nissanka’s brief fireworks, Sri Lanka finishing their power­play on 46 for two. The key question was how the hosts would tackle Rashid, the leg-spinner having been unpickable at certain points of the tour. Rashid’s leg-break spun big but it was the googly that did for Pavan Rathnayake, trapped lbw on 13. Kusal Mendis, playing his 100th T20, top-edged a sweep off the very next delivery, bowled by Jacks, leaving Sri Lanka 62 for four in the 10th over. We had a game.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell turned the game England’s way, taking four wickets for 11 runs.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APKamindu and Janith Liyanage brought the required rate down to below six, with 39 required and six wickets in hand. But the economical Jacks skidded the ball on to end Kamindu’s innings, and had rhythm from around the wicket as England squeezed, Bethell’s left-arm spin joining in on the fun. Brook wasn’t going to turn back to pace.“Sixteen overs of spin, to do that against a Sri Lankan team in their own country, is an awesome effort,” the England white-ball captain said at the post-match presentation. Liyanage swept to Bethell in the deep for Jacks’s third and Rashid’s tight six left 21 required from the last three overs.Every run turned precious, a boundary to begin Bethell’s third over feeling seismic. But Buttler sprung into action with the next delivery, leaping in front of the stumps to take a low, desperate, one-handed grab. Chameera pushed forward moments later, the ball lobbing to Brook at cover. Shanaka shimmied down the pitch but the turn was too great, Buttler pulling off the ­stumping, England jubilant. There were no more twists to come.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

We run the rule over every team’s businessTue 3 Feb 2026 05.09 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 12.22 ESTShareArsenalThe foot injury sustained by Mikel Merino made the last few days of the window a bit more interesting forArsenalsupporters, although in the end there was no big signing. Deadline-day links to Sandro Tonali of Newcastle and Leon Goretzka came to nothing, and Arsenal missed out to their north London rivals Tottenham on the 18-year-old Scotland striker James Wilson. They did sign the England Under-19 defender Jaden Dixon from Stoke but will Mikel Arteta regret allowing Ethan Nwaneri to join Marseille on loan with Merino poised to be out for at least two months?Ed AaronsKey ins:NoneKey outs:Oleksandr Zinchenko (Ajax, £1.3m), Ethan Nwaneri (Marseille, loan)Aston VillaTwelve months ago Unai Emery had pushed through deals for Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio but this time there were no late high-profile arrivals. It is hard to discern whether Villa finish the window in a stronger position than when it opened after allowing Donyell Malen and Evann Guessand to depart, but the return of Tammy Abraham, on a permanent deal, provides Villa with another bona fide striker, and Douglas Luiz, another player back for a second spell, eases their midfield injuries. Alberto Benito, Emery’s chief scout, tracked Alysson, a £10.5m buy from Grêmio and the club could look back on the £10m deal for Brian Madjo as smart business; there is plenty of excitement around the Enfield-born 17-year-old, who became Metz’s youngest debutant aged 16 last year. Finley Munroe was sold to Middlesbrough, to the surprise of Ian Holloway, who managed the 20-year-old left-back – a cousin of Declan Rice – during his impressive loan spell at Swindon. “I don’t think I’ve had as good a full-back potentially in my lifetime,” Holloway said.Ben FisherKey ins:Tammy Abraham (Besiktas, £18.3m), Brian Madjo (Metz, £10m), Alysson (Grêmio, £8.7m), Douglas Luiz (Juventus, loan)Key outs:Evann Guessand (Crystal Palace, loan), Donyell Malen (Roma, loan)BournemouthBournemouth prevented the £62.5m record sale of Antoine Semenyo from developing into a saga, the Ghana forward scoring a stoppage-time winner on his final appearance. He took out a full-page advert in theBournemouthEcho to thank fans for their support after making the next step on an extraordinary journey that has brought him from non-league to arguably the best team on the planet. Bournemouth were preparing for his exit and signed Rayan in a £30m deal from Vasco da Gama; the fact Bournemouth have inserted a €100m release clause suggests they are expecting big things. The 20-year-old Hungary midfielder Alex Toth, whose development at Ferencvaros was overseen by Robbie Keane, arrives with a fine reputation. The arrivals of Christos Mandas and Fraser Forster widened Andoni Iraola’s pool of goalkeepers, with the Greek, a loan signing from Lazio, expected to compete with Djordje Petrovic to be No 1.BFKey ins:Rayan (Vasco da Gama, £24.7m), Alex Toth (Ferencvaros, £10.4m), Christos Mandas (Lazio, loan), Fraser Forster (free agent)Key outs:Antoine Semenyo (Manchester City, £62.5m)View image in fullscreenRayan has a €100m release clause at Bournemouth.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersBrentfordThe window was all about streamlining the squad, with the feeling at the club being that they might have been carrying a few too many over the first half of the season. The picture has been influenced by excellent player availability.Brentfordlost their head of performance, Chris Haslam, to Tottenham last summer but which club have continued to have the injury problems? Frank Onyeka was prominent among the outgoings, which also included Myles Peart-Harris and Paris Maghoma. The major piece of incoming business was the promising 18-year-old Kaye Furo, who has joined to provide cover up front for Igor Thiago.David HytnerKey ins:Kaye Furo (Club Brugge, £8.7m)Key outs:Frank Onyeka (Coventry, loan)BrightonThe return of club legend Pascal Gross has paid immediate dividends after the veteran scored the first goal of his second spell on the south coast against Everton last weekend. Brajan Gruda was the surprise casualty as he was allowed to join RB Leipzig on deadline day, while Matt O’Riley cut short his loan move to Marseille and is back to add more depth to Fabian Hürzeler’s squad. Interest fromNottingham Forestin the veteran club captain Lewis Dunk and Yasin Ayari was rebuffed.

After a bit of a delay the experienced James Ward-Prowse arrived from West Ham, having been cast out by Nuno Espírito Santo, who is clearly not a fan of the former England international. Ward-Prowse, a cool head with impeccable delivery from set pieces, was a sensible loan, adding maturity to a squad in need of leaders. Hannes Delcroix, who had last played a first-team game forBurnleyin March 2024, departed for Lugano in Switzerland, while Manuel Benson moved to Maccabi Haifa.Will UnwinKey ins:James Ward-Prowse (West Ham, loan)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenJames Ward-Prowse was on the Burnley bench at Sunderland but his cool head and set pieces could boost his new team.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAChelseaA quiet window by Chelsea’s standards, even if it did begin with the departure of Enzo Maresca as head coach. Liam Rosenior came in and spent a while examining his deep squad. Not much was needed. Chelsea looked for cover in defensive midfield but cooled interest in Douglas Luiz before his move toAston Villa. Central defence was a bigger priority. Chelsea were beaten to Jérémy Jacquet by Liverpool but recalled Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg. Sarr, who played for Chelsea at last summer’s Club World Cup, was crucial for Rosenior at Strasbourg. He will have a chance to establish himself before Chelsea look to sign a defender in the summer.Jacob SteinbergKey ins:Mamadou Sarr (Strasbourg, recalled from loan)Key outs:Raheem Sterling (released), Tyrique George (Everton, loan), Axel Disasi (West Ham, loan)Crystal PalaceAnother manic end to the window finished with Jean-Philippe Mateta staying after his move to Milan fell through and Palace breaking their transfer record for the second time by signing Jørgen Strand Larsen from Wolves. A late push for to take Dwight McNeil from Everton did not get over the line but Oliver Glasner is not short of attacking options after the arrivals of Evann Guessand and Brennan Johnson. The major disappointment was Palace’s failure to secure a replacement for Marc Guéhi after the England defender joined Manchester City – a situation that will have to be resolved in the summer.EAKey ins:Jørgen Strand Larsen (Wolves, £43m), Brennan Johnson (Tottenham, £35m), Evann Guessand (Aston Villa, loan)Key outs:Marc Guéhi (Manchester City, £20m), Romain Esse (Coventry, loan)EvertonThe Everton hierarchy wished to save transfer funds until the summer but David Moyes wanted to strengthen asap, believing European qualification remains achievable for a club who have spent recent years fighting relegation. Ultimately there was a little compromise, with a loan deal sanctioned for Chelsea’s promising young winger Tyrique George after Jack Grealish’s season-ending foot injury. Everton have an option to buy the 19-year-old in the summer. Moyes had also wanted a striker and a successful resolution to his year-long search for a right-back. There was interest in Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri but the Morocco forward favoured a move to Saudi Arabia. Fulham rejected an approach for Harry Wilson, who is out of contract at the end of the season.Andy HunterKey ins:Tyrique George (Chelsea, loan)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenTyrique George has joined Everton from Chelsea after Jack Grealish’s season-ending foot injury.Photograph: Jacob King/PAFulhamHave they done enough to convince Marco Silva to renew his contract when it expires this summer? Maybe not. The £27m signing of Oscar Bobb from Manchester City is exciting butFulhamstruggled to get other business done. Silva wanted a striker and targeted PSV’s Ricardo Pepi, who proved too expensive. Another concern is a potential cover in midfield after Sasa Lukic’s hamstring injury. However Fulham were pleased to hold on to Wilson. The winger, who is having a stunning season, was targeted by Everton. He is out of contract at the end of the season and will be watching Silva’s situation closely.JSKey ins:Oscar Bobb (Manchester City, £27m)Key outs:Adama Traoré (West Ham, £2m)LeedsDaniel Farke is likely to be underwhelmed – to put it politely – at the sole addition of Facundo Buonanotte to his Leeds squad. The winger arrived on loan from Brighton, having had a similar deal at Chelsea cut short owing to lack of game time. In the days before the deadline the Leeds manager told reporters he had “made my views on what we need clear to the board” but would not elaborate. It is safe to assume that Farke had requested reinforcements but, bar a brief dalliance with the idea of augmenting the team’s attack by buying Jørgen Strand Larsen from Wolves, nothing much has happened. With Leeds not clear of relegation waters, everyone at Elland Road must hope Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains fit.Louise TaylorKey ins:Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton, loan)Key outs:Jack Harrison (Fiorentina, loan)LiverpoolThe £60m deal for Jacquet, Rennes’ highly rated centre-half, again demonstrated that Liverpool’s transfer strategy was not dictated by short-termism. There was an unsuccessful attempt to sign theSunderlanddefender Lutsharel Geertruida on loan from Leipzig, having lost Conor Bradley, Jeremie Frimpong and Joe Gomez to injury, and that may leave Arne Slot light on defensive cover. Liverpool felt there was no value in reviving a move for Guéhi six months before he was due to become a free agent and Semenyo, another target, also joined Manchester City. But in beating Chelsea to Jacquet’s signature they have secured a key part of their defensive rebuild and a profile of signing the club have been pursuing for some time. Liverpool also resisted Tottenham’s attempts to end Andy Robertson’s outstanding Anfield career.AHKey ins:Jérémy Jacquet (Rennes, £60m, defender joins on 1 July)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenJérémy Jacquet, a central defender, will join Liverpool from Rennes next summer.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoManchester CityIn the combined £82.5m splurge on Semenyo and Guéhi, Pep Guardiola signed a top-class wide forward and top-class defender to strengthen a second half of a campaign in which City remain in contention for the title, Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Semenyo’s 44th-minute strike in Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham was a fourth in his first five games, and Guéhi has been as impressive in his first two appearances. The latest chapter of Kalvin Phillips’s disappointing City career featured the No 6’s third loan, to Sheffield United. Sverre Nypan, a 19-year-old Norwegian midfielder, was recalled from his temporary move at Middlesbrough after making only three starts and Joel Ndala was sent on loan to Sheffield Wednesday.Jamie JacksonKey ins:Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth, £62.5m), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace, £20m)Key outs:Oscar Bobb (Fulham, £27m), Stefan Ortega (Nottingham Forest, £500,000), Kalvin Phillips (Sheffield United, loan)Manchester UnitedBefore the window Ruben Neves, Conor Gallagher, Tyler Adams and Semenyo were on Ruben Amorim’s radar. Yet on 5 January the head coach was sacked by United, four days later Semenyo signed for Manchester City, and at 7pm on 2 February Neves remained at Al-Hilal and Adams was still at Bournemouth, with Gallagher having moved from Atlético Madrid to Tottenham, so Michael Carrick’s reward for beating Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham in his first three games as interim manager was zero signings to bolster his challenge for a Champions League berth. Factor in Tyrell Malacia remaining owing to Patrick Dorgu’s muscle injury after interest from Turkey, and the sole business involved temporary moves for academy youngsters and Toby Collyer going on loan to Hull.JJKey ins:NoneKey outs:NoneNewcastleIn Eddie Howe’s ideal world, Newcastle would have strengthened at full-back, centre-back, in central midfield and in attack. But no one arrived, which means Howe must extract the best from his injury-hit and inconsistent squad. Can Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa, Jacob Ramsey and Anthony Elanga fully justify last summer’s £220m total investment in their abilities? Howe’s medium-term future could depend upon the answer. He could perhaps have done with recalling Matt Targett from a loan at Middlesbrough but the full-back was resistant and his wishes were respected. Although the Sandro Tonali to Arsenal stories were unfounded, subsequent comments from Tonali’s agent that he would “work out Sandro’s valuation in about March” raise fears that Howe should brace himself for Isak part two. The long-serving centre-half, and club captain, Jamaal Lascelles, moved to Leicester.LTKey ins:NoneKey outs:Jamaal Lascelles (Leicester, undisclosed)Nottingham ForestWithout the injured Chris Wood, Forest focused on the forward line. A string of names were linked but 6ft 7in Lorenzo Lucca was the first through the door from Napoli in an attempt to replicate what they are missing without Wood. Jørgen Stand Larsen, Mehdi Taremi and Jean-Philippe Mateta were also on the shortlist but Forest opted against adding an extra striker after Taiwo Awoniyi scored at Brentford. Stefan Ortega was a sensible signing from Manchester City to bolster the goalkeeping department after John Victor’s season-ending injury, especially considering Matz Sels sustained a groin problem against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ending the loans of Oleksandr Zinchenko and Douglas Luiz were boosts because they never found their feet at the City Ground, and Borussia Mönchengladbach’s Luca Netz was a logical and frugal addition at left-back. Unsuccessful bids were made for Celtic’s Arne Engels and Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney but the club did not panic and sign any old central midfielder for the sake of it.WUKey ins:Luca Netz (Borussia Mönchengladbach, £2m), Stefan Ortega (Manchester City, £500,000), Lorenzo Lucca (Napoli, loan)Key outs:Arnaud Kalimuendo (Eintracht Frankfurt, loan), Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal, loan ended), Douglas Luiz (Juventus, loan ended)SunderlandArguably Sunderland’s most interesting signing is Melker Ellborg. The highly rated 22-year-old former Malmö goalkeeper cost £3m and is said to be stylistically similar to Régis Le Bris’s first choice, Robin Roefs. Ellborg’s arrival allows last season’s first-choice keeper, Anthony Patterson, to join Millwall on loan. Similarly last season’s key midfielder and captain Dan Neil has been loaned to Ipswich, preventing any potential fractures in squad harmony on Wearside. There is relief that the versatile defender and Leipzig loanee Geertruida has not moved toLiverpoolbut a changing of the guard is under way on the wings. Simon Adingra’s struggles to establish himself prefaced a loan to Monaco, and Ecuador’s free-scoring Nilson Angulo has arrived from Anderlecht for £17.5m.

That, in headline terms, has seen Conor Gallagher sign and Brennan Johnson depart. Spurs have also added the 19-year-old left-back prospect Souza. Since the window opened, there have been significant injuries to Mohammed Kudus, Rodrigo Bentancur, Richarlison, Ben Davies, Lucas Bergvall, Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso (in that order). Frank made clear that short-term fixes on the market were not an option. The club aimed high, trying to get Semenyo and Andy Robertson. The former opted to go from Bournemouth to Manchester City and Liverpool would not sell the latter.DHKey ins:Conor Gallagher (Atlético Madrid, £34.6m), Souza (Santos, £13m)Key outs:Brennan Johnson (Crystal Palace, £35m)West HamNuno Espírito Santo sought to rebalance his squad and began by reinforcing his attack with Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos for a combined £47m package. They have made an early impact but there is concern over West Ham’s struggle to improve their backline. One defender arrived, on deadline day: Axel Disasi, on loan from Chelsea. West Ham, who also added to their wide options by signing Adama Traoré from Fulham, have not kept a clean sheet since August and a bigger focus on the back four was needed. However a lot of attention was devoted to the Lucas Paquetá saga, with the Brazil midfielder eventually forcing through a move to Flamengo. Other squad players also departed.JSKey ins:Taty Castellanos (Lazio, £25.2m), Pablo Felipe (Gil Vicente, £18.3m), Adama Traoré (Fulham, £2m), Axel Disasi (Chelsea, loan), Keiber Lamadrid (Deportivo La Guaira, loan)Key outs:Lucas Paquetá (Flamengo, £36.7m), Luis Guilherme (Sporting, £14.2m), Guido Rodríguez (Valencia, free),James Ward-Prowse (Burnley, loan), Niclas Füllkrug (Milan, loan)WolvesPoor recruitment has been central to Wolves’ demise and their deadline-day business felt like an admission that they are preparing for the Championship. Adam Armstrong signed from second-tier Southampton after the sale of Jørgen Strand Larsen, while Angel Gomes, out of favour at Marseille and keen to get his career back on track, joined on loan with a view to a permanent move. They failed with a bid for Torino’s Ché Adams, another former Saints striker. Wolves went into January aware offloading Strand Larsen suited both parties and while Crystal Palace reneged on their initial agreement to sign the Norway striker and it threatened to descend into a saga, a £48m sale represented a £25m profit on a player who has scored a single top-flight goal this season and signed permanently only last summer. The loan exits of Fer López and Marshall Munetsi, recruited under Vítor Pereira and indicative of the old regime, are a reminder of expensive mistakes.BFKey ins:Adam Armstrong (Southampton, £7m), Angel Gomes (Marseille, loan)Key outs:Jørgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace, £43m), Fer López (Celta Vigo, loan), Marshall Munetsi (Paris FC, loan), Ki-Jana Hoever (Sheffield United, loan)Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeagueArsenalAston VillaBournemouthBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionanalysisShareReuse this content"

The centre says his side will “have a bit of swagger” during the Championship.Accusations of English arrogance, particularly from their Six Nations rivals, are nothing new, but the best England sides have not wanted for self-belief and Freeman says they intend to puff out their chests as they seek to extend their 11-match winning run.England optimistic injured backline quartet will be ready for Calcutta Cup returnRead moreSuch confidence is reflective of the mood in the camp. Steve Borthwick has told us repeatedly how he expects Wales to play on Saturday and has challenged England to ensure they are in the hunt for the grand slam on Super Saturday – the final round of the championship on 14 March – when they face France in Paris, urging supporters to “flood across the Channel”.Jamie George, who will captain the side against Wales, has explained how he is fed up with finishing second. England are targeting a first title since 2020 and a first clean sweep in a decade, while the Rugby Football Union has tasked Borthwick with winning international competitions “consistently” in its recently released strategic plan.Freeman is yet to win silverware with England, having made his debut in 2022, but they have the perfect opportunity to begin their campaign with a bang against a Wales side who have lost their past 11 Six Nations matches. England are not only expected to beat Wales, but to thump their forlorn neighbours and Freeman does not see added expectation as a burden.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman says England are still learning and still wanting to get betterPhotograph: David Rogers/Getty Images“There is an element of a bit of both, you listen to [the outside expectation] too much and you can coast along,” he said. “But we will be looking to keep doing what we are doing, keeping our heads down on the training field and letting the rest take care of itself. The more we can do that, the better we can do that.“Don’t get me wrong, we want to stick our chests out. We are hard to beat and you have seen that over the last year. We recognise that and we will have a bit of swagger about us.“It is a great feeling, being on the back of wins is a lot better than losses. There is an element of confidence, but I don’t think there is any complacency. The lads are still learning and still wanting to get better.“Every week is a different week and a different competition, the autumn was so different to the Six Nations in terms of the hype built through the competition, the teams out there, the styles of play. There are elements we can learn every time. That is what Steve really goes at.“The place is unbelievable to be around. We are all good mates, the connections we are building. It has been the same faces over the last couple of years so it is a really good spot to be in.”Freeman lines up at outside-centre against Wales, just as he did in Cardiff a year ago whenEngland ran riot in a 68-14 victory. It was the fourth victory in their winning run, but the first when they realised the outer reaches of their potential. Not long before that England had developed a habit of losing close contests in the final quarter, but, as Freeman explained, a mindset shift, instigated by Borthwick and his assistant coaches, prompted the turnaround.‘Thinking a lot less’: Tommy Freeman on the secret to international rugbyRead more“That’s something Steve is always talking about, get used to lifting silverware,” he said. “We want to be winning as much as possible. That’s the end game.“Games look better than others and the performance can be different and not as good, but getting the win is the most important thing.“That’s definitely forefront of the mind and that’s what every competition is about and every team wants to do the same thing. If we can do that, that would be lovely. Having a few caps now, you want to win as much as you can.“There’s a difference in mindset, from, when you’re winning it’s to prevent them from winning rather than, when we’re winning, to keep winning. We probably did everything we can to not let them score, whereas it’s: let’s carry on doing everything we can to score more points and be in the right areas.“It’s a shifted mindset of playing for the full 80 and not being up and then trying to stop them. It’s how long you can keep the game on the pitch that you’re trying to do and impose.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Rugby unionSix NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What ­happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problem as human beings.”The Rapid Support Forces in Sudan have been backed by the UAE, a position the Gulf state denies despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters. The RSF hascarried out mass killingsin the Sudanese city El Fasher.In November the UAE admitted to errors in policy after reputational damage over its support for the RSF.

Last ­Thursday ­Guardiola spoke at a charity event in Barcelona about the need to protect children in Palestine, prompting questions before City’s Carabao Cup tie against Newcastle on Wednesday about why he was vocal on humanitarian issues.“It is about a better place for humanity,” he said. “The people who run away from their countries, go in the sea and then go on a boat to get rescued: don’t ask if he is right or wrong, rescue him. It is about a human being. After, we can agree, criticise. But people dying, you have to help them.“Protecting the human being is the only thing we have. Right now, we kill each other, for what?

Look what happened in the United States of ­America,Renée GoodandAlex Prettihave been killed … Tell me how you can defend that?”After referencing the shootings of Good and Pretti by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Minneapolis, Guardiola said: “There is not a perfect society, nowhere is perfect, I am not perfect, but we have to work to be better.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaSudanUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

A statement from the OWGR board said this “recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out”.LIV and let die: Reed’s return to PGA fold shows why Saudi golf experiment is doomed | Ewan MurrayRead moreSince LIV competition started in 2022, the OWGR has not given any reward to those performing in that domain. This has led to previously prominent golfers tumbling down the rankings; Cameron Smith is now 221st, Sergio García 363rd and Dustin Johnson 662nd. Not happy with an apparent victory of sorts, LIV took aim at the OWGR with a statement of its own: “We acknowledge this long overdue moment of recognition, which affirms the fundamental principle that performance on the course should matter, regardless of where the competition takes place.“However, this outcome is unprecedented. Under these rules, a player finishing 11th in a LIV Golf event is treated the same as a player finishing 57th. Limiting points to only the top-10 finishers disproportionately harms players who consistently perform at a high level but finish just outside that threshold, as well as emerging talent working to establish themselves on the world stage – precisely the players a fair and meritocratic ranking system is designed to recognise.“No other competitive tour or league in OWGR history has been subjected to such a restriction. We expect this is merely a first step toward a structure that fully and fairly serves the players, the fans, and the future of the sport. We entered this process in good faith and will continue to advocate for a ranking system that reflects performance over affiliation. The game deserves transparency. The fans deserve credibility. And the players deserve a system that treats them equally.”LIV’s 2026 season begins against a troubled backdropafter Brooks Koepkaand Patrick Reed chose to exit. Both will make returns to the PGA Tour.Expanding on their process, the OWGR said: “The board’s overriding aim was to identify an equitable way of ranking the best men’s players in the world, including the top performing players in LIV Golf, while taking account of the eligibility standards that LIV Golf does not currently meet and the fact that it operates differently from other ranked tours in a number of respects.“This includes LIV Golf’s average field size of 57 for 2026 versus the minimum of 75 set out in OWGR Regulations; exclusively no-cut events; the restrictive pathways to join LIV Golf with two spots filled from the Asian Tour’s International Series and three from a ‘closed’ promotions event which does not offset the turnover of players exiting the league; self-selection of players with players being recruited rather than earning their place on the tour in many cases and, in recent days, the addition/removal of players to/from teams based on their nationality rather than for meritocratic reasons.”The OWGR added it will “continue to evaluate” LIV’s competitive status.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

For me, the only thing missing from that performance was a goal.View image in fullscreenWatford’s interim manager, Charlie Daniels, took over from Javi Gracia after the latter’s resignation on Sunday.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“From one training session, the response has been really pleasing. They’ve taken on board what we’ve said and what we’ve asked of them and they’ve implemented it. It showed in our performance.”Daniels expects to still be in charge when Watford travel to Southampton on Saturday as a whirlwind week continues. “Luckily, on Sunday, we were in prepping for our under-21s game today against QPR,” he said. “We were actually on the pitch at the time when we got called in.“We went up to see [the chair and chief executive] Scott Duxbury and he informed us that obviously Javi was leaving and we were going to take charge. I don’t really know too much more than that. We say control the controllable.”This fixture was supposed to be played a month ago only to be postponed 18 minutes before kick-off and it saw Watford end Hull’s run ofChampionshipwins since then.A fifth successive victory for the Tigers would have put them within two points of the automatic promotion places, but Sergej Jakirovic was delighted to move within four of the top two. “Perfect point for us,” the Hull manager said.“When you watch everything back, Watford were better on the ball, without the ball. They were very dangerous and we knew it because this is a team with a lot of potential. Powerful, quick, they can make a difference in every part of the pitch.“They missed some chances, good chances, and I cannot complain about this point. Every point is very important in this league and we are very satisfied with one point.”Eiran Cashin’s first goal for managerlessBlackburnwas enough to secure a 1-0 win over bottom-clubSheffield Wednesdayand move out of the Championship relegation zone.After aturbulent few days that saw Valérien Ismaël depart, the on-loan Brighton defender provided much-needed respite by emphatically converting from close range in the 12th minute to ensure Rovers edged a game originally abandoned back in December with the hosts leading.View image in fullscreenEiran Cashin’s close-range finish was enough to see his side run out the winners against Sheffield Wednesday.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PABlackburn were in control for the majority of the contest and Sondre Tronstad struck the woodwork as they set about calming a nervy Ewood Park. But only a tremendous clearance on the line by Mathias Jørgensen just after the break kept the scores level as he headed on to the crossbar.They deservedly held on, ending an eight-match winless run to haul themselves out of the drop zone on goal difference, while stretching Wednesday’s sequence without victory to 24.Sheffield Unitedmaintained their impressive home form by coming from behind to beatOxford3-1 and move seven points clear of the Championship relegation zone.Sydie Peck cancelled out Myles Peart-Harris’s early opener for Oxford before the break and second-half goals from Andre Brooks and Chiedozie Ogbene sealed the Blades’ sixth win in their past seven league games at Bramall Lane.The Blades’ win against their manager Chris Wilder’s former club continued their climb towards the top half of the table and also lifted them to within eight points of the top six with 16 games to play.PortsmouthagainstIpswichwas postponed owing to a waterlogged pitch.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipBlackburn RoversSheffield WednesdayHull CityWatfordSheffield UnitedOxford UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The centre-back was dismissed in the 29th minute for denying the Saints debutant Jacob Devaney a goalscoring opportunity.It was the third time in five league games thatHeartshad been reduced to 10 men. Unlike the previous two occasions, however, they were unable to grind out a result in Paisley as Freckleton’s 88th-minute header consigned them to a third defeat of the season. The result leaves Hearts six points ahead of Celtic and Rangers, both of whom play their games in hand on Wednesday.Stephen Robinson, theSt Mirrenmanager, made five changes to the side that started the 0-0 draw with Dundee on Saturday, including handing a debut to the on-loan Manchester United midfielder Devaney.Pressure firmly on Celtic in Scottish title race finally worthy of the nameRead moreThere were two changes to the Hearts team from the 3-0 win at Dundee United as Michael Steinwender and Beni Baningime came in for Jordi Altena and Tomas Magnusson.Saints had a decent chance in the third minute but Alex Gogic headed over from Declan John’s free-kick. At the other end, Alexandros Kyziridis saw a shot from the edge of the box easily saved by Shamal George. It proved to be the visitors’ only notable attempt of the first half.The Hearts goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow had to make a good save from Mikael Mandron before Devaney’s cross from the right struck the top of the crossbar. Gogic then saw an inswinging cross from the left clawed out by Schwolow as the Buddies cranked up the pressure.Hearts endured a blow in the 29th minute when they were reduced to 10 men. Stuart Findlay got caught dithering on the ball by Mandron, forcing fellow centre-back Halkett into some frantic last-ditch defending that resulted in him fouling Devaney just outside the box and being sent off. From the resulting free-kick, Killian Phillips’s effort was superbly saved by Schwolow, with Mandron unable to force in the rebound.View image in fullscreenStuart Findlay, seen here after the game ended, gave away possession before Halkett tried to intervene and was sent off.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PASaints thought they had gone ahead in the 39th minute when Marcus Fraser headed home the rebound after Gogic had nodded John’s free-kick against the post but it was ruled out for offside.There was more frustration for the hosts just before half-time when they were awarded a penalty after Harry Milne fouled Jayden Richardson on the right edge of the box, but VAR deemed the offence was outside the box. John fizzed the resulting free-kick agonisingly beyond the far post.Saints continued to knock on the door early in the second half and Schwolow produced a spectacular save to deny Mandron. But Hearts started to become a threat on the counterattack, with Cláudio Braga in particular carrying the fight to the Saints defence.It felt like the game could go either way in the closing stages and Saints eventually made the breakthrough when Freckleton headed home John’s corner from close range.“We’ve seen before in recent weeks when we go down to 10 men, I think there’s a belief there that we can go and get results and I think that showed in the performance,” said the Hearts manager, Derek McInnes.“But we’ve got to own the fact that we can’t keep getting away with it, you can’t keep playing with fire. It’s a red card, there’s no complaint about that, but we caused it, we got ourselves into a fankle.“We had two opportunities to play it forward, and we get ourselves in a bit of a state, and it culminates in a last-gasp challenge, and we’ve paid for it,” McInnes added. “From that point on, it was just making sure we kept it at zero for as long as we can and then hope for a moment.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsSt Mirrenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The trip was a big thing to have been given away, the embassy as well,” said Lai, speaking at anall-party parliamentary group on arbitrary detention and hostage affairshearing on his father’s case.Trump urges Xi Jinping to free HK pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy LaiRead moreThe UK government wants closer ties with the world’s second biggest economy and approved the new highly contested Chinese embassy in London last month. While there were some tangible gains from the trip – a visa waiver, the dropping of sanctions on British MPs and peers, and investment inChinaby British firms – criticism came from parliamentarians questioning why the prime minister travelled to Beijing with the embassy “in our back pocket” without first securing Lai’s release.“Time is running out for my father,” said Lai. “Surely a man who defended freedom deserves a bit of it himself.”It is understood Lai has been told that his father’s case was raised by Starmer during his visit, although he has not yet met the prime minister or foreign secretary since. There is no indication of when his father’s sentencing will take place, Sebastien said, adding it would be catastrophic for both government’s should his father pass away in prison.“It was a tragedy that the only thing that came out of this trip was Johnnie Walker notJimmy Lai,” said the former governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten, referring to the reduction on whisky taxes agreed between the two nations during Starmer’s visit.View image in fullscreenHong Kong businessman Jimmy Lai in 2020.Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP“We were told that the PM raised Jimmy Lai’s case,” said Lord Patten. “What we don’t know is that the Chinese said in response … what was the extent of their discussion?”While a shift in urgency on the government’s behalf was noted by the head of Lai’s international legal team, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC – who has met Starmer and Cooper – she said the strategy remains to be seen.“We make no secret of the fact we think there’s been a strategic misstep in not putting conditionality,” said Gallagher. “It feels to us the UK hasn’t necessarily played the cards it has as well as it could have.”Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

While Santander is the largest lender so far to go above 95%, it is not the first: theSkiptonand Yorkshire building societies have offered deals that allow people to borrow100% and 99% of a property’s valuerespectively.While welcoming the latest announcement, experts highlighted the restrictions and exclusions that apply to Santander’s 98% mortgage. It is not available on flats, new-build homes or any properties in Northern Ireland.In addition, self-employed buyers are excluded and, for a joint mortgage application, both people must be first-time buyers.Meanwhile, the maximum loan of £500,000 will be problematic for many would-be buyers in regions such as London, where the average house price stood at £539,000 in December, according to the Halifax.Santander said its data showed that 52% of UK adults found saving up a deposit to be the biggest barrier to buying a property. Last year the average first-time buyer who borrowed from the bank put down a deposit of more than £85,000.PaulaHiggins,thechief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, said a 98% mortgage from a major lender could make a real difference for some, but the strict eligibility criteria would limit how widely the product was adopted.“Taken together, these restrictions raise real questions about how many first-time buyers can realistically benefit, particularly in higher-priced parts of the south-east where £500,000 may not go far,” she said.Flats are the main route into home ownership in urban areas, especially in London, so their exclusion from first-time buyer mortgage products “is a worrying signal and risks putting ownership further out of reach for many”, Higgins added.Aaron Strutt, at the broker Trinity Financial, said Santander’s move “may well tempt other big lenders back into offering more sub-5% deposit mortgages to new customers”.However, those hoping to borrow the maximum £500,000 will need to earn more than £112,000 a year, as the most Santander will lend someone taking the 98% deal is 4.45 times their salary.First-time buyers borrowing up to 95% from the bank may be able to obtain up to 5.5 times their salary, and a growing number of lenders, including Nationwide and NatWest, will now let some homebuyers borrow up to six times their income.Explore more on these topicsFirst-time buyersPropertyHouse pricesHousing marketMortgagesBanco SantanderBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?Sam WollastonTue 3 Feb 2026 11.08 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 11.12 ESTShareIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is aCornwallthe summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”We’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”That’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.View image in fullscreenA former china clay mine near St Dennis that is now Cornish Lithium’s site for hard rock lithium extraction.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know,possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.Most of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.Jeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.Cornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”View image in fullscreenA derelict former mine building in the Gwennap area, Cornwall.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He foundedCornish Lithiumin 2016.Wrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”He explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects inPortugalandSerbiahave been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists.In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?Wall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”View image in fullscreenLabelled core samples from deep boreholes at Cornish Lithium’s geothermal site near St Day.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”The curse of ‘white oil’: electric vehicles’ dirty secretRead moreI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.On cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.View image in fullscreenScientists analysing old core samples at Cornish Lithium’s geothermal site.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.When he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”Morse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”Things have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”View image in fullscreenA sample of lithium-bearing Cornish rock.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”Cornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”We have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.About 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.View image in fullscreenMachinery at Cornish Lithium’s hard rock extraction site.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”In this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.The water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”It sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.View image in fullscreenThe view to United Downs from Gwennap.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian‘The part of Cornwall nobody ever sees’: the hi-tech future for lithium and tin miningRead moreBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.Since they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals?

Six sites on the Firth of Forth, an estuary on Scotland’s east coast joining the River Forth to the North Sea, were surveyed to better understand the makeup of “urban beaches”.The researchers used a systematic search method to collect and analyse sediment from beaches at Torryburn, Ravenscraig, the Fife coastal path, Carriden, Granton and Prestonpans.On Granton beach near Edinburgh, researchers from theUniversity of Glasgowfound evidence that up to half of the coarse sediments within the tidal zone were human-made materials. These sediments mostly derive from matter swept from land into the Forth by the erosion of coastal industrial sites and the dumping of waste.This phenomenon is not unique to Scotland. On Crosby beach inMerseyside, waste from collieries and the blitz in the second world war now forms a large part of what is called sand. The Thames estuary’s sediments are also thought to be made up of a significant amount of human-made materials. On a sandy bank opposite Canary Wharf, littered bricks that have rounded over time are referred to as “Thames potatoes”.Why are onions turning up on Brighton beach?Read moreLarissa Naylor, a professor of geomorphology and environmental geography at the University of Glasgow and a co-author ofthe study, published in the journal Sedimentology, said: “Beaches are not static landforms – they change. How does a brick become a ‘Thames potato’? It’s not all just about marine plastics. People don’t necessarily know about things like this.”She called for further research on urban coastal areas, saying this was vital for understanding how coastal management might evolve.Across the surveyed beaches, an average of 22% of coarse sediments were found to be what the team called “anthropogenic geomaterial”. They said this warranted a new scientific classification: “anthropogenic sand and gravel” beaches. Scientists have said that as climate breakdown continues to accelerate coastal erosion, changes to the landscape could have an unpredictable effect on ecosystems.“Research like this casts a new light on how human activity is affecting the natural world,” Naylor said.The headline of this article was amended on 3 February 2026 to more accurately reflect the article, which has also had further detail added from the study.Explore more on these topicsCoastlinesGeologyPollutionClimate crisisUniversity of GlasgowScotlandLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

A team from bird conservation charity the RSPB used drones to survey the hard-to-reach areas of the Pennines in the first survey of its kind, which was funded by Natural England.They were delighted to find tiny chicks, including on the High Helbeck estate where the landowners have been creating habitat for the birds to thrive in. The estate managers have created 79 hectares of peatland restoration and 25 new wader “scrapes”, which are the shallow pools the birds pick through to find food.In one video, which particularly charmed the conservationists, chicks were seen feeding in a newly-created bog pool.Dunlins have declined by at least 20% globally since the early 2000s and the IUCN Red List now classifies the species globally as near threatened. In the UK, the species is now red-listed, meaning it is one of the country’s rarest birds.Conservationists have long beenraising the alarmover declining UK wader populations, pointing to the climate crisis and degraded habitats as key threats.Kath Milnes, higher officer for Natural England in Cumbria, said: “This fantastic work across the Cumbrian Pennines clearly demonstrates how investing in nature delivers multiple benefits for everyone. By working with landowners and conservation partners to restore and re-wet peatlands, we’re creating the right conditions for species like dunlin to thrive.”Out of 14 locations the conservationists surveyed, the birds were found in eight of them, and their presence corresponded with how high-quality the habitat was.Nicolete Blackett-Ord, joint landowner High Helbeck, said: “It has been extremely rewarding to take part in this project. We’ve learned such a lot about this threatened species’ distribution and habitat needs.“To confirm breeding at High Helbeck is particularly special because we have worked with the RSPB and partners for several years, improving habitat, to enable wading birds to thrive.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsEndangered speciesEndangered habitatsConservationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

One shows him standing in front of a statue with his wife and oldest son in the centre of San José and smiling. In another, his two sons sit in front of caricatures from the film Cars. For him, the photos capture moments of joy that feel distant when he returns home to La Carpio, a neighbourhood on the outskirts ofCosta Rica’s capital.Delgado migrated with his family from Nicaragua toCosta Ricawhen he was 10, as his parents sought greater stability. When he started a family of his own, his greatest hope was to give his children the security he had lacked. But now, that hope is often interrupted by the threat of extreme weather events.His community in La Carpio, most of whom have Nicaraguan roots, live squeezed between the unstable banks of the Río Torres and a steep hillside. Each time it rains, they face a double risk: the river swelling on one side and potential landslides on the other. Despite official reports deeming the area uninhabitable, government action has stalled.View image in fullscreenIn La Carpio, houses sit along the Río Torres, which is prone to flooding.

It was not the first time, but the heavy rains and winds knocked out the steel panelling on the side of his home. The weather grew so bad that he and his neighbours were told to evacuate temporarily.The storm severely damaged several homes, and Delgado started leading a community effort to relocate vulnerable families to safer ground. He shared photos and videos on his Facebook page, which he renamedRío Torres La Carpio, and joined conversations on other people’s posts to raise awareness about his situation and that of his neighbours.“I want to go to a better place,” says a video in one of his posts.View image in fullscreenThe Río Torres is flooding more regularly, at times forcing nearby residents to evacuate.Photograph: Jake Kilburg/The GuardianDelgado is trying to raise funds to buy land outside La Carpio, where families can build safer homes and find a path towards a better future. His cause has gained the support of Gail Nystrom, founder and director of theCosta Rican Humanitarian Foundation, an organisation that has led work in La Carpio for more than two decades. The pair plan to raise money to buy land in the neighbouring province of Alajuela, where affordable and sustainable shipping-container homes would be built.The relocation is slated to begin with 10 families, including Delgado’s and Patricia Meléndez Narváez’s, whose home was destroyed in the 10 October storm.Narváez, a single mother of six sheltering at her sister’s house in another part of La Carpio, was among the first to express interest in the relocation project. As a low-income Nicaraguan, she spends much of her earnings on bus fares to San José. She sells fruit, but her family faces food insecurity. Her eldest child, born in Costa Rica and now in high school, has started working to earn money.View image in fullscreenPatricia Meléndez Narváez sells fruit for a living.

Situations such as Narváez’s, she says, underscore how families already living on the margins suffer the most when extreme weather events happen.“Where these people are living is not healthy,” Nystrom says. “It’s uneven ground and there’s always a risk of a home washing away. If we can get them to safer, more stable ground, even just a few families at a time, it will make a difference.”In Delgado’s fight for a better life, every step taken is progress. As this rainy season concludes, he and his family cling to the hope that by the start of the next, their situation will be different – safer and more stable.“I left Nicaragua looking for a better life, and I know there is still a lot to do,” Delgado says. “It’s a long road, but we have to take it step by step.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanCosta RicaExtreme weatherFloodingClimate crisisNicaraguaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His report was published on Tuesday.Lammy said he would accept Hall’s 13 recommendations in full.They include:The creation of a new tiered separation centre system, with the most dangerous extremists facing stricter conditions.As reported in the Guardianlast month, Hall recommended that privileges could be earned or taken away depending on closely monitored standards of behaviour.Consideration of whether new legislation is required to protect decisions taken by experienced staff in separation centres from human rights legislation. Hall wrote that prisoners have been able to use article 8 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to challenge conditions in separation centres. “In my view, the government should take steps to limit the application of article 8,” he said.An expert-led review of training for staff.Further improving intelligence collection practices to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy.Lammy said separation centres, special units inside prisons to house Islamist extremists, would be transformed with a new tiered system.Prisons that currently have the centres are HMP Full Sutton near York, HMP Frankland in County Durham, and HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.Lammy said: “Mr Hall identifies a clear need to transform the way that separation centres are governed and operated. That is why we will explore all available options to overhaul the system, including at the next spending review, the creation of new tougher supermax-style units for the most violent, disruptive prisoners.“This will be a tiered system, with movement between tiers permitted following rigorous new risk assessments.“We will begin designing this system immediately.”Lammy said he would consider whether legislation to “protect decisions taken by experienced staff in separation centres” is needed after a high court ruled that a convicted terrorist had his human rights breached by being kept away from other prisoners.“We will also consider whether new legislation is needed to protect decisions taken by experienced staff in separation centres from mitigation on article 8 grounds, exploring the full range of options to deliver this while being clear we will remain compliant with our obligations under the ECHR,” he said.The shadow justice secretary, Nick Timothy, said the UK must leave the ECHR to stop prisoners using it to “escape separation centres”.The chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, Andrea Coomber, expressed concern at the proposals.“It is important to emphasise that the review has not recommended the creation of a ‘supermax’-style prison in the UK. The review rightly finds that it is not necessary to impose such a level of inhumane conditions to manage risk and prioritise safety in custody,” she said.“We wait to see how the tiered approach to separation centres will be operationalised, and in particular the Howard League is concerned at proposals to water down Article 8 human rights.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceDavid LammyEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

One of these, it argues, is that the trans and non-binary equality policy statement at the centre of the OfS case is not a governing document of the university, and is therefore not subject to OfS registration conditions.It further argues that the university’s internal scheme of delegation – the subject of the second breach – forms part of its internal laws and is also outside OfS jurisdiction. The university’s lawyers also argue the OfS decision was “procedurally unfair” and its approach was “in certain respects unreasonable”.In written submissions on behalf of the OfS, Monica Carss-Frisk KC argued that all of the university’s challenges should be dismissed. “The OfS had jurisdiction to consider all relevant matters; it conducted a careful and detailed investigation, correctly interpreting the relevant regulatory conditions and the trans and non-binary equality policy statement.”The hearing before Mrs Justice Lieven is due to conclude on Thursday, with a judgment expected in writing at a later date.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of SussexUniversitiesHigher educationOffice for StudentsRegulatorsGenderTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

He said he had been told he could keep working for the publisher only if he gave up his private investigator’s licence.Portley-Hanks, 79, was giving evidence in a case brought by seven claimants,including Prince Harry, who accuse ANL of using unlawful information gathering techniques over decades.Doreen Lawrence tells court she felt ‘taken for a fool’ by Daily Mail publisherRead moreThe other claimants are Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, the actorsElizabeth HurleyandSadie Frost, the former Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes and the mother of Stephen Lawrence,Doreen Lawrence.Portley-Hanks said he worked for the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday from the early 1990s to around 2013. He said he was “the database guy”, stating: “All I needed was a name or a phone number and I could find a target’s contact and other private details, usually within minutes.”In court, Portley-Hanks said he did not believe anything he was doing was illegal “at the time”, but that he now believed he had carried out activities that are unlawful in the UK, including the gathering of personal data.This was challenged by ANL’s legal team, who pointed to his previous public statements stating he had not broken the law.ANL denies that its journalists engaged in wrongdoing. It has described all of the allegations of unlawful information gathering as “lurid” and “preposterous”.Portley-Hanks alleged that the publisher tried to conceal its continued use of private investigators by asking him to change his email address, to make it appear that he was a Hollywood reporter.He also alleged that on one occasion he was used as part of a chain to make a payment to a serving police officer for documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein. This is denied by ANL.While Portley-Hanks said he thought he carried out some work in relation to John, Hurley andPrince Harry, he said he could not remember anything specific.“I recall that I did stuff for the Mail on Sunday and Daily Mail in relation to Prince Harry,” he said in a written submission. “I know that I did unlawful stuff on him, but I cannot recall what exactly.“I also did stuff on Elton John. That was basically getting contact information for him and his boyfriend or significant other. I know that I did something involvingElizabeth Hurley, but I cannot recall what it was.”Portley-Hanks, who said he was in and out of jail when he was younger, was most recently imprisoned in 2017 in relation to his role with a violent gambling group.ANL’s legal team presented emails showing that a Mail editor had sought confirmation that Portley-Hanks was acting lawfully. In court, however, Portley-Hanks said he was also called at the same time and told to “agree to this, even though it wasn’t true”.Sadie Frost tells court there was ‘price put on my head’ by Daily Mail publisherRead moreIn its written submissions, ANL said all its articles had been secured by lawful means. It said the “serious allegations, which are denied in their entirety, are unsupported by the available evidence”.The publisher said some journalists named in relation to Portley-Hanks had not heard of him until the case. Its legal team also said he was of “doubtful relevance” to the claimants’ case, given a lack of evidence connecting him to stories about them.There is uncertainty over whether a key figure in the trial will give evidence. Gavin Burrows, a private investigator who now states a previous admission of unlawful activity was a “forgery”, has said he is only willing to give evidence from a secret location.David Sherborne, acting for the claimants, told the court this was “highly unorthodox” and that it should not be allowed.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsAssociated NewspapersDaily Mail & General TrustPrince HarryElizabeth HurleySadie FrostElton JohnMedia businessnewsShareReuse this content"

At leastfour of the 10 councils the party controls had proposed 5% council tax rises, the maximum permitted by law, at the beginning of this year.George Finch, who has led a minority government atWarwickshirecounty council since he was appointed leader in July, defended proposals to increase council tax by 3.89%.Finch said: “It’s not an ideal situation. We want low tax, low spend and we were always committed to that. It’s just that national pressures that the government is not solving [such as] Send [special educational needs and disabilities] home-school transport.“The people understand that taxes do have to go up now. I am dead against increasing taxes and I will do as much as I can to lower that bill and that burden.”Council officers told the administration in December that to balance the budget it would have to make further cuts of £4.2m for every 1% reduction from the maximum council tax rise. “Material levels of additional budget reductions would need to be approved,” the report stated.Finch said such officers were expected to “use their professional opinion”, but that it was the “easier” option to implement a 5% council tax increase. “It’s easier to go for 4.99% … we wouldn’t have to change the whole environment of the council. We wouldn’t have to look underneath the backs of the sofas.”Finch said he hoped to make savings through using AI and “transformation savings”, but did not detail on how this would be done.Finch said he had not anticipated the “blockage” he would face after the 2025 local elections. “I had to learn very quickly … the elected members are not fully in control straight away,” he said, adding that council workers and bureaucrats had caused “a lot of blockage”.“The shutters were coming down,” he said. “They realised straight away that George isn’t going anywhere, Reform ain’t going anywhere so they had to start working with us.”Councils have said repeatedly they are facing a dire financial situation, with many struggling to meet their legal duty to balance the books because of rising costs and demand. Most are expected to increase council tax by the maximum amount in April.Reform UK swept to power in the local elections last year, gaining more than 600 seats, and pledged to scale back diversity and climate policies and tackle “waste” and “fraud” through a initiative mirrored on Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiency (Doge).However, Finch said the party’s national equivalent – their Department of Local Government Efficiency (Dolge), led by Reform’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, was yet to visit Warwickshire council. Instead, the council launched a “value for money” programme, which the leader said he hoped would bring £70m-£100m of savings over the next four to five years.Challenged on what specific savings had been made at the council by Doge-style cuts, Finch described a £1m investment fund to improve local roads and streets, the purchase of a “fleet of buses and taxis” for home-to-school transport for children with special needs, as well as savings in the procurement of contracts.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It involved a record number of 71 ballistic missiles as well as 450 drones, he said, sent to destroy energy infrastructure.More than 1,000 residential buildings in Kyiv were without heating on Tuesday.Zelenskyy said Russia had broken a promise that Trump had last week framed as a personal request toVladimir Putinto stop hitting Kyiv and “various towns” for a week because of the exceptionally cold weather. “He agreed to do that. And I have to tell you it was very nice,” the US president said on Thursday.The Kremlin later announced the truce would last only until Sunday. According to Ukraine, the ceasefire should have continued until this Friday.Zelenskyy saidRussiahad used this brief pause in fighting to stockpile weapons. “Either Russia now believes that there are four incomplete days in a week instead of seven, or they are really betting only on war and waiting for the coldest days of this winter,” he said.‘It’s a miracle we survived’: the civilian crew trapped on a ship in Ukraine as bombs rained downRead more“We believe this Russian strike clearly violates what the American side discussed, and there must be consequences.”Trump told reporters that Putin had made an agreement that expired on Sunday. “It was Sunday to Sunday, and it opened up and he hit them hard last night,” he said at the White House. “He kept his word on that … we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there. But it was on Sunday, and he went from Sunday to Sunday.“Asked if he was disappointed, Trump replied: “I want him to end the war.”A second round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US to end the war are due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi. A first round last month failed to yield a breakthrough.Visiting Kyiv, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Tuesday accused Moscow of trying to “create chaos for innocent civilians”. Zelenskyy was “absolutely ready to play ball” in talks this week, he said, questioning whether the Russians “are serious”. He called the overnight attack a “really bad signal”.Rutte praised Trump as the only person capable of brokering a peaceful solution, almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion. “Be assured that Nato stands with Ukraine and is ready to do so for years to come. Your security is our security. Your peace is our peace,” he told Zelenskyy.Kyiv residents reported loud explosions beginning at 1am on Tuesday in strikes that caused damage to five Kyiv districts and injured at least nine people. An air raid alert stayed in effect for more than five hours.“Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. He called on western partners to step up the supply of missiles for air defence systems in order to protect “normal life”.View image in fullscreenAn apartment building hit by a Russian drone strike in Kyiv.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters“Without pressure on Russia, this war will not end. Now Moscow is choosing terror and escalation, and that’s why maximum pressure is needed,” he wrote on social media.Among the infrastructure hit overnight were facilities to heat water for distribution to Ukrainian homes.“Hundreds of thousands of families, including children, were deliberately left without heating during the harshest winter conditions, with temperatures dropping to -25C,” the Ukrainian energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on X.Kyiv resident Natalia Hlobenko, 35, described how she rushed to cover her 11-year-old son on Tuesday before an explosion sprayed her apartment with broken glass. “Where is this ceasefire?” said a teary Hlobenko, bundled up in her windowless apartment.Ukraine said the attack had damaged the Motherland monument, a Soviet-era second world war memorial.

The plan was discussed in December and January by Ukrainian, European and US officials.According to the Financial Times, citing sources involved in the negotiations, a Russian violation of the truce would trigger a response within 24 hours. This would initially involve a diplomatic warning followed, if necessary, by Ukrainian army action to restore a ceasefire.If hostilities continued after 72 hours, Ukraine and its allies would move to a second stage. It would involve a military response from the coalition of the willing, and include American forces.Tuesday’s attacks took place across Ukraine. In Kyiv, 1,170 buildings were without power. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said energy infrastructure had been damaged. More than 800 buildings were without heat, as water was drained from radiator systems to stop them freezing in the bitter cold.“The goal is obvious: to cause maximum destruction and leave the city without heat in severe cold,” Terekhov wrote on Telegram. The deputy prime minister, Oleksii Kuleba, said 110,000 properties in Kharkiv had been left without heating after the attack.View image in fullscreenWorkers installing anti-drone nets over a road in icy conditions near Kharkiv on Monday.Photograph: Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/ReutersThe public broadcaster Suspilne said Russian strikes had knocked out electricity in two towns in the Kharkiv region, Izium and Balakliia, and struck two apartment buildings in the northern city of Sumy.Russian propagandists have been celebrating the Kremlin’s deliberate destruction of Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks – a war crime.“We have driven Ukraine into the stone age. Terrifying cold is approaching. The energy system is extremely sensitive to imbalance,” the presenter Vladimir Solovyov told state TV. He predicted Kyiv would become “a giant cesspool”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They also requested a €100,000 (£86,000) fine.“The seriousness of the charges means any other sanction would be inadequate,” Stéphane Madoz-Blanchet, one of the state prosecutors in the case, said on Tuesday.The final decision on sentencing will be made by a panel of appeal judges who will take several months to deliberate and return a verdict “before the summer”.Le Pen, 57, who leads the anti-immigration National Rally (RN), was considered to be one of the top contenders for next year’s French presidential election until she wasbarred from running for election for five yearswith immediate effect last March after being found guilty of an extensive and long-running fake jobs scam at the European parliament.Le Pen appealed against last year’s verdict and a fresh trial at Paris’s court of appeal is entering its final stages. Le Pen is seeking to overturn last year’s verdict and sentence in order to run for president in 2027. She told the court there was no “system” set up by her party to misuse European parliament funds.But state prosecutors summing up the case against Le Pen on Tuesday that she had been at the centre of a “thought-out”, “centralised” and almost “industrial” system to embezzle European parliament funds.They told the appeal court that taxpayer money allocated to members of the European parliament to pay their assistants based in Strasbourg or Brussels was siphoned off by the party from 2004 to 2016, to pay its own workers in France, in violation of the parliament’s rules.The staff in France had no connection to work undertaken at the European parliament, prosecutors said. The loss to European funds was estimated at €4.8m (£4.2m). The party, which was then called Front National, made substantial savings through the system, the prosecutors said. The system was well documented in email exchanges and party papers.One state prosecutor, Thierry Ramonatxo, criticised Le Pen for making public attacks on judges after last year’s verdict, when she said a“tyranny of judges”wanted to stop her running in a presidential race that she could otherwise win.Ramonatxo said that judges simply apply the law that has been voted for by the people’s representatives in parliament. He said Le Pen had “made a choice to attack judges on the political stage rather than to reflect upon what she had been reproached for”.He said: “Speaking of a ‘tyranny of judges’, of a ‘violation of the state of law’ or of ‘political assassination’ is not part of the judicial debate in a democratic society. It is not part of a debate of ideas but rather is aimed at discrediting all judicial actions in their entirety.”Ramonatxo said this was dangerous and judges had been exposed to death threats because of these attacks.He added: “Speaking of a conspiracy of judges is not an argument, it’s a withdrawal reflex each time the cause seems lost.”He noted Le Pen’s “change of tone” in the appeal court which had a calmer atmosphere, compared with her anti-judges press conference and media interviews last year.The state prosecutors did not request that a five-year ban from running for public office should take immediate effect. However, this detail – which would leave room for a final appeal to France’s highest court – is unlikely to change the fact that a five-year ban would effectively prevent Le Pen being able to stand for the presidency next spring.Le Pen, in the front row in court, sat taking notes and shaking her head as the state prosecutors outlined their case against her and 10 other party members who appealed against last year’s verdict – a further 13 who were convicted last year have not appealed.Outside court, before the state prosecutors’ summing up, Le Pen had told journalists: “I’m a believer, so I believe in miracles.”Defence lawyers will give closing speeches next week. If Le Pen is banned from running for office, she would be replaced by her protege and party president,Jordan Bardella, 30.Le Pen has recently begun speaking of Bardella as a clear alternative if she can no longer run for president, telling La Tribune Dimanche last month: “Jordan Bardella can win in my place.” She said whatever the outcome, her party would dominate and its “ideas will survive”.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenNational RallyFranceEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an electionare a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president torig the November midterm elections.While describing his victory in terms of counties he won in 2024 – and ignoring the vast difference in population between large urban counties and rural counties – Trump said of immigrants: “IfRepublicansdon’t get them out, you will never win another election as a Republican.”Trump said that immigrants “were brought” to the United States to vote, “and they vote illegally. And the, you know, it’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say: ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting in at least many – 15 places – the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.”Dragged down by an unpopular president, Republicans are bracing for a midterm trouncingRead more“We have states that are so crooked – and they’re counting votes – we have states that I won, that show I didn’t win,” Trump continued. “Now, you’re going to see something in Georgia, where they were able to get with acourt orderthe ballots. You’re going to see some interesting things coming out.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to questions on Tuesday about Trump’s call for the nationalization of elections.“The president believes in the United States constitution,” Leavitt said. “However, he believes there has obviously been a lot of fraud and irregularities that have taken place in American elections, and again, voter ID is a highly popular and commonsense policy that the president wants to pursue and he wants to pass legislation to make that happen for all states across the country.”Trump’scommentsto Dan Bongino, the podcast host and short-lived former deputy director of the FBI, come less than a week after FBI agents served a criminalsearch warrantto obtain nearly 700 boxes of ballots and other election material from Fulton county, Georgia, long a target of Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Trump reportedly held a short phone call with the agents, alongside the national intelligence director,Tulsi Gabbard, to congratulate them as the raid concluded.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat, responded to Trump’s comments on Tuesday. “That statement alone makes clear that this threat to our election security, the basic premise of our democracy, is forward looking, to 2026, to 2028,” hesaid. “This is about whether these same tactics we’re seeing now, or worse, will be used to disrupt free and fair elections.”Voting is not a national process in the US: the constitution gives each state the responsibility to govern its elections. Congress can make laws to safeguard the constitutional rights of voters to preserve one-person-one-vote standards and prevent discrimination, but the federal government does not manage elections apparatuses.Trump’s remarks also come as Congress considers several bills that would have a significant impact on US elections.Alarm as Trump DoJ pushes for voter information on millions of AmericansRead moreAnna Paulina Luna, a representative from Florida, led an effort by a group of Republicans to add theSave America Actto the spending bill necessary to end the government shutdown, but the effort failed. The act would requireproof of citizenship– not just a driver’s license – when registering to vote or updating voter registration. It also largely outlaws mail-in voter registration and government-funded voter registration drives, and would charge elections officials with a felony if they register a voter without citizenship documentation, even if that voter is a citizen.An earlier version passed in the House but has stalled in the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York described the legislation as a “poison pill” if added to the spending bill as an amendment.A more strident electionsbill, the Make Elections Great Again Act, was introduced last week by Bryan Steil, a Republican representative from Wisconsin. In addition to the provisions of the Save America Act, the legislation would outlaw ranked-choice voting and universal vote-by-mail, require all mailed ballots to be at an election office before polls close, restrict third parties from helping voters and create a national elections auditing system.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansTrump administrationUS immigrationUS voting rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its service, available in 10 US cities as of early 2026, aims to expand to about 20 metropolitan areas within a year, including London.Waymo’s white Jaguars, equipped with cameras and sensors, have become a familiar sight on San Francisco and Los Angeles streets.“We are no longer proving a concept; we are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London,” Dolgov and Mawakana said.Last year, the company more than tripled its annual volume to 15m rides and now provides more than 400,000 rides weekly in the six major US metropolitan areas where it operates, according to the company.“We have demonstrated that our technology is not just the most advanced manifestation of AI in the physical world, but a vital service that people have come to rely on in their daily lives,” the co-chief executives said.Alphabet took a big part in the recent funding round led by Dragoneer Investment Group, joined by Silicon Valley venture capital titans like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, according to Waymo.Letting go of the steering wheel is no longer a fantasy as Waymo’s robotaxis in the United States and China’s Apollo Go – which has been growing rapidly over the past year – demonstrate the reliability of fully autonomous driving, where responsibility lies with the machine and not the human.Rivals such as Uber are fast emerging. The ride-sharing giant last month unveiled a Lucid robotaxi, aiming to put a fleet of them to work in San Francisco later this year.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyWaymoSelf-driving carsnewsShareReuse this content"

Iger will remain on Disney’s board until December.Mutiny at Disney? Bob Iger’s fight to right the ship faces showdown with shareholdersRead moreThe company also announced that Dana Walden, co-chair of its entertainment division, who had been in the running to be CEO, would become president and chief creative officer.Disney is one of the biggest media and entertainment empires in the world, having acquired Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and most of21st Century Foxunder Iger. Valued at $185bn, it also has a vast tourism business, built around its resorts and ships, and a sprawling digital media arm.While it reported a surge in profits from its streaming services – Disney+, Hulu and ESPN – earlier this week,Disney+unnerved investors by warning of “headwinds” among international visitors to its US theme parks. Earnings generated by its wider entertainment division also slumped after it spent heavily to promote box office hits such as Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash.D’Amaro said: “I am immensely grateful to the board for entrusting me with leading a company that means so much to me and millions around the world.Disney’s strength has always come from our people and the creative excellence that defines our stories and experiences.“There is no limit to what Disney can achieve, and I am excited to work with our teams across the company and brilliant creative partners to honor Disney’s remarkable legacy while continuing to innovate, grow, and deliver exceptional value for our consumers and shareholders.”Some analysts have noted that D’Amaro, unlike Iger, is little known in Hollywood. Walden’s promotion is likely designed to mitigate such concerns.D’Amaro “has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects”, Iger said on Tuesday.Shares in Disney dropped 1% during early trading in New York.D’Amaro will receive a base salary of $2.5m, the company disclosed in a market filing, and a performance-based bonus of up to 250% – in this case, $6.25m – of his base salary.He will also receive a long-term incentive stock award with a target value of $9.7m upon taking up the job, and be granted a long-term incentive award with a target value of $26.3m each year, based on the board’s evaluation of his performance and wider conditions surrounding the company.Walden, meanwhile, will receive a base salary of $3.75m as chief creative officer and president, with a potential performance-based bonus of up to 200% – in this case, $7.5m – of her salary each year.She will also receive a long-term incentive stock award with a target value of $5.3m after starting the job, and be granted a long-term incentive award with a target value of $15.8m each year, based on the board’s evaluation of her performance and wider conditions surrounding the company.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyDisney+newsShareReuse this content"

More than four in 10 Britons – 44% – said the government should write off some or all student debt. But 41% said graduates should have to pay back their loans as currently.Here we look at what the row is all about.Why exactly are Lewis and Reeves at loggerheads?The disagreement is focused on the estimated 5.8 million people who took out a student loan between September 2012 and July 2023.For many of these graduates, everything they hand over from their salary is dwarfed by the interest that is slapped on their debt every month.What prompted the latest row is Reeves’s decision to freeze the salary threshold for repayments for “plan 2” student loans for three years – which means many graduates will now have to pay even more.This salary threshold, above which plan 2 graduates have to repay 9% of anything they earn, will rise to £29,385 in April this year, and normally it would have been expected to then rise again each year. However, Reeves announced it will stay frozen at that level until 2030.Freezing the threshold as wages go up means more people will be pulled into the net and have to start repaying their loans as the amount they are earning goes over the limit. Those already over the threshold who get pay rises will have to repay 9% of a bigger chunk of their earnings.I don’t really understand student loans – can you run me through the basics?It’s a very complicated system, so here’s the short and simple version. Student finance is made up of a tuition fee loan that covers course fees, and a maintenance loan designed to help with costs such as rent and food.Both need to be paid back, and interest is added each month until the debt has been repaid in full or written off.There are five repayment plans – you don’t choose which one you are on – and the Lewis/Reeves row involves plan 2 loans, which were taken out by students from England who started university between September 2012 and July 2023, and students from Wales who have started since September 2012.Student loan average debt chartThe vast majority of outstanding student loan debt involves plan 2 loans: a total of £213bn at the end of 2024–25, said the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).As plan 2 graduates currently have to repay 9% of everything they earn more than £28,470 a year, that means that if someone is earning £38,470, their annual repayment is now £900. The more you earn, the higher your monthly repayments will be.The interest rate on plan 2 loans is linked to the RPI rate of inflation and can vary from month to month: in August 2024 it hit 8%.The Guardianreported in Septemberthat more than 2.6 million people in the UK owed £50,000-plus in student loan debt, and that just over 150,000 owed more than £100,000 – prompting claims that these “debt sentences” are damaging graduates’ ability to save for the future and get on the property ladder.Student loan changes by decile chartThere have been frequent calls for student loan debt to be rebranded as a graduate tax. It certainly works like one: plan 2 graduates simply pay 9% of everything they earn over the threshold, regardless of how much they owe, and it is collected through the payroll, just like income tax.Crucially, the loans are written off after 30 years, and most plan 2 borrowers will never repay their loans in full.But, say many students, that is a very long time to watch your debt get bigger and have to hand over money from your pay packet.What does Martin Lewis want?He said his message to the chancellor was: “I do not think it is a moral thing for you to do to be freezing the repayment threshold in this way … You didn’t say the terms were variable. This isn’t right. Please have a rethink.”Lewis added that in his opinion, students had a contract, and the government was “unilaterally changing the terms. You tell companies they can’t do that – you shouldn’t do it either … It would not be allowed for any commercial lender, it would go against all forms of consumer law.”View image in fullscreenMartin Lewis said graduates affected by the changes could write to their MPs.Photograph: Simon Hadley/AlamyHe added that freezing the salary threshold “is a breach of contract – it’s a breach of promise”.Lewis suggested that all of the millions of plan 2 graduates affected by this could write to their MPs to say that “this isn’t on – this isn’t what we were promised”.What does Reeves say?She said it was “not right that people who don’t go to university are having to bear all the cost for others to do so”.She told LBC: “It is important that you don’t have to start paying back the student loan until you earn enough money.” She added that if a graduate was able to get a job that paid a good wage, they would pay that money back more quickly. “But if you’re never able to repay, that loan will eventually be written off. I think that is a fair system.”The Department for Education has said: “This government is making fair choices to make sure the student finance system is sustainable – protecting taxpayers and students.”What do others say, and what happens now?The National Union of Students (NUS) has said the salary threshold freeze could leave new graduates struggling to afford food, rent and bills.In a report last month, the IFS Institute for Fiscal Studies quantified the financial hit that graduates would take from Reeves’s move. It said that as a result of the freeze, it expected that millions of plan 2 people would repay an extra £93 in 2027–28 – rising to an extra £259 in 2029–30.Crucially, it said the combined effect of all the threshold freezes announced in the budget meant someone who started a course in 2022–23 would repay an average of about £3,200 more over their lifetime. To put it another way, their expected lifetime loan repayment would go up from £52,600 to £55,800 (in today’s prices).“These latest freezes mean that in the long run, we now expect the taxpayer will pick up almost none of the bill for financing the higher education of this cohort,” was a key sentence in the IFS report.The debate will now continue as to whether graduates should meet almost all of the cost themselves, and whether that is a fair way to divide up the bill.Politicians and campaigners will now be watching closely to see if Lewis’s “write to your MP” idea gets traction, and whether this issue might shape up to be one that could cost Labour at the ballot box. The government may welcome the YouGov poll’s findings as demonstrating that there is much disagreement among the public about how the bill should be financed and who should pick up the tab.Explore more on these topicsStudent financeHigher educationStudentsMartin LewisRachel ReevesFinancial sectorexplainersShareReuse this content"

I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.I want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.How storms, Alex Pretti and Trump led TikTok to disasterNearly two weeks ago,TikTokstepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.TikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.During the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.Winter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.After days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.TikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.Read more:‘It’s really sad’: US TikTok users rethink app over concerns about privacy and censorshipWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.This week in Elon MuskElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails showTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to roboticsTwo new plays dramatize our anxieties about techView image in fullscreenJune Squibb and Cynthia Nixon in Marjorie Prime.Photograph: Joan MarcusTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.Marjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes:millions of peoplehave digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.Data, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They wereplaying out in headlinestwo days before I attended, andthe Guardian has published stories about them.Data is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.Marjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).Read more:Marjorie Prime review – Cynthia Nixon steals sad, and spotty, sci-fi revivalI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.The central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.The wider TechScapeWhat is Moltbook?

Are the diamonds of future law-abiding peacetime prosperity under communist rule – that is, effective rule by those who started the war invading Poland in league with the Nazis – preferable to the ashes of wartime suffering which at least offered certainty and purpose?The scene is a provincial Polish town on VE Day, 8 May 1945. Across the continent, there are complex and unresolved feelings under all the celebration, nowhere more so than in Poland, the historic centre of the European war. Maciek (Zbigniew Cybulski), Andrzej (Adam Pawlikowski) and Drewnowski (Bogumił Kobiela) are three fighters in the home army resistance movement, patriotically opposed to communists as much as Nazis. They consider their mission in no way halted by the end of the war, but they have just grotesquely bungled their latest task of assassinating Communist party apparatchik Szczuka (Wacław Zastrzeżyński); lounging around and sunbathing before the hit, they accidentally kill two innocent young people.Nauseated by his failure, horrified by accidentally witnessing the grief of a young woman engaged to one of his two innocent victims, and realising himself exhausted by the war’s end, Maciek is nonetheless ordered by his superiors to try again. He must kill Szczuka, who is due to attend a victory banquet and stay overnight at the seedy state-run Hotel Monopol, whose name is a twist of black comedy on its own. Maciek gets a room next to the one occupied by Szczuka, who is to learn that his own teenage son is working for the insurgents. Maciek flirts with barmaid Krystyna (Ewa Krzyżewska) and inveigles her to his room, which is now more important as the site of lovemaking than a base for political killing. He is struck by a terrible epiphany: he is in love with Krystyna, or at any rate he knows he is now a lover, not a fighter. The war is over. If he refuses this mission, it won’t mean he is a coward or a traitor … will it? Why did he want to kill this man anyway? Or anyone? What has it all been for? “I can’t kill or hide any more!” he wails to his commanding officer, who remains unmoved.Meanwhile, the banquet continues and degenerates into a drunken bacchanal. Drewnowski gets horribly drunk while angling for a job in the press under the new dispensation; scenes showing squares of newsprint used as lavatory paper give a clear indication of just how noble that is. Maciek and Krystyna wander the streets, encounter a ruined church where the crucified Christ now swings crazily upside down, encounter Norwid’s poem and make a terrible discovery about who else is there.Why does Maciek wear dark glasses, asks Krystyna. Maciek replies: “A souvenir of unrequited love for the homeland.” The sunglasses make him look perennially in disguise, incognito, unable to show his loyalties. He will ultimately take them off, but there is no corresponding liberation or revelation. Everywhere in this film is sadness and a kind of delirium: the film was made just 13 years after the events it described; the original novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski on which it is based just three years. It is a testament to Poland’s crisis of identity and ideology.Ashes and Diamonds is at the BFI Southbank, London, on 4 February then tours as part of the Kinoteka Polish film festival.Andrzej Wajda: Portraits of History and Humanityis at BFI Southbank, ICA and Ciné Lumière in London until 26 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAndrzej WajdaSecond world warPolandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s next for the Sundance film festival?The final Utah edition of the hub for American independent film saw slow sales and a mixed bag of movies but a future in Colorado could bring a refreshBenjamin LeeTue 3 Feb 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 18.03 ESTShareSundance is over. Well, not quite. The Sundance we all know, with Robert Redford as its head and Park City, Utah, as its location, is over. The festival’s beloved founderdied last yearmonths after the festival also opted fora move to Boulder, Colorado.But on the alarmingly snow-light ground, there was also chatter about what would become of Sundance as a whole, once the shining beacon of American independent cinema, after it entered a new phase. There were standout films as ever but again notquiteenough to override concerns over what the festival now represents in a harsh new world where it’s arguably easier to make an indie (or whatever cobbling together bits of AI slop might be called) but harder to get it sold.‘The world is hurting right now’: politics and protest hit the Sundance film festivalRead moreThe identity of the festival has long been attached to both Redford and Utah as well as a certain type of movie and a certain definition of independent cinema. The old-fashioned dream trajectory for a Sundance movie – rapturous reception at premiere, heated all-night auction, sleeper success upon theatrical release, possibly a few Oscar nominations next – is harder, if not entirely impossible, to achieve in this landscape. There are textbooks examples of this working – films like Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and The Big Sick – but there are now more roadblocks in place as well as a generation of film-makers raised on these films trying a little too hard to conjure the same magic. Attenders, and attention-hungry critics with X or Letterboxd followings, have tried to force this in recent years, often at a high enough volume to convince studios, or increasingly streamers, to bite, but when viewed without all that altitude, hits have turned to misses. There’s been Patti Cake$, Brittany Runs a Marathon, Blinded by the Night, Late Night, and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl all barely existing outside Utah, and while there have always been Sundance gambles that haven’t paid off (Happy, Texas or Hamlet 2, anyone?), we’re at a time when each loss hits harder, risks that much less justifiable in the heads of cautious execs.The idea of a Sundance movie has slowly shifted and stratified over time – the horror breakout, the must-see doc, the arthouse hit, the comedian-does-drama awards play, the sizzle reel for more commercial work – and this year gave us all of that and more. Again, the films that feel less calculated, less factory-made to appeal to a Sundance audience, were the ones that worked best. Last year, narrative standouts for me were films likeLurker(a dark music industry thriller about obsession and celebrity),Twinless(a genre-shifting tale of sex, lies and identity),Together(a wild body horror riffing on extreme co-dependency) andIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You(an abrasive, darkly funny spiral about the exhaustion of motherhood), all uniquely formed, not calculated to speak to a past Sundance or appease the audience at a new one.View image in fullscreenGemma Chan, Mason Reeves and Channing Tatum in Josephine.Photograph: Greta ZozulaIn a similar vein, the best film I saw this year wasJosephine, a devastating film about the fallout from an eight-year-old girl witnessing a sexual assault told in a way we just haven’t really seen before. On paper it sounds too familiar (Serious Issue drama is another Sundance subgenre), but director Beth de Araujo turns it into something wholly original and deeply affecting, a seat-edge parental nightmare that exists somewhere close to horror without dipping into nasty exploitation. It was the film everyone was talking about on the ground (and the one I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since) and managed something relatively unusual in winning both the grand jury prize and audience award. The grand jury prize in itself has lost much meaning (Nanny, Atropia and In the Summers all recent, little-known winners), but scooping up both has tended to be reserved for films with a brighter future (Minari, Coda, Whiplash, Fruitvale Station). I could see Channing Tatum, who plays one of the more fascinatingly written and performed father characters I’ve seen in some time, gaining awards heat (I’d be shocked if he’s not a best supporting actor frontrunner this time next year) but the film is still unsold. I imagine it’s down to the difficult subject matter (the uncensored rape scene is an extremely tough watch) but also the uncomfortable way that it’s handled (I was told of a producer storming out after exclaiming, “That’s it, I’ve had enough!”).Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreIt’s also still a slower sales market than it once was. Sundance is the most market-led film festival we have, the overwhelming majority of films going in without distribution, but buyers have become more wary – at least outside of those with the most cash (see: Netflix). At the end of last year’s festival, titles starring Jennifer Lopez, Josh O’Connor, Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman still hadn’t found buyers, while this year it’s been similarly quiet.View image in fullscreenOlivia Wilde and Seth Rogen.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for CasamigosThere was excitement over Olivia Wilde’sThe Invite, which had a real slam-dunk Saturday-night premiere (Wilde called it “the best night of my life”). The sour, starry comedy, starring Wilde, Seth Rogen, Penélope Cruz and Edward Norton as two couples bickering and flirting through an increasingly revealing, and kinky, night together, played like gangbusters and, as someone who has sat through many an unfunny festival comedy that has still found laughs from an audience eager to delude themselves, this was a rare communal experience I could take part in. It led to an old-fashioned auction with pretty much every major studio or streamer making a bid, but Wilde, who has shown herself to be a craft-first film-maker who really cares about classic cinema, rightfully demanded a theatrical release and found the film a home at A24. I’d say it’s more sophisticated studio comedy than “cool” indie (more Toronto than Sundance ultimately, I was hoping Warner’s new independent label would win out) but it was a reported $12m-plus sale for a film that more than deserves it. Wilde had quite the festival, also impressing in a far different comedic role in Gregg Araki’s otherwise lukewarm dom-sub rompI Want Your Sex, earning herself belle of the ball status, something that many had expected Charli xcx to snag, starring in three films being unveiled. But her big mock docThe Momentunderwhelmed and smaller, cameo-sized roles in comedies didn’t do much to reassure that her big-screen assault (there are more films to come) will be Brat-sized.The Invite review – A-list ensemble electrify hilarious couples night gone wrong comedyRead moreThe other major sale, albeit on a far smaller scale, was a far more organic Sundance success story: a small, Australian queer horror calledLeviticus. I remain cold on the rather misleading title but the film, about a conversion therapy curse that causes gay teens to be plagued by a demon looking like the one person they most desire, was a knockout. The instant Heated Rivalry comparisons felt a little SEO-inspired (gay sex did in fact exist before that show), but I think its inescapable success did help nudge a film such as this, which was heavy on gay love and lust, from a Shudder maybe to a Neon yes. The company, which has had major awards success in recent years and a hit-and-miss track record with horror, paid around $5m, which does at least take pressure off the film to become a mega-hit (last year’s $17m sale of Together led to just $21m at the US box office). With a smart campaign and an almost perfect critical score so far, it could be a nice small-scale late summer breakout, if not a Talk to Me-sized hit. It also helped to maintain the festival’s horror credentials with other offerings (Buddy, Rock Springs, Saccharine) disappointing.View image in fullscreenLeviticus director Adrian Chiarella and his stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen and Mia Wasikowska.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesDisappointments, well there were many, most of which felt like limp attempts to speak to older, better Sundance movies (overdirected and underwritten small-town dramedies likeCarouselandChasing Summer). The worst was the Dead Pigs director Cathy Yan’s star-packed art world satireThe Gallerist, which wasted Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Catherine Zeta-Jones. It was a grating, antically unfunny slog (even though, like most Sundance films, it was short, it did not feel that way), plus it had the misfortune of premiering right after The Invite, where laughs dissipated into groans. Despite that cast (three Oscar winners!), there has been no buzz over a potential sale.Once Upon a Time in Harlem review – remarkable Harlem Renaissance documentaryRead moreThe festival started on the same day as the Oscar nominations, which brought good news for last year’s narrative crop – nods for If I Had Legs I’d Kick You and Train Dreams – but great news for documentaries. Last year, four of the five nominated docs were Sundance premieres, but this year it was all five, the festival having turned into the most desirable place to premiere a nonfiction film, and while this year was lighter on more obvious breakouts, there were enough to suggest the Academy might once again turn to the festival for recommendations. The doc everyone was talking about wasOnce Upon a Time in Harlem, a slick assemblage of archival footage from a 70s dinner party that reunited key figures from the Harlem Renaissance. Summer of Soul, which also premiered at the fest and was a film that breathed new life into old footage also in Harlem, managed to snag an Oscar win, so while sales news has been quiet, I would expect a deluge of offers.With whispers over who might buy what limited to mostly The Invite, most people I spoke to were more curious over what Sundance might become when it moves to Boulder. The festival has maintained a steady stream of rich Utah attenders who have very little respect for personal space (I’ve never had more jackets unfolded over or on to me in my life) but a lot of money to splash on priority passes and premiere tickets. A similar community will exist in Colorado with similarly big hats, but it’ll take time to get them onside, especially with both the Denver and Telluride film festivals already taking place in the state. What the state does have on its side is better politics (a rumoured concern for leaving Utah with an increase in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation among other issues) and more affordable lodging, a hope that a more diverse cross-section of critics might be able to attend (Park City remains absurdly overpriced).The biggest questions are more existential. What is Sundance now? What do we want or need from independent cinema? What does the system allow or encourage as it now stands? A change of location isn’t going to change the films that are being made, and while quality might have weakened, it remains an important American institution especially as new, awful mergers threaten to squeeze out the underdog. Sundance will return next year in Colorado with a lot of expectations, and hopefully a refresh will mean sights will be set less on the old and more on the new.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2026Sundance film festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meet the cure.” With one of the funniest taglines in cinema history, how can you possibly resist revisiting Sylvester Stallone’s violent, ultra-earnest cult action movie Cobra, which turns 40 this year?Marion “Cobra” Cobretti (Stallone) is a tough LA cop who plays by his own rules. Sporting aviator shades, a matchstick in the corner of his mouth and a gun emblazoned with a cobra, he takes on criminals with a steely dedication to violence and wisecracks, and an aversion to due process that would make Charles Bronson blush.As the movie opens, the city is being terrorised by a cult calling itself New World, whose members are hellbent on demonstrating their commitment to a survival-of-the-fittest creed by murdering everyone in sight. Their leader, a fearsome killer nicknamed the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson), wields a giant, spiky knife that must be the envy of black metal bands everywhere. Cobra and his partner, Gonzales (Reni Santoni), are enlisted to stop the killings – and protect fashion model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen), the only living witness to the Night Slasher’s identity, and consequently his number-one target.It’s the set up for a deadly game of cat and mouse across the city involving car chases, violent mayhem and an army of psycho killers.Cobra’s politics are definitely on the iffy side. The uncomfortable truth about maverick cop movies is that once you scratch the surface they tend to be a bit rightwing. Cobra’s suggestion that cops should be above the law feels a little on the nose in light of current events – and at the time, the movie was heavily criticised for its depiction of policing and glorification of violence. Still, the more ridiculous these kinds of movies are, the easier they are to enjoy, and Cobra is nothing if not ridiculous.The movie, written by Stallone (adapted from Paula Gosling’s 1974 crime novel A Running Duck) and directed by George P Cosmatos (Rambo: First Blood Part II; Tombstone), creates such a monochrome universe of good and bad that the wisdom of letting cops have unlimited power will never enter your mind. When Stallone starts gruffly mumbling about criminals deserving to get shot to death, or fellow detectives suggest (quite reasonably) that Cobra arrest some people instead of executing them, it’s laughable rather than polemical.View image in fullscreenSylvester Stallone and Brigitte Nielsen in Cobra directed by George P Cosmatos.Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyThe contrast between sincere delivery and absurd plot is a key part of Cobra’s appeal. There’s also Stallone’s supersized performance: whether he’s twirling his gun around like a cowboy or simply posing in a doorway, he seems to be screaming “look at me” in every scene, like an attention-starved child.There are also many moments of indisputable cool and unadulterated fun – such as when a cult member threatens to blow up a supermarket and Stallone retorts, “Go ahead, I don’t shop here”; and a bizarre sequence in which Cobretti, snacking in his home office, cuts up leftover pizza with scissors.View image in fullscreenThe poster for Cobra.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyI suspect an earlier version of the script was a lot lighter in tone; Cobra drives an eye-catching hot rod with the vanity plate AWSOM 50 and a Bond-esque nitrous oxide booster – jarringly at odds with a character who very much enjoys putting bullets in “dirtbags”.But Cobra’s most underrated asset is the Night Slasher – one of my all time favourite movie villains, played with a bug-eyed intensity by Thompson. A menacingly giant physical presence, he radiates maniacal rage, particularly in a final showdown during which he bellows that he wants to cut out Cobra’s eyes.And in a nice bit of switcheroo casting, Andrew Robinson plays by-the-book detective Monte, finding himself on the right side of the law after playing the Scorpio Killer in Dirty Harry, the movie Cobra most shamelessly cribs from.Cobra is one of those movies that perfectly reflects the frequent disagreement between critics and audience when it comes to blockbusters.

The first is the brown bear, which was hunted out of existence in the region by the early 2000s.Now the bears are back, around 70 of them, thanks to efforts by conservationists backed by the European Union. The film opens with footage of a 200kg delivery by helicopter, lowering a crate on to the mountainside out of which a bear comes thundering out.The airmail delivery is necessary because of local opposition – farmers are barricading the roads, painting “no to bears” on the tarmac, saying that bears kill their livestock. Shepherd Yves, 63 – flat cap, cigarette dangling from his mouth – is against the reintroduction of the bears. He is training Lisa, a shepherd in her 20s, but their way of life is the other endangered species, with few young people joining the industry.In the local bar, an expert on the TV explains that 85% of a brown bear’s diet is vegetarian, and protein mostly comes from insects and other small creatures. “Pah!” say the shepherds, who have woken up to find their sheep half-eaten, sometimes still breathing. Whichever side of the argument you instinctively find yourself on – team bear or team shepherd – the film resists snap judgments. Keegan shot the footage over three years, and the locals clearly see him as part of the furniture and ignore the camera.We hear a slightly hectoring pro-bear commentator on TV say that we humans must to learn to live in harmony with the natural world. Tell that to the shepherds, who are constantly outdoors, with the changing mood of seasons breathtakingly captured by Keegan and his co-director of photography Clément Beauvois. But then a farmer is taken by her budding wildlife photographer son to view a bear and its two cubs, and is awestruck by the beauty of it. There are no easy answers here.The Shepherd and the Bear is in UK cinemas from 6 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsConservationFarmingFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Our hero is one Merrick Beckford, played by Myles Clohessy (son of character actor Robert Clohessy), who has been entrusted by William H Macy (in a single-scene cameo) with a wagonload of medical supplies in need of a courier.Along the way, Merrick encounters a father-son duo, Mule (Thomas Jane) and Billy (Ryan Masson), a wrong ’un called Edmund (Armie Hammer, appearing on screen for the first time since 2022’s Death on the Nile), and a wounded husband (Eli Brown) and defenceless wife (Mary Stickley). As obvious weak link Billy, Masson is particularly good; poor decision-making feels written into his physicality and way of being in the world, and you’re just waiting to see how this weird little guy is going to mess up.There’s probably at least one too many of the others, though. Clohessy, Brown, Jane and Hammer make for a quartet of handsome guys, playing varying shades on the moral spectrum. Attempts have been made to disguise said handsomeness under layers of grizzle and grime, but any one of them could and has played the hero. Because this is a film determined to be character-driven, it takes time to unravel their various issues, giving rise to a surfeit of talky scenes – somewhat at odds with a genre whose greatest poetic strength was always the ability of a man of few words to telegraph endless meaning with a lingering glance.The model here should perhaps have beenthe Ranown Cycle: inexpensive but beautiful and brisk character-driven westerns none of which are longer than 80 minutes. Still, Frontier Crucible does look lovely, with plenty of evocative shots of Monument Valley and, while gorehounds may feel they have to wait too long for it, there’s some effectively staged violence reminiscent of2015 breakout hit Bone Tomahawk, with whom it shares some of the same creative team.Frontier Crucible is on digital platforms from 2 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsArmie HammerreviewsShareReuse this content"

But he can’t help bringing to it his signature shocks and unsubtle tropes. Sham is based on a real-life case from 2003 that convulsed Japanese media and public opinion. In the city of Fukuoka in south-west Japan, primary school teacher Seiichi Yabushita was accused of racially abusing and beating a pupil and driving him close to suicide on the grounds of the child supposedly having an American grandfather, his pure Japanese blood tainted by foreigners. But was the child lying on the instructions of his mother, the real abuser? The film is based on Fabrication: The Truth About the “Murder Teacher” in Fukuoka, investigative journalist Masumi Fukuda’s 2007 book about the case.Mirroring the prosecution and defence cases in court, Miike gives us both sides of the story in quasi-Rashomon style: first, that of the boy’s mother Mrs Himuro (Kô Shibasaki) and in this version, the behaviour of the teacher (Gô Ayano) is truly sinister. Afterwards – the “prosecution” version having taken up very little of the film – we get the teacher’s own account, and it soon dawns on us that this is in fact the objective reality. He is a gentle, reasonable man, loved by his pupils; he wouldn’t hurt a fly and his remarks on the boy’s family background are entirely innocent. The trouble stemmed from having been persuaded by the school’s terrified headteacher to apologise to the parents in a doomed attempt to make the case go away and to confess to corporal punishment on the grounds of one misjudged chastisement after a bullying incident, intended to show him how awful violence is.In the end, this film does not sit on the fence; there is no Rashomon-style mystery about where the truth lies. Yet Miike’s own creative energies are galvanised, I think, by showing the teacher in his “evil” guise and also, perhaps, by showing Mrs Himuro as a virtual J-horror villain with long straight black hair and a pale impassive face – not far, in some ways, from the avenger Asami inhis classic chiller Audition. And the bullying scenes, the teacher beset by slanderous rumour, the school’s insincere apologies, and the air of ambiguity and mystery … it may be a clue that the original 2003 case also indirectly inspiredHirokazu Kore-eda’s mystery drama Monster from 2023.Sham is at the ICA, London on 6 February, then tours, as part of theJapanFoundation Touring Film Programme.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJapanTakashi MiikeFilm adaptationsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sea Beneath the Skin takes that a whole ocean further. The brainchild of the Samoan director, artist and choreographer Lemi Ponifasio, it’s an unclassifiable music-theatre piece that’s less a collision of worlds than a collusion between them.It begins with a woman walking on to the dark, glossy-floored stage, on which two white pillars stretch up to the roof to represent the trunks of giant kauri trees. Her song, rich-toned and short-phrased, is eventually answered by another woman high in the auditorium, and their duet grows in urgency and intensity. Later there will be four black-clad men dancing a neat cyclical routine involving lots of body percussion, then a third woman facing us down with terrifyingly aggressive shouted chants, and then a young man in Kiribati ceremonial dress, pouring white sand on to the stage from a black plastic bucket. What do these mean? It’s not clear, but they all frame and link the six movements of Mahler’s song cycle, in which the two singers are on stage as characters in some kind of undefined narrative.View image in fullscreenStrikingly different … Sea Beneath the Skin/Song of the Earth.Photograph: Mark AllanThe first notes of the Mahler sounded ornate, strange and almost bejewelled in this new context, even though theBritten Sinfoniawere playing a version by Iain Farrington that condenses Mahler’s huge orchestra, efficiently and imaginatively, to just 16 players. There were translations of the texts for the Mahler songs but not the Pasifika chants, which reinforced the idea, perhaps inevitable in London, that the latter were the “exotic” components – but you could argue that this allowed the imagination more space. The actual texts of the Mahler seemed of secondary importance to the passion put into their delivery by the tenor Sean Panikkar, sounding especially heroic of voice in the first song, and the velvet-toned mezzo-soprano Fleur Barron.They and the conductor Nuno Coelho were only partly visible, playing from behind a gauze at the back. The gauze formed the screen for some largely monochrome videos: flowers opening, underwater explosions, people who might have been wading through floods. Blurry and broken up by the tree trunks, they were often hard to make out and didn’t seem designed to coincide with the music with any precision. For this reason Sea Beneath the Skin, which was first seen in its current form in Luxembourg in 2024, still has the feel of a work in progress. Yet put it next to other works on the theme of climate change – theBarbican’s Fragile Earthseries is showcasing several – and it feels absorbingly, strikingly different: not a lecture but an appeal to the senses and the imagination.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaTheatreGustav MahlerBritten SinfoniareviewsShareReuse this content"

He was captured and imprisoned after being accused of orchestrating attacks that resulted in the killing of five civilians, and convicted on terrorism charges by an Israeli court. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organisation, criticised the trial at the time, arguing that itbreached international law, including the Geneva conventions. Barghouti has consistently denied the charges against him.Barghouti is a member of the Fatah party, a rival of Hamas, and has long advocated a two-state solution. Many argue that Israel’s refusal to release him is driven by concern thathe could emerge as a powerful voice for the Palestinian cause.Born in 1959 in the West Bank village of Kobar, Barghouti grew up under Israeli military occupation after the 1967 war and was arrested multiple times for political activism as a teenager. Over subsequent decades he emerged as a prominent figure within Palestinian politics, advocating Palestinian unity.The forthcoming book will assemble private letters to Barghouti’s family written from prison, correspondence with public figures, press interviews, public statements, historical documents and photographs, alongside extracts from his book 1,000 Days in Solitary Confinement, which until now has been available only in Arabic.Barghouti has spent extended periods in solitary confinement without access to his family and, according to former Palestinian detainees, hasbeen subjected to multiple serious assaults in prison. In November 2025, theGuardian reportedthat he had not seen his family for three years, while his lawyers had been permitted to visit him only five times in the prior two years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been barred from visiting him, a move that breaches international law.The Guardian view on Marwan Barghouti: Palestinians need a political future as well as aid and reconstruction | EditorialRead moreIn August last year, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,shared video footagein which he was seen taunting Barghouti and threatening him with execution.Despite more than two decades in prison, successive opinion polls show Barghouti is the most popular Palestinian politician in Gaza and the West Bank. He is often cited by supporters as a potential unifying leader across factional divides, and hasbeen described as“Palestine’s Mandela”. His continued prominence has fuelled international campaigns calling for his release.The latest waslaunched in November 2025,with coordinated demonstrations and public art installations in Palestine and in cities including London, alongside protests across Europe, the US and South Africa. In December, more than 200 leading cultural figures – including Margaret Atwood, Annie Ernaux, Benedict Cumberbatch, Elif Shafak, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Tilda Swinton, Olga Tokarczuk, Colm Tóibín, Sir Ian McKellen and Gary Lineker –signed an open lettercalling for his release.An introduction to the book has been written by Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa Barghouti, a prominent advocate for his release. “For a long time, I have wished that the world could hear Marwan in his own voice, not through the noise surrounding him,” she said in a statement. “This book finally makes that possible – and I hope it helps people understand who Marwan Barghouti truly is, and how he embodies the Palestinian struggle for freedom and dignity.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPalestineIsrael-Gaza warPenguinMiddle East and north AfricaPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Back in 2009, Kate Pickett’sThe Spirit Level(co-authored with Richard Wilkinson) argued that inequality was the ultimate cause of almost all our social problems, from obesity and teenage pregnancy to violent crime; more equal societies, they claimed, had better outcomes across the board. While criticised – as most “big idea” books are – for overstating the case and cherrypicking evidence, they struck a chord, and some aspects of their thesis are now mainstream.However, when it comes to the UK, there is an awkward problem, both for Pickett and for economists like me who, while not entirely convinced by The Spirit Level, would still like to see a more equal society. In the first chapter of Pickett’s new book, inequality is once again the root of all (social) evils: “if you know a country’s level of inequality, you can do a pretty good job of predicting its infant mortality rate, or prevalence of mental illness, or levels of homicide or imprisonment”. By contrast, she argues that GDP or GDP growth are very poor measures of overall welfare. Pickett then goes on to list the ways in which the UK has become a worse place to live since 2010 – higher child poverty, flattening life expectancy and child mortality, more people in prison.But what actually happened to inequality and GDP over this period? On Pickett’s own preferred measure, the Palma ratio,inequality peaked in 2008and has fallen considerably since then, as the tax system has become significantly more progressive. Meanwhile, growth in GDP has been very slow compared to the previous two decades. If you’d asked Pickett in 2010 whether she’d have accepted this trade – much slower growth in GDP in return for more progressive taxation and lower inequality, she’d presumably have jumped at it. But now, like most of the rest of us, she’s less than happy with the results.Rather than addressing this puzzle, Pickett largely dodges it. The Good Society has lots of ideas: that is, rather than one unifying concept, it covers policy problems and solutions across health, education, criminal justice, social care, and elsewhere. In each case, she diagnoses the failures of our current model and suggests alternatives, mostly drawn from the successful social democracies of northern Europe.The problem is that because – as she commendably admits – she has neither the expertise nor the space to provide a detailed analysis of these topics, we end up with a whistle-stop tour of the greatest hits of progressive social policy, from Finnish schools to Norwegian prisons. If you’re instinctively sympathetic to the view that we imprison too many people, that we should value care work more, that the education system is too exam-focused and so on, then you will probably nod along to much of this. But if you’re not already convinced, you’re unlikely to change your mind. And for those who do have expertise in one of these topics – and can spot the holes, or at least the oversimplifications – this compendium is less than the sum of its parts.More interesting – perhaps because Pickett has researched the topic in depth herself – is her section on Universal Basic Income. Working with my frequent co-author and friend Howard Reed, she has helped produce detailed, costed blueprints for a UK UBI. I think she overstates the case, though: it’s simply false to claim that a UBI would eliminate the need for means-testing or eligibility tests, since the main drivers of these in the UK system are incapacity and housing benefit, which would still be needed even with a UBI. And most of the small-scale studies of UBI so far have failed to find the transformational benefits she claims. Whether you agree or disagree, however, this at least represents a serious and substantive proposal for tackling both inequality and injustice.Finally, in an attempt to address the political obstacles to achieving any of this, Pickett concludes with an appeal for the greater use of evidence in policymaking, combined with citizens’ juries. Sadly, this just makes her sound out of touch in the current political context. I wish I could believe her claim that “a fairer, healthier, more caring and sustainable society is entirely within our grasp”, but I’m afraid I ended this book no more optimistic than when I started it.The Good Society: And How We Make It is published by Bodley Head (£25).

A professor of American literature at the University of Manchester, McGuire specialises in the late 19th-century realist tradition; at its best his work blends the unsparing violence of Cormac McCarthy with a bleak lyricism reminiscent of Welsh poet RS Thomas.Both The North Water, set onboard a whaling ship dispatched from Hull to Baffin Bay in 1859, andThe Abstainer, inspired by the hanging of three Irish rebels in Manchester a decade later, probed the grisly underbelly of Victorian imperialism, harsh worlds where a “man’s life on its own is nothing much to talk about”. In White River Crossing, McGuire travels across the Atlantic and back another 100 years to the Prince of Wales Fort, a remote trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Company in what is now northern Manitoba. Founded by royal charter in 1670 and granted sole right of trade and commerce across some 1.5m sq km of territory, the British venture was established to exploit the indigenous fur trade, but investors also hoped for other profitable discoveries, particularly silver and gold.It is the frozen winter of 1766 when a ragged pedlar brings a chunk of rock to Magnus Norton, the fort’s chief factor. The rock is “shot through with a pair of thin and branching yellow lines like twin rivers”, proof, the pedlar says, of gold fields in the Barren Grounds 600 miles north. Norton can barely contain his greed. He dispatches his deputy, John Shaw, and two other company men to seek out and claim the treasure, along with two couples of the Dene tribe, known to their white paymasters as Northern Indians, to serve as their hunters, guides and cooks. He is careful not to inform the company of his mission. He lets the other men in the fort believe that the mission is for copper ore. Norton is near retirement, his health is failing. A rich man already, he intends to return to England a good deal richer.White River Crossing moves at a propulsive lick, its bloody meat marbled with cruelty and violenceAlthough the novel moves between the viewpoints of all seven members of the group, it is granted mostly to the bookish Thomas Hearn to tell the story of the arduous and ill-fated expedition. Poleaxed by grief and loss of faith, Hearn, a one-time ordinand, has sealed himself up inside a fiercely austere self-restraint. Shaw, by contrast, is a man of brutish appetites for whom both the land and its peoples are chattels, his to exploit as he chooses. As they travel north the group encounter other communities and, when the younger of the Dene guides, the hot-headed Nabayah, loses his wife to a rival in a wrestling match, Shaw steps in and wins her back. Deaf to Hearn’s warnings, Shaw insists on a night with her as his reward. The consequences of his crude arrogance will undo them all.Like The North Water, with which it shares much DNA, White River Crossing moves at a propulsive lick, its bloody meat marbled with cruelty and violence. McGuire does not let us look away: the clumsy amputation of a gangrenous arm is described in almost voluptuous detail, while the desolate beauty of the vast landscape is summoned with a sharp precision, “the blueish peaks of frost-tipped hills” as crisply vivid as “the piles of shattered marrow bone and antler”.Inside his characters’ heads, however, McGuire moves with less confidence. Backstories provide context but little complexity or depth. Hearn is convincing enough as a man who, broken open by horror, is remade anew, but Shaw, like Drax in The North Water, is a frustratingly one-dimensional villain and Abel Walker, the third company man, mostly overlooked. As for the Dene guides, whose perspective might have given this story a very different complexion, they are quickly swallowed by the plot.In a foreword to the novel, no doubt to pre-empt criticisms of cultural appropriation, McGuire stresses the paucity of first-hand Dene histories and defends his choice in the novel “to emphasise commonality over cultural or historical difference”. The decision is misguided. It is when he abandons that imagined commonality, giving his Indigenous characters the scope to see the world entirely on their own terms, that he succeeds most powerfully: a scene in which a shaman uses his powers to expel an evil spirit from the body of a sick child is one of the most striking – and affecting – in the novel. By emphasising commonalities, in scrupulously eradicating deep cultural difference, McGuire diminishes the power of the four Dene guides to transform the narrative and begs the very question he sought to duck about whether their story was really ever his to tell.White River Crossing by Ian McGuire is published by Scribner (£20).

What are the implications for a community when a woman lies dead in her home for more than a year without being discovered? All the signs are there, from the slowly seeping stench in the hallway to the maggots emerging in the homes of her neighbours.Questions of responsibility and culpability, both individual and systemic, are raised in Najib’s play. Its central, sad scenario is not as far-fetched as it may sound: the deceased, Shirley, is fictional but the play takes inspiration from the real, lonely deaths of several women listed at the beginning of the script, includingSheila Seleoanewho lay dead for more than two years before she was discovered.Three storytellers (Marcia Lecky, Sam Baker Jones and Safiyya Ingar) describe events leading up to Shirley’s discovery from the point of view of her neighbours – a single mother, a cleaner, a middle-aged widower and his grieving daughter among them. The drama underlines its artifice rather redundantly (we are actors, the actors tell us). But there is intimacy and richness in the stories they tell, with a deft creation of interior life even though the third-person narration should technically distance us.The Rat Trap review – teenage Noël Coward’s jaundiced marital portraitRead moreIn a production directed by Jess Barton, a spotlight is used to create focus and stillness (lighting design by Peter Small), backstories are folded into the present and humour is entwined into a story of death and desolation. Caitlin Mawhinney’s set design, with the beauty of dried flowers overhead even as we are told about maggots and skeletal remains, delivers in irony.But there is a fuzziness in the play around bigger systemic failures that lack the forensic detail needed to devastate. The pushand pull between the human need to connect versus urban isolation is reminiscent of Alexander Zeldin’sBeyond Caringand Kae Tempest’sLet Them Eat Chaos, but the play does not tie together the personal and political nearly half as rigorously. The central arc around the maggots appears to be building to a surrealist horror on insect invasion but stops short to serve as little more than backdrop.It has an anticlimactic effect, as does the leavening of darkness with a benign tone of goodness and warmth. Najib has a knack for drawing you into her world, even if she pulls her punches in it.AtBush theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Their next trick? A seance-style tribute to an old friendMark FisherTue 3 Feb 2026 04.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 04.18 ESTShareSpalding Gray used to perform a show called Interviewing the Audience.The celebrated monologistwould invite a stranger he had met in the lobby to join him on stage. Through a sequence of innocuous questions, he would get them to open up about their lives. At one performance, a guest broke the audience’s hearts by talking about her daughter’s murder. At benefit nights, people living with HIV shared their tales. Other times, the anecdotes would be eccentric or amusing. Gray said they showed us “what it is to live in the world”.Watching Gray conjure up this material made a big impression on a young actor calledScott Shepherd. It was the show he saw on his first visit to the Performing Garage, the New York home of the Wooster Group. The pioneering avant garde company had been established a few years earlier by Gray and director Elizabeth LeCompte with their colleagues Kate Valk, Ron Vawter, Jim Clayburgh, Willem Dafoe and Peyton Smith.“Interviewing the Audience was quite amazing,” says Shepherd. “His first question was always the same – ‘How did you get to the theatre?’ – and there would be some story about the subway or the taxi and, somehow, he would find a thread from that into the person’s inner being. It was one of the great early theatre experiences of my life.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s an act of channelling or ventriloquism’ … Scott Shepherd, with Spalding Gray on screen in the background.Photograph: Gianmarco BresadolaBy this time, Valk had had an equally transformative experience at the Performing Garage, a theatre so small there was no room for a foyer and some seats were accessible only by climbing a ladder. As an inquisitive acting student, she had headed along to the SoHo venue to see Spalding Gray in two autobiographical pieces, Sakonnet Point (1975) and Rumstick Road (1977). She was hooked.“I gave up my apartment and moved in upstairs,” Valk says, joining Shepherd on our video call. “It was such an amazing group of artists. I was like, ‘Oh, I’m just going to give up everything and move in here because this is the place to be.’”Valk became part of the Wooster Group in 1979, initially working as a seamstress and soon as an actor. She has rarely worked outside the company since: “I don’t know how to do anything else.”Now, in a kind of posthumous tribute, both actors are returning to the role Gray created in Nayatt School (1978). This was the piece that followed Sakonnet Point and Rumstick Road in the Rhode Island trilogy and was Gray’s first foray into autobiographical monologues, a forerunner to pieces such as Swimming to Cambodia and Monster in a Box.Coming to London’s Coronet theatre, Nayatt School Redux is not exactly a revival, but a reimagining of the 1978 show in a very Wooster Group way. “When we go back to look at the old work, it’s not like an artist can pull out her old painting from the warehouse and look at it,” says LeCompte, who lived with Gray in the 1970s. “We can’t do that. We only have very deteriorated, black-and-white material to work from.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m the survivor’ … Kate Valk.Photograph: Gianmarco BresadolaWhere Gray – who died in 2004 – was once a friend and colleague, he is now a character in a play about a play he made. “We’re getting as close to channelling his performance in Nayatt School as we can,” says Valk. “I’m the survivor, because I’m still in the group. I knew him, I worked with him, I was young, now I’m old and I’m the person who’s translating and telling you what he did. My monologue is like a palimpsest across the top of Spalding.”“It’s another act of channelling or ventriloquism,” says Shepherd, recalling the Wooster Group’sHamlet(2005) in which he mimicked an archive recording of Richard Burton. “It’s even more literal this time, because I’m wearing some of the clothes that Spalding wore when he did the show. It does feel a bit seancey.”Taking its name from a school in Barrington, Rhode Island, where Gray grew up, Nayatt School had all of LeCompte’s celebrated hallmarks. Foremost among these was the collage-like juxtaposition of disparate elements. The production blended vaudeville-style radio skits with TS Eliot’s postwar playThe Cocktail Party, itself a curious combination of drawing-room comedy and esoteric religious debate.View image in fullscreenEllen Mills and Ari Fliakos in Vieux Carré by the Wooster Group at the Edinburgh international festival in 2010.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianEliot’s play fascinated Gray not only because he owned a cast recording featuring Alec Guinness and Irene Worth, but also because one of its characters, Celia Coplestone, goes on a spiritual journey that ends in her martyrdom. It reminded him of his mother, a Christian Scientist, who killed herself when he was 26. (Gray himself is assumed to have jumped off the Staten Island Ferry to his death.)The fusion of pop culture and high art has characterised the Wooster Group’s work. In 1984, LSD (Just the High Points) sat at the meeting point of Timothy Leary’s countercultural drug taking and Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. In 1988, Frank Dell’s the Temptation of St Antony combined Gustave Flaubert with Lenny Bruce. And 1997’s House/Lights was half-Gertrude Stein and half-sexploitation flick.The company has forgedunexpected connectionsbetween baroque opera and sci-fi B-movies, Noh theatre and Chekhov. For LeCompte, who trained in painting and photography, such head-spinning collisions are the way she sees the world. “I grew up with the television and art, and they do that all the time,” she says. “You can go from the most serious soap-opera scene to a toothpaste ad. As a kid, I thought, ‘Oh, they’re in the bathroom and they’re going to come out of the bathroom and continue the scene.’ I didn’t see that you needed to connect those things in any rational way.”She compares her technique to frottage, the artistic practice pioneered by Max Ernst in which pencil rubbings are taken from rough surfaces to create something new. “That’s what I do with the texts and the people,” says LeCompte, rubbing her hands to demonstrate. “The performers are material and I like to rub myself up against them.”“Not in the literal sense,” she adds, hastily, with a laugh.The effect can be discombobulating. It can also be funny. “It seems to be fun when it’s high/low,” says Valk. “For instance, this difficult writing by Gertrude Stein juxtaposed with a girl gang from a 60s B-movie. It’s a fun mix, like a cocktail. Sometimes, it’s not logical or reasonable, but you put the source material and the text so they’re vibrating against each other and then they somehow grow together.”Shepherd adds: “The high and low combination has a double benefit. It takes the high thing down off its pedestal and you can appreciate an earthier humanity that’s encoded in there. And on the flip side, something sublime is exposed in the low thing.”View image in fullscreenWillem Dafoe and Sheena See in To You, the Birdie! (Phèdre) by the Wooster Group at Riverside Studios, London, in 2002.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGetting these combinations to work can be difficult, but once LeCompte has set her course, she never abandons an idea. Shepherd gives the example ofVieux Carré(2008), in which they took a play by Tennessee Williams and layered it on to Paul Morrissey’s films from Andy Warhol’s Factory. “We wanted to get the tone of realism from those movies on to this Tennessee Williams text,” he says. “We had to try and abandon different parts of the films because they didn’t work with the scene. It took us a while to get the right parts. Sometimes we know it’s not working, but not at the level of the whole project falling apart.”‘Theatre puts a finger in the wound’: Willem Dafoe returns to his first love in VeniceRead moreThe matching of live actors to recorded film and audio requires discipline. Even if a Wooster Group performance leaves you bewildered, you never lose admiration for the precision of the actors and technicians. “As performers, Scott, myself and Ari Fliakos – the whole middle period of the Wooster Group – have an athlete spirit,” says Valk. “With the copying, the speed, the deftness and the technical skills to follow and respond physically, there is a feat that needs to be accomplished. All three of us enjoy that.”It is entertaining for audiences too, and if any of this sounds highfalutin, it is to underestimate LeCompte’s sense of joy and wonder. She is less the austere auteur than the enthusiast, delighted at the absurdities of life and art. When Valk refers to the company’s “career”, LeCompte raises her eyebrows, adopts an expression of cartoon horror and draws scare quotes in the air. Imagine calling it a career! Heading for 82 and looking decades younger, she retains her sense of delight and mischief. She flashes another broad smile and heads off to rehearsal.Nayatt School Redux is atCoronet theatre, London, 17–25 AprilIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Noël Coward’s characters often struggle to fit their romantic and creative ambitions into conventional shapes. This rarely seen, jaundiced marital comedy suggests that the interest started early – Coward was just 18 when he completed it at the end of the first world war, though it was first staged in 1926.A century on, playwright Bill Rosenfield and the enterprisingTroupe theatre company“reimagine” the play – streamlining the plot and florid dialogue. Two young writers, novelist Sheila and budding playwright Keld, embark on marriage, pursuing domestic bliss and artistic success. Something has to give – and, although she’s the brains of the pair, it is Sheila who relinquishes ambition to allow Keld to flourish.View image in fullscreenScent and spite … Zoe Goriely in The Rat Trap.Photograph: Mitzi de MargaryRosenfield relates the play to Ibsen (you might think of A Doll’s House), while other observers mention Strindberg’s acrid marriage plays. These sombre lodestars suggest that The Rat Trap isn’t exactly a comedy – Coward hadn’t yet developed his chrome-plated twists of phrase or predatory banter.Lily Nichol’s Sheila begins in eye-rolling splendour. Her boho prints and flappy trousers (spiffy costumes by Libby Watson) create art deco curves between hip and shoulder. As trouble hits paradise, she shrinks, stills, stops taking up space – subdued in politely pressed pleats. It’s dismaying to watch her light dim, and Kirsty Patrick Ward’s production, which can’t lift the play’s bickering comedy, is tender with its misery.Ewan Miller doesn’t disguise Keld’s self-regard. He may be ruffle-haired and boyish, but he also bridles and bullies and is foul to the shrewd housekeeper (an excellent Angela Sims). He’s a second-rate talent, insufferable even in abjection.Characters around the central pair question what marriage means: Gina Bramhill’s shrewd singleton or Zoe Goriely’s minx, arriving in a cloud of scent and spite. There’s no template for love among the artists, and an unexpected ending hardly lifts the spirits.Troupe make a staunch case for Coward’s youthful effort. “I think it will only be interesting as a play to ardent students of my work,” he said – but though he would later write more piercingly about intractable desires, he sharpened his claws in The Rat Trap.AtPark theatre, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreNoel CowardComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

For Christie has found her happy place: serenely single, professionally triumphant (on the telly too, after years not finding a niche there), and absolved by menopause of the need to give a toss about almost anything. There’s comedy in that freedom from care, and Christie mines it plentifully in an entertaining 90 minutes majoring – like her Channel 4 showThe Change– in what life looks like for women (or at least, this woman) when oestrogen gets out of the way.But Jacket Potato Pizza feels like a placeholder of a show, lacking the fervour or clownish fury of her best work. Its short first half begins by contrasting quotations from Presidents Obama and Trump – but that gives a misleading impression of what’s in store. More indicative is the routine that follows, in which Christie re-enacts a story as told by her menopausal pal, a banal tale of a night out turned into a symphony of digressions, malapropisms (mixing the Benjamins Zephaniah and Netanyahu, most memorably) and vocabulary tantalisingly out of reach. It’s as much sketch as standup, and our host brings it to life with characteristic pop-eyed dismay.View image in fullscreenPeachy material … Bridget Christie.Photograph: Natasha PszenickiSuch is life for the fiftysomething female, as Christie would have it: recording her farts for friends on WhatsApp; reporting to her doctor ever more exotic bodily malfunctions; socially invisible and entirely pleased about it. Two anecdotes early in the show contrast eager-to-please young Christie with her later-in-life counterpart – the one indulging a date’s improbable sexual fetish, the other caring not a jot when her gardener catches her eating cake directly from the bin.You can’t not enjoy this stuff: Christie’s demob-happiness is infectious, and her flair intact for constructing, routine by routine, mini-carnivals of her own ridiculousness. But there’s a sense too that she’s in her comfort zone with this material – and that one or two routines aren’t quite up to snuff. The number on Alan Carr and The Traitors is too throwaway to justify the clunky segue from ICE killings in Minnesota. A joke about Jimmy Savile and adding new clauses to her will feels a bit arbitrary and unmoored.There’s peachy material too, like the routine (which she wishes us to understand – honest, guv – doesn’t draw on her own family life) on the thermonuclear obnoxiousness of 15-year-old girls. But I found myself wishing for more of the political edge that animates a later section, in which Christie takes issue with the TV drama Adolescence. The excitement, of an opinion both passionate and provocative, and ventured with her trademark 10-ton sarcasm, is palpable.‘My reproductive life is over? That’s liberating!’ Bridget Christie on comedy, TV and the menopauseRead moreWhile the show concludes with sobering words about the state of the world, the politics are seldom integrated into the comedy here.

The last of these teamed with Elliott in 1970 to produce a superb West End debut (originating at the Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford) with JB Priestley’s When We Are Married at the Strand (now the Novello) starringPeggy Mountand the veteran, very large comedian Fred Emney as the bibulous photographer.Emney was prone to ad-lib new lines. When asked if he had lost any weight recently, he replied, “Indeed I have. I’ve given up mint sauce.” No wonder Elliott went on to become, for many years, the leading and most successful pantomime producer in the land, also writing or directing about 500 of them himself.His stable of regular stars included Les Dawson,Danny La Rue,Lily Savage (Paul O’Grady), Lesley Joseph and his favourite dame, the Scottish star Allan Stewart, with whom he worked for 11 years. His first panto, in 1968, was Goldilocks and the Three Bears at the New theatre, Hull, starringRonnie Hiltonand another notable dame, George Lacy.Goldilocks was his favourite panto, he said, “because it’s the same as Cinderella only the Buttons character gets the girl”. He also liked the rarely seen Sinbad the Sailor, but was distraught during an interval at the Wimbledon theatre in the 1982-83 season whenKen Doddhad extended the first act to well over two hours. “He’s not sticking to my script!” he screamed at a few critics happily wallowing in the Ken Dodd show.His panto pre-eminence was challenged about a decade ago by the rising new company he had joined, Nick Thomas and Jon Conway’sQdos, and he withdrew as an eminence grise. It was an unhappy departure, but he gracefully elided into an advisory position with both Thomas and Conway and the rising new producerMichael Harrison.View image in fullscreenSally Ann Triplett (Ruby Keeler) in Jolson at the Victoria Palace theatre, London, in 1995.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBy then he had been reunited with Weldon after they had gone their separate ways. Weldon, who died in 2019, had concentrated on star-laden classics at theChichester Festival theatreand the Haymarket in London, while Elliott veered towards Ray Cooney, juke-box musicals and star-laden classics at the Phoenix theatre –Douglas Fairbanks Jr, who became a great friend, in The Pleasure of His Company, a stage version of the Fred Astaire movie, and Lee Remick in William Inge’s Bus Stop, both in 1976.His biggest hits, without Weldon, were Cooney’s Run for Your Wife (1983) about a bigamous taxi-driver dashing between south London homes in Wimbledon and Streatham, withRichard BriersandBernard Cribbins, which ran in the West End for nine years, then all over the world; and Buddy (1989), a musical celebration of Buddy Holly at the Victoria Palace, then the Strand, which ran for 13.The third great Elliott show wasJolson(1995), based on the Michael Freedland biography of Al Jolson, also at the Victoria Palace, which boasted a sensational performance by another of Elliott’s panto stable, Brian Conley, a definitive Buttons. There was a stunning design coup when Conley burst through a stage-wide screen showing Larry Parks in the black and white Jolson Story movie to make a live comeback in the gilded deco extravagance of Radio City in New York.Elliott was born in Bournemouth, the only child of Lewis Elliott, a greengrocer and taxi driver, and his wife Sybil (nee Wyatt), a florist. He was educated at Bournemouth school and left to work as a fridge salesman in a department store. His wage of £5 a week was slightly improved by joining the local Palace Court theatre in 1958 – he fancied the leading lady – where he acted in Agatha Christie plays.He moved on in 1959 to weekly rep in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, where he played golf withDavid Hemmings, also starting out, and fell in love with another actor, Janet Waldron, with whom he lived for the next 11 years.In 1961, he joined the cast ofDixon of Dock Greenon BBC TV as a police cadet, stayed for two seasons and made a lifelong friend and colleague inPeter Byrne, who played the square-jawed DS Andy Crawford. Together, they formed E&B productions in 1964, which stayed afloat until 2000, though Byrne had long since departed.He was mentored as an actor, stage manager and ultimately producer by Bridge, who improved on an offer of an understudy role at the Oxford Playhouse with a one-line walk-on (“Water, water, we’ve found water …”) in The Lizard on the Rock, starring Siân Phillips at the Phoenix in 1962.View image in fullscreenConleth Hill and Sean Campion in Stones in His Pocket at the Tricycle theatre, 1999.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianUp and running as a producer in 1964, he ran two seasons at the Little theatre in Rhyl, where Roy Plomley, begetter of Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio, put up some money – twice – on condition they included two of his plays. Then came a return to Bournemouth to run the Palace Court theatre, where the company includedBill Maynard, Ann Sidney (Miss World, 1964),Pat Kirkwood,Charlie ChesterandDave King.Those are dim and distant days now, but there always remained a creative link with the repertory and vaudeville theatre of the past that Elliott and others exploited to commercial advantage and success.This was activated when Elliott first met Weldon in 1967, arranging a tour ofAlan Ayckbourn’s first hit, Relatively Speaking, starringEvelyn Layein the Celia Johnson role. Weldon was meanwhile cultivating working relationships with the new Billingham Forum and new Yvonne Arnaud, and this led to their West End breakthrough in 1970.Bridging the generation gap, they were soon producing (in 1973) Gladys Cooper and Joan Greenwood in Enid Bagnold’s shimmering The Chalk Garden and, in the same year,Peter WyngardeandSally Ann Howesin a decent revival of The King and I at the Adelphi.Elliott was by now married (in 1971) to the musical theatre actor Jenny Logan, and Weldon to another musical starlet, Janet Mahoney, and the quartet became a regular fixture at West End first nights. They shared an office in Ivor Novello’s old flat at the top of the Strand in the Aldwych and lined the walls with posters of flops and triumphs.One of the triggers of the falling out with Qdos was Elliott’s acquisition – without consulting his fellow board members – of the rights to Marie Jones’sStones in His Pockets, which had started out in Belfast and arrived at the Tricycle (now the Kiln) in Kilburn 2000.He transformed this modest two-hander, brilliantly performed byConleth Hilland Sean Campion as Irish film extras dreaming of fame and glory, into a West End and Broadway smash hit. It remained one of his proudest achievements, and rightly so.View image in fullscreenLindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman in Noël Coward’s Private Lives at the Albery theatre, London, 2001.Photograph: Peter Jordan/PAHe and Logan divorced in 1986, and he married the actor Linda Hayden in 1987, having cast her a few years previously in a notable flop, Underground, starring Raymond Burr (Perry Mason and Ironside on TV), at the Prince of Wales – this was a low rent, unlikely tube train version of Murder on the Orient Express.More positively, Elliott had a long-lasting creative partnership withEdand David Mirvish in their big Canadian theatres, and a huge international hit withEric Sykesand Jimmy Edwards in Big Bad Mouse (1972), by Philip King and Falkland Cary.He built more kudos after Stones with high-class presentations ofAlan RickmanandLindsay Duncanin Noël Coward’sPrivate Livesin 2001 at the Albery (now the Noël Coward) and ofPatrick Stewartand Kate Fleetwood in a brilliant, blood-soakedMacbeth, directed by Rupert Goold in the West End and New York, starting out at Chichester’s Minerva studio and Goold’s Almeida in Islington in 2007.Elliott was given an honorary degree by Arts University Bournemouth in 2015 and a special Olivier award in 2018. In that same year, he published some rollicking “random memoirs” titled Keeping My Balls in the Air.He is survived by Linda, their two children, Haydn and Laura Jane, and by a son, Simon, from his first marriage.Paul Richard Elliott, theatre producer, born 9 December 1941; died 26 January 2026Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsPanto seasonobituariesShareReuse this content"

Last year,Anya Taylor-Joywas linked to the project in the role of the younger Mitchell, as was Streep’s Mamma Mia! co-starAmanda Seyfried.Crowe, whose best-known film is the music drama Almost Famous, has been attached to the project for some years, and in 2023 said that he hoped for a release date before 2026. Speaking three years ago, Crowe explained that – unlike recent films based on brief periods in the life of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen – the film is not based on a biographical book about the star, but rather Mitchell’s own account of her life.“It’s Joni’s life, not [seen] through anybody else’s prism,” he said. “It’s through her prism. It’s the characters who impacted her life that you know and a lot that you don’t know. And the music is so cinematic.”Streep has previously received two Oscar nominations for playing real-life musicians: the violinist Roberta Guaspari in 1999’s Music of the Heart and the titular character in Florence Foster Jenkins, about the life of the amateur singer, in 2016.Explore more on these topicsFilmMeryl StreepJoni MitchellCameron CroweAnya Taylor-JoyAmanda SeyfriedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Directors were still saying, ‘If we put a black woman in this role, what does this mean for the whole story? Do I have to cast a black man? Then it’s a black movie. Black movies don’t sell overseas.’”A similar sentiment was voiced by Lupita Nyong’o last year, who won the supporting actress Oscar in 2014 for her performance in Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave.Speaking to CNN, Nyong’o said the range of roles she was offered was dismayingly slim. “After I won that Academy Award, you’d think, ‘Oh, I’m gonna get lead roles here and there,’” she said.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreInstead, she said, the conversations usually began: “‘Oh, Lupita, we’d like you to play another movie where you’re a slave, butthistime you’re on a slave ship.’ Those are the kind of offers I was getting in the months after winning my Academy Award.”More than 30 black actors – including Sinners’ Michael B Jordan – have so far been nominated for the leading actor Oscar, and five have won, while 16 black female actors have been up for the equivalent best actress award.Twenty-five black male actors have competed for the supporting actor award – with seven wins – including Sinners’ Delroy Lindo. His co-star, Wunmi Mosaku, is one of 32 black female actors who have been nominated for supporting actress, with 10 wins.

Now there are barely more than 30. Can social media attention and a push for protected status ensure their survival?Tim DowlingTue 3 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 08.37 ESTShareOutside it’s raining so hard that the sandwich board sign for BJ’s pie and mash (“All pies are made on the premises”) is folded up inside. The pavement along Barking Road in Plaistow is a blur through the front windows and deserted, and there are only two customers in the shop. Another sign – this one on the counter – says “CASH ONLY”.Card machine companies often tell proprietor Nathan Jacobi that he’s missing out by not catering to customers who favour cashless transactions. “They’re the ones missing out,” he says. “Cos they ain’t getting pie and mash.”London’s pie and mash shops, once threatened with extinction, seem to be experiencing a kind of resurgence. “London’s original fast food, ‘pie and mash’ is making a surprise comeback in the British capital …” announced the Washington Post in a recent article. “This renewed demand for hearty ‘cockney cuisine’, so-called for its working-class East End roots, has been observed across the city.” The revival is said in part to be down to the TikTok generation’s fascination with these bygone establishments and their obscure customs. M Manze’s in Bermondsey – London’s oldest surviving pie and mash shop, founded in 1902 – has never been busier. At Goddards at Greenwich, the Post reported, there are queues down the street every weekend.View image in fullscreenThe menu at BJ’s Pie and Mash cafe.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBut behind this flurry of enthusiasm is a backstory of unrelenting decline. There are now just more than 30 pie and mash shops in London, where once there were hundreds. On its website thePieand Mash Club lists five closures in Greater London in 2025 alone, including another Manze’s in Deptford High Street, which shut this time last year after more than a century in business. There was a queue down the street that day, not because it was suddenly cool; it was the end of an era.But that still isn’t the whole story. Alongside the closures, a few new pie shops have appeared. Barney’s in Walthamstow only opened in 2018. Bush Pie & Mash in Shepherd’s Bush acquired its premises in 2021, filling a gap left by the 2015 closure of A Cooke’s, which had been in nearby Goldhawk Road since the 1930s.Which picture reflects reality? “It’s a bit of a difficult one to speak about,” says food blogger James Dimitri, who has visited all of London’s pie and mash establishments, bar a few where shops have more than one branch. “A lot of the ones I go to, they’re packed at lunchtimes, from 12 or maybe even earlier.” Others, he says, are doing less well. “There’s one I went to the other day, and it was just a shit atmosphere, kind of dying, and I just know it’s not going to last.”When it comes to the difficulties facing pie and mash shops, I might consider myself part of the problem: although I’ve lived in London for 35 years, I’ve never set foot in one. It wasn’t the food – beef pies, mash, the classic parsley sauce known as liquor, the eels – that put me off as much as the arcane ritual, the fact that there is definitely a wrong way to order and consume pie and mash. For example: I know that you’re not supposed to use a knife, even if you’re offered one – pie and mash is only ever eaten with a fork and a spoon.View image in fullscreenTim and Don get ready to dig in.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“Those things are slightly intimidating to outsiders, if you don’t know the rules,” says Jonathan Nunn, co-editor of the food and culture magazine Vittles. “There’s an insularity about pie and mash which is one of the reasons why people love it. On the other hand, that insularity is one of the things that makes it difficult – more difficult than British cafes and fish and chip shops – to induct new customers.”As a precaution I have come to BJ’s with my friend Don, who knows about these things. Don lives just up Barking Road, towards Canning Town. He eats at BJ’s often, and knows enough to have cash on him. He even dropped by the shop earlier in the week to let it be known that he was coming today, and that he would be bringing an idiot with him.Under Don’s guidance I opt for a single portion each of pie and mash – “one and one” in pie shop parlance. BJ’s is famous, or maybe notorious, for an innovation that amounts in some eyes to heresy: they offer chips as well as mash. “You put this on the internet, that you’ve had pie and chips, the stick you’ll get,” says Jacobi, who runs BJ’s with his wife, Nadine. Worse still, the chips are very good – fried in beef dripping, rather than palm oil. “At least I’m saving orangutans around the world,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘A comforting working-class dish.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianJacobi sits down with us at one of the long communal tables, to oversee my first pie and mash experience. “I’m supposed to flip the pies over, aren’t I?” I say. “You can, I don’t bother,” says Jacobi, handing me a napkin wrapped around a fork, a spoon and a knife. I think: this is a test.“It is my understanding,” I say. “That I shouldn’t touch this knife.”“That’s right,” says Jacobi. “Never use a knife.” But Don, I point out, is using his knife. “That’s cos he’s posh,” says Jacobi. He claims the tradition dates to the second world war, when the pie and mash shops of London donated all their knives to a metal drive. This sounds fanciful, but he says he heard it from a Chelsea pensioner in full regalia.Pie and mash is a famously under-seasoned dish, which makes the next step crucial: after making Xs in the bottom crust of your flipped pies – with the spoon’s edge, unless you’re Don – you douse the plate liberally with salt, white pepper and chilli vinegar. “You must put the vinegar on, because it changes the meal altogether,” says Jacobi.As the rain slows, the shop begins to fill up. Jacobi, simultaneously working, holding court and submitting to a fractured interview, clears a table after the departure of a satisfied customer. “There’s another one’s taken the pattern off the plate!” he says. I too am satisfied. The pie and mash was tasty, the chilli vinegar hot. It is simple food, made fresh every day and while some enthusiasts will keep score about which pie and mash shops offer the best fare, that is slightly beside the point.View image in fullscreenTwo cups of liquor – made with eel stock or potato water.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“What makes one stand out isn’t always going to be the pie itself,” says Dimitri. “Because even when it’s really good, it’s never going to be mind-blowing. It is what it is: a comforting working-class dish.”I’m thinking: I’ve been here for almost an hour and nobody’s mentioned eels yet. But even as I think it, I see Jacobi coming back to the table with a tub of jellied eels. The pie in pie and mash was originally filled with eels, a cheap source of protein closely associated with London. But as the 19th century came to a close, eel got more expensive, beef got cheaper and the pies were filled with mince to keep costs down. Eels were relegated to a side dish, stewed or jellied – a decidedly acquired taste.“As a food writer, and as someone who loves London and really wants there to be a great London dish, it’s to my annoyance that I hate jellied eels so much,” says Nunn. “I really cannot stomach them.”“It’s not a thing that a lot of people have,” says Jacobi, “and it’s mainly older people. My boy will eat it, because he’s been brought up with it.”Suffice to say that if you don’t like eels, you won’t like them jellied – the jelly, Jacobi tells me, is also made of eel. (Traditionally liquor, too, is made with eel stock, but Jacobi doesn’t keep enough on hand to make it that way every time – alternating batches are made with potato water.)But an acquired taste should never be too easy to acquire. After working my way through a small plate of eel segments I find myself becoming pleasantly inured. “You did well there,” says Don.There is an idea that pie and mash isn’t really being eclipsed, it’s just migrating to the suburbs, following on the heels of its former clientele – the white working class of the old East End. But the origin story of BJ’s runs counter to this narrative. “My dad used to be a lagger,” says Jacobi, “but when he pulled out of the company he owned with two partners, he wanted to find something else to do.” In 1979 he started a pie and mash shop in suburban Elm Park – one of the first in Essex – but it was deemed such a threat to the tone of the neighbourhood that the council wouldn’t let him call it a pie and mash shop. “If we’d put that sign out,” Jacobi says, pointing to the sandwich board leaning against the wall, “they’d have closed us down.”View image in fullscreenM Manze in Bermondsey, London’s oldest surviving pie and mash shopFed up, Jacobi’s father, Benjamin, returned to the East End, bought an old pet shop in Barking Road and opened BJs in 1982. Competition was stiff – there were nine pie and mash shops in Newham then – but crucially Benjamin owned the freehold. “That’s why we’re still here,” says Jacobi. BJ’s is the only surviving pie and mash shop in the borough.It’s not an easy way to make a living, especially if you’re committed, like Jacobi, to making pie and mash the traditional way. “Tuesdays and Thursdays I mince me own meat,” he says. “Then you’re here at five o’clock every morning, and you’re literally preparing pies for four or five hours. So you’re not earning a penny, you’re just preparing pies. Then you start cooking at 10 o’clock. That’s the worst thing about it, the prep.”As a highly regarded survivor in the pie and mash world, Jacobi is not unaccustomed to attention. He had an ITV crew in last November, highlighting aspects of the chancellor’s budget. Before that, a TikToker called Ben in the Mix paid a visit. Influencers with cameras drop by regularly. “Best thing,” Jacobi says. “TikTok and YouTube and things like that, helps you out so much. Helps me out anyway.”But pie and mash bloggers can also be a little bit doctrinaire, and Jacobi resents having points deducted for anything non-canonical, like chips. Another example: he serves his mash in domed scoops, where traditionally it should be scraped on to the edge of the plate to form a little cliff. He even offers gravy as an alternative to liquor, albeit grudgingly. “I always say, I make gravy with water,” he tells me. “I make liquor with love.”View image in fullscreenJellied eels are also an essential item on the menu at pie and mash shops.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOnline critics who are new to pie and mash present their own challenges. “One woman gave me three stars because a geezer moaned at her for leaving the door open,” says Jacobi. “It ain’t my fault.” Then there are the Americans who view pie and mash as an exotic curiosity, or a holdover from a previous century, or another example of British cuisine’s manifest shortcomings. When US food critic and social media star Keith Lee came to London last year he ruffled feathers with his blunt assessment of pie and mash, even though he got it about right: “Is it something to rave about? I don’t believe so,” he said. “I just think it’s a comfort food that people are used to going to, and they’ve been going to for years, so they just keep coming back.”In October 2024 the MP Richard Holden called for pie and mash to be granted traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) status. In pursuit of that designation, last February, 15 representative producers agreed on a standardised recipe. But would such a designation amount to a lifeline, or a straitjacket?The pie and mash shop is itself a product of relentless innovation. It sprung up as an alternative to the street pie man, providing four walls and a roof where working people could eat. It switched from eel pie to mince when the economics demanded it. But once pie shops came to be seen as endangered, tradition became the point, and innovation a drawback. Shouldn’t they be able to mutate in order to survive?View image in fullscreen‘You must put the vinegar on, because it totally changes the meal altogether.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“I like the ones that strictly just do pie and mash and nothing else,” says Dimitri. “The core audience they have, people who visit pie and mash shops, don’t want them to change and get quite angry when they do.”“I think the presence of liquor is probably the one non-negotiable thing,” says Nunn. “But having the choice of gravy, or vegetarian pies, if those are things that will help pie and mash shops thrive in 2026 London, then I would rather that happen.”For Jacobi, a simple menu reflects the pie and mash shop’s status as the original fast food. “Some pie and mash shops never used to do tea,” he says, “so they’d have you in and out faster.”This article was amended on 3 February 2026. A picture caption said the original M Manze shop was in Bloomsbury; however, it is located in Bermondsey.Explore more on these topicsPieFoodLondonRestaurantsSocial etiquettefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Soon she had lost her car, phone and all her moneyAnna MooreTue 3 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTShareTamsin met Mike in the summer of 2022. He was a mechanic in a garage that she walked past twice each day between home and work. After a while, he’d call out “good morning” or “good evening” and she’d wave and smile back. Then the exchanges got a little longer. (“Hard day?” “Looking forward to dinner?”) Six months later, Mike and Tamsin exchanged numbers.Within two years, her life was wrecked. She had left her marriage, lost her home, quit her job, and sold her car and her phone, spent all her savings and racked up tens of thousands in debt. (Under her current repayment plan, it will take another eight and a half years to pay back her creditors.) Tamsin’s story seems scarcely credible and she is mortified to have to tell it. She stumbles through, piles of notes on her lap and a support worker fromVictim Supportat her side. Every few minutes, she breaks off to say, “It sounds so stupid”, “I sound like an absolute nutter” or “Where was my head?” In truth, she spent two years in the company of a psychopath, a master manipulator. He is in prison now, serving a 22-year sentence, but not for romance fraud, or anything involving Tamsin. Her experience, police have told her, “would not stand up in court”.There has, however, been some progress in the understanding of “in-person romance fraud”, with the recent conviction ofNigel Baker. His 17-year sentence, for fraud by false representation,is believed to be the longest ever for this crime. Baker targeted single mothers, divorcees, and women who had been recently bereaved, including a divorced police officer and mother of two, and an accountant. He lured them into non-existent “investment schemes” and persuaded them to take out loans to help him through various invented personal crises,causing bankruptcy and a suicide attempt. There were five victims in the court case, who lost more than £900,000 between them, but police now believe there to be many more, with Baker’s crimes stretching back to the 90s. One victim reported him in 2016, but was told that this was a “civil matter”. It took four years of pushing before she found a detective to take on the case.Anna Rowe, co-founderof the romance fraud support organisation and thinktankLoveSaid, is not at all surprised. Rowe co-founded LoveSaid in 2022 with Cecilie Fjellhøy, a victim of fraudsterSimon Leviev, who was convicted of fraud, forgery and theft in 2019, and whose story was told in the Netflix documentaryThe Tinder Swindler. The two women are currently assisting 75 to 100 victims of romance fraud each week – including “romances” that took place entirely online, and those that took place in real life (or “in-person”). “We’ve been banging the drum about ‘in-person romance fraud’ for the past five years,” says Rowe. “When we started, we had so many women come forward to say that they’d been told by police that it was a civil matter. The typical attitude from police has been, ‘Your boyfriend lied to you – that’s not really a crime. You chose to give money to a love rat. It’s a relationship gone bad.’ Slowly, slowly, we’re seeing lines of inquiry open up. Instead of turning victims away, we want police to take five and ask questions. Why was the relationship created? Why did they say they needed money? Can you confirm it?”There have been other recent cases.Christopher Harkinsposed as a successful businessman when matching with women on dating apps, then used various methods to extract money from them. In total, he admitted to defrauding nine women out of £214,000. Harkins was also found guilty of multiple sexual offences, including rape. “You’ll find, unsurprisingly, that perpetrators of in-person romance fraud are usually career criminals and often have long histories of other crimes,” says Rowe. Though Harkins’ conviction was in 2024, many women had reported him over the years to no effect, at least one as far back as 2012.There have been other successful prosecutions. In 2023,David Checkleywas jailed for 11 years after conning at least 10 women out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. He had been convicted of similar offences in 2010 – and before that, in 2002, he was jailed for false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. In another case,Cieran McNamarawas sentenced to seven years in 2024 for swindling more than £300,000 from four women.According to Rowe, most ofthe methodsused for in-person and online romance frauds are the same. “We see the same patterns every time,” says Rowe. “It’s the grooming, the absolute love bombing, where the fraudster finds out everything about you and mirrors it back to create that perfect soul mate,” she says. “Then it’s the trauma bombing – getting your sympathy – and gaslighting when you question anything. But, with in-person romance fraud, there’s the added violation of them having touched you. That’s a whole different layer of trauma.”View image in fullscreenWhen Tamsin met Mike, she was nearing 50, and at a low point. Living in south-east England with her teenage daughter and husband of almost 20 years, she had always been the main breadwinner, working in product development. “I was tired, unhappy, feeling unloved, a bit neglected,” she says. “I was in a rut of going to work, going home, doing dinner.” Mike was tall, broad, and 10 years older than her. After swapping numbers, the two began chatting on WhatsApp. “It was constant,” she says. “Question after question. I’ve never known anything like it. We were talking about anything and everything. What we were doing, how we got here, things we liked.” Mike told Tamsin that he was divorced, and, like her, a Christian. (They discussed their favourite hymns.) A month later, they met for dinner in a neighbouring village and more dates followed. Tamsin met Mike’s friends at his local pub. He told her that he owned various rental properties around the world, and was also a partner or investor in a number of businesses. He claimed to be a wealthy man whose money was all tied up. He said that he chose to rent a room with a local family because he wanted company and didn’t like living alone.Around this time, Mike also revealed that he had a history of cancer – and doctors had recently found a malignant growth in his bowel, the size of a 20 pence piece. Rowe says that this is entirely predictable: “Cancer is used in almost every romance fraud experience.. Either the fraudster has it, or his child, or a close family member.” It makes the fraudster seem vulnerable and, to the victim, worthy of extra care and compassion. If questions arise further down the line, the enormity of a cancer diagnosis is enough to silence them. It also charges the relationship with a new level of urgency.In the coming weeks, Mike showered Tamsin with affection. “He’d buy me flowers, he messaged constantly with lovely compliments – just wonderful things that made me feel good about myself. He was fun, sociable, full of life. He seemed like the male version of me.” During a stolen weekend in a shepherd’s hut in Port Lympne (Tamsin told her husband she was with her cousin), they planned their future. “We talked about me getting a divorce and us making a life together,” she says. “To me, it was really serious. This is where I was going.” Soon after, though, Mike called her at work with devastating news. His tumour was now the size of a grapefruit. His cancer was terminal. “I had to go outside and cry,” she says. “I was in this crazy, confused world, and I couldn’t tell anyone about it. I was losing my head, struggling to know what to do.” Although she arranged to accompany Mike to his hospital appointments, when the time arrived, he’d always insist on going alone.View image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; OSTILL/Getty ImagesTime now seemed precious. They began viewing places to live – huge barn conversions, always with space for Tamsin’s daughter, that Mike said he could pay for. Meanwhile, Tamsin began paying for Mike to stay in hotels. “He was telling me that at home, the hot water wasn’t on and I wasn’t having that,” she says. “He was a mechanic, he did a dirty job. He had cancer. He needed a warm shower, so I insisted.” Finally, Mike claimed that he had bought a local property on family land that he was fully renovating. He didn’t want Tamsin to see it until it was ready and perfect.It was a fraught time. Mike was losing weight, looking pale, struggling with his mental health and supposedly in and out of hospital. For a brief period, Tamsin even believed that he’d died. Mike’s lawyer and business partner, “Marcus” (who Mike had talked about in the past), messaged her and delivered the news. Tamsin cries as she recalls this. “I was mourning this person, looking up at the stars, talking to a dead man who wasn’t even dead,” she says. After a few days, she was contacted again. Mike had not died after all; he’d been saved in a specialist clinic in Switzerland. It was a turning point. “From then on, I decided that I was not going to lose him. I would not let him out of my sight.”Tamsin left her marriage, was reunited with Mike and they moved into a hotel, which she paid for. Mike told her he’d bought her a local business of her own - he showed her the building, which was also being renovated – so she resigned from her job. While awaiting all these renovations, they took off on a road trip: Mike told her he wanted her to attend a family reunion up at the very tip of Scotland. To help with cash-flow, Tamsin sold her Audi, exchanging it for a less expensive Mercedes. A few weeks later, she had to sell the Mercedes too, and instead bought an older Passat.They drove all over the UK – Pembrokeshire, Blackpool, Paisley, Inverness, with Tamsin paying for every meal and every hotel, emptying her savings accounts and using multiple credit cards. She then began messaging her parents and friends, begging for small loans to tide her over – though that had to stop when she also sold her phone. (At that point, she was miles from anyone she knew and cut off completely.)How could she have been so taken in? “I feared so much that I was going to lose him,” she says. “I’d invested everything – left my family, resigned from my job. I just don’t think my heart could handle any doubts. I was too exhausted to question things, so I think I decided that this had to be it. I love him. He loves me. This is my life now. Trust him.” Denial is a common form of self-protection, says Rowe. “Eventually, most victims know that something is very wrong, but it can take a long time for the heart to catch up with the head. Can you imagine accepting something that will bring the worst pain down on you ever?”After four months, out of cash, Tamsin and Mike were sleeping in her car. “Each day, we had to choose between paying for food, or a shower, or diesel. I was exhausted. I just wanted it to be over,” she says. She drove back south, dropping Mike in a town centre and telling him that she was going to the doctors to get contraceptives. Instead, she drove to her parents’ home. They had been in touch with the police and informed Tamsin that Mike was wanted for multiple sexual offences. She called the officer in charge of the case, and Mike was arrested that same day.View image in fullscreenWhat did Mike want from her? Tamsin still isn’t sure. “I think it was a final adventure for him, a last horrible hoorah when he knew a case was building against him and he was soon going to be charged,” she says. “I came along and he decided to get as much out of me as he could.” If it was only about money, then why lead her to resign from her job and cut off her income stream? Why invent a cancer? Why make her believe he had died? Tamsin thinks he simply enjoyed the game. Money is only one element of romance fraud, says Rowe. “It’s about power and control, the horrendous emotional manipulation, and the sexual element too – and then the money,” she says. “There is no doubt that perpetrators get an absolute kick out of all of it.”Two years on, Tamsin is still at the very start of recovery. Staying with her parents, she set about selling all her personal belongings – bags, jewellery, anything branded – to begin paying her debts. She has since found a job, paid back the loans from friends and family and, with the help of Victim Support, agreed a repayment scheme for the £50,000 she owes credit card companies. (Although Victim Support did manage to get one creditor to write off £10,000 of debt, most would not accept that Tamsin was a victim of fraud or economic abuse, since she “benefited” from the expenditure herself.) “I’m ashamed, embarrassed, hurt, humiliated,” she says. “At first, I didn’t want to see anybody. It was just work all the hours God gave me, go home, have dinner, sleep, repeat. I very much cut myself off from the world.” She had stayed in some kind of contact with her daughter through most of this. When she first saw her husband again, his words were, ‘Thank God you’re safe.’ They are slowly rebuilding a relationship, but “it’s tough,” she says.Tamsin isn’t expecting sympathy. “The crimes he is now in prison for are far worse than anything I’ve been through,” she says. In fact, she is always braced for blame. “That’s what all victims of romance fraud are met with,” says Rowe. “When it finally ends, on top of all the trauma, they’ll be blamed by most people for being so ‘stupid’.”In the UK, victims of in-person romance fraud should report to local police as well as Report Fraud (0300 123 2040).

Why do some recipes not specify which miso to use?Ben, by email“I think what recipe writers assume – and I’m sure I’ve written recipes like this – is that either way, you’re not going to get a miso that’s very extreme,” says Tim Anderson, whose latest book,JapanEasy Kitchen: Simple Recipes Using Japanese Pantry Ingredients, is out in April. As Ben points out, the two broadest categories are red and white, and in a lot of situations “you can use one or other to your taste without it having a massive effect on the outcome of the dish”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Salty, savoury miso is (usually) made by steaming soya beans, mashing them with salt andkoji, then leaving to ferment. “And the age is what changes the colour,” says Anderson. “White miso is not aged for very long – three to six months – and so it retains that beany, beige/yellow colour and tastes fresher, while red miso is aged for six months or longer, resulting in a darker colour and more funk.” The parallel Anderson often draws is that of a mild cheese and an aged or mature cheese. “Gouda is a good example,” he says. “It can be quite mellow and salty, but as it ages it develops a buttery, caramelised flavour.”As to which miso to use when, the general rule is: if you want to keep things light, use white; if you’re after something more savoury, something richer, then go red. “There’s a recipe in my new book for misotrone [AKA minestrone seasoned with miso] and that’s a good example of what miso can do to food,” says Anderson. “White miso accents the tomato’s acidity and freshness, but if you use red, you get a richer, more concentrated tomato flavour.”Likewise, Emiko Davies, author ofThe Japanese Pantry, dollops red miso on top of fried or roasted aubergine, while lighter misos are for soups with clams or other seafood. Millie Tsukagoshi Lagares, author ofUmai, meanwhile, leans on the latter to crank up dressings, marinades for white fish, and bakes or sweet treats (hello, miso caramel). But the other thing you could – and should – do, adds Davies, is mix your misos: “You can customise a more complex flavour – think of it like a blend.”Other misos you might come across include shinshu (yellow) miso, which, happily, can offer the best of both worlds. “It has the right amount of savouriness and nuttiness,” says Tsukagoshi Lagares, and is best used for miso soup and sauces. Then, there’s sweet white miso, or sweet rice miso, which is “fresh and not very salty or funky,” notes Anderson, making it a good call for mild ingredients (think the classic Nobu miso marinated black cod). At the other end of the spectrum is hatcho miso, which is aged in open barrels for a minimum of 18 months, turning a very dark brown, and “has all these rich flavours, such as cocoa, Marmite and molasses”. And if you can find it, check out Anderson’s favourite category: nama miso, or unpasteurised miso. “It has an interesting, lively aroma that you don’t get from other misos,” he says, and it works like a dream as a marinade. “It’s some of my favourite stuff.”Got a culinary dilemma?

I’ve imagined bringing new flavours home, letting them transform the kitchen – but with all the madness in today’s world, that dream must stay a dream, for now. So, these recipes become my journey, a way to reconnect with that spirit and taste the magic of the Arab golden age today.Kbeibat bulgur with spring onion and pomegranate (pictured top)This dish originates in Latakia, a port in Syria.Kbeibatbulgur in Arabic translates to “smallkibbeh”, and refers to a range of dishes that are popular across the Arab world and beyond. It has many variations from Turkey to Iran, even Brazil, but what they all have in common are complex layers of flavour: sweet, sour and spicy. Serve with the spicy fennel and herb salad below, plus bread to mop up the beautiful juices.Prep10 minSoak20 minCook50 minServes4For the kbeibat200g fine bulgur wheat1½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground coriander1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling and greasing1¼ tsp salt55g plain flourFor the sauce4-5 large spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced (150g)5g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped, plus extra for sprinkling1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped4 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp red pepper paste or harissa2 tsp lemon zest2 tbsp lemon juice¾ tsp ground cumin45g pomegranate molasses1½ tsp caster sugar, or honey¾ tsp saltMix the bulgur with the spices, olive oil and salt in a bowl, then add 300ml just-boiled water and mix well. Cover the bowl and leave to soak for 20 minutes, until the bulgur has absorbed all the water. Add the flour to the bowl, then mix it in well with your hands, squeezing the mixture until you have a sticky paste. Have ready a bowl of oil next to you (to stop the mixture sticking to your hands), then shape into 20 balls of about 30g each; roll them between your palms to make smooth balls. Put the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover and set aside while you make the sauce.Put all ingredients for the sauce in a large bowl and mix well to combine. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, then carefully slip in the kbeibat, stirring gently so they don’t break up or collapse, and cook on a medium heat for 15 minutes.Using a slotted spoon, lift the bulgur balls out of the boiling water and into the bowl of sauce. Once they’re all in there, stir gently until coated all over with sauce. Spoon into serving plates and finish with chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil.Spicy fennel and herb saladView image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’s spicy fennel and herbs salad.This bright, aromatic salad works beautifully at any meal, but is especially good as a fresh, cleansing contrast to the richness and complexity of kbeibat bulgur. Crisp fennel brings sweetness and crunch, while chilli, herbs and capers add heat and sharpness. Thinly sliced kohlrabi would make an excellent substitute for the fennel, offering a similar texture with a milder flavour.Prep20 minCook10 minServes4For the dressing2 tbsp lemon juice, plus 1 tsp zest2½ tbsp olive oil1 tbsp capers, drained and choppedSalt and black pepperFor the salad2 fennel bulbs, trimmed, halved and thinly sliced (about 400g)1 green chilli, stalk discarded, flesh thinly sliced100g castelfranco radicchio, or white endive, torn into bite-size pieces3g mint leaves, roughly torn3g picked coriander leaves3g picked dill leaves2 tsp black sesame seeds, toastedFirst, make the dressing. Put the lemon juice and zest, olive oil and capers in a large bowl. Add a half-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and whisk well to emulsify.Add the fennel and chilli to the dressing bowl, then toss well so the fennel is coated.Add the radicchio or endive, most of the herbs and the sesame seeds, and toss again, this time gently. Finish with the remaining herbs and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsFoodMiddle Eastern food and drinkMain courseCereals and grainsVegetablesSaladSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

The sudden flood of light, that howling rush of air. Clearly, it’s not just me who thinks trains are the new (old) planes, with 2025 having seen a7% risein UK train travel, and more Europeans than ever looking to hit the rails.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s late December, and I’m heading out on a slow-train journey across the historic railways of the Swiss Alps and the Italian lakes. It’s a trip of roughly 1,800 miles (2,900km), crossing five countries, almost entirely by scenic daytime trains.What is clear from the off is how easy, and slightly disorientating, this type of train travel can be: drifting through stations, across platforms and over borders, it’s hard to believe we’ve hit three countries in less than a day – the UK, France and Switzerland – such is the ease of each passport stop. Gone are the sweaty finger scans of airport border control, replaced by the most polite immigration police I’ve ever encountered. “You’ve travelled a lot,” one says, with a wry smile and a German shepherd, to which I reply “legally”, just to cover my back.View image in fullscreenJonnie Bayfield took the spectacular Gotthard route.Photograph: Jakub Korczyk/AlamyOutside, the French countryside soon blurs into Swiss hills, all behind a thin veil of white, wintry light. The fields, with their clumps of bare trees, seem suspended in mid-freeze, as though bracing for the full blast to come. As we roll into Zurich, we catch our first glimpse of the milky Alpine peaks.This is the thrill of train trips: the steadily shifting scenes, the rise and fall of the landscape, leavened like fresh bread. Next morning, we’re greeted with crisp blue skies for our mountain ascent via one of Europe’s most historic train routes, theMatterhorn Gotthard railway. The original line opened in 1882 and was the railroad that changed Europe, slicing a path through inhospitable mountains and isolated villages.What becomes clear is how easy, and slightly disorientating, this type of train travel can be: drifting through stations, across platforms and over bordersWe catch one of the historic trains (the IR46) – keen to avoid anything routed through the Gotthard base tunnel, which bypasses the beauty. In summer, atourist train– with bigger windows and a bigger price tag – takes the exact same route, famouslydepicted by JMW Turnerand described in awed terms by Goethe. “Here,” he wrote, “it is necessary to submit to nature.” Though it’s the cafe car selling Swiss coffee at eye-watering prices that forces me to revise Goethe: here, it is necessary to submit toinflation.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s painting of the Devil’s Bridge, St Gotthard Pass.Photograph: AlamyPhones duly on charge (as is slow-train travel etiquette), we sit back and gawp out of the window for three hours, eating Swiss truffles as the tracks snake the mythic Alps via the famous Gotthard “spirals” – corkscrew tracks built inside the mountains for a steady ascent. It’s the stuff of oil paintings all right – vertiginous gorges, frothing rivers and snow-capped peaks.At Göschenen, we opt for a lunch stop via a short, even steeper rack-and-pinion route high into the former garrison town of Andermatt, now reinvented as a chic ski retreat. Up here, the snow is thick. Between that and the dark Alpine stone, it’s as though we’ve stepped out into a monochrome photograph. A comforting lunch at the excellentBiselli, along with several glasses of Swiss Ticino red (liquid lunch being another perk of slow-train travel) takes the edge off a dense mist that has crept over the rest of the day’s rail route. Thankfully, Italy soon pushes back, with clear skies andterracotta valley towns, and – just like that – another border is crossed, bringing with it a welcome drop in the cost of a cappuccino (from €5 to €2), enjoyed while skimming the edge of the ice-blue Lake Lugano.By dusk, we’re at Lake Como. Bags dropped, we catch the last of the light with an easypasseggiata(stroll) round the perimeter of the famous lake, mercifully lacking its high-season crowds. Ornate street lamps line the water’s edge like washed-up pearls and, in the distance, the funicular up to the hillside town of Brunate shines with a string of golden lights that dangle down the slope like lost jewellery. It’s hard to imagine Como any other way.In Turin we find a vibrant, easygoing student city that appears contentedly trapped in some kind of temporal raguNext morning, having got into the swing of slow-train transience, we pack up in record time and take coffee at the station. For our final stop, we’re heading in the direction of a much-needed metropolis. Ditching Milan – Italy’s least interesting city – we roll into Turin, one of its most underappreciated.Stepping off the rickety regional train at Torino Porta Susa, what we find is a vibrant, easygoing student city that appears contentedly trapped in some kind of temporal ragu; a place where 1920s art deco neon signs cling to 18th-century baroque buildings that house vintage shops run by students dressed as if they are in the 1990s.Miraculously, all this gels, and the student cohort rub along just fine with their more conservative elders, united beneath the impressive porticos that run, unbroken, for more than 18km and are lined with boutiques and historic coffee bars. We round out our first night with anaperitivoat the classic art-school hauntCaffè Università, with its frayed edges and charmingly outmoded daily buffet.Next morning, Turin’s enviable portfolio of museums and galleries beckon, most free to enter with theTorino card. Here, the time-warp vibes continue within the soaring spire of the 19th-century Mole Antonelliana, now housing the superbMuseo Nazionale del Cinema– surely, the only neoclassical building that’s home to an xenomorph egg from the film Alien? Likewise, another repurposed building, the Lingotto complex, boasts an even more outlandish upcycle: the famous Fiat test track on its roof has been reimagined asLa Pista 500,a panoramic garden walk, where art installations live alongside the historic skidmarks. Proof that Turin is not interested in simply preserving history, but also evolving.View image in fullscreenThe cupola and spire of the Mole Antonelliana in Turin.Photograph: Steve Tulley/AlamyWith a chill in the air, we duck in for a perfect meal at the unassuming yet excellentOsteria Rabezzana, part of theMangébin circuitthat promotes Piedmontese cuisine. Thebrasato al barolo(beef braised in barolo wine) and localagnolotti delplin(beef- and cabbage-stuffedpasta) are excellent. This family-run restaurant and winery opened just after the second world war, and judging by the convivial atmosphere – full of local people on office festive outings – it has served the city well ever since.Next morning, we are up and out to catch the 7.36 TGV all the way back to Paris. Drifting in and out of sleep, we take in a last glimpse of the Italian Alps.

The reality is mould, gnats and the sour smell of rotGynelle LeonTue 3 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTShareTheproblemOnce you tumble down a houseplant rabbit hole online, suddenly everything in your kitchen starts to look like fertiliser. Using oats and Epsom salts sounds wholesome, thrifty; breakfast for you, breakfast for your plants. But does it help?ThehackThe idea is that oats break down and enrich the soil, while Epsom salts (magnesium sulphate) top up magnesium to keep leaves green and glossy. Social media says a spoonful of each will pep up tired plants without the need for proper feed.ThemethodThe hack says unpot your plant and mix the old soil with 1–2 tablespoons of dry oats, a sprinkle of Epsom salts and a bit of fresh compost. Then pop the plant back in the pot, firm it around the roots and water it in. Sounds simple enough.Houseplant hacks: can you really use banana water as a fertiliser?Read moreThetestI tried it on one plant and left its twin with normal feed. Within a couple of weeks, the “breakfast” pot had developed a fuzzy white film on the surface, smelled off and was attracting fungus gnats. Growth wasn’t better. It was just messier.The verdictOats rot, encouraging mould, gnats and sour smells long before they do anything remotely helpful. Epsom salts can be useful if you know there’s a magnesium deficiency, but throwing them in “just in case” risks salt buildup and knocks other nutrients out of balance. If you want to do something kind for your plants, stick to peat-free compost and a balanced liquid fertiliser – and leave TikTok “soil superfoods” in the kitchen cupboard.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t understand much English,” Petro wrote, alongside a photo showing “You are great” written above Trump’s autograph.On the same social media platform, X, where months earlier he had warned Trump to “do not wake the jaguar” after the US leader suggested Colombia could be targeted by a US attack, Petro alsoposteda printed photo he got from Trump, bearing the handwritten message: “Gustavo, a great honour. I love Colombia.”Colombia’s first leftwing president – who will not run in the May elections because the constitution allows only a single term – was alsophotographedleaving the White House wearing a red Maga (Make America Great Again) cap.At a press conference in the Oval Office shortly after the meeting, Trump was asked whether they had reached an agreement on drug trafficking – Colombia’s position as the world’s largest cocaine producer had been a constant feature of his criticism of Petro – and said they had.“We got along very well. He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted [with Petro’s comments] because I never met him. I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well,” said the US president.In an interview with Colombia’s Radio Caracol, Petro praised Trump. “The truth is, I like frankgringos. People who say what they feel. We are undoubtedly very different, but frankness comes first,” he said.Trump added that the meeting had been “very productive” and “fantastic”, and that they would continue working “on other issues, including sanctions”.Despite the cordial tone, there was no immediate announcement about Petro’s removal from the so-called “Clinton list”. In October, Petro, his wife, his son and his interior minister were included on the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) list over what the US Treasury department said was “their involvement in the global illicit drug trade”.Petro said he had not discussed the matter with Trump, but added: “If there were legal evidence, I would not be speaking here; I am on the Ofac list because of what I said in New York.”The Colombian president was referring to last year’s UN summit in New York, when he called on American soldiers to disobey any illegal orders from their commanders during a pro-Palestinian rally. After that, his visa was revoked and he was granted a special visa by Washington specifically for this trip.At a press conference at the Colombian embassy in Washington, Petro said his government was the one that had “seized more thousands of tonnes of cocaine than at any point in the history of humanity”.He said he told Trump that “we have to go after thecapos”, the criminal bosses, who do not live in Colombia but “in Dubai, in Madrid, in Miami. US agencies know who they are. I gave their names to President Trump,” said Petro.Before the meeting, the Colombian government extradited to the US Andrés Felipe Marín Silva, known as “Pipe Tuluá”, identified as the leader of a drug gang. The defence minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the move showed that “Colombia is a reliable partner and will continue working with the US with respect, cooperation and concrete actions, protecting citizens and suffocating those who live off crime,” said Sánchez.Explore more on these topicsColombiaDonald TrumpAmericasDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

While it grants TPS holders the right to live and work in the US, it does not provide a legal pathway to citizenship.Kristi Noem says all federal agents will begin wearing body cameras on patrolsRead moreTheTrump administrationhas aggressively sought to remove the protection, making more people eligible for deportation. The moves are part of the administration’s wider, mass deportation effort.In addition to the migrants from Haiti, Noem has terminated protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans, 60,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits in federal courts.Haiti’s TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after a catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times. The country is racked by gang violence that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.While the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in Haiti had improved, lawyers for the plaintiffs argue the situation remains dire.“If the termination stands, people will almost certainly die,” attorneys for Haitian TPS holders wrote in a court filing in December. “Some will likely be killed, others will likely die from disease, and yet others will likely starve to death.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemHaitiUS politicsAmericasLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Within the vehicle, there must also be signs showing occupants how to open the door.Electric ​cars ​go ​mainstream as ​adoption ​surges ​across ​rich and ​developing ​nationsRead moreThe flush-mounted pop-out door handle was first popularised by Elon Musk’s Tesla Model S, released in 2012. The design integrates the handle into the door and uses electrical signals to activate the latch. Such door handles provide a slight boost to efficiency by reducing drag.It has since become a common design choice on many EVs worldwide, including in China, where it features in around 60% of the top 100 bestselling new energy vehicles – which includes both EVs and hybrid cars – according to state media.Cars released after January next year must comply with the new regulations, forcing Chinese car manufacturers to redesign many of their vehicles. Certain vehicles already approved and in the final stages of launching have been given a two-year grace period to update designs.Several high-profile deadly accidents, in which power failures have trapped occupants in vehicles due to the absence of a manual release, have been attributed to the design, prompting scrutiny from safety watchdogs globally.In October, a fatal collision in the city of Chengdu involving Chinese firm Xiaomi’s SU7 electric sedan resulted in bystanders unable to open the vehicle and save the driver before it burst into flames.Tesla is being suedin the US by the parents of a teenager killed in a 2024 crash involving one of its Cybertrucks. The vehicle hit a tree and caught fire, according to apolice report. When power to the truck’s electric doors was shut down by the fire, the four passengers were locked in with no way out, and three died.China is the world’s largest EV market, and its dozens of brands have growing operations abroad.Statistics published last month showed that Chinese firm BYD last year sold more EVs thanTesla, overtaking the US industry pioneer in the annual category for the first time.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinaTeslaMotoringAsia PacificElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

The minerals kept in the reserve would help to shield the manufacturers of vehicles, electronics and other goods from any supply chain disruption.During trade talks last year spurred by Trump’s tariffs,China restricted the exporting of rare earthsthat were needed for jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles, laptops and phones.“We don’t want to ever go through what we went through a year ago,” Trump said in an apparent reference to the showdown withChina, adding that, ultimately, “it did work out”. The president said he expected the government to make a profit from the loan being used to start the reserve.China controls about 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and 90% of global rare earths processing. That gave it a chokehold on the sector that has caused the US to nurture alternative sources of the elements, creating a stockpile similar to the national reserve for petroleum.The strategic reserve is expected to be the highlight of a ministerial meeting on critical minerals that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, will host at the state department on Wednesday.Vice-president JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote address at the meeting, which officials from several dozen European, African and Asian nations plan to attend. The meeting is also expected to include the signing of several bilateral agreements to improve and coordinate supply chain logistics.The state department said in its statement announcing the meeting that the gathering “will create momentum for collaboration” among the participants to secure access to rare earths.The government-backed loan funding the reserve would be for a period of 15 years. The US government has previously taken stakes in the rare earths miner MP Materials, as well as providing financial backing to the companies Vulcan Elements and USA Rare Earth.Trump announced the reserve with General Motors CEO Mary Barra and mining industry billionaire Robert Friedland in the Oval Office, along with other members of his administration and congressional leaders.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCritical mineralsChinaUS foreign policyAsia PacificTrump administrationInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to have a full ticket in the upper house. We’re going to work very hard for our candidates, and I hope they’re all rewarded.“To be honest, I’d love to be the official opposition in this state. But you know what? Even if we don’t have the most numbers of seats, I promise you, we will have the strongest, the most effective voice.”In the upper house, 11 seats are up for grabs – and it’s a grab bag of people, many of whom are singing from the same song sheet as One Nation.And Bernardi isn’t the only former Liberal in the mix.Former Liberal member turned Family First senator Bob Day will run candidates in both houses for the Australian Family Party. Day’s former chief of staff Rikki Lambert is running for the Nationals. The Family First candidate is former Liberal candidate Deepa Mathew.Jing Lee, who quit the Liberals after getting caught up in a rightwingabortion bill debacle, is running as an independent.Could One Nation be a genuine threat to Australia’s conservative parties?Read moreThere is another element of unpredictability in One Nation’s rise. The anti-woke, anti-Islam, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism, anti-renewables mob have found their voice in March for Australia protests and through One Nation.But there might be a cohort in these latest polls that balk at actually ticking the One Nation box when it matters. And it can be reinforced by the experience of voters as the campaign trail heats up.At Tuesday’s press conference, the ebullient crowd’s cheers turned to jeers as soon as Hanson was asked a tough question by Guardian Australia’s Sarah Martin aboutfailing to declare flights on billionaire Gina Rinehart’s private jet.Hanson struggled to come up with a cohesive answer, and her supporters erupted in fury at the questioning. “Who cares?” they yelled at the press, as people began to jostle one another. “Did you have something for breakfast?”“What is your agenda?” Carlos Quaremba said, and repeated it. It was almost the sole contribution to the press conference for the One Nation state president, who has been relegated to second spot on the ticket by Bernardi.But the more disturbing response to a reporter’s valid question came from someone in the crowd who was heard saying: “She’s going to get lynched.”Tory Shepherd is a senior reporter for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsOne NationAustralian politicsCory BernardiSouth AustraliaSouth Australian politicsSouth Australian election 2026Pauline HansonanalysisShareReuse this content"

The government has failed to give a clear answer | Luke McNamaraRead moreThe change will also apply to conduct outside the classroom, including comments on social media.The president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Timothy Roberts, a former teacher and education officer at Nesa, said the move risked being seen as an attempt to silence discussion onPalestinein schools and distracting Nesa from its work maintaining school standards.“Schools should be places where students are free to ask difficult questions, and teachers safe to answer them. It is disappointing the premier does not share the same trust the people of NSW have in their local teachers,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn September, a report by the Australian Palestinian Advocacy Network (Apan) said anti-Palestinian racism had become widespread in Australian schools since October 2023, primarily in NSW and Victoria. It was being used to “prevent and silence” the discussion of the war inGazathrough a “climate of fear, censorship, intimidation and punishment”, the group said.One staff member alleged they were “screamed at” by their principal for wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh and called a “terrorist” and “antisemitic” in front of other staff.Organiser for Teachers and School Staff for Palestine NSW, Chris Breen, said he was “deeply concerned” about how the new code could apply, claiming the 200 members of the advocacy group could be “sacked” for expressing support for the pro-Palestine cause.“This is a political attack on free speech,” he said on Tuesday.“We think it’s extreme [and] targeted at the Palestine movement to intimidate and scare teachers. Exactly what will be covered is unclear, but that seems to be part of the political purpose – to intimidate teachers who speak out for Palestine.”On Sunday, the body vowed to continue using the slogan“globalise the intifada”in response to thestate government’s intention to ban the phrase.Minns said on Tuesday that the new guidelines were “not an attack on freedom of speech … or concern about Palestinians and innocent civilians in Gaza”.What does ‘globalise the intifada’ mean, and why does NSW want to ban the chant?Read moreHe told 2GB the changes responded to cases where the government had “felt it has been unable to take action” after teachers had been accused of hate speech.“If you participate in hate speech, even if it’s not on the school grounds, then you’re not the kind of person that we want shaping young minds,” he said.Minns said in a statement: “These changes to the rules follow the new hate speech legislation passed by both the state and commonwealth governments … making clear that there is no place for extremism or vilification in our classrooms or our state.”Under the change, Nesa will publicly amend its registration manuals to clarify that school employees must not have “engaged in a deliberate pattern of immoral or unethical behaviour, including hate speech”.The deputy premier and education minister, Prue Car, said following a complaint, Nesa would investigate and make a decision on whether a particular comment constituted hate speech, before potentially directing the school to terminate the employment of that staff member.Nesa is defining hate speech as conduct covered by section 93ZAA of the NSW Crimes Act, a controversial new offence which criminalises inciting hatred on the grounds of race. It became law in August last year, despite a warning by the NSW Law Reform Commission it would “introduce imprecision and subjectivity into the criminal law”.Roberts said defining hate speech according to 93ZAA was “attempting to build a good house on a bad foundation”.“It is very easy to say that hate speech is bad and we should protect children from it. However, it is hard and often divisive to try and reach agreement on what constitutes hate speech,” he said.Prof Luke McNamara, an expert on hate speech at the University of NSW law school, told Guardian Australia he thought it would be inappropriate for Nesa to determine if a hate speech offence had occurred in the absence of a prosecution.“If a teacher is suspected of having committed the serious crime of intentionally inciting racial hatred, the appropriate course of action is to refer the matter to the police,” he said.“If charges are pursued, it will be for the courts to determine whether the accused teacher is guilty.”Guardian Australia understands schools were made aware in advance of Tuesday’s announcement, and must now update their code of conduct, a document all schools are required to register.Inquiry calls for ban on ‘globalise the intifada’ in NSW – but only when used to incite hatred and violenceRead moreA spokesperson for the NSW Teachers Federation said they had sought discussions with the education department about the assessment of codes of conduct.Andy Mison, president of the Australian Secondary Principals’ Association (Aspa), welcomed policy that supported school leaders “to maintain schools as safe, supportive and inclusive environments for students and staff”.“Provided that implementation is supported by clear guidance and professional learning, we do not believe these changes should inhibit the kind of open, respectful discussion that is central to a quality education,” he said.As NSW parliament resumed on Tuesday for the first time since emergency sessions following the Bondi massacre, the focus has remained on the response to the attack and antisemitism.The opposition moved legislation for all universities, government agencies and local councils to adopt theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, arecommendation by the special envoy to combat antisemitism, Jillian Segal, in her July report.Universities Australia’s 39 members have alreadyadopted a definition of antisemitism– either the IHRA definition or one closely aligned to it – after working with Segal.Minns declined to comment on the proposal on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsBondi beach terror attackAntisemitismGazaAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

It was unclear how many of the survivors transported to the hospital had been injured.The coastguard said it was not immediately clear how many people had been on the speedboat.Trial of aid workers accused of facilitating illegal entry of migrants into Greece set to beginRead moreVideo footage by a local news site showed at least one person being carried in a blanket from a coastguard boat moored on the side of a jetty into a waiting coastguard vehicle with blue flashing lights, as others appeared to lead two children toward the car.The coastguard did not immediately have further information on exactly how the collision occurred, or on the identities of the casualties or the other passengers on the speedboat.Greece is a major entry point into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Fatal accidents are a common occurrence. Many undertake the short but often perilous crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands in the eastern Aegean.But increased patrols and allegations of pushbacks – summary deportations without allowing for asylum applications – by Greek authorities have reduced crossing attempts.Greece, along with several other EU countries, has been tightening its regulations on migration. In December, the EU was overhauling its migration system, including streamlining deportations and increasing detentions.Explore more on these topicsMigrationGreeceRefugeesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They also requested a €100,000 (£86,000) fine.“The seriousness of the charges means any other sanction would be inadequate,” Stéphane Madoz-Blanchet, one of the state prosecutors in the case, said on Tuesday.The final decision on sentencing will be made by a panel of appeal judges who will take several months to deliberate and return a verdict “before the summer”.Le Pen, 57, who leads the anti-immigration National Rally (RN), was considered to be one of the top contenders for next year’s French presidential election until she wasbarred from running for election for five yearswith immediate effect last March after being found guilty of an extensive and long-running fake jobs scam at the European parliament.Le Pen appealed against last year’s verdict and a fresh trial at Paris’s court of appeal is entering its final stages. Le Pen is seeking to overturn last year’s verdict and sentence in order to run for president in 2027. She told the court there was no “system” set up by her party to misuse European parliament funds.But state prosecutors summing up the case against Le Pen on Tuesday that she had been at the centre of a “thought-out”, “centralised” and almost “industrial” system to embezzle European parliament funds.They told the appeal court that taxpayer money allocated to members of the European parliament to pay their assistants based in Strasbourg or Brussels was siphoned off by the party from 2004 to 2016, to pay its own workers in France, in violation of the parliament’s rules.The staff in France had no connection to work undertaken at the European parliament, prosecutors said. The loss to European funds was estimated at €4.8m (£4.2m). The party, which was then called Front National, made substantial savings through the system, the prosecutors said. The system was well documented in email exchanges and party papers.One state prosecutor, Thierry Ramonatxo, criticised Le Pen for making public attacks on judges after last year’s verdict, when she said a“tyranny of judges”wanted to stop her running in a presidential race that she could otherwise win.Ramonatxo said that judges simply apply the law that has been voted for by the people’s representatives in parliament. He said Le Pen had “made a choice to attack judges on the political stage rather than to reflect upon what she had been reproached for”.He said: “Speaking of a ‘tyranny of judges’, of a ‘violation of the state of law’ or of ‘political assassination’ is not part of the judicial debate in a democratic society. It is not part of a debate of ideas but rather is aimed at discrediting all judicial actions in their entirety.”Ramonatxo said this was dangerous and judges had been exposed to death threats because of these attacks.He added: “Speaking of a conspiracy of judges is not an argument, it’s a withdrawal reflex each time the cause seems lost.”He noted Le Pen’s “change of tone” in the appeal court which had a calmer atmosphere, compared with her anti-judges press conference and media interviews last year.The state prosecutors did not request that a five-year ban from running for public office should take immediate effect. However, this detail – which would leave room for a final appeal to France’s highest court – is unlikely to change the fact that a five-year ban would effectively prevent Le Pen being able to stand for the presidency next spring.Le Pen, in the front row in court, sat taking notes and shaking her head as the state prosecutors outlined their case against her and 10 other party members who appealed against last year’s verdict – a further 13 who were convicted last year have not appealed.Outside court, before the state prosecutors’ summing up, Le Pen had told journalists: “I’m a believer, so I believe in miracles.”Defence lawyers will give closing speeches next week. If Le Pen is banned from running for office, she would be replaced by her protege and party president,Jordan Bardella, 30.Le Pen has recently begun speaking of Bardella as a clear alternative if she can no longer run for president, telling La Tribune Dimanche last month: “Jordan Bardella can win in my place.” She said whatever the outcome, her party would dominate and its “ideas will survive”.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenNational RallyFranceEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Yaccarino resigned as chief executive of X in July last year.The French prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media firms. A senior source in the Greek government told Reuters on Tuesday the country was “very close” to announcing a social media ban for children under 15.In Spain, where the government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, promised to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.Sánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.He also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week toregularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.The comments appeared to infuriate Musk, who used a post on X later on Tuesday to call Sánchez “a traitor to the people of Spain”.The Paris raid is part of an investigation launched in January last year into the suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction, which the prosecutor’s office said it had widened to cover complaints about X’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok.It said the alleged offences it was investigating now included complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.Other possible charges included fraudulent data extraction from, and falsified operation of, an automated data processing system by an organised group, and operation of an illegal online platform by an organised group, the statement said.French authorities launched the investigation after the centre-right MP Éric Bothorel filed a complaint alleging that biased algorithms on the platform were likely to have distorted its data processing system and affected the kind of content it recommended.Bothorel complained of a “reduced diversity of voices” and Musk’s “personal interventions” in X’s management since he bought it in 2022. Another complaint said the changes had led to a surge in “nauseating political content”.Prosecutors said in November that they were expanding the investigation to include the behaviour of Grok, which allegedlyengaged in Holocaust denial, advancing false claims commonly made by people who deny Nazi Germany murdered 6 million Jews.The chatbot has since caused outrage by allowing users to “strip” clothed people, including children, in photos through AI image generation and editing. TheEU has launched an investigationinto its production and dissemination of sexualised deepfakes of women and minors.X said in a statement: “We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives.“The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation.“The allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech.”The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation was being conducted as “part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory”.Despite being described as voluntary, the summonses issued to Musk and Yaccarino are mandatory, but they are hard to enforce on people outsideFrance. Afterwards, authorities can potentially place suspects in custody.Europol said it supported the investigation through its European cybercrime centre and deployed a specialist to Paris for the raid. “The investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offences linked to the functioning and use of the platform,” it said.Those included “the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity”, the pan-European policing organisation said, adding that it “stands ready to continue supporting the French authorities as the investigation progresses”.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskFranceEuropeSocial mediaDigital mediaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

It involved a record number of 71 ballistic missiles as well as 450 drones, he said, sent to destroy energy infrastructure.More than 1,000 residential buildings in Kyiv were without heating on Tuesday.Zelenskyy said Russia had broken a promise that Trump had last week framed as a personal request toVladimir Putinto stop hitting Kyiv and “various towns” for a week because of the exceptionally cold weather. “He agreed to do that. And I have to tell you it was very nice,” the US president said on Thursday.The Kremlin later announced the truce would last only until Sunday. According to Ukraine, the ceasefire should have continued until this Friday.Zelenskyy saidRussiahad used this brief pause in fighting to stockpile weapons. “Either Russia now believes that there are four incomplete days in a week instead of seven, or they are really betting only on war and waiting for the coldest days of this winter,” he said.‘It’s a miracle we survived’: the civilian crew trapped on a ship in Ukraine as bombs rained downRead more“We believe this Russian strike clearly violates what the American side discussed, and there must be consequences.”Trump told reporters that Putin had made an agreement that expired on Sunday. “It was Sunday to Sunday, and it opened up and he hit them hard last night,” he said at the White House. “He kept his word on that … we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there. But it was on Sunday, and he went from Sunday to Sunday.“Asked if he was disappointed, Trump replied: “I want him to end the war.”A second round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US to end the war are due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi. A first round last month failed to yield a breakthrough.Visiting Kyiv, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Tuesday accused Moscow of trying to “create chaos for innocent civilians”. Zelenskyy was “absolutely ready to play ball” in talks this week, he said, questioning whether the Russians “are serious”. He called the overnight attack a “really bad signal”.Rutte praised Trump as the only person capable of brokering a peaceful solution, almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion. “Be assured that Nato stands with Ukraine and is ready to do so for years to come. Your security is our security. Your peace is our peace,” he told Zelenskyy.Kyiv residents reported loud explosions beginning at 1am on Tuesday in strikes that caused damage to five Kyiv districts and injured at least nine people. An air raid alert stayed in effect for more than five hours.“Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. He called on western partners to step up the supply of missiles for air defence systems in order to protect “normal life”.View image in fullscreenAn apartment building hit by a Russian drone strike in Kyiv.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters“Without pressure on Russia, this war will not end. Now Moscow is choosing terror and escalation, and that’s why maximum pressure is needed,” he wrote on social media.Among the infrastructure hit overnight were facilities to heat water for distribution to Ukrainian homes.“Hundreds of thousands of families, including children, were deliberately left without heating during the harshest winter conditions, with temperatures dropping to -25C,” the Ukrainian energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on X.Kyiv resident Natalia Hlobenko, 35, described how she rushed to cover her 11-year-old son on Tuesday before an explosion sprayed her apartment with broken glass. “Where is this ceasefire?” said a teary Hlobenko, bundled up in her windowless apartment.Ukraine said the attack had damaged the Motherland monument, a Soviet-era second world war memorial.

The plan was discussed in December and January by Ukrainian, European and US officials.According to the Financial Times, citing sources involved in the negotiations, a Russian violation of the truce would trigger a response within 24 hours. This would initially involve a diplomatic warning followed, if necessary, by Ukrainian army action to restore a ceasefire.If hostilities continued after 72 hours, Ukraine and its allies would move to a second stage. It would involve a military response from the coalition of the willing, and include American forces.Tuesday’s attacks took place across Ukraine. In Kyiv, 1,170 buildings were without power. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said energy infrastructure had been damaged. More than 800 buildings were without heat, as water was drained from radiator systems to stop them freezing in the bitter cold.“The goal is obvious: to cause maximum destruction and leave the city without heat in severe cold,” Terekhov wrote on Telegram. The deputy prime minister, Oleksii Kuleba, said 110,000 properties in Kharkiv had been left without heating after the attack.View image in fullscreenWorkers installing anti-drone nets over a road in icy conditions near Kharkiv on Monday.Photograph: Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/ReutersThe public broadcaster Suspilne said Russian strikes had knocked out electricity in two towns in the Kharkiv region, Izium and Balakliia, and struck two apartment buildings in the northern city of Sumy.Russian propagandists have been celebrating the Kremlin’s deliberate destruction of Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks – a war crime.“We have driven Ukraine into the stone age. Terrifying cold is approaching. The energy system is extremely sensitive to imbalance,” the presenter Vladimir Solovyov told state TV. He predicted Kyiv would become “a giant cesspool”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In our review process, we concluded that aspects of the research and the factual basis for our legal conclusions needed to be strengthened to meet Human Rights Watch’s high standards. For that reason, the publication of the report was paused pending further analysis and research. This process is ongoing.”Shakir said that his experience illustrated that while public opinion has evolved onIsraelin the last several years – with “concepts of apartheid, genocide and ethnic cleansing” increasingly voiced in mainstream circles – the right of return remains a third rail. “The one topic,” he said, “even at Human Rights Watch, for which there remains an unwillingness to apply the law and the facts in a principled way, is the plight of refugees and their right to return to the homes that they were forced to flee.”Israel supporters say that allowing Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to their homes would end the Jewish state by depriving it a Jewish majority.But in its messaging, the organization’s leadership has insisted that the core of the disagreement has nothing to do with the right of return, which HRW supports. In an email to staff on 29 January, Bolopion said HRW had commissioned an independent review of “what happened, and what lessons we need to learn”. Bolopion cast the events of the past two months as “a genuine and good-faith disagreement among colleagues on complex legal and advocacy questions”, and emphasized: “HRW remains committed to the right of return for all Palestinians, as has been our policy for many years.”View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians staying at a shelter run by the Unwra in the Shuja’iyya neighborhood in Gaza City, on 20 January.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesShakir and Ansari completed a draft of their report in August 2025, at which time they say it went through HRW’s usual edit process, ultimately being reviewed by eight separate departments. Some colleagues raised concerns to Shakir along the way. In an 21 October email, chief advocacy officer Bruno Stagno Ugarte said he was concerned with the wide scope of the report, which in his view implicated all diaspora Palestinians, and suggested a report on the recent forced displacements from Gaza and the West Bank might “resonate better”. He further said he worried that the findings “will be misread by many, our detractors first and foremost, as a call to demographically extinguish the Jewishness of the Israeli state”.Concerns about reputational damage were also voiced by Tom Porteous, HRW’s acting program director at the time. He wrote Shakir that the report was well-argued, but “the question is how we are going to deploy this argument in our advocacy without this coming off as HRW rejecting the state of Israel and without it undermining our credibility as a neutral, impartial monitor of events.”Still, the decision to pull the final report came as a surprise to Shakir and others on staff, who said Bolopion – who has worked for HRW in numerous roles – was a key contributor to the group’s landmark 2021reportaccusing Israel of committing the crime of apartheid.‘Other inhumane acts’Human Rights Watch has repeatedly calledfor the right of return – a universal human right grounded in international law – in previous publications. But those earlier reports were focused on other issues, and did not make the case that Israel’s ongoing denial of refugees’ right to return was a crime against humanity.Work on the report, eventually titled ‘Our Souls Are in the Homes We Left:’ Israel’s Denial of Palestinians’ Right to Return and Crimes Against Humanity, had begun in January 2025. It was intended as a follow-up to aNovember 2024 reportthat focused on the internal displacement of Palestinians in Gaza. During interviews for that report, Ansari said, she heard refugees connect their current predicament to “their generational trauma of being uprooted and disconnected from their homelands back in 1948 and back in 1967”.Inspired by those accounts, the unpublished 33-page report, which has been reviewed by Jewish Currents and the Guardian, not only documents the experiences of Palestinians recently displaced by Israeli military forces from Gaza and the West Bank, but also those of some Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria who were originally displaced by Israeli forces in 1948 and 1967 – and who have suffered persistent poverty and substandard housing, and face severe obstacles to land ownership and employment.The authors reach a novel conclusion: the denial of these refugees’ right of return falls under the crime against humanity known as “other inhumane acts”. Under theRome Statutethat established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998, this designation was meant to address grave abuses that were similar in character to other crimes that intentionally caused “great suffering” – apartheid, for instance, or extermination – but did not precisely fit into those legal categories.The report cites a 2018 pre-trialfindingby the ICC that determined that preventing the return of Rohingya to Myanmar after they’d been displaced to Bangladesh could be prosecuted as a crime against humanity of “other inhumane acts”. Shakir said that the report introduced a legal argument that had been previously confined to academia into the world of human-rights advocacy, providing an “asset” that could potentially help a refugee displaced in 1948 bring a current case against Israeli authorities.The report’s slated publication date of 4 December 2025 coincided with the week HRW’s new executive director would begin his tenure, following repeated leadership changes over the last few years.View image in fullscreenPalestinians hold a protest in the Jabalia refugee camp against UNRWA’s policy of restricting services and the deprivation of humanitarian assistance for refugees in Gaza City, Gaza, on Sunday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn November, senior staff began raising the prospect of delaying the report over concerns from colleagues. They felt its conclusion – that denying the right of return constitutes the crime against humanity of “other inhumane acts” – was weak and not established law, according to Shakir and Ansari, and required more evidence to back up.Shakir raised the prospect of resignation if the report was delayed – but also said he offered to make it clearer that the crimes against humanity determination definitively applied only to those communities that were the focus of the research: those most acutely vulnerable as a result of the denial of their right to return, both in the occupied territories and in Syria, Lebanon, and among a subset of Palestinians living in Jordan.Shakir said those offers were rejected. Days before Bolopion took up the position as executive director, he called Shakir to tell him the report would need to be paused.In response, more than 200 HRW employees signed a letter of protest, sent to leadership on 1 December, calling the organization’s “rigorous vetting process” the “cornerstone of our credibility”. Blocking the report, the staffers wrote, could “create the perception that HRW’s review process is open to undue intervention that can reverse decisions taken through the pipeline, undermine trust in its purpose and integrity, set a precedent that work can be shelved without transparency, and raise concerns that other work could be suppressed”. In its statement, HRW said: “Our internal review processes are robust and designed to protect the integrity of our findings. As with any organization conducting such analyses, differences of professional judgment can arise in the process.”Kenneth Roth, who was HRW’s executive director until 2022 and learned about the controversy from his former colleagues, rejects allegations the decision was political and argues that the leadership transition marred the approval process. He characterized Shakir’s behavior as an effort “to fast-talk through the review system at a time of leadership transition an extreme interpretation of the law that was indefensible. Various staff members expressed concern with the report during the review, but it took Philippe arriving as executive director … to exert the leadership that should have been exercised far earlier and to send the report back for a more defensible interpretation,” he said. Roth – who has not read the report personally but who was briefed on the legal argument by Shakir – insisted that “this had to do with preventing publication of a report that was indefensible and would have been deeply embarrassing if given a Human Rights Watch imprimatur.” (Roth is a columnist for the Guardian.)In response to doubts over the strength of his research, Shakir said that the report, its press release, and its question and answer document were “fully reviewed and finalized” and prepared for publication on their website. “Were there any credible concerns about the research, this would never have happened at HRW, where major Israel/Palestine reports always attract extra scrutiny.” He added: “In an organization of 500 people, people are gonna have different views. But you do not need a consensus of 500 people. That’s not how we release reports.”In his resignation letter, Shakir argued that he did everything he could to address the concerns of staff members but that it made no sense to limit the findings to Palestinians recently displaced from the West Bank and Gaza – an approach multiple staffers say Bolopion demanded. “Such a limitation means we would be saying that the suffering caused by the denial of return for a Palestinian displaced for a year from a West Bank refugee camp would meet the threshold of sufficient gravity to be a crime against humanity, but not those denied return for 78 years,” he writes.Shakir was deported from Israel in 2019 because of his advocacy on behalf of Palestinian human rights. He stressed the organization’s responsibility to Palestinian victims of displacement. “Witnessing the anguish in the Palestinians I interviewed who are effectively condemned to lifelong refugee status is among the hardest things I’ve seen,” he said. “They deserve to know why their stories aren’t being told.”This story was co-published with Jewish Currents.

He was captured and imprisoned after being accused of orchestrating attacks that resulted in the killing of five civilians, and convicted on terrorism charges by an Israeli court. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organisation, criticised the trial at the time, arguing that itbreached international law, including the Geneva conventions. Barghouti has consistently denied the charges against him.Barghouti is a member of the Fatah party, a rival of Hamas, and has long advocated a two-state solution. Many argue that Israel’s refusal to release him is driven by concern thathe could emerge as a powerful voice for the Palestinian cause.Born in 1959 in the West Bank village of Kobar, Barghouti grew up under Israeli military occupation after the 1967 war and was arrested multiple times for political activism as a teenager. Over subsequent decades he emerged as a prominent figure within Palestinian politics, advocating Palestinian unity.The forthcoming book will assemble private letters to Barghouti’s family written from prison, correspondence with public figures, press interviews, public statements, historical documents and photographs, alongside extracts from his book 1,000 Days in Solitary Confinement, which until now has been available only in Arabic.Barghouti has spent extended periods in solitary confinement without access to his family and, according to former Palestinian detainees, hasbeen subjected to multiple serious assaults in prison. In November 2025, theGuardian reportedthat he had not seen his family for three years, while his lawyers had been permitted to visit him only five times in the prior two years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been barred from visiting him, a move that breaches international law.The Guardian view on Marwan Barghouti: Palestinians need a political future as well as aid and reconstruction | EditorialRead moreIn August last year, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,shared video footagein which he was seen taunting Barghouti and threatening him with execution.Despite more than two decades in prison, successive opinion polls show Barghouti is the most popular Palestinian politician in Gaza and the West Bank. He is often cited by supporters as a potential unifying leader across factional divides, and hasbeen described as“Palestine’s Mandela”. His continued prominence has fuelled international campaigns calling for his release.The latest waslaunched in November 2025,with coordinated demonstrations and public art installations in Palestine and in cities including London, alongside protests across Europe, the US and South Africa. In December, more than 200 leading cultural figures – including Margaret Atwood, Annie Ernaux, Benedict Cumberbatch, Elif Shafak, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Tilda Swinton, Olga Tokarczuk, Colm Tóibín, Sir Ian McKellen and Gary Lineker –signed an open lettercalling for his release.An introduction to the book has been written by Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa Barghouti, a prominent advocate for his release. “For a long time, I have wished that the world could hear Marwan in his own voice, not through the noise surrounding him,” she said in a statement. “This book finally makes that possible – and I hope it helps people understand who Marwan Barghouti truly is, and how he embodies the Palestinian struggle for freedom and dignity.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPalestineIsrael-Gaza warPenguinMiddle East and north AfricaPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump on Saturday said Iranians were“seriously talking to us”as he hinted at a deal to avert military strikes against Tehran.Asked on Monday about the prospect of a deal, Trump told reporters at the White House that talks were happening. “We have ships heading to Iran right now, big ones – the biggest and the best – and we have talks going on with Iran and we’ll see how it all works out ... if we can work something out, that would be great and if we can’t, probably bad things would happen.”Speaking during a visit to the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Araghchi said: “[Iran’s enemies] are talking about diplomacy today, even though Iran has always been ready for this option, provided there is mutual respect and consideration of interests.”Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to arrive in the region for talks in Israel with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Co-writer of Oscar-nominated film It Was Just an Accident arrested in IranRead moreNo date was given for any Iran-US talks but a spokesperson for Tehran’s foreign ministry said that “several points have been addressed and we are examining and finalising the details of each stage in the diplomatic process, which we hope to conclude in the coming days”.Multiple reports have suggested Witkoff and Araghchi would meet on Friday in Istanbul along with representatives of several Arab and Muslim countries to discuss a possible nuclear deal. Reuters reported that delegations would attend from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.The meeting would be the first between the US and Iranian officials since last April, shortly before Israel and later the US struck Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile sites during a 12-day war in June. During the conflict, Iran fired hundreds of ballistic missiles at cities and towns in Israel, many of which were downed by interceptors.Trump hasdispatched a “massive armada”of ships and warplanes to the region in response to Iran’s brutal crackdown on protesters that has killed thousands, with activists claiming that more than 30,000 were left dead in a government massacre. They include an aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, along with guided missile destroyers and dozens of warplanes capable of delivering strikes against Iran’s leadership, military targets, or its nuclear programme.View image in fullscreenUSS Abraham Lincoln crew conducting flight operations in the Arabian Sea.Photograph: Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Zoe Simpson/US Navy/EPAThe US president has since indicated he also wants Iran to negotiate a new deal to cease production of highly enriched uranium that could be used for a nuclear weapon and to scupper its ballistic missile programme. New satellite imagery published last week indicated that Iran had built new roofs over damaged buildings at the Isfahan and Natanz facilities after strikes in June by the US and Israel.Trump has also suggested that he is seeking regime change, raising fears that efforts to topple Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, could spark a regional war.Reuters on Monday reported that the Iranian government was “increasingly worried” that a limited US strike could reignite protests and potentially lead to a revolution, citing six current and former Iranian officials who said that protesters were increasingly ready to confront the security services.Saudi and Israeli officials held talks at the Pentagon last week to discuss potential US strikes and concerns over an Iranian counterattack that could lead to growing conflict in the region. Iran has threatened to attack Israel, including Tel Aviv, if a strike is launched by the US. Netanyahu on Monday said that Israel was ready “for every scenario” and warned that anyone who attacks the country would face “unbearable consequences”.Iranian protesters havecalled for an independent inquiryinto the number of people killed following protests that began in December, prompted by the devaluation of the Iranian currency and high inflation. Iran’s government has taken the unusual step of overseeing the publication of the names of the deceased from the protests. The government has claimed that 3,117 people, including members of the security services, died as a result of the protests. Activists have said that the number is more than 30,000.Explore more on these topicsIranUS militaryDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyIran nuclear programmenewsShareReuse this content"

There have been reports of bodies only being released after relatives sign statements saying that the deceased belonged to the Basij, a pro-regime militia, a tactic designed to bolster the authorities’ designation of protesters as “terrorists” who attacked security forces and to raise the reported number of casualties on the regime’s side.Some projections have estimated that 30,000 were killedin the demonstrations that broke out in late December and spread across the country. Other estimates have suggested even higher numbers.Iranian sociologists say the mood of the resulting funerals carries a message of rebellion in the face of the lethal crackdown.View image in fullscreenIranians gathering while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran on 9 January.Photograph: Khoshiran/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images“Many of today’s mourners … do not want the grief over their loved ones to bear any trace of the religious mourning that is emblematic of the subculture shared by their killers,” said Hosein Ghazian, a US-based Iranian commentator. “Instead of outwardly expressing grief, they choose to display joy. This joy carries a powerful political message of persistence in the struggle against bloodthirsty oppressors.”Footage of several funerals has been shared on social media.Rather than overt grieving, the videos depict euphoric scenes, including women without traditional Islamic head covering, whooping and dancing to popular songs being blared from stereo sound systems.Families who lost relatives said they had decided to stage vibrant events to capture the spirit in which the dead person had lived.Relatives of Milad, 17, danced to his favourite song,Ghaf, a romantic ballad by Alireza Talischi, at his funeral after he died from injuries sustained when security forces fired on a protest in Tehran’s Naziabad neighbourhood on 8 January. The authorities initially demanded the equivalent of £5,000 to return his body. It is unclear how much the family eventually paid.“They did what Milad would have wanted,” said his older brother, Reza, who lives in Tallinn in Estonia. “They danced through tears at the burial. Even in mourning, they honoured his vibrant life.”Shaghayegh, 21, described similar circumstances surrounding her 19-year-old cousin, who was shot dead in a protest in Narmak, a neighbourhood in north Tehran.“I can’t even tell you how much money we paid but we just wanted him back,” she said. “When his body finally arrived home, the family prepared as if for a wedding. Loudspeakers were set up. Large tents filled the garage. Family members cooked together, just as they would for a celebration.“The only difference was that none of us were laughing. We were celebrating his life, what he meant to us, what he could have given to the world.”Dancing is an important part of Iranian culture but is generally limited to closed-door settings such as private parties and weddings under the religious restrictions imposed by the regime.By contrast, many of the euphoric funerals depicted on social media take place outdoors in settings that appear to boldly challenge the regime’s conservative mores.Scenes of women dancing and singing along in public can likewise be interpreted as a repudiation of the Islamic republic’s basic tenets, which forbid dancing and the female singing voice asharam.Saeed Paivandi, a sociologist at the University of Lorraine in France, said Iranian funerals without traditional Islamic symbolism represented “resistance against the theocratic government that wants to impose religious norms on all of Iranian society and various areas of individuals’ lives”.He added: “In the protest movements, mourning ceremonies for victims of government repression have become a space to challenge religious and official norms.“What seems very significant symbolically is the use of music and dance, which are considered anti-values in the state culture. Replacing the crying and wailing that are considered a core value with a kind of bitter joy is another significant element in this cultural transformation.“They want to tell the government that we don’t cry for the martyrs of freedom – they chose the right path and are a source of pride for us.”View image in fullscreenMajidreza Rahnavard, an Iranian man who was executed for taking part in protests against the Islamic Republic.Photograph: Social mediaAn inspiration may have beenMajidreza Rahnavard, who was executed in 2022, aged 23, after being accused of stabbing two members of the Basij during the Woman, Life, Freedom protests.After his death, footage appeared of Rahnavard moments before his execution, saying: “I don’t want anyone to mourn upon my grave. I don’t want them to read the Qur’an or pray. Just celebrate and play celebrating music.”Regime opponents have since embraced Rahnavard as a folk hero and have invoked his words as legacy to be emulated.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The conservancy sees mule deer, which are not native to the island, as a major threat to local biodiversity, water quality and fire resilience.Thepermit issuedby the California department of fish and wildlife allows the conservancy to eliminate the island’s herd of roughly 1,800 deer over a period of five years, mostly using hired shooters who will kill the deer over bait. Outside the island’s only incorporated city of Avalon, shooters can fire at night and use helicopters and drones to help locate deer. Helicopters may also be used to drop nets on deer for capture.As deer numbers dwindle, the permit envisions using dogs to help shooters find and kill the stragglers. The permit also allows the conservancy to capture deer, sterilize them, fit them with GPS collars and release them back into the wild.The meat from the animals will either go to feed captive birds at the California Condor Recovery Program or to tribal partners.Many locals, however, deride the extermination methods as cruel and see deer as an iconic local species, despite the fact that they were introduced to establish a huntable population in the 1920s. Anonline petitionto “Stop the Slaughter of Mule Deer on Catalina Island” has garnered nearly 23,000 signatures.“Mule deer have been part of Catalina’s landscape for nearly a century, and their presence has become an important part of the island’s identity,” Los Angeles county supervisor Janice Hahnwrote in a recent letterto California’s wildlife officials. “This plan disregards the deeply held values of many Catalina residents and visitors. I continue to hear from my constituents who have lived on the island for decades and have come to cherish these deer.”Live TV report on cougar capture in San Francisco neighborhood interrupted by coyoteRead moreRecreational hunting will continue on Catalina Island, though the conservancy says that it has failed to reduce numbers sufficiently.Santa Catalina’s native flora evolved without mule deer, leading plants to evolve few defenses to limit the animals from gorging on them, according to the conservancy. That heavy browsing pressure has allowed non-native grasses to colonize areas once populated with native plants, leading the island to lose shrubby chaparral to invasive grasslands.The conservancy plans to replant native flora and beat back invasive vegetation as it exterminates the deer. Recolonizing the island with native shrubs and other plans will help support efforts to recover endangered species including the Catalina Island fox and the Catalina Hutton’s vireo, a small songbird endemic to the island, the conservancy says.“The ecological challenges facing Catalina cannot be solved in a long-term, sustainable way as long as nonnative mule deer continue to prevent the recovery and restoration of the island’s natural habitat,” reads a conservancy management plan.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWildlifeLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Post staffers have also filmed and posted videos on social media urging Bezos to “#savethepost”.While Post chief executive,Will Lewis, has been included on at least one of the emails, the letters have been addressed to Bezos, who some staffers hope might be more persuadable. (Matt Murray, the Post’s top editor, has had private discussions with several Post journalists in recent weeks, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.)“As the Post’s [owner], Bezos is ultimately making the call on these cuts,” said a Post staffer who signed one of the letters but was not authorized to comment. “He also has enough money to do whatever he chooses here. Reporters across the newsroom want to be sure he understands the magnitude of the devastating cuts that we all expect are coming.”Emails sent by the Guardian to Bezos and a representative at the company he founded, Amazon, have not been returned. A Post spokesperson declined to comment on the rumored cuts.The Post staffer described the mood at the paper as “funereal”, with many expecting the cuts to come in the next few days – though the publication still has not acknowledged or confirmed that anything is happening. A rally to protest the cuts has been scheduled for outside the Post’s headquarters on Thursday.On Monday, the union representing most Post employees called out Bezos in a series of posts on X. “If @JeffBezos follows through with his reported plan to decimate the Post’s newsroom, it will be a huge indictment of his supposed business prowess,” the account wrote. “How else to explain his failure to monetize some of the world’s most award-winning, agenda-setting journalism?”Some Post staffers also noted that Bezos has not yet commented on the 14 January raid of a Post reporter’s home,even though many groups that advocate for journalistsdecried the government’s tactics as unprecedented and dangerous. Cameron Barr, a former managing editor of the Post, called out Bezos for his silence in a post on LinkedIn, writing: “It’s not just the chest-thumping overreach of the Trump administration that will crush American freedoms – it’s the silence of its enablers.”Amazon and Bezos have also faced criticism for spending approximately $75m to acquire and promote a documentary about Melania Trump – particularly after Bezos faced accusations of cozying up to Trump by killing the Post’s planned endorsement last fall of Kamala Harris for president.Glenn Kessler, whoended a 27-year-long career at the Postlast year, expressed cautious optimism about the campaign to reach Bezos. “That kind of pushback might have an impact,” he said. “We don’t really know until we see what the actual result is.”Kessler said he and a few other reporters had lunch with Bezos, who purchased the paper in 2013, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election. “He wanted to hear war stories and that sort of thing,” he recalled. “He was quite interested in what people did. He had this great laugh, and he seemed quite engaged.”But Kessler was heavily critical of Bezos’s handling of the Harris endorsement and his decision to refocus the section’s opinion page to prioritize writing “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, decisions that led to the resignation of a top editor and quickly cost the Post hundreds of thousands of subscribers.“Even before these cuts, you can question the quality of Bezos’s stewardship,” Kessler said. “The sense I get is that he’s not nearly as engaged with the Post as he once was. If you’re not really that engaged or invested in the thing that you own, the easiest thing to do is to cut back the money you’re losing on it.”Is Jeff Bezos going to destroy the Washington Post? It sure looks like it | Margaret SullivanRead more“I think it’s hard to overestimate how excited the journalists and editors were when Bezos bought the company,” recalled political journalist Chris Cillizza, who worked at the Post from 2006 to 2017. “The richest man in the world buys the company and he says all the right things. I think people were slower to see that something had changed because they wanted to believe so badly that the original sense we had of Bezos was it.”Cillizza remembered being skeptical when Bezos said he intended the Post to be profitable. “I remember thinking to myself even then, in 2013: ‘Man, that’s going to be tough.’”While Bezos has stayed silent about potential cuts to the Post andignored an effort by the union last yearto get him to visit the newspaper, he was more visibly engaged with one of his other companies on Monday, the spaceflight startup Blue Origin.Bezoswas on handto meet secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, who last Novembercalled the Post’s reporting“fake news”, during a visit to the company’s facility in Florida. “Great to see you,” Bezos told Hegseth. “Welcome – it’s an honor to have you.”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostNewspapersUS press and publishingJeff BezosWill LewisNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Brown kept his decision, which followed days of political wrangling, to a tight inner circle. Nick Clegg, who would go on to serve as deputy prime minister of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, was formally told of Brown’s resignationonly 10 minutes beforethe announcement.But across the pond, a man named Jeffrey Epstein, a well-connected financier and convicted child sex offender, had been briefed hours before. “Finally got him to go today …” anemail believed to be sent by Peter Mandelsoninformed Epstein on Monday morning.The apparent tipoff, revealed in the latest tranche of the Epstein files, not only gave Epstein an inside track on the UK’s political future, but also on large moves that were to ripple through global markets.Those included further wild swings in the value of the British pound, which had already been volatile in the lead-up to the 6 May general election. It fell 2.2% on the day of the vote, its worst day in over a year, illustrating how concerned traders were about the risk of a hung parliament and political instability.On the day of Mandelson’s apparent tip-off to Epstein, the pound rose by more than two cents to $1.505, before losing all its gains as Brown’s resignation – andhis plan for Labour to hold coalition talks with Clegg’s Liberal Democrats– sent shock waves through Westminster. Sterling would gain back a cent a day later, as the Lib Dems struck a deal with the Tories, handing the keys of No 10 to the Conservative leader, David Cameron.While there is no evidence that anyone traded off the leaks, it is just one example of the kind of inside information that Mandelson is alleged to have shared with Epstein, according to the latest batch of documents released by the US Department of Justice last week. Those leaks have caused political outrage across the UK, with Keir Starmer asking police to investigate over concerns they contained market sensitive information.The market for sterling is one of the largest and most liquid in the world, traded through currency desks globally. Bank of International Settlements data shows it was the fourth most traded currency in 2010.Among the allegations that Starmer has asked police to investigate are that the former business secretary, who resigned from the House of Lords on Tuesday, may have also given Epstein advance notice of a €500bneurozone rescue deal.On the same weekend that Brown was locked in talks over the Labour party’s political future, EU finance ministers were scrambling to strike a deal that would shore up the euro and stave off potential collapse of the eurozone.What started during the 2008 financial crisis, and had balloonedinto a sovereign debt crisis in Greece, was now threatening the solvency and stability of the eurozone. It had spread along the Mediterranean, triggering market bets against Portugal, Spain, Italy, as well as Ireland, and raising questions over whether European leaders had the political will to save the common currency.View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein (left) with Peter Mandelson on a boat.Photograph: US Department of JusticeOverall, the crisis, and its resolution, created lucrative opportunities for traders and financiers to profit in European stock markets and moves on the euro.On the night of Sunday 9 May 2010, while eurozone ministers were still in negotiations, Epstein emailed Mandelson, saying sources were claiming that the €500bn bailout was “almost compelte” [sic].“Sd be announced tonight,” a reply thatappears to have been sent by Mandelson, said. When Epstein asks if the UK business secretary is home, Mandelson wrote “Just leaving No10..will call”. The UK government, which never joined the common currency, did not contribute to the bailout, but the then-chancellor, Alistair Darling, had been in Brussels for the negotiations.At about 2.30am the next morning in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers announced a jaw-dropping €750bn rescue plan – topped up with €250bn from the International Monetary Fund – to shore up the currency bloc.It came shortly after markets in Tokyo had opened for trading, and prompted a sharp rally after European stock markets opened at 8am UK time that day. France’s CAC 40 index alone moved significantly, rising by 8.8% that session. The euro also rallied in early trading before falling back. Currency traders could have been placing trades from as early as 10pm on Sunday, UK time.Euro strikes back with biggest gamble in its 11-year historyRead moreChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, told the Guardian there would only have been “limited time” to trade on such information before the eurozone bailout was announced, as policymakers had tried to time bailouts with the markets’ open.In contrast, Mandelson’s tip-off over Brown’s resignation seems to have been sent during market trading hours, meaning it could have been easier for someone with inside information to trade on sterling, government bonds or stocks on the FTSE 100. However, “there’s the risk that the market might not interpret the move in the same way as you did”, Beauchamp noted.“If proven, the allegations as reported would amount to a serious abuse of entrusted power at the heart of government during a national crisis, said Daniel Bruce, chief executive of the anti-corruption body Transparency International UK. “It is right that the police are now involved.“Any investigation should examine whether offences have been committed under both the Bribery Act and the common law offence of misconduct in public office.“With public trust in politics at historic lows, government needs to act decisively to rebuild confidence. While we welcome progress on misconduct legislation and reform of peerage removal rules, ministers should accelerate these reforms to arrest the UK’s declining reputation as a beacon of good governance.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonGordon BrownJeffrey EpsteinFinancial crisisLiberal-Conservative coalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

Bruce Campbell, chief revenue and strategy officer for Warner Bros Discovery, also testified in the packed Senate hearing room.Both Sarandos and Campbell addressed concerns about how the merger would affect entertainment industry jobs, whether it would raise consumer prices for streaming services, whether it would result in less content for users and whether it would hurt the movie theater business.“We’re going to operate theWarner Brosstudio largely as it is today,” Sarandos said in response to a question from Democratic senator Adam Schiff about whether the merger would result in layoffs.Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, specifically questioned Sarandos about the content of Netlix programming, using data that Sarandos said was “inaccurate”. Hawley said he and his wife had to review theNetflixcontent their children want to watch because “I don’t have confidence in what’s on your platform”.Netflix sweetens Warner Bros bid with all-cash offer to block ParamountRead more“Why is it that so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology?” Hawley asked. “An enormous amount of your children’s programming has this ideology in it.”Sarandos said that “Netflix programming has no agenda of any kind”, adding: “We feature a wide variety of stories and programs to meet a wide variety of tastes.”“My concern is that you don’t share my values or that of many American parents,” Hawley said. “I think we ought to be concerned about what content you’re promoting.”Eric Schmitt, a Republican senator from Missouri, pressed Sarandos on donations made by Netflix employees to Democrats and accused him and his company of promoting “DEI and wokeness”. “The overwhelming majority of your stuff is overwhelmingly woke,” he added.“We have no political agenda,” Sarandos responded. “We have a great deal of programming on Netflix, left, right and center.”When asked by a Democratic senator about concerns that past media mergers have resulted in job losses, Sarandos acknowledged that “most media mergers have faired poorly”, but said: “This media merger will be different than any of the others because we actually need these people.”The chair of the subcommittee, Republican senator Mike Lee, began the hearing by saying that the merger raisescompetition concernsbecause Netflix would no longer be competing with a streaming service it would acquire,HBOMax.“The merged firm would have both the incentive and the ability to put rivals at a disadvantage,” Lee said in his opening remarks, saying the deal could “further entrench Netflix’s dominance”.In his opening remarks, Sarandos talked about the value of the merger and the need to compete in an extremely crowded marketplace for content.“With WBD, we’re going to create more economic growth and more value for consumers,” Sarandos said. “We will give consumers more content for less … We’re buying a company that has assets we do not, and we will keep investing in Warner Bros.”The deal was originally announced in early December, and Netflixupgradedits purchase price in mid-January to make the transaction – valued at $82.7bn – all cash.Paramount Skydance has also made several unsuccessful offers for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery, including its television assets.Trump buys $1m in Netflix and Warner Bros bonds days after saying he’ll ‘be involved’ in mergerRead moreCory Booker, the top Democrat on the Senate subcommittee, said he had invited Paramount Skydance chief executive David Ellison to appear at the hearing but he declined. “The absence of having Paramount Skydance here is frustrating,” he said, although he thanked Ellison for meeting with him and other senators to discuss his company’s bid.Booker questioned Sarandos about his meetings with Donald Trump, and asked whether he thought the president’s stated intention to be “involved” in the merger process was appropriate.Sarandos said he had met with Trump “a few times”. While he said the meetings were mostly about the state of the entertainment industry, rather than to discuss the merger, “of course he asked how the deal is going”, Sarandos added.“I think the president, from my experience, has been nothing but interested in protecting and creating American jobs,” Sarandos said.Anti-monopoly groups and veterans of the anti-trust spacehave saidthat Netflix’s acquisition of WBD presents competition concerns that will surely be looked at closely by both domestic and international regulators.While the anti-trust division of the justice department has the most significant role to play in approving the deal, along with the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general could also file lawsuits to block the deal.Booker expressed doubt that the review process would be handled fairly by the Trump administration.“I think it’s really important that we gather a lot of information,” Booker said at the end of the hearing. “I do not trust this administration in their evaluations.”Sarandos, however, expressed confidence that the review “will be run on the merits” of the Department of Justice.Explore more on these topicsNetflixUS politicsWarner BrosUS SenateTed SarandosnewsShareReuse this content"

Iger will remain on Disney’s board until December.Mutiny at Disney? Bob Iger’s fight to right the ship faces showdown with shareholdersRead moreThe company also announced that Dana Walden, co-chair of its entertainment division, who had been in the running to be CEO, would become president and chief creative officer.Disney is one of the biggest media and entertainment empires in the world, having acquired Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and most of21st Century Foxunder Iger. Valued at $185bn, it also has a vast tourism business, built around its resorts and ships, and a sprawling digital media arm.While it reported a surge in profits from its streaming services – Disney+, Hulu and ESPN – earlier this week,Disney+unnerved investors by warning of “headwinds” among international visitors to its US theme parks. Earnings generated by its wider entertainment division also slumped after it spent heavily to promote box office hits such as Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash.D’Amaro said: “I am immensely grateful to the board for entrusting me with leading a company that means so much to me and millions around the world.Disney’s strength has always come from our people and the creative excellence that defines our stories and experiences.“There is no limit to what Disney can achieve, and I am excited to work with our teams across the company and brilliant creative partners to honor Disney’s remarkable legacy while continuing to innovate, grow, and deliver exceptional value for our consumers and shareholders.”Some analysts have noted that D’Amaro, unlike Iger, is little known in Hollywood. Walden’s promotion is likely designed to mitigate such concerns.D’Amaro “has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects”, Iger said on Tuesday.Shares in Disney dropped 1% during early trading in New York.D’Amaro will receive a base salary of $2.5m, the company disclosed in a market filing, and a performance-based bonus of up to 250% – in this case, $6.25m – of his base salary.He will also receive a long-term incentive stock award with a target value of $9.7m upon taking up the job, and be granted a long-term incentive award with a target value of $26.3m each year, based on the board’s evaluation of his performance and wider conditions surrounding the company.Walden, meanwhile, will receive a base salary of $3.75m as chief creative officer and president, with a potential performance-based bonus of up to 200% – in this case, $7.5m – of her salary each year.She will also receive a long-term incentive stock award with a target value of $5.3m after starting the job, and be granted a long-term incentive award with a target value of $15.8m each year, based on the board’s evaluation of her performance and wider conditions surrounding the company.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyDisney+newsShareReuse this content"

The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to putdatacenters and solar-powered satellites in spaceas a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.The deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float isexpected to be timed for early summerto coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.Musk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.The announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”Musk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platformXin an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.Both SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed anexpected value of $800bnfor the company.Despitewidespread backlashto xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.Speculation and leaks about the deal,first reported by Reuters,have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.The news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week thatshowed declining revenuesand a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showedMusk exchanging numerous friendly emailswith the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.He called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.Explore more on these topicsSpaceXXElon MuskInternetTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The fall cast immediate uncertainty over one of the most anticipated storylines of this year’s Games.Vonn said the days since the crash have been spent undergoing scans, physical testing and monitoring swelling and muscle response, adding that she believes her overall conditioning remains strong.“My fitness is 100%, but that doesn’t mean that my body is 100%,” she said. “As long as my swelling is down and my muscles are firing, my strength is what it was a few days ago.“My knee is not swollen, and with the help of a knee brace, I am confident that I can compete on Sunday. This is not, obviously, what I had hoped for. I’ve been working really hard to come into these Games in a much different position.“I know what my chances were before the crash, and I know my chances aren’t the same as it stands today, but I know there’s still a chance. And as long as there’s a chance, I will try. So, that’s where I am.”The revelation that Vonn ruptured her ACL underscores the extent to which injury management has defined the final phase of her career. But she said she has not allowed the diagnosis to shift her mindset.“I’m not letting this slip through my fingers,” she said. “I’m gonna do it, end of story. I’m not crying. My head is high, I’m standing tall, and I’m gonna do my best – and whatever the result is, that’s what it is. But you can never say I didn’t try.”Vonn is entered in the downhill, super-G and the new team combined event. Cortina holds particular significance for the American, who has recorded a record 12 World Cup victories on the Italian course during her career.Her comeback season has already ranked among the most remarkable in the sport’s history. After nearly six years away from competition and following major knee surgery, Vonn returned to the World Cup circuit this season and immediately reestablished herself among the elite, leading the World Cup downhill standings withfive podium finishes from five races, including two wins. She has also claimed two other top-three placements in the super-G. Prior to Vonn’s return, the oldest woman to win a World Cup race was 34.On Tuesday, she acknowledged the emotional stakes of returning to the Olympics after believing her career was over, saying the opportunity to compete again had already exceeded expectations.“I never thought this was possible,” said Vonn, whose three Olympic medals include gold in downhill and bronze in super-G in 2010 and bronze in downhill in 2018. “This is all icing on the cake. I don’t want to have any regrets. I will do everything in my power to be in that starting gate.”Training for the Olympic downhill is scheduled across three sessions in Cortina later this week, with the medal race set for Sunday.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingUS sportsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal may not have been at all convincing against aChelseaside who caused them the occasional problem but Mikel Arteta will not care one bit. After four successive semi-final defeats, Arsenal are on their way to Wembley. At last.After the drama of the first leg at Stamford Bridge that saw Liam Rosenior’s side travel to north London needing to overturn a 3-2 deficit, this was a much more cagey affair that was eventually settled in stoppage time by Kai Havertz’s breakaway goal against his former club.Arsenalhad seemed content to keep Chelsea at arm’s length for most of the evening and rarely looked like extending their advantage until then.Mikel Arteta savours ‘vitamins’ as Arsenal reach Carabao Cup finalRead moreYet having not won this competition since 1993 and after crashing out at the semi-final stage to Newcastle after a 4-0 defeat on aggregate last season, this was an occasion for Arteta and his team to savour as they celebrated deep into the night. A potential showdown in the final with title rivals Manchester City would only add to the sense of drama as they chase a potential quadruple but Arsenal know they are within touching distance of a first trophy since winning the FA Cup in Arteta’s first season six years ago.Rosenior sprang a surprise by leaving Cole Palmer on the bench and naming a back three for the first time, while there was no place for captain Reece James after he failed a fitness test. But while his team’s unexpected formation caused Arsenal a few issues in the first half, they lacked the cutting edge to make it count against a defence as organised as Arsenal’s and only managed two shots on target.View image in fullscreenKai Havertz celebrates with his teammates after sealing Arsenal’s final place.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe hosts were also without their skipper as Martin Ødegaard missed out with a minor muscle injury and Arteta decided against risking Bukayo Saka’s hip problem. Their absence could explain Arsenal’s lack of fluency in attack that hardly backed up Arteta’s pre-match claim that his side are the most exciting in Europe as Eberechi Eze laboured on a rare start.Not since 1987 when David Rocastle’s winner helped Arsenal come from behind against their north London rivals Tottenham has a team overturned a first-leg deficit in the semi-final of this competition after losing the first leg at home. But with Arsenal playing in front of their fans for the first time since losing to Manchester United last weekend, Rosenior admitted beforehand that his side would try to play on any anxieties among the home supporters. Those would only have been heightened by an unconvincing first half performance that saw Arsenal struggle to deal with Chelsea’s switch of formation.Their high-energy press unsettled the hosts and William Saliba gifted the first opportunity to Liam Delap with a poor piece of control inside his own area but his shot went well wide.Arsenal scored from a corner early in the first leg in Rosenior’s first game in charge three weeks ago but Chelsea’s head coach had clearly been working on how to stop them. Three attacking players were sent upfield just as Declan Rice was about to deliver their first of the evening. Piero Hincapié’s header was deflected over by Wesley Fofana and it needed a full-stretch Robert Sánchez to save the Ecuador defender’s piledriver after Chelsea had failed to clear the second corner.But Rosenior will have been encouraged with how his side adapted to their task as he patrolled the touchline in the rain. When Gabriel Martinelli finally found some space in the area, Malo Gusto was there to block his shot. Chelsea’s best attempt of the half came just before the break when Enzo Fernández let fly from outside the area and Kepa Arrizabalaga was able to make a comfortable save. Arteta headed down the tunnel looking most concerned.Arrizabalaga’s flap at a corner as the start of the second half will not have done his nerves any good but Delap could not direct his effort on target. Arteta earned himself a yellow card after remonstrating with the fourth official when João Pedro was fouled by Hincapié as temperatures briefly threatened to spill over.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior surprisingly benched Cole Palmer against Arsenal.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersRosenior decided it was time to roll the dice on then hour mark and summoned Palmer and Estévâo from the bench as he switched to a back four. Suddenly they were much more of a threat as Marc Cucurella and the Brazilian teenager fired efforts wide. Gusto was booked for diving before the anonymous Viktor Gyökeres was replaced by Havertz.Gabriel Magalhães had a golden opportunity to settle it for Arsenal 13 minutes from time when he connected with Hincapié’s cross but Cucurella was able to block with his head. Chelsea felt that they should have had a penalty when Palmer’s free-kick struck Havertz in the wall, even if replays showed the ball hit his shoulder.Their best chance came when Wesley Fofana volleyed wide at the near post from the resulting corner. It was left to Havertz to make sure of Arsenal’s victory when he rounded Sánchez to seal their place in the final to the delight of their trophy-starved supporters.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupArsenalChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He had considered attending the game in Denver or watching on TV in a No 21 Patriots jersey, which he wore in Foxboro for four seasons through the mid-to-late 2010s, but feared he might jinx the outcome. In the end, it was just him and his nerves for company.Just as Butler was feeling somewhat at peace with that setup, and the Patriots’ prospects, a bad omen intruded: His wifi glitched, delaying the broadcast as the Patriots clung on to a three-point lead in the fourth-quarter. “I was laggingbad,” Butler tells the Guardian. “But I did get the wifi back working. And as soon as I did my phone was ringing like crazy, so I knew something was going right. It’s crazy that we’re back.”With a 10-7 victory, New England booked their 10th Super Bowl appearance in the past 24 years and the team’s 12th overall. On Sunday, they’ll face Seattle in a rematch ofthe Patriots’ 28-24 victoryover the Seahawks in 2015’s Super Bowl XLIX. Victory this Sunday at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, would break the Patriots’ stalemate with the Pittsburgh Steelers forthe most Super Bowl victoriesby a franchise ever, at seven. And New England’s success story couldn’t be told without Butler.Maye v Stafford for MVP and Aaron Rodgers getting flattened: NFL end of season awardsRead moreTwo years into retirement, the 36-year-old remains one of football’s biggest emotional triggers – the defensive back who reshaped legacies and kindled a lasting firestorm on one mind-bending play. “It’s most definitely been life-changing,” he says. “It’s one of the best plays ever made inSuper Bowlhistory – in NFL history.”For those who somehow missed it: in Super Bowl XLIX, Seattle were four points behind against New England with a minute left. They had four cracks to all but win the game from the Patriots’ five-yard line. After Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch gained four yards to set up second-and-goal from New England’s one-yard line, most assumed the Seahawks would hand the ball again to Lynch – theSkittles-scarfingbruiser whose impact was oncemeasured on the Richter scale.Instead, with a green light from head coach Pete Carroll, Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell called a pass play – a quick slant to Ricardo Lockette. The basic idea: Jermaine Kearse, staggered just inside of Lockette on the far side of the field, would take out his man – Patriots corner Brandon Browner – and Lockette would slip in underneath the block for the catch and leave Butler, an undrafted rookie, in no-man’s land. The Seahawks had exploited the Patriots’ tight man coverage schemes throughout the game with their rub concepts. All Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson needed was one more completion to revel in confetti as a two-time Super Bowl winner and, likely, the game’s MVP.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Two Tom Brady kneel downs sealed a fourth Patriots’ Super Bowl win that still feels like a rip in the space-time continuum: The Seahawks had the game in the bag – and Malcolm Butler swiped the bag. “I ain’t got nothin but one job to do,” he remembers telling himself. “If they throw this ball, it’s mine.”Butler’s interception still stands as one of the most dramatic plot twists to ever unfold with a championship on the line – more cosmically random than Bill Buckner’sbetween-the-legs World Series errororSteve Bartman’s NLCS souvenir, more crushing than the Golden State Warriorsblowing a 3-1 NBA finalslead in 2016 or the Atlanta Falconswasting a 28-3 Super Bowl lead, wilder thanZinedine Zidane headbutting himselfout of the World Cup final, more outrageous than Lewis Hamilton’s being controversiallydenied an eighth F1 title.Down the years Carroll has said that the Seahawks would have definitely won more Super Bowls if a certain Patriots cornerback hadn’t gotten in the way. “Sometimes you can’t be greedy,” Butler says. “Just take the win. I don’t know if there was something wrong with who wanted to be MVP or whatever, but it’s selfish.”A year before Butler’s epic turnover, I found myself in the Seahawks locker room after theycrushed Denver 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII, watching defensive players mutter and shake their heads over not keeping Peyton Manning off the scoreboard entirely. It was terrifying to imagine all the winning this young team might do in the years ahead, simply in the name of pride.But Butler’s pick cracked something fundamental in the Seahawks; once touted as a dynasty in the making, the Seahawks devolved into a Dynasty-level soap opera. Richard Sherman, Michael Bennett and other members of Seattle’s vaunted Legion of Boom defense came to publicly resent Wilson for, in their view, hoarding credit for the team’s success, and Carroll and general manager John Schneider for protecting the quarterback,opening a rift in the locker roomthat led to the defense’s dismantling.Tom Brady leads New England Patriots on a thrilling ride to Super Bowl XLIX winRead moreWilson slowly transformed from one of the NFL’s most admired players intoits most polarizing; since being traded to Denver in 2022, he has bounced around two teams and could well wind up on a third when his contract with New York Giants expires in March. In 2024 the Seahawks parted ways with Carroll, the architect of their most successful era. Only Schneider hung on long enough to steer the Seahawks back in a Super Bowl – and with the franchise’s future ownership in fluxamid talk of a post‑game sale, there’s no guarantee he’ll be around for the next one.“We [were] at the peak of our careers with a chance to go ahead and start a dynasty,” Lynch said in a 2023 podcast appearance, “and we fumbled the bag on the [one]-yard line.” The Seahawks’ Bennett and Bruce Irvin only compounded the damage after Butler’s interception, drawing flags for encroachment and fighting as New England, already pushed back by penalties for their overzealous celebration of Butler’s pick, inched closer to their own end zone. Those Seattle penalties eliminated any chance of a fumbled snap, a safety or even a lucky touchdown if the Pats had somehow turned it over – leaving only two stress-free kneeldowns for Brady.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Butler went on to win another Super Bowl with the Patriots in February 2017.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesThe fallout from the Seahawks’ choice not to run the ball, which helped start a streak that saw Brady win two more Super Bowls in New England over the next four years and now sets the stage for another possible run with second-year Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, has only made it easier to second‑guess that final play – and the Monday morning quarterbacking is hardly restricted to media and fans. In 2023 Carroll appeared on Richard Sherman’s podcast to unpack the whole episode and said he made the call based on feel. But – and consider this a flaming hot-take warning – not only was Carroll not numb to the situation, he made the correct call.To recap: The Seahawks hadfourattempts at the end zone from the Patriots’ five-yard line with about a minute left – and a timeout in their pocket. It’s logical that at leastoneof those plays would be a pass to keep the Patriots’ defense guessing – and who better to pick on than Butler, a vagabond of college football’s lower tier who had agreed to sign with the Patriots for a deal that notably did not include a signing bonus. Kearse had already beaten Butler on a pair of completions earlier in the game, the most memorable a spectacular juggling catch on his back for a 33‑yard gain that put Seattle at New England’s doorstep just a few plays earlier.After Lynch’s four-yard carry, the rub route was the next logical play call – and, with Butler playing eight yards off Kearse, it was set to work flawlessly. But Butler was well prepared. “Being around great coaches and players, you understand situational football,” he says. “From the one-yard line, the only thing Kearse can do is run a slant or an out route. I didn’t know the pick to set up the slant was coming, but I only had one job to do and that was cover the guy and make a play.”With slightly better execution from the Seahawks, he might not have. “[Kearse] could have run aharderroute to make us both break up the throw,” Butler says. “But I just wanted the ball more.” Still, he concedes the story might have been different if the game had come down to him and a handoff to Lynch, a running back itusually took a mobto bring down. “If they run the ball,” says Butler, who, at a listed 190lbs, was giving up at least 25lbs to Lynch back then. “I’m not making that tackle.”“I cannot believe the call,” NBC’s Cris Collinsworth screeched on the telecast, oblivious to how much his outraged first-hand impression would shape future discussion of the touchdown pass that wasn’t. “If I lose the Super Bowl because Marshawn Lynch can’t get it in from the one-yard line, so be it. But there is no way …why?!” Conversely, had the pass play worked, Collinsworth almost certainly would have spun it as a testament to Carroll’s gumption and Bevell’s acumen, all while anointing Wilson the nextTom Brady.While the Seahawks were reduced to a short-run playoff contender in the years after that play – “as catastrophic as any moment can be,” Carroll described it to Sherman in their 2023 sitdown – Butler cemented his place on the Patriots defense and added another championship after New England came back from 28‑3 down to win Super Bowl LI in 2017; years later, he signed a blockbuster contract worth more than $30m in guarantees with the Tennessee Titans to play for Mike Vrabel, the ex-Pats player turned coach who will lead New England against Seattle on Sunday.After Brady was named the Super Bowl MVP against the Seahawks, he gave Butler the grand prize – a brand new Chevy Colorado pickup truck,the last car ever givento the game’s top performer. “Everybody that saw that play knows what it means,” says Butler. “But to me, it’s just waking up in my house, taking out the trash and looking at my Tom Brady truck.”The good run of fortune is why he has no regrets about Bill Belichick suddenly benching him for the Patriots’ upset defeat to Philadelphia in the 2018 Super Bowl, and why he feels compelled to defend his former coach afterhis recent hall of fame snub. “This man is top three in everything he’s done: winning, postseason victories, Super Bowl rings,” says Butler, who also credits Belichick for facilitating his Patriots return in 2022, essentially as a retirement gesture. “I know sometimes you just gotta ignore stupid stuff, but I don’t agree with it.”These days Butler dedicates himself to giving back – hosting free football camps at his Mississippi high school for the past 11 years, donating free coats and meals through the United Way and collaborating with the American Diabetes Association to raise awareness. For the past three years he has served as the volunteer assistant defensive backs coach at Houston’s St Thomas High, and the team hasn’t missed the playoffs yet. But Butler’s players’ loyalty tohimdoesn’t necessarily guarantee loyalty to his old team, a fact he learned not long after the Patriots-Seahawks matchup was set.“A couple of my players are Seahawks fans. One of them texted me: ‘You’re not playing this time,’” says Butler. It’s not unlike the hesitant acknowledgements he receives from heartbroken Seahawks fans who respect the player, hate that game and remain endlessly haunted by the play that forever lives in championship infamy. “Usually, they’ll be like, ‘Good play, bro. We should’ve ran it.”Every morning he wakes up grateful they never did.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXNew England PatriotsSeattle SeahawksSuper Bowl XLIXNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vancouver sound alarm bells amid difficult sale processScheduling and financial impasses at Vancouver’s World Cup stadium are leading down a road the league hasn’t traveled in over a decadePablo Iglesias MaurerTue 3 Feb 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 17.05 ESTShareOn the surface,Vancouver WhitecapsCEO Axel Schuster’s press conference last week would have felt familiar to almost any North American sports fan. Once again, a team was agitating for more money or a better stadium. Once again, local governments were at least partially to blame.Some of his comments, though, felt more alien, and raised a question that seemed unfathomable just a couple of months ago: are the Vancouver Whitecaps about to die?The Whitecaps were among Major League Soccer’s most competitive sides in 2025,eliminating Inter Miamifrom the Concacaf Champions Cup early in the year andlosing to Miami, the eventual champions, in MLS Cup. They feature a global superstar in Thomas Müller and are just weeks away from their home opener. Lingering in the background, though, the club is for sale, with their financial state and their inability to find a new home cited as the primary reasons.That situation, Schuster revealed last week, has only bleakened.Schuster said the Whitecaps generate less revenue than any other franchise in the league. Indeed, some reports say that on matchdays, they are entitled to as little as 12% of the take at BC Place, the multipurpose stadium they’ve called home since enteringMLSin 2011. The stadium has bona fides, having hosted the 2015 Women’s World Cup final, with two Canada games to come at this summer’s men’s World Cup. However, it’s also very popular. The Whitecaps are one tenant among many, and the terms of their lease have not materially changed in the 15 years they’ve been in operation. Negotiations for better terms with PavCO, the province-owned operators of the stadium, have proved fruitless, said Schuster. The city and Whitecaps have a one-year “memorandum of understanding” to explore other stadium options, but as of now, nothing viable has come of it.Inter Miami have reloaded for 2026 in a way no other MLS team could haveRead moreMore striking than any of this, though, were Schuster’s comments about the club’s search for new investors. The club was publicly put up for sale in late 2024. Since then, Schuster revealed, “almost 40” groups entered into non-disclosure agreements with the Whitecaps and were given a look at the club’s financial data.“As of now, at this moment, no one, not one single one, is interested in buying even 1% of this club,” Schuster told reporters, “because all of them think that our setup here and the market and the situation we are in is not something where you can invest in as long as [things don’t change completely].”It’s a level of transparency that feels uncommon in situations like these, where businesses more often than not strive to present themselves in the rosiest terms possible while they search for a buyer. Schuster’s comments felt at times more like the league, and Whitecaps, are laying the groundwork for a relocation, or even some form of contraction.A league statement, released concurrently, mirrored much of Schuster’s commentary.“Operational constraints around scheduling and venue access have intensified in 2026, creating untenable conditions for a major league club, with no clear path forward to resolving these challenges in future years,” the statement read in part. “This is not fair to the club or its fans … meaningful progress is urgently required to establish a sustainable path forward.”Like any professional sports league in North America, MLS has a history of franchise relocation and contraction. The league eliminated two of its original franchises, the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion, less than a half-decade after its founding. The San Jose Earthquakes moved to Houston in 2005 before restarting in 2008. In 2014, the Chivas USA folded, with MLS eventually selling the franchise rights to the current-day owners of LAFC.The one case since then was especially fraught: In 2017, MLS very nearly approved the relocation of a league original, the Columbus Crew, before agrassroots efforthelped save the team. Anthony Precourt, the Crew’s owner, was tapped to own expansion side Austin FC instead.View image in fullscreenIn Thomas Müller, the Whitecaps have a global star and a solid team on the field alongside him.Photograph: Rich Lam/Getty ImagesMLS is a fundamentally different place than it was in 2011, when the Whitecaps were founded. It is no longer a collection of largely unprofitable clubs who appeal to a small niche of American sports fans. In 2013, NYC FC entered the league for $100m. San Diego FC, the league’s most recent franchise, paid five times that sum a decade later. Most recently, Sporting Kansas City sold to a new majority owner at a $700m valuation. At this point, it feels more like big business.After decades of rapid MLS expansion, league commissioner Don Garber has declined, for now, to outline any plans for adding more franchises. With that door theoretically closed, potential MLS markets like Sacramento, or Detroit, or more recently Indianapolis, would probably jump at the opportunity to lure an existing franchise like the Whitecaps, or buy the rights to one from the league.The Whitecaps are not entirely without value to an investor who wants to keep them local, though. Far from it. For a modern MLS team, they have a strong brand identity, one steeped in a history that dates back to the team’s original incarnation in the 1970s and one that’s still deeply meaningful in-market. They’ve showed ambition at times, as they did with the signing of Müller, and they are well-supported, even during rough patches. Though sometimes lost in the shuffle with their Cascadian neighbors in Seattle and Portland, Vancouver remain an important part of that important trio of rivals.Yet maybe more than any other club in MLS, the Whitecaps face a laundry list of scheduling challenges, with BC Place frequently booked for other events (the Whitecaps nearly lost hosting rights for a playoff game due to a scheduling conflict with a motocross event at their home stadium last year). Those conflicts will only increase in 2026, when the men’s World Cup visits BC Place. The Whitecaps have their full slate of regular-season matches and will also take part in Concacaf Champions League, Leagues Cup and Canadian Cup play as well.MLS to cut a quarter of Spanish-language broadcast talent on Apple TV, according to sourcesRead moreNone of these issues, though, are as insurmountable as the bare fact that the Whitecaps do not own the stadium they call home. This type of arrangement used to be commonplace in MLS but faded with the advent of soccer specific stadiums. Vancouver’s arrangement feels a bit like the one DC United navigated until 2018. Unable to broker a stadium deal with the District of Columbia, United languished at RFK Stadium for years under a lease agreement with the city that gave them little to no matchday revenue outside of ticket sales.MLS – and DC United – had strong words for the District government, even leveraging nebulous interest from nearby Maryland and Virginia. United eventually got their downtown stadium, but have struggled mightily to claw their way back to relevance after a decade or so out of the spotlight.In Vancouver, opinions on the club’s ownership group – majority owner Greg Kerfoot and a handful of smaller investors, which includes former NBA legend Steve Nash – skews negative, with more than a handful of fans placing the blame for the club’s financial state and lack of a stadium plan squarely on their shoulders.It’s perhaps the most frustrating thing about North American sports: a strong brand identity, strong local support and even results on the field are often not enough without the backing of a billionaire. That holds particularly true in MLS, where some teams still operate at a loss and franchise valuations, even while they skyrocket, sometimes don’t justify absorbing decades of losses.Many of the club’s longtime fans will be understandably hopeful that the Whitecaps can find a way to stay in Vancouver. Based on the comments of the club’s CEO – and the league – it feels more likely that the end of the road may be drawing near.Explore more on these topicsVancouver WhitecapsMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new members of the Hall of Fame will be revealed on Thursday night, in the run-up to this weekend’s Super Bowl.‘Insane’: LeBron and Mahomes lead backlash after Belichick’s reported Hall of Fame snubRead moreBelichick and Kraft led one of the NFL’s most successful dynasties in New England, winning six Super Bowls together over the course of more than two decades. If the Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday’s Super Bowl it will be Kraft’s first championship without Belichick as head coach. The victory would also mean the Patriots would move out of a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins by a franchise.Last week, it emerged that Belichick had failed to secure the required votes to enter the Hall of Fame this year, despite being widely considered one of the greatest head coaches of all time. Belichick reportedly said “Six Super Bowls isn’t enough?” when he was told he hadn’t made the Hall of Fame this year.On Monday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he believed both men deserved to be in the Hall of Fame. The NFL does not decide who enters the Hall.“We are not involved in it,” Goodell said. “Bill Belichick’s record goes without saying, same with the Patriots and Robert Kraft, who is also a candidate. They are spectacular. They have contributed so much to this game, and I believe they will be Hall of Famers.”Kraft’s apparent exclusion dampens speculation that Kraft lobbied voters to keep his former head coach out of the Hall after their relationship soured. Kraft denied those rumors last week.“Whatever perceptions may exist about any personal differences between Bill and me, I strongly believe Bill Belichick’s record and body of work speak for themselves,” Kraft said in his statement last Wednesday.“As head coach of theNew England Patriotsfor more than two decades, he set the standard for on-field excellence, preparation, and sustained success in the free agency and salary cap era of the National Football League. He is the greatest coach of all time and he unequivocally deserves to be a unanimous first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer.”Others have speculated that Kraft and Belichick have been passed over by voters due to theSpygate and Deflategate scandalsthat marred the team’s reputation.Kraft was first nominated for the Hall of Fame in 2013 but this was the first year he was a finalist. Other NFL owners such as Jerry Jones, Pat Bowlen, Eddie DeBartolo Jr, and Dan Rooney are already in the Hall of Fame.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

War crimes are said to have been carried out by both sides in the conflict.

What ­happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problem as human beings.”The Rapid Support Forces in Sudan have been backed by the UAE, a position the Gulf state denies despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters. The RSF hascarried out mass killingsin the Sudanese city El Fasher.In November the UAE admitted to errors in policy after reputational damage over its support for the RSF.

Last ­Thursday ­Guardiola spoke at a charity event in Barcelona about the need to protect children in Palestine, prompting questions before City’s Carabao Cup tie against Newcastle on Wednesday about why he was vocal on humanitarian issues.“It is about a better place for humanity,” he said. “The people who run away from their countries, go in the sea and then go on a boat to get rescued: don’t ask if he is right or wrong, rescue him. It is about a human being. After, we can agree, criticise. But people dying, you have to help them.“Protecting the human being is the only thing we have. Right now, we kill each other, for what?

Focus on our core. We are a sports organisation. We understand politics and we know we don’t operate in a vacuum. But our game is sport. That means keeping sport a neutral ground. A place where every athlete can compete freely, without being held back by the politics or divisions of their governments.“In a world that is increasingly divided, this principle matters more than ever. It is what allows theOlympic Gamesto remain a place of inspiration where the athletes of the world can come together and showcase the best of our humanity.”The general understanding in Milan was that Coventry was referring to Russia’s exclusion since it launched its war on Ukraine in 2022. Her comments were also quickly welcomed by the Russian IOC member Shamil Tarpischev, who confirmed that relations with the IOC had improved significantly.“It was emphasised in her speech that the political component shouldn’t play a role,” he told German media. “Because sport is inspiration and the future. So far, everything is going smoothly and honourably. But we still have a lot of discussions to make.”Tarpischev also said he welcomed Infantino’s comments. “I sat next to him at the concert yesterday. He’s very positive about all our efforts in terms of participation. We communicate all the time.”View image in fullscreenMatvii Bidnyi called Gianni Infantino ‘irresponsible’ and ‘infantile’ for his comments around Russia.Photograph: ReutersRussia has been banned byFifaand Uefa since its full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Its teams are allowed to play friendlies, but cannot enter competitions such as the men’s or women’s World Cup, European Championship or junior equivalents. Infantino has consistently expressed a hope to see them return and, in an interview with Sky News on Monday, said the ban had “not achieved anything” and should be reassessed, at least concerning youth teams.Bidnyi, however, delivered a withering response to Infantino, highlighting the real-life effects of Russia’s aggression on footballers and other sportspeople. “Gianni Infantino’s words sound irresponsible, not to say infantile,” he said. “They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed. Let me remind you that since the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians. Among them were 100 footballers.”Bidnyi proceeded to give examples of young players killed by missile strikes and shelling before urging football’s authorities not to let Russia back in. “War is a crime, not politics,” he said. “It is Russia that politicises sport and uses it to justify aggression. I share the position of the Ukrainian Association of Football, which also warns against Russia’s return to international competitions.“As long as Russians continue killing Ukrainians and politicising sport, their flag and national symbols have no place among people who respect values such as justice, integrity, and fair play.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, went further in his condemnation of Infantino and linked his comments to a past Olympic scandal. “679 Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football – Russia killed them,” he posted on X. “And it keeps killing more while moral degenerates suggest lifting bans, despite Russia’s failure to end its war. Future generations will view this as a shame reminiscent of the 1936 Olympics.”In December the IOC advised sport’s governing bodies to let Russian youth athletes compete at international events again, under their own flag and national anthem. Shortly after, Fifa announced plans for a new under-15 festival, open to all 211 member associations, that will take place for boys this year and girls in 2027.Welcome to Team GB’s Milan base: TV, games, popcorn and 5,000 tea bagsRead moreThere will be 13 Russian athletes competing as neutrals in Milano Cortina, and seven from Belarus. That is a fraction of the 200 Russians who competed in Beijing four years ago, winning 32 medals under the banner of the “Russian Olympic Committee” enforced following the state-sponsored doping scandal.In football, Russia under-16 and under-15 teams have regularly participated in Uefa-branded “development tournaments”, which are also open to guest countries from outside Europe, since the ban. Opponents in these tournaments have included Serbia, Kazakhstan, China, Ghana and Belarus.Russian national teams have played few matches in Europe since February 2022, aside from games in its close ally Belarus. Exceptions have sprung up in the past year: the senior women’s side played a friendly in Serbia last July and two matches in North Macedonia three months later. Mid-season practice matches during club training camps in Turkey are more common. The German club Berliner AK sparked controversy when their under-19s faced Spartak Moscow, and the sixth-tier side Rot‑Weiss Wittlich played Dynamo Moscow’s second team last week.A full return in football appears highly unlikely while no end to the war is in view. Opposition within Europe, which in effect led to the ban when opponents refused to play Russia in the World Cup 2022 playoffs, remains strong and any vote taken by the Fifa Council or Uefa would almost certainly not pass.Explore more on these topicsSportGianni InfantinoRussia (Football)International Olympic CommitteeLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesFifanewsShareReuse this content"

Rob Higgins, the athletics CEO of the University of South Florida, was brought on to the ice to attempt a shot through a very small opening in an empty goal. If Higgins, who is a cancer survivor, made the shot the NHL said it would donate $500,000 to cancer charities; if he missed the donation would be $100,000. The event was broadcast live on Sportsnet in Canada and ESPN in the US. Higginsmissed what was a very tough shot. He was then given another chance, with a guaranteed donation of $200,000 if he missed, which would increase to $1m if he scored. Higgins missed again.Higgins thanked the Lightning and the NHL for an “amazing honor” but many on social media attacked the league for leaving $800,000 on the table that could have gone to charity.One account saidthe move was “classless”, adding that “the NHL should’ve built the widest net and asked dozens of survivors to score symbolically”. Another usercalled the event “dystopian”.Higgins was a little more upbeat. “And with that, my hockey career (which thankfully only lasted two shots) is now officially over,”he wrote on X.Explore more on these topicsNHLTampa Bay LightningBoston BruinsIce hockeyUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now he could face his first backlashJohn DuerdenTue 3 Feb 2026 12.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareJurassic Park sounded great given the spectacular beasts on display, but there was chaos after they started to do their own thing. WhenCristiano Ronaldo, surely the T rex, and Karim Benzema, perhaps a velociraptor, are scoring in spectacular fashion there are headlines around the world, but the Saudi Pro League is finding out that when they start to flex their muscles off the pitch, there is even more interest and, it turns out, a real problem for the competition.What happened on a manic Monday in the SPL should have been about what unfolded on the pitch.Al-Hilal, in first, drew with third-placed Al-Ahli. Al-Nassr won, to stay second, closing to within a point of the leaders. If Brendan Rodgers, having a whale of a time with Al-Qadsiah, wins his game in hand then four points will separate the top four with just over a third of the season remaining. It is the kind of title race most leagues would love.Early birds, big spenders, hidden gems: January transfer window trendsRead moreBut it was all overshadowed. Sadio Mané scored the only goal for Al-Nassr, but where was his teammate Ronaldo,the face of the leaguesince he signed on the last day of 2022? According to reports back home, he was believed to be on strike.The 40-year-old is said to be unhappy at the relative lack of investment his club received in this transfer window and to be thinking about leaving despite a reported daily pay packet of about £490,000.Al-Nassrare owned by the Public Investment Fund, which also backs the other members of the “Big Four”: Al-Nassr’s city rivals Al-Hilal and the Jeddah clubs Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli.Ronaldo has yet to win a major trophy in Saudi Arabia, but this season was looking different under Jorge Jesus, who led Al-Hilal to the 2024 title. Yet mid-season recruitment has been underwhelming, the young Iraqi midfielder Haydeer Abdulkareem being the only addition.Al-Hilal splashed out on Mohamed Meïté from Rennes, the former Arsenal centre-back Pablo Marí, a couple of Saudi Arabia internationals and, most strikingly, Benzema. The former France striker played a major role last season to help Al-Ittihad win the title, but has not been quite as prolific this time as the team have struggled.It has been theorised that Ronaldo may have gone on strike in an attempt to persuade the PIF not to allow Al-Hilal to bring his former Real Madrid teammate into their ranks. The fund was said to be keen to ensure Benzema stayed in the country.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema moved to Al-Hilal after his relationship at Al-Ittihad soured.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APBenzema’s relationship with Al-Ittihad had soured in recent weeks. He joined in the summer of 2023 and the 38-year-old wanted a new deal. It could not be agreed, though, and it was reported that Benzema went down the striking route. He has joined Darwin Núñez and Rúben Neves on the blue side of Riyadh, having scored 54 goals in 83 appearances for Al-Ittihad.His goodbye message to Al-Ittihad fans on social media, thanking them for “the welcome, the love, and the energy you gave me every day”, is surely not going to stop him from getting a roasting the next time he plays there.Infantino apologises to British fans and defends awarding Trump peace prizeRead moreRonaldo can be forgiven for not wanting Al-Hilal to strengthen with a proven, if somewhat injury-prone, goalscorer, but less easy to overlook will be, if true, a withdrawal of his highly remunerated labour. He is at a different level to Benzema and could face a backlash for the first time for apparently throwing his toys when he did not get his way. There were murmurings in the past about suggestive gestures and red cards, but for the most part he is regarded as having excelled as the face of the league.Despite the influx of megastars in recent years, fans could be forgiven for feeling nostalgic about the old days. Sami Al-Jaber, who made more than 150 appearances for Saudi Arabia and had a short loan spell at Wolves, has never seen anything like it.“Some world-famous foreign players have come to control not only the spotlight, but even the decisions of the clubs they play for, exploiting international media outlets to strengthen their influence,” he said on Saudi TV, adding that they could now steer events in their own favour.“The uncontrolled behaviour and excessive power of global stars pose a real crisis within the league, as their influence sometimes surpasses that of clubs themselves.”If the comments from Al-Jaber, an influential figure, are anything to go by, Ronaldo could have some explaining to do and the league faces some soul-searching and must decide who is in charge: PIF, the league, the clubs or the big beasts who look as if they are running amok?Explore more on these topicsSaudi Pro LeagueCristiano RonaldoAl-NassrAl-HilalSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The centre-back was dismissed in the 29th minute for denying the Saints debutant Jacob Devaney a goalscoring opportunity.It was the third time in five league games thatHeartshad been reduced to 10 men. Unlike the previous two occasions, however, they were unable to grind out a result in Paisley as Freckleton’s 88th-minute header consigned them to a third defeat of the season. The result leaves Hearts six points ahead of Celtic and Rangers, both of whom play their games in hand on Wednesday.Stephen Robinson, theSt Mirrenmanager, made five changes to the side that started the 0-0 draw with Dundee on Saturday, including handing a debut to the on-loan Manchester United midfielder Devaney.Pressure firmly on Celtic in Scottish title race finally worthy of the nameRead moreThere were two changes to the Hearts team from the 3-0 win at Dundee United as Michael Steinwender and Beni Baningime came in for Jordi Altena and Tomas Magnusson.Saints had a decent chance in the third minute but Alex Gogic headed over from Declan John’s free-kick. At the other end, Alexandros Kyziridis saw a shot from the edge of the box easily saved by Shamal George. It proved to be the visitors’ only notable attempt of the first half.The Hearts goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow had to make a good save from Mikael Mandron before Devaney’s cross from the right struck the top of the crossbar. Gogic then saw an inswinging cross from the left clawed out by Schwolow as the Buddies cranked up the pressure.Hearts endured a blow in the 29th minute when they were reduced to 10 men. Stuart Findlay got caught dithering on the ball by Mandron, forcing fellow centre-back Halkett into some frantic last-ditch defending that resulted in him fouling Devaney just outside the box and being sent off. From the resulting free-kick, Killian Phillips’s effort was superbly saved by Schwolow, with Mandron unable to force in the rebound.View image in fullscreenStuart Findlay, seen here after the game ended, gave away possession before Halkett tried to intervene and was sent off.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PASaints thought they had gone ahead in the 39th minute when Marcus Fraser headed home the rebound after Gogic had nodded John’s free-kick against the post but it was ruled out for offside.There was more frustration for the hosts just before half-time when they were awarded a penalty after Harry Milne fouled Jayden Richardson on the right edge of the box, but VAR deemed the offence was outside the box. John fizzed the resulting free-kick agonisingly beyond the far post.Saints continued to knock on the door early in the second half and Schwolow produced a spectacular save to deny Mandron. But Hearts started to become a threat on the counterattack, with Cláudio Braga in particular carrying the fight to the Saints defence.It felt like the game could go either way in the closing stages and Saints eventually made the breakthrough when Freckleton headed home John’s corner from close range.“We’ve seen before in recent weeks when we go down to 10 men, I think there’s a belief there that we can go and get results and I think that showed in the performance,” said the Hearts manager, Derek McInnes.“But we’ve got to own the fact that we can’t keep getting away with it, you can’t keep playing with fire. It’s a red card, there’s no complaint about that, but we caused it, we got ourselves into a fankle.“We had two opportunities to play it forward, and we get ourselves in a bit of a state, and it culminates in a last-gasp challenge, and we’ve paid for it,” McInnes added. “From that point on, it was just making sure we kept it at zero for as long as we can and then hope for a moment.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsSt Mirrenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is hard to discern whether Villa finish the window in a stronger position than when it opened after allowing Donyell Malen and Evann Guessand to depart, but the return of Tammy Abraham, on a permanent deal, provides Villa with another bona fide striker, and Douglas Luiz, another player back for a second spell, eases their midfield injuries. Alberto Benito, Emery’s chief scout, tracked Alysson, a £10.5m buy from Grêmio and the club could look back on the £10m deal for Brian Madjo as smart business; there is plenty of excitement around the Enfield-born 17-year-old, who became Metz’s youngest debutant aged 16 last year. Finley Munroe was sold to Middlesbrough, to the surprise of Ian Holloway, who managed the 20-year-old left-back – a cousin of Declan Rice – during his impressive loan spell at Swindon. “I don’t think I’ve had as good a full-back potentially in my lifetime,” Holloway said.Ben FisherKey ins:Tammy Abraham (Besiktas, £18.3m), Brian Madjo (Metz, £10m), Alysson (Grêmio, £8.7m), Douglas Luiz (Juventus, loan)Key outs:Evann Guessand (Crystal Palace, loan), Donyell Malen (Roma, loan)BournemouthBournemouth prevented the £62.5m record sale of Antoine Semenyo from developing into a saga, the Ghana forward scoring a stoppage-time winner on his final appearance. He took out a full-page advert in theBournemouthEcho to thank fans for their support after making the next step on an extraordinary journey that has brought him from non-league to arguably the best team on the planet. Bournemouth were preparing for his exit and signed Rayan in a £30m deal from Vasco da Gama; the fact Bournemouth have inserted a €100m release clause suggests they are expecting big things. The 20-year-old Hungary midfielder Alex Toth, whose development at Ferencvaros was overseen by Robbie Keane, arrives with a fine reputation. The arrivals of Christos Mandas and Fraser Forster widened Andoni Iraola’s pool of goalkeepers, with the Greek, a loan signing from Lazio, expected to compete with Djordje Petrovic to be No 1.BFKey ins:Rayan (Vasco da Gama, £24.7m), Alex Toth (Ferencvaros, £10.4m), Christos Mandas (Lazio, loan), Fraser Forster (free agent)Key outs:Antoine Semenyo (Manchester City, £62.5m)View image in fullscreenRayan has a €100m release clause at Bournemouth.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersBrentfordThe window was all about streamlining the squad, with the feeling at the club being that they might have been carrying a few too many over the first half of the season. The picture has been influenced by excellent player availability.Brentfordlost their head of performance, Chris Haslam, to Tottenham last summer but which club have continued to have the injury problems? Frank Onyeka was prominent among the outgoings, which also included Myles Peart-Harris and Paris Maghoma. The major piece of incoming business was the promising 18-year-old Kaye Furo, who has joined to provide cover up front for Igor Thiago.David HytnerKey ins:Kaye Furo (Club Brugge, £8.7m)Key outs:Frank Onyeka (Coventry, loan)BrightonThe return of club legend Pascal Gross has paid immediate dividends after the veteran scored the first goal of his second spell on the south coast against Everton last weekend. Brajan Gruda was the surprise casualty as he was allowed to join RB Leipzig on deadline day, while Matt O’Riley cut short his loan move to Marseille and is back to add more depth to Fabian Hürzeler’s squad. Interest fromNottingham Forestin the veteran club captain Lewis Dunk and Yasin Ayari was rebuffed.

After a bit of a delay the experienced James Ward-Prowse arrived from West Ham, having been cast out by Nuno Espírito Santo, who is clearly not a fan of the former England international. Ward-Prowse, a cool head with impeccable delivery from set pieces, was a sensible loan, adding maturity to a squad in need of leaders. Hannes Delcroix, who had last played a first-team game forBurnleyin March 2024, departed for Lugano in Switzerland, while Manuel Benson moved to Maccabi Haifa.Will UnwinKey ins:James Ward-Prowse (West Ham, loan)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenJames Ward-Prowse was on the Burnley bench at Sunderland but his cool head and set pieces could boost his new team.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAChelseaA quiet window by Chelsea’s standards, even if it did begin with the departure of Enzo Maresca as head coach. Liam Rosenior came in and spent a while examining his deep squad. Not much was needed. Chelsea looked for cover in defensive midfield but cooled interest in Douglas Luiz before his move toAston Villa. Central defence was a bigger priority. Chelsea were beaten to Jérémy Jacquet by Liverpool but recalled Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg. Sarr, who played for Chelsea at last summer’s Club World Cup, was crucial for Rosenior at Strasbourg. He will have a chance to establish himself before Chelsea look to sign a defender in the summer.Jacob SteinbergKey ins:Mamadou Sarr (Strasbourg, recalled from loan)Key outs:Raheem Sterling (released), Tyrique George (Everton, loan), Axel Disasi (West Ham, loan)Crystal PalaceAnother manic end to the window finished with Jean-Philippe Mateta staying after his move to Milan fell through and Palace breaking their transfer record for the second time by signing Jørgen Strand Larsen from Wolves. A late push for to take Dwight McNeil from Everton did not get over the line but Oliver Glasner is not short of attacking options after the arrivals of Evann Guessand and Brennan Johnson. The major disappointment was Palace’s failure to secure a replacement for Marc Guéhi after the England defender joined Manchester City – a situation that will have to be resolved in the summer.EAKey ins:Jørgen Strand Larsen (Wolves, £43m), Brennan Johnson (Tottenham, £35m), Evann Guessand (Aston Villa, loan)Key outs:Marc Guéhi (Manchester City, £20m), Romain Esse (Coventry, loan)EvertonThe Everton hierarchy wished to save transfer funds until the summer but David Moyes wanted to strengthen asap, believing European qualification remains achievable for a club who have spent recent years fighting relegation. Ultimately there was a little compromise, with a loan deal sanctioned for Chelsea’s promising young winger Tyrique George after Jack Grealish’s season-ending foot injury. Everton have an option to buy the 19-year-old in the summer. Moyes had also wanted a striker and a successful resolution to his year-long search for a right-back. There was interest in Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri but the Morocco forward favoured a move to Saudi Arabia. Fulham rejected an approach for Harry Wilson, who is out of contract at the end of the season.Andy HunterKey ins:Tyrique George (Chelsea, loan)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenTyrique George has joined Everton from Chelsea after Jack Grealish’s season-ending foot injury.Photograph: Jacob King/PAFulhamHave they done enough to convince Marco Silva to renew his contract when it expires this summer? Maybe not. The £27m signing of Oscar Bobb from Manchester City is exciting butFulhamstruggled to get other business done. Silva wanted a striker and targeted PSV’s Ricardo Pepi, who proved too expensive. Another concern is a potential cover in midfield after Sasa Lukic’s hamstring injury. However Fulham were pleased to hold on to Wilson. The winger, who is having a stunning season, was targeted by Everton. He is out of contract at the end of the season and will be watching Silva’s situation closely.JSKey ins:Oscar Bobb (Manchester City, £27m)Key outs:Adama Traoré (West Ham, £2m)LeedsDaniel Farke is likely to be underwhelmed – to put it politely – at the sole addition of Facundo Buonanotte to his Leeds squad. The winger arrived on loan from Brighton, having had a similar deal at Chelsea cut short owing to lack of game time. In the days before the deadline the Leeds manager told reporters he had “made my views on what we need clear to the board” but would not elaborate. It is safe to assume that Farke had requested reinforcements but, bar a brief dalliance with the idea of augmenting the team’s attack by buying Jørgen Strand Larsen from Wolves, nothing much has happened. With Leeds not clear of relegation waters, everyone at Elland Road must hope Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains fit.Louise TaylorKey ins:Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton, loan)Key outs:Jack Harrison (Fiorentina, loan)LiverpoolThe £60m deal for Jacquet, Rennes’ highly rated centre-half, again demonstrated that Liverpool’s transfer strategy was not dictated by short-termism. There was an unsuccessful attempt to sign theSunderlanddefender Lutsharel Geertruida on loan from Leipzig, having lost Conor Bradley, Jeremie Frimpong and Joe Gomez to injury, and that may leave Arne Slot light on defensive cover. Liverpool felt there was no value in reviving a move for Guéhi six months before he was due to become a free agent and Semenyo, another target, also joined Manchester City. But in beating Chelsea to Jacquet’s signature they have secured a key part of their defensive rebuild and a profile of signing the club have been pursuing for some time. Liverpool also resisted Tottenham’s attempts to end Andy Robertson’s outstanding Anfield career.AHKey ins:Jérémy Jacquet (Rennes, £60m, defender joins on 1 July)Key outs:NoneView image in fullscreenJérémy Jacquet, a central defender, will join Liverpool from Rennes next summer.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoManchester CityIn the combined £82.5m splurge on Semenyo and Guéhi, Pep Guardiola signed a top-class wide forward and top-class defender to strengthen a second half of a campaign in which City remain in contention for the title, Champions League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Semenyo’s 44th-minute strike in Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham was a fourth in his first five games, and Guéhi has been as impressive in his first two appearances. The latest chapter of Kalvin Phillips’s disappointing City career featured the No 6’s third loan, to Sheffield United. Sverre Nypan, a 19-year-old Norwegian midfielder, was recalled from his temporary move at Middlesbrough after making only three starts and Joel Ndala was sent on loan to Sheffield Wednesday.Jamie JacksonKey ins:Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth, £62.5m), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace, £20m)Key outs:Oscar Bobb (Fulham, £27m), Stefan Ortega (Nottingham Forest, £500,000), Kalvin Phillips (Sheffield United, loan)Manchester UnitedBefore the window Ruben Neves, Conor Gallagher, Tyler Adams and Semenyo were on Ruben Amorim’s radar. Yet on 5 January the head coach was sacked by United, four days later Semenyo signed for Manchester City, and at 7pm on 2 February Neves remained at Al-Hilal and Adams was still at Bournemouth, with Gallagher having moved from Atlético Madrid to Tottenham, so Michael Carrick’s reward for beating Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham in his first three games as interim manager was zero signings to bolster his challenge for a Champions League berth. Factor in Tyrell Malacia remaining owing to Patrick Dorgu’s muscle injury after interest from Turkey, and the sole business involved temporary moves for academy youngsters and Toby Collyer going on loan to Hull.JJKey ins:NoneKey outs:NoneNewcastleIn Eddie Howe’s ideal world, Newcastle would have strengthened at full-back, centre-back, in central midfield and in attack. But no one arrived, which means Howe must extract the best from his injury-hit and inconsistent squad. Can Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa, Jacob Ramsey and Anthony Elanga fully justify last summer’s £220m total investment in their abilities? Howe’s medium-term future could depend upon the answer. He could perhaps have done with recalling Matt Targett from a loan at Middlesbrough but the full-back was resistant and his wishes were respected. Although the Sandro Tonali to Arsenal stories were unfounded, subsequent comments from Tonali’s agent that he would “work out Sandro’s valuation in about March” raise fears that Howe should brace himself for Isak part two. The long-serving centre-half, and club captain, Jamaal Lascelles, moved to Leicester.LTKey ins:NoneKey outs:Jamaal Lascelles (Leicester, undisclosed)Nottingham ForestWithout the injured Chris Wood, Forest focused on the forward line. A string of names were linked but 6ft 7in Lorenzo Lucca was the first through the door from Napoli in an attempt to replicate what they are missing without Wood. Jørgen Stand Larsen, Mehdi Taremi and Jean-Philippe Mateta were also on the shortlist but Forest opted against adding an extra striker after Taiwo Awoniyi scored at Brentford. Stefan Ortega was a sensible signing from Manchester City to bolster the goalkeeping department after John Victor’s season-ending injury, especially considering Matz Sels sustained a groin problem against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ending the loans of Oleksandr Zinchenko and Douglas Luiz were boosts because they never found their feet at the City Ground, and Borussia Mönchengladbach’s Luca Netz was a logical and frugal addition at left-back. Unsuccessful bids were made for Celtic’s Arne Engels and Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney but the club did not panic and sign any old central midfielder for the sake of it.WUKey ins:Luca Netz (Borussia Mönchengladbach, £2m), Stefan Ortega (Manchester City, £500,000), Lorenzo Lucca (Napoli, loan)Key outs:Arnaud Kalimuendo (Eintracht Frankfurt, loan), Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal, loan ended), Douglas Luiz (Juventus, loan ended)SunderlandArguably Sunderland’s most interesting signing is Melker Ellborg. The highly rated 22-year-old former Malmö goalkeeper cost £3m and is said to be stylistically similar to Régis Le Bris’s first choice, Robin Roefs. Ellborg’s arrival allows last season’s first-choice keeper, Anthony Patterson, to join Millwall on loan. Similarly last season’s key midfielder and captain Dan Neil has been loaned to Ipswich, preventing any potential fractures in squad harmony on Wearside. There is relief that the versatile defender and Leipzig loanee Geertruida has not moved toLiverpoolbut a changing of the guard is under way on the wings. Simon Adingra’s struggles to establish himself prefaced a loan to Monaco, and Ecuador’s free-scoring Nilson Angulo has arrived from Anderlecht for £17.5m.

That, in headline terms, has seen Conor Gallagher sign and Brennan Johnson depart. Spurs have also added the 19-year-old left-back prospect Souza. Since the window opened, there have been significant injuries to Mohammed Kudus, Rodrigo Bentancur, Richarlison, Ben Davies, Lucas Bergvall, Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso (in that order). Frank made clear that short-term fixes on the market were not an option. The club aimed high, trying to get Semenyo and Andy Robertson. The former opted to go from Bournemouth to Manchester City and Liverpool would not sell the latter.DHKey ins:Conor Gallagher (Atlético Madrid, £34.6m), Souza (Santos, £13m)Key outs:Brennan Johnson (Crystal Palace, £35m)West HamNuno Espírito Santo sought to rebalance his squad and began by reinforcing his attack with Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos for a combined £47m package. They have made an early impact but there is concern over West Ham’s struggle to improve their backline. One defender arrived, on deadline day: Axel Disasi, on loan from Chelsea. West Ham, who also added to their wide options by signing Adama Traoré from Fulham, have not kept a clean sheet since August and a bigger focus on the back four was needed. However a lot of attention was devoted to the Lucas Paquetá saga, with the Brazil midfielder eventually forcing through a move to Flamengo. Other squad players also departed.JSKey ins:Taty Castellanos (Lazio, £25.2m), Pablo Felipe (Gil Vicente, £18.3m), Adama Traoré (Fulham, £2m), Axel Disasi (Chelsea, loan), Keiber Lamadrid (Deportivo La Guaira, loan)Key outs:Lucas Paquetá (Flamengo, £36.7m), Luis Guilherme (Sporting, £14.2m), Guido Rodríguez (Valencia, free),James Ward-Prowse (Burnley, loan), Niclas Füllkrug (Milan, loan)WolvesPoor recruitment has been central to Wolves’ demise and their deadline-day business felt like an admission that they are preparing for the Championship. Adam Armstrong signed from second-tier Southampton after the sale of Jørgen Strand Larsen, while Angel Gomes, out of favour at Marseille and keen to get his career back on track, joined on loan with a view to a permanent move. They failed with a bid for Torino’s Ché Adams, another former Saints striker. Wolves went into January aware offloading Strand Larsen suited both parties and while Crystal Palace reneged on their initial agreement to sign the Norway striker and it threatened to descend into a saga, a £48m sale represented a £25m profit on a player who has scored a single top-flight goal this season and signed permanently only last summer. The loan exits of Fer López and Marshall Munetsi, recruited under Vítor Pereira and indicative of the old regime, are a reminder of expensive mistakes.BFKey ins:Adam Armstrong (Southampton, £7m), Angel Gomes (Marseille, loan)Key outs:Jørgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace, £43m), Fer López (Celta Vigo, loan), Marshall Munetsi (Paris FC, loan), Ki-Jana Hoever (Sheffield United, loan)Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeagueArsenalAston VillaBournemouthBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionanalysisShareReuse this content"

For me, the only thing missing from that performance was a goal.View image in fullscreenWatford’s interim manager, Charlie Daniels, took over from Javi Gracia after the latter’s resignation on Sunday.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“From one training session, the response has been really pleasing. They’ve taken on board what we’ve said and what we’ve asked of them and they’ve implemented it. It showed in our performance.”Daniels expects to still be in charge when Watford travel to Southampton on Saturday as a whirlwind week continues. “Luckily, on Sunday, we were in prepping for our under-21s game today against QPR,” he said. “We were actually on the pitch at the time when we got called in.“We went up to see [the chair and chief executive] Scott Duxbury and he informed us that obviously Javi was leaving and we were going to take charge. I don’t really know too much more than that. We say control the controllable.”This fixture was supposed to be played a month ago only to be postponed 18 minutes before kick-off and it saw Watford end Hull’s run ofChampionshipwins since then.A fifth successive victory for the Tigers would have put them within two points of the automatic promotion places, but Sergej Jakirovic was delighted to move within four of the top two. “Perfect point for us,” the Hull manager said.“When you watch everything back, Watford were better on the ball, without the ball. They were very dangerous and we knew it because this is a team with a lot of potential. Powerful, quick, they can make a difference in every part of the pitch.“They missed some chances, good chances, and I cannot complain about this point. Every point is very important in this league and we are very satisfied with one point.”Eiran Cashin’s first goal for managerlessBlackburnwas enough to secure a 1-0 win over bottom-clubSheffield Wednesdayand move out of the Championship relegation zone.After aturbulent few days that saw Valérien Ismaël depart, the on-loan Brighton defender provided much-needed respite by emphatically converting from close range in the 12th minute to ensure Rovers edged a game originally abandoned back in December with the hosts leading.View image in fullscreenEiran Cashin’s close-range finish was enough to see his side run out the winners against Sheffield Wednesday.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PABlackburn were in control for the majority of the contest and Sondre Tronstad struck the woodwork as they set about calming a nervy Ewood Park.

A quiet transfer deadline day at St James’ Park featured swiftly-crushed suggestions that Arsenal were poised to bid for Tonali. There were fears it could be a precursor to a possibly agent-led initiative to move the midfielder this summer.Howe, perhaps fearing a repeat of the debilitating saga that led toAlexander Isak’s departurefor Liverpool in the summer, held talks on Monday with his £55m signing.Ekitiké and Wirtz sink Newcastle before Konaté seals welcome Liverpool winRead moreAsked whether he had uncovered any hidden agenda behind the rumours, he said: “I don’t think so. That would surprise me. But lots of things happen without my knowledge. As far as I’m aware though we’ve got a player that’s an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.“Sandro’s very happy here. He’s got a great relationship with me and his teammates and he seems really, really, happy within himself. I don’t see an issue, but I’m not in control of everything. If I knew where everything [rumours] came from I’d be wiser. But Sandro is absolutely fine. I had discussions with him yesterday. His focus is on the here and now with us.“There’s no issue with Sandro. He’s happy and committed. But our best players will always be attracting glances from other clubs – that’s just the reality of football.”Given that Tonali is contracted until 2029 with an option to extend by a year, he would command a high fee, leaving Newcastle, theoretically at least, in a strong position.The same cannot be said of their hopes of reaching a third Carabao Cup final in four years. The holders travel to Manchester City on Wednesday for the semi-final second leg,trailing 2-0.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe needs his Newcastle team to overturn a 2-0 deficit from the first leg against Manchester City.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA“It will be an almighty challenge,” said Howe, who is again without the injured Bruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley. “But we have to have belief. We have the talent.”Howe could have done with January reinforcements, but said Premier League spending rules left him with no room for manoeuvre. “Financially, it wasn’t possible,” he said. “We are under financial restrictions and had a very limited amount of money available to use this window so we decided to wait until the summer when there’s a lot more players available for potentially better value.“Our squad is OK. If it was a fully fit squad it would be really strong in some areas, but, of course, it’s not, so there’s a bit of an imbalance defensively.”Pep Guardiola has said Newcastle are among six clubs who have to win the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup because their net spend is bigger than City’s over the past five years, although he appeared to be in joke mode. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool are also ahead of City on that list.In January City bought Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guéhi for a total of £82.5m. Guardiola was asked whether the football director, Hugo Viana, deserved particular credit for the signings.“Yeah, really good,” said City’s manager. “I’m a little bit sad and upset because in net spend the last five years we are seventh in the Premier League. I want to be the first; I don’t understand why the club doesn’t spend more money. I am a little bit grumpy with them.“But like we won in the past because we spent a lot, now six teams have to win the Premier Leagues, Champions Leagues and FA Cups because they spent more in the last five years. These are facts. It’s not an opinion. You can say an opinion, like we playgood or bad against Spurs– we can agree or disagree. But they are facts. Good luck to the six teams who are in front of us for net spend for the last five years. Let’s go. I’m waiting. That’s a nice quote, eh.”In the past five years, Manchester United’s net spend is £675m, Arsenal’s £663m, Chelsea’s £651m, Tottenham’s £574m, Newcastle’s £424m, Liverpool’s £420m, and City’s £396m, according toTransfermarkt.co.uk.Guardiola does not believe City will ever shed the tag of having spent their way to success. “No, never ever. Always we live with that. Every time we won it was: ‘Why was that?’ The numbers are the numbers and that is not going tochange.”Guardiola denied he and the players believed there was a conspiracy against City from referees: “Absolutely not. Of course there aren’t meetings between the referees about how they can punish Man City. I’ve never said that.”After City drew 2-2 at Tottenham on Sunday Rodri criticised the decision to allow Spurs’ first goal and other decisions he feels have gone against City recently, saying: “I know we won too much and the people don’t want us to win, but the referee has to be neutral.” It was put to Guardiola that the midfielder had crossed a line. “In that moment you can feel the situations, when you finish the game and go to the interview [you] can be emotional,” he said.Rayan Cherki faces a late fitness test on a knock received during the 2-2 draw at Spurs.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedCarabao CupEddie HowePep GuardiolaManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

A statement from the OWGR board said this “recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out”.LIV and let die: Reed’s return to PGA fold shows why Saudi golf experiment is doomed | Ewan MurrayRead moreSince LIV competition started in 2022, the OWGR has not given any reward to those performing in that domain. This has led to previously prominent golfers tumbling down the rankings; Cameron Smith is now 221st, Sergio García 363rd and Dustin Johnson 662nd. Not happy with an apparent victory of sorts, LIV took aim at the OWGR with a statement of its own: “We acknowledge this long overdue moment of recognition, which affirms the fundamental principle that performance on the course should matter, regardless of where the competition takes place.“However, this outcome is unprecedented. Under these rules, a player finishing 11th in a LIV Golf event is treated the same as a player finishing 57th. Limiting points to only the top-10 finishers disproportionately harms players who consistently perform at a high level but finish just outside that threshold, as well as emerging talent working to establish themselves on the world stage – precisely the players a fair and meritocratic ranking system is designed to recognise.“No other competitive tour or league in OWGR history has been subjected to such a restriction. We expect this is merely a first step toward a structure that fully and fairly serves the players, the fans, and the future of the sport. We entered this process in good faith and will continue to advocate for a ranking system that reflects performance over affiliation. The game deserves transparency. The fans deserve credibility. And the players deserve a system that treats them equally.”LIV’s 2026 season begins against a troubled backdropafter Brooks Koepkaand Patrick Reed chose to exit. Both will make returns to the PGA Tour.Expanding on their process, the OWGR said: “The board’s overriding aim was to identify an equitable way of ranking the best men’s players in the world, including the top performing players in LIV Golf, while taking account of the eligibility standards that LIV Golf does not currently meet and the fact that it operates differently from other ranked tours in a number of respects.“This includes LIV Golf’s average field size of 57 for 2026 versus the minimum of 75 set out in OWGR Regulations; exclusively no-cut events; the restrictive pathways to join LIV Golf with two spots filled from the Asian Tour’s International Series and three from a ‘closed’ promotions event which does not offset the turnover of players exiting the league; self-selection of players with players being recruited rather than earning their place on the tour in many cases and, in recent days, the addition/removal of players to/from teams based on their nationality rather than for meritocratic reasons.”The OWGR added it will “continue to evaluate” LIV’s competitive status.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

Jacob Bethell’s part-timers turned lethal, his three-wicket over dismantling Sri Lanka’s tail to help secure a 12-run win in the third and final Twenty20 international.The tourists put up just 128, their total built by Sam Curran’s 48‑ball 58, a score to which no one else came close. But it proved enough on a worn surface as England’s raft of spinners went to work. And while Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson are the veteran frontliners, this night belonged to Bethell and Will Jacks. The left-armer finished with four for 11, the offie with three for 14 off the full allotment.Harry Brook blocks out the noise to lead England to T20 series win in Sri LankaRead moreBethell completed the job as a surprise death bowler, three strikes in the 18th over followed by the final blow in the 20th, Maheesh ­Theekshana’s slog producing a looping edge to short third. England will enter the World Cup with a clean-sweep victory and five consecutive white-ball wins.Dasun Shanaka’s side will begin their campaign with 10 wins in 23 T20s since the start of 2025, a sense of dysfunction hanging over them. Kamindu Mendis, initially omitted from the squad for these T20s, was included at No 5 for the final match of the series. ­Dhananjaya de Silva, who had batted there on Friday, was ­missing from their final World Cup squad announced on Monday.View image in fullscreenSam Curran struck 58 from 48 balls as England scraped together a total of 128-9.Photograph: Lahiru Harshana/ReutersBen Duckett was a late inclusion for Phil Salt, who sustained a back spasm in the warm-up, and Harry Brook’s decision to bat first meant an early entry for the left-hander. This was his first T20 international since June. He was rested for the series against South Africa and New Zealand, and missed the start of this one with a bruised finger, Salt and Jos ­Buttler re‑establishing their thumping opening partnership in his absence. After all that waiting, though, Duckett lasted one ball, Dushmantha Chameera’s nip‑backer proving fatal. It was the first of six single‑figure dismissals in the England innings.Matheesha Pathirana, bound to thrive at the upcoming tournament, was a parti­cular thrill to watch early on, his low‑arm heat removing Bethell and Brook inside the powerplay. Brook had tucked into the fast bowler two nights previous for three sixes but here he fell to a setup. An 88mph delivery zipped past the nose before a cutter got stuck in the surface – Brook’s prod led to a simple grab at short extra cover. Tom Banton was undone by Dunith Wellalage’s loop, Buttler by Theekshana’s turn. Chameera was excellent, clocking that his leg­cutter was the way to go, bringing him a five‑wicket haul. His dismissal of Jacks left England 60 for six.Chameera accounted for Curran, too, but only after the all-rounder had given England something to believe in. Entering at 34 for four, he pulled the drag-downs hard and opened up at the close. He used his early arrival to advance to his second T20 international half-century.Luke Wood struck in the first over before Pathum Nissanka’s brief fireworks, Sri Lanka finishing their power­play on 46 for two. The key question was how the hosts would tackle Rashid, the leg-spinner having been unpickable at certain points of the tour. Rashid’s leg-break spun big but it was the googly that did for Pavan Rathnayake, trapped lbw on 13. Kusal Mendis, playing his 100th T20, top-edged a sweep off the very next delivery, bowled by Jacks, leaving Sri Lanka 62 for four in the 10th over. We had a game.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell turned the game England’s way, taking four wickets for 11 runs.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APKamindu and Janith Liyanage brought the required rate down to below six, with 39 required and six wickets in hand. But the economical Jacks skidded the ball on to end Kamindu’s innings, and had rhythm from around the wicket as England squeezed, Bethell’s left-arm spin joining in on the fun. Brook wasn’t going to turn back to pace.“Sixteen overs of spin, to do that against a Sri Lankan team in their own country, is an awesome effort,” the England white-ball captain said at the post-match presentation. Liyanage swept to Bethell in the deep for Jacks’s third and Rashid’s tight six left 21 required from the last three overs.Every run turned precious, a boundary to begin Bethell’s third over feeling seismic. But Buttler sprung into action with the next delivery, leaping in front of the stumps to take a low, desperate, one-handed grab. Chameera pushed forward moments later, the ball lobbing to Brook at cover. Shanaka shimmied down the pitch but the turn was too great, Buttler pulling off the ­stumping, England jubilant. There were no more twists to come.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The standalone Grok app was also used to generate sexualised deepfakes.X and xAIannounced measuresto counter the abuses, but several regulatory and legal investigations have followed. The two companies have been approached for comment.The executive director of regulatory risk and innovation at the ICO, William Malcolm, said: “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this.“Losing control of personal data in this way can cause immediate and significant harm. This is particularly the case where children are involved.”GDPR requires that people’s data, including their image, is managed fairly, lawfully and transparently – and that they are informed about how their data is used.Breaches of GDPR can result in a fine of up to £17.5m or 4% of global turnover. X’s revenues are not public, but according to estimates from the market research company eMarketer it was expected to make $2.3bn (£1.7bn) in advertising turnoverlast year, which would equate to a fine of about $90m.Iain Wilson, the managing partner at the law firm Brett Wilson, said: “The ICO’s investigation raises serious questions about the nature of AI-generated imagery and how it is sourced. If photographs of living individuals have indeed been used to generate non-consensual sexual imagery, then it is difficult to imagine a more egregious breach of data protection law.“This is particularly so if the subjects are identifiable or children.”Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers.X is owned by xAI, the developer of Grok, although both have beensubsumed into Musk’s SpaceX rocket businessunder a merger announced on Monday.In a separate statement, the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, said it was not investigating xAI, which provides the standalone Grok app.Ofcom also said its investigation intoXwas still gathering evidence and that the inquiry could take months.The company has taken steps to address the issue and must be given a “full opportunity to make representations”, it said.On why it was not investigating xAI, the statement said not all chatbot activities were covered by the Online Safety Act, the legislation that covers sites such as X. If a chatbot interacts with one individual and no other users, for example, it is not within the scope of the act.Pornography providers, however, are covered by the act, leaving Ofcom with a potential route to widen its investigation. It said it was considering an investigation into whether xAI complied with rules requiring the age-gating of pornographic content.Meanwhile a cross-party group of MPs led by Labour’s Anneliese Dodds has written to the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, urging the government to introduce AI legislation to prevent a repeat of the Grok scandal. The legislation will require AI developers to thoroughly assess the risks posed by their products before they are released.“The scandal would not have happened in the first place if proper testing and risk assessment had been undertaken. This episode shows existing safeguards are not sufficient,” said Dodds.A spokesperson for the department for science, innovation and technology said: “We have strengthened the Online Safety Act so services have to take proactive action to tackle this content. And we will ban the supply of tools designed to create non-consensual intimate images – targeting the problem at its source.”Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXElon MuskInformation commissionerPrivacyData protectionAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

A senior source in the Greek government told Reuters on Tuesday the country was “very close” to announcing a social media ban for children under 15.In Spain, where the government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, promised to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.Sánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.He also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week toregularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.The comments appeared to infuriate Musk, who used a post on X later on Tuesday to call Sánchez “a traitor to the people of Spain”.The Paris raid is part of an investigation launched in January last year into the suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction, which the prosecutor’s office said it had widened to cover complaints about X’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok.It said the alleged offences it was investigating now included complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.Other possible charges included fraudulent data extraction from, and falsified operation of, an automated data processing system by an organised group, and operation of an illegal online platform by an organised group, the statement said.French authorities launched the investigation after the centre-right MP Éric Bothorel filed a complaint alleging that biased algorithms on the platform were likely to have distorted its data processing system and affected the kind of content it recommended.Bothorel complained of a “reduced diversity of voices” and Musk’s “personal interventions” in X’s management since he bought it in 2022. Another complaint said the changes had led to a surge in “nauseating political content”.Prosecutors said in November that they were expanding the investigation to include the behaviour of Grok, which allegedlyengaged in Holocaust denial, advancing false claims commonly made by people who deny Nazi Germany murdered 6 million Jews.The chatbot has since caused outrage by allowing users to “strip” clothed people, including children, in photos through AI image generation and editing. TheEU has launched an investigationinto its production and dissemination of sexualised deepfakes of women and minors.X said in a statement: “We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives.“The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation.“The allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech.”The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation was being conducted as “part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory”.Despite being described as voluntary, the summonses issued to Musk and Yaccarino are mandatory, but they are hard to enforce on people outsideFrance. Afterwards, authorities can potentially place suspects in custody.Europol said it supported the investigation through its European cybercrime centre and deployed a specialist to Paris for the raid. “The investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offences linked to the functioning and use of the platform,” it said.Those included “the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity”, the pan-European policing organisation said, adding that it “stands ready to continue supporting the French authorities as the investigation progresses”.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskFranceEuropeSocial mediaDigital mediaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.I want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.How storms, Alex Pretti and Trump led TikTok to disasterNearly two weeks ago,TikTokstepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.TikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.During the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.Winter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.After days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.TikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.Read more:‘It’s really sad’: US TikTok users rethink app over concerns about privacy and censorshipWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.This week in Elon MuskElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails showTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to roboticsTwo new plays dramatize our anxieties about techView image in fullscreenJune Squibb and Cynthia Nixon in Marjorie Prime.Photograph: Joan MarcusTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.Marjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes:millions of peoplehave digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.Data, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They wereplaying out in headlinestwo days before I attended, andthe Guardian has published stories about them.Data is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.Marjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).Read more:Marjorie Prime review – Cynthia Nixon steals sad, and spotty, sci-fi revivalI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.The central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.The wider TechScapeWhat is Moltbook?

The software company Sage lost 10% in London and the Dutch software company Wolters Kluwer lost 13% in Amsterdam.Shares in theLondon Stock ExchangeGroup fell by 13% and the credit reporting company Experian dropped by 7% in London, amid fears over the impact of AI on data companies.Nasdaq-listed Thomson Reuters’ shares plummeted 18%.“The likes of Relx, London Stock Exchange Group,Experian, Sage, Informa and Pearson were smashed as AI provider Anthropic unveiled a new product,” saidDan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. “The concern will be that, at the very least, the emergence of tools like the one unveiled by Anthropic will reduce the margins these data-driven companies can achieve and, in a worst-case scenario, disintermediate them [remove them as providers] entirely.”The FTSE 100 had hit a record high on Tuesday morning but the sell-off dragged the blue chip index into the red.AI is hitting UK harder than other big economies, study findsRead moreAnthropic said the plugin did not provide legal advice. “AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions,” the startup said.The company also announced a number of other open-source tools to automate a range of professional activities, including sales and customer support.Anthropic was founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei, its chief executive, and other former staff members from OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT.“Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition within the space,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note on Thomson Reuters. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative.”The share price declines deal another severe blow to Nick Train, one of the UK’s most high-profile fund managers, whose firm Lindsell Train has run Finsbury Growth & Income Trust since 2000. The trust’s four largest holdings are Sage, Experian, London Stock Exchange and Relx and its shares fell more than 5% on Tuesday.Train apologised again for the “dire” performance of the investment trust at its annual meeting last month, after surviving a vote on its future. The FTSE 250-listed company is the worst-performing UK equity income trust over one year and five years.The news will reignite fears of job losses caused by the AI boom. Clifford Chance, one of the largest international law firms, said in November it wasreducing the number of business services staffat itsLondonbase by 10%, citing increased use of AI as a factor behind the decision.Along with factory jobs that can be automated, office-based jobs are seen as vulnerable to advances in AI – computer systems that perform cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence.TheUK is losing more jobs than it is creatingas companies adopt more AI tools, and is being hit harder than rival large economies, according to a study by Morgan Stanley.More than a quarter (27%) of UK workers areworried their jobs could disappear in the next five years as a result of AI, a recent survey of thousands of employees showed. It found that British businesses reported an average 11.5% increase in productivity aided by AI. US businesses reported similar gains, but created more jobs than they cut.In his annual Mansion House speech last month, the London mayor,Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobsin the capital. He said London was “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, has also warned that “some jobs will go”, as she announced plans totrain up to 10 million British workers, including members of the cabinet, in basic AI skills by 2030.Lindsell Train and Nick Train have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)PearsonLondon Stock ExchangeSharesInvestingExperiannewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.In the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which hasstruggledwith unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.The town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.View image in fullscreenBarnsley town hall.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.The “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”But one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”Microsoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.View image in fullscreenBarnsley’s ‘tech town’ status means residents will be eligible for free AI training.Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”Ministers have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to bebespoketraining for customers of particular companies such as Google,otherscost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.Ministers have also beenchallengedfor holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”Hannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”Residents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorBarnsleyAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to putdatacenters and solar-powered satellites in spaceas a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.The deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float isexpected to be timed for early summerto coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.Musk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.The announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”Musk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platformXin an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.Both SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed anexpected value of $800bnfor the company.Despitewidespread backlashto xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.Speculation and leaks about the deal,first reported by Reuters,have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.The news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week thatshowed declining revenuesand a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showedMusk exchanging numerous friendly emailswith the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.He called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.Explore more on these topicsSpaceXXElon MuskInternetTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The report is also guided by senior advisers, including Nobel laureates Geoffrey Hinton and Daron Acemoglu.Here are some of the key points from the second annual report, published on Tuesday. It stresses that it is a state-of-play document, rather than a vehicle for making specific policy recommendations to governments. Nonetheless, it is likely to help frame the debate for policymakers, tech executives and NGOs attending the next global AI summit in India this month.1.The capabilities of AI models are improvingA host of new AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were released last year, including OpenAI’sGPT-5, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 and Google’sGemini 3. The report points to new “reasoning systems” – which solve problems by breaking them down into smaller steps – showing improved performance in maths, coding and science. Bengio said there has been a “very significant jump” in AI reasoning. Last year, systems developed by Google and OpenAI achieved a gold-level performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad – a first for AI.However, the report says AI capabilities remain “jagged”, referring to systems displaying astonishing prowess in some areas but not in others. While advanced AI systems are impressive at maths, science, coding and creating images, they remain prone to making false statements, or “hallucinations”, and cannot carry out lengthy projects autonomously.Nonetheless, the report cites a study showing that AI systems are rapidly improving their ability to carry out certain software engineering tasks – with their duration doubling every seven months. If that rate of progress continues, AI systems could complete tasks lasting several hours by 2027 and several days by 2030. This is the scenario under which AI becomes a real threat to jobs.But for now, says the report, “reliable automation of long or complex tasks remains infeasible”.2.Deepfakes are improving and proliferatingThe report describes the growth of deepfake pornography as a “particular concern”, citing a study showing that 15% of UK adults have seen such images. It adds that since the publication of the inaugural safety report in January 2025, AI-generated content has become “harder to distinguish from real content” and points to astudy last yearin which 77% of participants misidentified text generated by ChatGPT as being human-written.The report says there is limited evidence of malicious actors using AI to manipulate people, or of internet users sharing such content widely – a key aim of any manipulation campaign.3.AI companies have introduced biological and chemical risk safeguardsView image in fullscreenAnthropic has released models with heightened safety measures.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersBig AI developers, including Anthropic, have released models with heightened safety measures after being unable to rule out the possibility that they could help novices create biological weapons. Over the past year, AI “co-scientists” have become increasingly capable, including providing detailed scientific information and assisting with complex laboratory procedures such as designing molecules and proteins.The report adds that some studies suggest AI can providesubstantially more helpin bioweapons development than simply browsing the internet, but more work is needed to confirm those results.Biological and chemical risks pose a dilemma for politicians, the report adds, because these same capabilities can also speed up the discovery of new drugs and the diagnosis of disease.“The open availability of biological AI tools presents a difficult choice: whether to restrict those tools or to actively support their development for beneficial purposes,” the report said.4.AI companions have grown rapidly in popularityBengio says the use of AI companions, and the emotional attachment they generate, has “spread like wildfire” over the past year. The report says there is evidence that a subset of users are developing “pathological” emotional dependence on AI chatbots, with OpenAI stating that about 0.15% of its users indicate a heightened level of emotional attachment to ChatGPT.Concerns about AI use and mental health have been growing among health professionals. Last year, OpenAI was sued by the family of Adam Raine, a US teenager who took his own life after months of conversations withChatGPT.However, the report adds that there is no clear evidence that chatbots cause any mental health problems. Instead, the concern is that people with existing mental health issues may use AI more heavily – which could amplify their symptoms. It points to data showing 0.07% of ChatGPT users display signs consistent with acute mental health crises such as psychosis or mania, suggesting approximately 490,000 vulnerable individuals interact with these systems each week.5.AI is not yet capable of fully autonomous cyber-attacksAI systems can now support cyber-attackers at various stages of their operations, from identifying targets to preparing an attack or developing malicious software to cripple a victim’s systems. The report acknowledges that fully automated cyber-attacks – carrying out every stage of an attack – could allow criminals to launch assaults on a far greater scale. But this remains difficult because AI systems cannot yet execute long, multi-stage tasks.View image in fullscreenAI systems can now support cyber-attackers.Photograph: Dmitry Molchanov/AlamyNonetheless, Anthropic reported last year that its coding tool, Claude Code,was used by a Chinese state-sponsored group to attack 30 entities around the worldin September, achieving a “handful of successful intrusions”. It said 80% to 90% of the operations involved in the attack were performed without human intervention, indicating a high degree of autonomy.6.AI systems are getting better at undermining oversightBengio said last year he was concerned AI systems were showing signs of self-preservation, such astrying to disable oversight systems. A core fear among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.The report states that over the past year models have shown a more advanced ability to undermine attempts at oversight, such as finding loopholes in evaluations and recognising when they are being tested. Last year, Anthropic released asafety analysisof its latest model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and revealed it had become suspicious it was being tested.The report adds that AI agents cannot yet act autonomously for long enough to make these loss-of-control scenarios real. But “the time horizons on which agents can autonomously operate are lengthening rapidly”.7.The jobs impact remains unclearOne of the most pressing concerns for politicians and the public about AI is the impact on jobs. Will automated systemsdo away with white-collar rolesin industries such as banking, law and health?The report says the impact on the global labour market remains uncertain. It says the embrace of AI has been rapid but uneven, with adoption rates of 50% in places such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore but below 10% in many lower-income economies. It also varies by sector, with usage across the information industries in the US (publishing, software, TV and film) running at 18% but at 1.4% in construction and agriculture.Studies in Denmark and the US have also shown no impact between a job’s exposure to AI and changes in aggregate employment, according to the report. However, it also cites aUK studyshowing a slowdown in new hiring at companies highly exposed to AI, with technical and creative roles experiencing the steepest declines. Junior roles were the most affected.The report adds that AI agents could have a greater impact on employment if they improve in capability.“If AI agents gained the capacity to act with greater autonomy across domains within only a few years – reliably managing longer, more complex sequences of tasks in pursuit of higher-level goals – this would likely accelerate labour market disruption,” the report said.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingCybercrimeInternetTechnology sectorexplainersShareReuse this content"

Wrong!I don’t understand.Well, if you want to do a dump dinner properly, then the first thing you need to do is cover your entire dining table in tinfoil.I don’t like where this is going.And then you tip whatever you’ve been cooking all over it. No plates. No serving dishes. Just the fat wet slop of food on table.This cannot possibly be a thing.And yet it is.

Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?Sam WollastonTue 3 Feb 2026 11.08 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 11.12 ESTShareIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is aCornwallthe summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”We’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”That’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.View image in fullscreenA former china clay mine near St Dennis that is now Cornish Lithium’s site for hard rock lithium extraction.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know,possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.Most of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.Jeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.Cornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”View image in fullscreenA derelict former mine building in the Gwennap area, Cornwall.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He foundedCornish Lithiumin 2016.Wrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”He explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects inPortugalandSerbiahave been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists.In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?Wall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”View image in fullscreenLabelled core samples from deep boreholes at Cornish Lithium’s geothermal site near St Day.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”The curse of ‘white oil’: electric vehicles’ dirty secretRead moreI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.On cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.View image in fullscreenScientists analysing old core samples at Cornish Lithium’s geothermal site.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.When he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”Morse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”Things have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”View image in fullscreenA sample of lithium-bearing Cornish rock.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”Cornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”We have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.About 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.View image in fullscreenMachinery at Cornish Lithium’s hard rock extraction site.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”In this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.The water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”It sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.View image in fullscreenThe view to United Downs from Gwennap.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian‘The part of Cornwall nobody ever sees’: the hi-tech future for lithium and tin miningRead moreBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.Since they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”Explore more on these topicsMiningPollutionLithium-ion batteriesCornwallRenewable energyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He played an early role in shaping the ethos and self-conception of the Silicon Valley elite. Brockman did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.In 2019, tech critic Evgeny Morozov, who was for a time represented by Brockman, called him “a true ‘organic intellectual’ of the digital revolution, shaping trends rather than responding to them”, and said that in the networks that he created, “billionaires, scientists, artists, novelists, journalists, and musicians all blend together to produce enormous value – for each other and, of course, for Brockman”.The events detailed in the emails took place in fine dining establishments on North America’s west coast, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Long Beach, California. Although the guests at exclusive Edge dinners were trumpeted after the events, emails show that attenders advised Brockman ahead of time to maintain secrecy and exclusivity: “No room for anyone else. Please cooperate by maintaining radio silence.”Media reports and non-profit tax filings indicate that through various charitable foundations, Epstein contributed $638,000 to Edge from 2001 to 2015, making him by far its largest funder, and in some years its only donor.Epstein’s connection with andfunding of Edgethrough 2011 has beenpreviously reported on, including his attendance at events, which Edge publicized on its website prior to his imprisonment for sex crimes.The emails provide the first details of his ongoing connection to Edge and the other members of its network past that year.‘Interested in backing this year’s event?’Epstein is listed as a guest or sponsor at several Edge events in the early and mid-2000s, prior to his conviction.In February 2004, for example,he attendedthe annual “Billionaires’ Dinner” alongside the likes of Page and Brin, Bezos, Pierre Omidyar and Vanity Fair journalist and subsequent Trump biographer Michael Wolff.Newly released files shed new light on Chomsky and Epstein relationshipRead moreIn 2006, according to the website, and also before Epstein’s conviction,Edgeconvened a conferencefor a “group of cosmologists, experimentalists, theorists, and particle physicists” including the late Stephen Hawking on the Caribbean island of St Thomas.The conference was led by physicist Lawrence Krauss, who in 2018retired from Arizona State Universityafter a finding that he hadviolated the school’s sexual harassment policy. The conference included “a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event”.Epstein’s 2008 conviction and sentencing for procuring an underage girl for prostitution received extensive contemporaneouslocal,nationalandinternationalcoverage, as did the details of his offenses againstaround 40 of his victims.International scandals quickly emerged around Epstein’s connections with powerful and wealthy individuals includingAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor,Bill ClintonandBritish government ministers.Epstein was released on 22 July 2009, placed on a year of probation and house arrest until August 2010, and registered as ahigh-risk sex offenderin New York, which meant that his name and photograph were publishedin an online registry.Nevertheless, in an email sent on 5 June 2009, while Epstein was still serving his sentence, John Brockman sent him anemailasking if he would sponsor an Edge master class to be held in Los Angeles that summer. The message to Epsteinasked: “JE, Interested in backing this year’s event??”Available tax records do not indicate whether Epstein offered specific support for that event. And while he is not listed among the attenders, other emails revealed that he did attend several subsequent Edge events at which his presence was not publicized by the organization.Billionaires’ dinnersFor several years after his release, Epstein was invited to and attended Brockman’s dinners and workshops along with leading lights in tech and the arts, according to the emails. The new emails show that while his Edge connection was no longer publicized, his conviction as a sex offender had little effect on his ability to move among Silicon Valley’s billionaire elite.On 28 February 2011, Brockmansenta reminder for the annual billionaires’ dinner, to be held on 1 March at L’Opera restaurant in Long Beach, California. (Like all the dinners, it piggy-backed on that year’s Ted conference.)Besides Epstein, those listed as attenders the day before the dinner included Musk and his then-partner Talulah Riley, Bezos, Brin, Gates, Mayer, Williams, former Microsoft CTO and bestselling cookbook author Nathan Myhrvold, and musicianPeter Gabriel.Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so farRead moreNone of those attenders responded to a request for comment. Edge’swebsite retrospectiveshows all those listed in attendance at the dinner except for Jeffrey Epstein.On 28 February 2012, Brockmansenta reminder to Epstein for that year’s annual dinner, to be held that night at the Sky Room private dining room in Long Beach, again timed to coincide with the Ted conference that year.His email began: “JE – there are 20 chairs and 21 guests in a small room. Please show up alone. JB.”Besides Epstein, guests listed included the now deceased Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Brin, Williams and Myhrvold.After the event, other guests were featured and photographed in thewebsite retrospective. Epstein was not.Itineraries indicatethat Epstein attended Ted events in Long Beach in both 2012 and 2013, though it was not clear at the time of reporting whether he attended the annual dinners. In 2013, according to an email,Elon Muskinvited him to lunch either at SpaceX on a tour or after his Ted talk.On 25 February 2014, Brockmansentan emailed invitation to the annual dinner, to be held that 17 March in Vancouver, British Columbia, to recipients including Epstein, Allen, Bezos, Brin, Page, Gates, Mayer, Musk, Myrhrvold and Omidyar.Epstein’s assistantconfirmedhis attendance at the dinner in an email to Brockman on 6 March 2014. Epstein’s attendance was not publicized on thewebsite retrospective, but it did show other attenders including Bezos, Brin, Page, Allen (who died in 2018) and Gabriel.On 18 March, following the dinner, Epstein wrote to Brockman, “your goyim dinner was amazing, . thank you very much for including me. where are the jews. ?” Later, on 15 February 2018, Epstein assistant Lesley Groffsenta copy of an invitation list for the 2014 dinner sent by Brockman ahead of the event to Epstein lawyer Darren Indyke.In April 2014, heinvited Epsteinto “our annual EDGE London dinner on Tuesday night”, adding, “This is usually a fun dinner” and “The London Edgies are incredibly bright and have ideas too big for a 3″ smartphone screen. They also know how to enjoy a party.”On 29 October 2014, Brockmanreached outto Epstein directly to remind him of an Edge event comprising “a one day/and dinner event on Monday December 8th in Palo Alto”.He wrote that he and his wife and business partner, Katinka Matson, were “inviting the Digerati, i.e., the usual guests at our Annual Dinner”. Confirmed guests according to Brockmanincluded Page and his wife, Lucinda Southworth; Musk; Twitter co-founder Williams; and 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki.Epstein’s assistant, whose name is redacted in the email,replied: “I have in Jeffrey’s calendar and will of course remind him of the Dec. 8th event!”Scandal re-emergesIn January 2015, the scandal around Epstein re-emerged with a vengeance when a victim, later revealed to be Virginia Giuffre,alleged in a court filingthat Epstein had repeatedly forced her to have sexual relations with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.On 28 February 2015, Brockman sent Epstein an invitation for that year’s 18 March dinner in Toronto during that year’s Ted conference at a private dining room.Epstein apparently turned this invitation down, writing on 28 February, “how are you. I wont be there this year. will be in santa fe, with chomsky and group.” (Linguist and political activistNoam Chomskywas a prominent Epstein associate, and the financier owned a sprawling ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico.)On 24 June, Brockman invited Epstein to a “Superforecasting” masterclass centered on the work of University of Pennsylvania professor Philip Tetlock.The same day, Epstein replied: “last year, at the last minute the women said no epstein. . am i going to have the same issue again. no problem as you know. i am not sensitvie, but … ”On 27 May 2015, Lesley GroffremindedEpstein of the RSVP on the 29th.The same day, Brockman sought to reassure Epstein in a manner suggesting that he was fully aware of the scandal enveloping the financier.Theemailbegins: “In terms of women, I don’t see a problem with this list,” adding: “but I can check with two phone calls.”He continued: “None of the guys who have accepted should have a problem. Fyi, Kahneman is ok. I should check with Tetlock.” (The Guardian asked Tetlock whether he was aware at that time that Epstein was a potential attender, of his 2008 conviction, whether Brockman had contacted him to “check” on Epstein’s attendance, and whether he had any other business or philanthropic contacts with the financier. He responded: “I understand the need to ask – and the answers to all four questions below is ‘no.’”)Brockman’s email went on: “If anything, the only people might [be] the corporate guys I’ve yet to hear from. I could see the founders of the big companies unhappy if they got the Prince Andrew treatment by the press in terms of photos and reportage.”He concluded: “The only reporters are Markoff and Andrian Kreye (who you met) both friends who should be able to cover the event without mentioning you. Only one person to date has a blog.”John Markoff, a New York Times tech reporter, does not appear to have written any contemporaneous stories related to the Superforecasting event. Markoff told the Guardian: “I just looked through my mail and I have no correspondence with Brockman in 2015 about a Tetlock Master Class.”Andrian Kreye wrotean articlefor German outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung that discussed Tetlock’s work in general terms without mentioning his attendance at the Edge event or Epstein.Kreye told the Guardian: “I do remember Tetlock‘s masterclass in California, but was not aware that Epstein had been invited. He wasn’t there that weekend. John Brockman didn’t mention any limits or demands concerning the reporting. Everything was on the record.”The emails do not indicate whether or not Epstein finally attended the event.On 28 February, Brockman sent Epstein aninvitationto that year’s iteration of the annual dinner, once again at the Blue Water Cafe in Vancouver.On 9 February 2016, EpsteintoldGroff to RSVP yes to Brockman’s invitation to that year’s annual dinner, and on 15 February, GroffforwardedEpstein a detailed Vancouver itinerary that included his attendance at the dinner and the annual Ted conference.It’s not known who else attended the dinner. By 2016, Brockman appears to have stopped circulating full guest lists of invitees, and ceased publishing retrospectives on the website.FavorsIn the following years, Brockman continued to tap Epstein for networking and favors, according to the emails.In October 2016, he sent anemailto Epstein copying in notable AI “doomer” Eliezer Yudkowsky, writing: “Jeffrey, meet Eliezer! Nice to hear from you today. Eliezer: you were the highlight of the weekend!”In 2018, the year before Epstein’s death,Brockman sent Epstein anemailreferencing “your friend in the Middle East” who was “coming to the US tomorrow and is reportedly going to buy 10% of Endeavor for $400m”. That year, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, visited the US as the country’ssovereign wealth fund sought to invest $400min the US talent and events company.He told Epstein: “He may be able do a lot more for his people (while spending less) by acquiring Brockman, Inc”, pitching an “ancillary benefit: The net worth of the 40 guests at my 2014 ‘billionaires dinner’ was equal to combined wealth of 60% of all Americans.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinSilicon ValleyElon MuskJeff BezosLarry PageSergey BrinEvan WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, average electricity prices over thepast yearhave risen by about 6.7%, while natural gas prices have increased by 10.8%. Energy prices are influenced by many factors beyond any president’s direct control, including market conditions, weather-driven demand, regional infrastructure constraints and the rapid growth of energy-intensive datacenters that are driving new system costs. Policy choices do not determine prices on their own, but they do shape market outcomes, and the direction of this administration’s energy policy has been clear.From his first days in office, President Trump made clear that his energy agenda would prioritizefossil fuel producersover consumers. His administration moved to expand USliquefied natural gasexports, increasing exposure to volatile global markets. At the same time, itfroze wind power projectsthat provide some of the cheapest new electricity, intervened to keepcostly coal plantsrunning, and backed the elimination ofenergy-efficiency tax creditsthat lower household energy bills.The administration also proposed cutting theLow Income Home Energy Assistance Programand theWeatherization Assistance Program, the federal government’s primary tools for protecting low-income households from rising energy costs even as electricity and gas prices were climbing. Congress ultimately blocked those cuts, sparing millions of families from immediate harm.Supporters claim these policies promote “energy independence”, but increasing reliance on global fuel markets while dismantling the lowest-cost sources of new domestic power and demand reduction does the opposite. The outcome is predictable: higher prices, greater volatility and protected fossil fuel profits, with households – especially low- and moderate-income families – left to pay the price.The result is that energy is becoming increasingly unaffordable. For example, we are projecting that home heating costs will increase by9.2% this winter, more thanthree timesthe rate of inflation, driven by higher electricity and natural gas prices and colder-than-average weather.These increases may be an inconvenience for higher-income households, but for low- and middle-income families they are devastating. Millions of households that were getting by are now being driven into utility debt and toward shutoffs because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm. Polling confirms the reality on the ground: nearlyone in fourhouseholds now say their energy bills are unaffordable.Energy use does not rise in proportion to income, meaning energy costs take up a far larger share of household budgets at the bottom than at the top. As prices increased between 2024 and 2025, that imbalance widened: forlowest income households(less than $30,000), the share of income spent on home energy rose from 9.4% to 9.9%, while moderate-income households saw a smaller increase, from 4.9% to 5.1% ($30,000 to $58,000). For the highest-income households ($156,000 plus), the change was barely perceptible, edging from 1.2% to 1.3%.These outcomes are not inevitable features of energy markets. They reflect policy choices that raise system costs, weaken efficiency and affordability programs, and shift risk on to households least able to absorb it. As a result, utility arrears have climbed sharply alongside higher energy prices, rising from $15.4bn at the end of 2021 to an estimated$23bn in 2025, largely driven by increasing electricity bills. If current trends continue, arrears could reach roughly $28bn in 2026, as higher energy costs compound broader inflation in essentials such as rent, food and medical care.The solution is neither complicated nor ideological. If the goal is lower energy bills, policy must focus on lowering system costs and reducing household exposure to price volatility. That means prioritizing the cheapest resources available: energy efficiency, weatherization, and renewable power that lowers demand and stabilizes prices. It means expanding existing tax credits that help families improve the efficiency of their homes and install rooftop solar, permanently reducing electricity and natural gas use. And it means protecting households from short-term price spikes through targeted bill assistance, rather than forcing families to absorb the shock.These are not untested ideas. States and countries that have leaned into efficiency, renewables, and consumer protections have achieved lower long-term costs and greater price stability. The tools exist, and the economics are well understood.What is missing is political will. An administration that claims to stand with consumers cannot continue to write energy policy for fossil-fuel producers and expect a different outcome. Lower energy prices will not come from propping up high-cost power plants, dismantling clean energy, or exposing households to volatile global fuel markets. They will come from policies that reduce demand, increase competition, and put consumers first.Mark Wolfe is executive director of NationalEnergyAssistance Directors Association, co-director of the Center on Energy Poverty and Climate and adjunct faculty at the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy at George Washington UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionEnergyClimate crisisRenewable energyUS politicsFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content"

Time to refocus on the horrific mistreatment of women and girls, and the role of these ghoulsTue 3 Feb 2026 09.28 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareLike a lot of women, I do vaguely care about the latestpolitical implosion of Peter Mandelson– but I think we’re all massively more obsessed with the fact that there really was a network of incredibly famous and powerful men trying to help a known ex-con minimise and wave away his underage sex crimes. Amirite, ladies? Sure, I’m crying my eyes out about some Gordon Brown adviser having his asset-sale memoforwardedin 2009 … but at the same time I’m a whole lot more concerned about the actual Sex Bilderberg. Which, even now, our eyes seem to keep being conveniently dragged away from. Can we refocus?We are, naturally, talking about the Jeffrey Epstein files. Since the latest lotdropped, I’ve been collating the emails from extremely famous men who actively sought to help the since-deceased underage sex trafficker trivialise his crimes in the years after his jail release in 2009. Richard Branson, Noam Chomsky,Steve Bannon, Mandelson, Andrew (obviously) – all of these men offer strategic advice, or media training, or chummy solidarity. Or, in the case of Chomsky, all of the above plus a drive-by on the notion of female victimhood. According to text signed under his first name that Epstein sent to a lawyer and publicist in February 2019, months after the Miami Herald had run anexplosive series of articleslaying out the scale of Epstein’s serial underage sexual abuse and the perversion of justice that covered it up, Chomskysneered at“the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women”. Wow. Never mind Manufacturing Consent – have a read of Not Giving A Shit About Consent. I thought Chomsky cared about power and exploitative elites? Still, nice photo of him laughing it up with Steve Bannon.No 10 asks police to investigate Mandelson’s leaks to Epstein due to concerns over ‘market sensitive information’– UK politics liveRead moreLet’s move on to Richard Branson. Here is Britain’s Best Loved Businessman TM in 2013, opening bysaying to Epstein: “would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” (“Virgin Group has clarified that ‘harem’ referred to three adult members of Epstein’s team and stated Branson would not have used the term or had contact if he knew the full facts.” More on the full facts he should have been abreast of shortly.) Then it’s on to helping Jeffreydownplay his sex crimes, three years after he’s finished doing time for them. “I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you’ve been a brilliant adviser to him, that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17½-year-old woman … ” – his sentence was for soliciting prostitution fromgirls as young as 14, Richard, but go on – “… and have done nothing that’s against the law since, and yes, as a single man you seem to have a penchant for women. But there’s nothing wrong with that.” Thanks, Sir Nice Guy!You know, almost every time I’ve ever written about Richard Branson over the years, he or one of his lackeys has written in to the Guardian to whine about it, andoften got the letter printed. This time, I’m actively begging him to get in touch. Come on, Richard – write in and tell us why you didn’t bother Googling why your friend with the best lawyers out there still got an 18-month prison sentence, and had, at the time of that email,settledmany widely reported civil lawsuits brought against him by victims? I’ll save you a space on the letters page.There are so many big hitters in Epstein’s circle that we could be hours off the wholly absent Jeff Bezos starting a hashtag: #notallbillionaires. These days, the thing about Epstein’s many, many powerful friends is that if they ever break cover about their appearance in the files – and how terrifyingly quiet they’re all being – they tend to say they had no idea about his crimes. And yet, if one of your friends or my friends went to jail for a year, even if they told us it was a big old mistake/little local difficulty, we’d Google what it was all about – right? So imagine being as worldly as Richard Branson/Elon Musk/Peter Mandelson/Steve Bannon/Bill Gates and thinking that a billionaire with billionaires’ lawyers in the malleable US justice system ends up in jail in Florida because of some fit-up. Do me a favour. All those men know the world doesn’t work like that – and didn’t in this case, with Epstein gifted an incredibly controversialsecret plea deal.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Steve Bannon and Noam Chomsky released from Epstein files.Photograph: House Oversight CommitteeThe only person I can believe was too stupid to have used a search engine was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. But then I think he knew what had gone on in “other ways”. There isn’t space today for the further exposure in the latest document dump of Andrew’s naked lies aboutcutting ties with Epstein. The fact is – they all knew what Epstein went to prison for. They overlooked it. As evidenced by their continued association with him, it wasn’t remotely a big deal to them.The other chilling part is imagining how these guys talked if this was the kind of thing they were willing to commit to email. “Send me a number to call,” Epsteinsaysto film producer and New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch at one point in an exchange about “working girls”: “I don’t like records of these conversations.” We know Bill Gates was very close to Epstein, but doesn’t seem (thus far in the file dumps) to have committed that camaraderie to email. Maybe he too thought it wiser to talk on the phone.In unrelated news, Ghislaine Maxwell will appearbefore Congress next week, where perhaps she’ll expand on herrecent claimthat four co-conspirators and 25 men made “secret settlements” related to the Epstein case, but were not indicted.But so many silences remain deafening. It’s like JD Vance, vice-president for shitposting, said in 2021: “Remember when we learned that our wealthiest and most powerful people were connected to a guy who ran a literal child sex trafficking ring? And then that guy died mysteriously in a jail? And now we just don’t talk about it.” He was on the warpath back then. “If you’re a journalist and you’re not asking questions about this case you should be ashamed of yourself. What purpose do you even serve?” Hmm. As a journalist who has been asking questions on this case for at least 11 years: who’s not talking about it now, JD? Though obviously not involved himself, Vance is in a position to illuminate much more than has been illuminated. So draw your own conclusion as to what purpose he is serving.They all sell out women in the end. So yet again, it’s being left to the victims. Twenty of the Epstein survivors recentlyreleased a statementsaying that information about them was included in the latest file release, “while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected”. That is the dark heart of this – yet even now we’re looking the wrong way. I keep hearing frantic commentary about what this means for Keir Starmer, for Fergie, for Mandelson’s peerage, whatever. How about the biggest and grimmest question of all: what it means for women and girls to be able to clearly see that we live in a world where so many of the richest and most powerful men alive are just not botheredenough by their exploitation. Or worse.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They were wrongTue 3 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 12.58 ESTShareRecent exercises in taking stock after one year of Trump 2.0 – for many an eternity of terrifying news and political traumas – tended to leave something out: the fact that, a mere 12 months ago, plenty of pundits (and politicians, for that matter) were instructing us to accept that a global “vibe shift” in favor of the righthad taken place. And that, in the face of what supposedly“felt” like a landslide,resistance was pointlessand “cringe”.Well, it doesn’t feel like that today. But understanding why observers not generally in the pro-Trump propaganda business rushed to portray the spirit of the age as effectively far-right is important. A way of thinking occasionally dubbed “reactionary centrism” plays an important role; it could yet again become influential in hindering or at least holding up post-Trump radical reforms which US democracy desperately requires.Consultant and political communications specialistAaron Huertascoined the expression “reactionary centrism” in 2018. The basic idea is that self-declared moderates claim equally to oppose extremes on the right and on the left – but hard-hitting criticism is reserved almost exclusively for the left (partly, perhaps, because the presumed audience is expected to already know how bad things are on the right).This perceptive observation was inadvertently vindicated in thousands of columns that contributed to amoral panicabout “wokeness” and “identity politics”. It convinced readers that, sure, Trump was horrible, but what was happening “on campus” (translation: anecdotes from one or two elite places, endlessly recycled) was also putting US democracy in peril.The point is not that what progressives do must never be criticized; the point is that the relentless drive to find fault with both sides equally results in a sense of (false) equivalence among those taking cues from supposedly trustworthy centrists.This dynamic may well have not made a difference in the election outcome in 2024. But it certainly made it easier to see that election outcome as confirmation of the reactionary centrist diagnosis of everything supposedly wrong with Democrats. Trump’s victory had to be understood as a legitimate “backlash” against “overreach” by the left – a story about what-caused-what thatobservers outside the USkeep repeating as it helps push their own anti-left agendas.Never mind that Kamala Harris did not take any bait from Trump to emphasize her own “identity”; never mind that she ran on socioeconomic promises (however tepid) and warnings about what Trump would do to democracy and the rule of law (as we now know, the most dire warning turned out to underestimate the regime).The other iron law of reactionary centrism – beyond the asymmetry that is hiding behind the seeming evenhandedness – is thatonly the left and liberals really have agency. The right just reacts – everything is always backlash, never a self-generated political project. As a result, it takes a while to wake up to the reality that, for instance, Stephen Miller’s ethnic cleansing project is self-generated, and not only a response to “legitimate grievances” about border security.Today, a reflexive position in the middle makes little sense in a completely asymmetrical political landscapeMany liberals, after the double shock of Trump and Brexit in 2016, confessed their supposed mistakes and performed contrition, along the lines of: we failed to pay attention to the “left-behind”; we must book political safaris in Appalachia; we must closely study Hillbilly Elegy to demonstrate compassion for the heartland. Of course, self-criticism and checking one’s priors is a good thing. But behind the ostentatious displays of “we failed to listen” was also a profound narcissism: if only we acted (or at least talked) differently, all would be well. Only liberals, or so the assumption goes again, have agency; performing contrition reinforced that flattering image.Even worse, this narcissism keeps shoring up the right’s claim that there is a “real America” and thatonly they speak for it. As any viewer of Sunday-morning shows has noticed, Republicans can malign city dwellers without anyone batting an eyelid; Obama saying something about guns and religion in rural areas triggers a multiyear scandal. It would not even occur to anyone to demand an apology from GOP members for insulting all urban dwellers. The asymmetry is taken for granted; liberals just accept it. This is what victory in a culture war looks like: Democrats accept the cultural framings enforced by the other side, even though polls would suggest that the liberals’ positions are often more popular (or, dare one say, reflect more about “real America” than the far-right fantasies pushed by Fox and its far-right friends).Centrismis not in and of itself illegitimate. But its defenders should ask themselves hard questions about what it can possibly mean in 2026. In the 20th century, it was important to position oneself against fascism and authoritarian state socialism simultaneously. But today, a reflexive position in the middle – for the middle must by definition be reasonable – makes little sense in a completely asymmetrical political landscape: you are under no moral obligations to become a fan of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, but to equate them with Trump (or say they are worse, asWall Street leaders have done) means contributing to the destruction of democracy.By the same token, a centrism that might be called procedural – the imperative being to always seek compromise – is not necessarily nefarious; in fact, it is the very ethos that the functioning of our political system, with its separated powers, requires. But today, only one side ever lauds “bipartisanship”, whereas the other uses legitimate power to the max and often goes beyond.The Joe Biden years were accompanied by a chorus of “don’t overdo it”.

That theDemocratsthus far have failed to create this oppositional political center of gravity may be because the method has been lost to history, not wielded effectively for 113 years. Focused on theICEoutrages, however, this political instrument can be revived in the 16 states where the Democrats control the governorships and both chambers of the state legislatures, as well as introduced in states with mixed power.Before the enactment of the 17th amendment in 1913, state legislators and not the voters selected US senators and regarded them frequently as their agents. It was a common practice for legislatures to send what were called “orders of instruction” urging senators and sometimes members of theHouse of Representativesto take a particular stand on important issues. The orders were not binding, but had significant force given the power of legislatures and political parties to decide who would holdSenateseats. These resolutions were variously called instructions, petitions and memorials.The resolutions were not incidental toUS politics. The practice of instructing senators was taken up by the antislavery movement beginning in the crisis over the admission of Missouri as a slave state in 1821. Northern state legislatures intervened with resolutions in the 1830s instructing members of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives to protest the gag rule by which the southern congressional leaders suppressed antislavery petitions. On the other side, slave states passed resolutions condemning abolitionists and favoring suppression of antislavery literature. After the Mexican War, northern states passed resolutions urging the prohibition of slavery in the territories through a measure called the Wilmot Proviso, which never passed. Congressman Abraham Lincoln voted in favor of it numerous times and declared himself a “Proviso Man”. That idea became the central platform of the new Republican party on which Lincoln was elected in 1860.Today, state legislative resolutions would have far more political weight than any poll, provide a galvanizing mechanism to drive public opinion, and solidify the states as defenders of basic American rights seeking to safeguard constitutional freedoms and the safety of electoral processes. State resolutions would expose the brazen hypocrisy of theTrump administrationas it tramples on the formerly sanctified principles of states’ rights and free speech, and as Trump poses a clear and present danger to free and fair elections in 2026 and 2028.Beware of ‘anti-woke’ liberals: they attacked the left and helped Trump win | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreUsing such resolutions, the state legislatures could organize debate within the legislatures, stage public hearings with witnesses and experts, hold legislative votes that forceRepublicanson the record, conduct signing ceremonies by governors, and send delegations for formal presentations to the Congress. The process would command both local and national media attention, especially since the Democratic-controlled states are among the largest ones and include the media capitals in New York and California. And states could either have varied resolutions or coordinate their language.Since the beginning of Trump’s second term theDemocratshave been operating from a defensive position within the Congress where they are perpetually frustrated as a minority. They have few if any levers of power. They cannot call committee hearings, subpoena witnesses or administration documents, or set the legislative agenda.Meanwhile, though lower courts have ruled overwhelmingly in state and city suits against Trump’s draconian tactics and policies, the conservative majority on the supreme court has relegated many of those decisions to a legal twilight zone through the “shadow docket” often without offering the slightest rhyme or reason. Their deliberately long-delayed rulings allow Trump the impunity to impose his authoritarian and unconstitutional methods without obstruction.The supreme court engages in a pantomime of judiciousness to serve as Trump’s knowing partnerOf 25 Trumpemergency applicationsin 2025, the supreme court conservatives have ruled in Trump’s favor to stay 20 cases, seven of which without any written explanation. “Trump’s challengers have a 60% win rate in the nearly 240 orders issued by federal district courts,” reportedCourt Accountabilityon cases through October 2025. “Trump’s challengers have a 59% win rate across just over 90 orders issued by federal circuit courts … Trump has a 90% win rate in the 23 Supreme Court orders included in our analysis. Virtually every case was decided on the Court’s so-called shadow docket.” In effect, the supreme court engages in a pantomime of judiciousness to serve as Trump’s knowing partner.State resolutions should not be understood as making a merely symbolic gesture. The politics would be a significant mobilizing factor in the Democratic midterm strategy in elections to the House, the Senate and state legislatures.In states with aDemocratic trifecta(where Democrats control the governorship and both legislative chambers), there are 659 Republican state legislators. Within these Democratic states there are also 38 Republican members of the House, most of them in swing districts. Forcing the Republican state legislators to vote on ICE would place them in a political vise between the intransigent Maga base and the majority of the electorate. This existential predicament would envelop Republican House members as well.Republican candidates for the Senate would also be confronted to come on the record in states with mixed control. In three states where Senate seats are contested – Michigan, Minnesota and Alaska – Democrats control one of the legislative chambers. In two – Michigan and Minnesota – Democrats hold the governorships.In Pennsylvania, the Democrats control the governorship and the state house of representatives, while the Republicans control the state senate by a narrow margin of 27 to 23 seats. Democrats need to flip three of those state senate seats in 2026 to gain control with the Democratic lieutenant governor casting a tie-breaking vote. Four seats are potentially vulnerable. In the US House, Republicans precariously hold four seats from Pennsylvania in highly competitive swing districts, three of which were decided in 2024 by 1, 1.3 and 1.6 points. So far, Republicans on every level in Pennsylvania have been servile before Trump on ICE. Popular Democratic governor Josh Shapiro will run a strong race that will extend down ticket in Pennsylvania.Hispanic voters are a significant share of voters in four Pennsylvania swing congressional districts, ranging from 20% in the seventh congressional district to about 7% in the 10th. These voters were crucial to Trump in carrying those districts and the state in 2024 by a slender 1.7% – and with that barely electing a number of wobbly Republican House candidates. Trump increased his vote from 27% of Hispanics in Pennsylvania in 2020 to 41% in 2024. Now 71% of Hispanics nationally disapprove of Trump, according to aPew polltaken in January before the killing of Alex Pretti. Though there is no statewide poll in Pennsylvania, the national trend is reflected there.In Michigan, three competitive US House seats with sufficient marginal Hispanic voters that could tip them to the Democrats are currently held by Republicans – in the fourth, seventh and 10th congressional districts. In Michigan, Trump won 27% of Hispanics in 2020, which he increased to 46% in 2024. Trump won the state by only 1.3 percentage points. Like everywhere else, his gains have washed away.In Arizona, a Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, presides over a house with a 33 to 27 Republican margin and a senate with a 17 to 13 margin. To flip both chambers, Democrats are targeting seven state house and six state senate seats held by Republicans. Two Republican-controlled US House seats are also highly competitive. In those districts the Hispanic vote ranges from 10% to 30%. According to an Equis Researchpolltaken back in September 2025, 35% of the new Trump Hispanic voters in 2024 already disapproved of his performance. Arizona Hispanics in general were profoundly anxious about ICE: 80% were concerned about ICE school raids, 67% were worried about arresting immigrants without criminal records and 66% were concerned about targeting immigrants at courthouses. The sentiment that ICE abuses have aroused has combined with an overwhelming sense of betrayal on the economy to foster a combustible anti-Trump feeling.For decades, rightwing Republicans have systematically suppressed immigration reform, determined to stoke a divisive issue for partisan advantage rather than to find a solution. They defied President George W Bush in order to defeat a comprehensive bill. On 15 May 2006, Bush delivered a special address to the nation on behalf of the legislation. “Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant, and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree,” hesaid. “It is neither wise, nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation.” Thebipartisan billco-sponsored by senators Edward M Kennedy and John McCain passed the Senate with 62 votes, including 23 Republicans. But the right wing controlled the Republican House and killed it.President Barack Obama revivedimmigration reformin 2013. Once again, the bill passed the Senate, this time with 68 votes. But, again, pressure from the Republican right in the House forced the bill to die without ever being brought to a vote on the floor, where it likely would have passed.In 2024, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell negotiated a bipartisan agreement with Joe Biden to present a border security and immigration reform bill tied to a foreign aid package. Donald Trump feverishly called senators to threaten them if they voted for it. The Republicans immediately bent to his will and abandoned McConnell. On 6 February 2024, the bill died without a vote. “Why? A simple reason: Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it’s bad for him politically,”saidBiden. Trump would “rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it”.Throughout his campaign, Trumpdemonizedimmigrants – “poisoning the blood … animals … not humans … bad genes” – and even spread a fable that they were supposedly “eating the dogs and eating the cats” in an Ohio town. Once in office, Trump launched a draconian and violent offensive under the whip of his sneering deputy Stephen Miller. Trump built up ICE into a massive paramilitary domestic force to deploy against immigrant communities in Democratic states and cities. If there is one issue that defines his nationalism, his quest for racial purity and his authoritarian rule, it is nativism. ICE is the boots on the ground of his vision.On 15 June 2025, in aTruth Social post, Trump made clear that his ICE operations were the tip of the spear of a political strategy: “[W]e must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State … ”For years, Republicans rebuffed President George W Bush, Senator John McCain and majority leader Mitch McConnell to be able to cling to the immigration issue as a partisan life raft. Trump made possible his resurrection from the political dead by destroying legislation to resolve the question and instead to incite fear and loathing of immigrants. When he was inaugurated, it was his most popular issue. Now, however, after setting loose ICE, his handling is about as unpopular as his flailing economic policy. ANew York Times/Siena pollreleased on 23 January found 63% disapproved of ICE, 61% believed ICE tactics have “gone too far”, only 26% said they were “about right”, while 11% said they had not gone far enough. Trump’s strongman thuggery has become his glaring weakness.What might the Democratic statements look like? They could avoid the trap of discussing abolishing ICE, instead advocating its proper limitation that would defang it. They could restore the old bipartisan consensus on how to treat undocumented people that the Republican right has reflexively rejected. They could finally set Democratic politics on the rock of constitutional principle.Here is suggested language that covers a range of the territory:The state legislature hereby urges the representatives and senators to the US Congress from this state to take appropriate measures to secure the enactment of a federal law which expressly provides that no federal funds may be authorized, appropriated, or used in any way to carry out police activity by any person working for or at the direction of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Authorized ICE activities shall be limited exclusively to measures to secure removal of undocumented persons only in violation of federal criminal law.Persons who have secured or applied for asylum, are in the process of securing naturalization, or are qualified for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) as defined as those who have arrived in the US before age 16, lived here since 2007, or have met education or military service requirements, are exempt. ICE agents shall have no authority to violate the fourth amendment, which protects all people within the US against the invasion of their home or seizure of their property without obtaining legal warrants from Article III courts. ICE agents shall not be permitted to use so-called administrative warrants to evade obtaining proper and legal warrants from Article III courts. ICE agents shall have no authority to interfere in any way with lawful protests and assemblies of citizens, or with the public recording of their activities. The Department of Justice shall not inhibit the exercise of freedom of speech and of the press. ICE agents shall be forbidden from deployment on any day on which votes may be cast under applicable state or local law in any state, city or municipality.Trump, of course, would react by issuing ultimatums to the Democratic states to back down, threaten them with budget cuts and coerce Republicans to oppose any statements. But the political consequence would only be a more sustained and intense focus on his attempt to create a police state and redound against Republicans.Trump has based his ICE assaults on the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was part of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Under the Sedition Act, dissenting newspaper editors were prosecuted and imprisoned, just as Trump’s Department of Justice hasarrested the journalist Don Lemon, while Trump’s ICE paramilitaries surveil protestors and have killed two US citizens, whom officials instantly designated “domestic terrorists”.When the early United States faced internal attacks on democracy, including the Alien Enemies Act, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “A little patience, and we shall see the reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolve, and the people, recovering their true sight, restore their government to its true principles … If the game runs sometimes against us at home we must have patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of winning back theprincipleswe have lost, for this is a game where principles are at stake.”Flexing the power of state legislatures now offers a golden opportunity for “winning back theprincipleswe have lost”.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to the Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The regime has lost its footing, and the global mechanisms to avoid conflict no longer workDr Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeTue 3 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 09.18 ESTShareForty-seven years on from the Iranian revolution,Iranis confronting a strategic reality it has never faced before – a simultaneous crisis of domestic legitimacy and a credible threat of external attack so severe that regime survival can no longer be taken for granted. Until now, Tehran has survived wars, sanctions, assassinations, mass protests and international isolation through a strategy of projecting strength abroad, repressing dissent at home and generating a permanent crisis to justify poor leadership and political failure.Today, Donald Trump has mobilised an “armada” to the Middle East that includes theUSS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, guided-missile destroyers, an expanded air presence and missile defence systems. This force projection suggests the US is no longer focused on containing Iran but rather compelling a final resolution of a long-running conflict. The choice at hand is either the acceptance of a US-imposed settlement or the destruction of the Islamic republic as it exists today.Trump’s actions during his first term as president included abandoningthe 2015 nuclear deal, reimposing sweeping sanctions and the assassination of Quds Force commanderQassem Suleimaniin 2020, and foreshadowed a new approach towards a longstanding adversary. Now back in office, he seems intent on completing that project by forcing Tehran to either accept a deal on American terms or confront military strikes aimed at dismantling the regime itself.For Iran, this is an unprecedented moment. Not since 1979 has the regime faced serious threats to both its legitimacy at home and its ability to deter enemies abroad at the same time. Inside the country, the system is exhausted. Years of economic decline, corruption, currency collapse and mass emigration have hollowed out the social contract. The protests since 2017, including the“Woman, Life, Freedom”uprising in 2022 and the mass demonstrations of the past month showcase a society that no longer fears the state. Protesters have grown bolder and angrier, even as the cost of dissent has risen sharply. In fact, the January crackdown was the most violent in the regime’s history, with more than 6,000 people confirmed dead and a further 17,000 recorded deaths still under investigation.Externally, Iran has lost its footing, and its regional projection of power has crumbled. Since 7 October, Israel’s systematic campaign against Iran’s so-called axis of resistance has steadily eroded Tehran’s sense of security. Through open airstrikes across the region and in Iran itself, high-level targeted assassinations and cyber-operations culminating inlast summer’s 12-day war,Israel has moved its shadow war into the open and, in doing so, has actively pushed Iran towards a direct confrontation with the US.View image in fullscreenAn F/A-18E Super Hornet launching from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, 28 January 2026.Photograph: Zoe Simpson/US Navy/EPAAt the same time, Iran has created the conditions of its own vulnerability. Its effort to build influence through militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen was meant to deter attack by raising the cost of war. Instead, it has created multiple points of exposure. Its nuclear brinkmanship, once a source of leverage, has become the main justification for international pressure. And its revolutionary ideology, once a tool for mobilisation, now leaves it increasingly isolated in a region that has grown tired of ideological conflict.The question looming for the days ahead is not whether confrontation will occur, but what form it will take.The first scenario is forced compromise. Under intense pressure, Iran accepts a deal that limits its nuclear programme, allows intrusive inspections, places constraints on its missile capabilities and reduces its regional role, in return for sanctions relief and perhaps eventual US investment in the country. This may prevent immediate war, but it would come at a heavy political cost. Such an agreement would be seen inside Iran as a bargain for the sake of the regime’s survival.The second scenario is controlled war. The US would coordinate strikes against the Iranian leadership, missile forces, air defences and remaining nuclear infrastructure, seeking to cripple the regime. This would probably trigger Iranian regional escalation ranging from attacks on US bases, shipping lanes and Israeli cities, and maybe even some proxy mobilisation across the Gulf. The goal in this scenario would be regime transformation, but the outcome would certainly unleash prolonged instability, elite fragmentation and a violent struggle over future leadership.The third scenario is uncontrolled collapse. Under combined external pressure and internal unrest, the regime fractures, producing not liberal transition but a power vacuum. Competing security factions, economic breakdown and regional intervention could turn Iran into a long-term source of instability conjuring up images of Libya and Syria that would produce an outcome more perilous than the regime it replaces.Calls grow in Iran for independent inquiry into protest death tollRead moreIn all three scenarios, the outcome is dangerous for the Iranian people. Whether through forced compromise, limited war or regime collapse, none of the likely paths ahead point toward immediate stability or democratic transition. Moreover, all sides – Israel, the US and Iran – are locked into a logic of escalation over restraint.This is what makes the current moment so dangerous. There are no real diplomatic brakes left. The systems and mechanisms that previously kept conflict contained no longer function. Europe has no role left to play in mediating with Iran. Russia is distracted by its war in Ukraine and reluctant to invest in any off-ramps. China is cautious and unwilling to lead. Regional states are trying to intercede and manage last-ditch diplomacy, but they are also bracing for the impact.For Iran, and for the Middle East more broadly, the question is no longer whether the crisis can be defused, but how much damage will be done before it finally runs its course.Dr Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Alas, the Reserve Bank listened to the noise and felt compelled toraise the cash rate to 3.85%, but one wonders if they listened more to the noise of the commentariat than the data.InTuesday’s announcement, the RBA monetary policy board barely changed anything from itsDecember statement.In December the board thought: “While inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it has picked up more recently”. Now it says: “While inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it picked up materially in the second half of 2025.”‘We never would have bought’: Australian mortgage holders feel the pain as interest rates rise againRead moreThat is a weird statement given that we have had two inflation releases since then – the one for November showed 0% inflation and the December one had 1%, but all that was due (asI noted last week) to holiday travel (ie the Ashes).There was, however, one very interesting new addition to the RBA’s statement on Tuesday. The board noted: “More recently, the exchange rate, money market interest rates and government bond yields have risen following a rise in market expectations for the cash rate.”It’s hard not to read that as the RBA saying: well, the speculators expected us to do it, so I guess we better.And over the past month the odds of a rate increase on Tuesday changed rather dramatically.Early in January there was almost no prospect of a rate rise after the October inflation figuresshowed an unexpected dip in inflation. In December, the governor of the RBA, Michele Bullock,told the mediathat “the balance of risk to inflation had tilted a bit to the upside”. But even with these words hovering over everything, the market only gave about a 20% chance of a rate rise.This all changed on 22 January. And rather oddly the reason it changed was not due to any new data on inflation, but on unemployment.On 22 January theDecember unemployment figureswere released, showing a large drop in unemployment to 4.1%. That massively changed the outlook for a rate rise, and last week’s latest inflation figuresdidn’t really have anywhere near the same impact:If the graph does not display click hereThe reason low unemployment drove speculators to bet that the RBA would raise rates is because the bank is very loud about suggesting that the labour market is “tight”. This is economic speak for there being too few people unemployed. Some economists (and everyone working for the RBA, it seems) worried about this because they believe it means employers will have to raise wages in order to attract and keep workers.And if wages start going up faster, then so too, they argue, will inflation.Thus, the low unemployment and the higher-than-expected inflation figures had some economists absolutely salivating for a rate rise. One in The Australian suggested the RBA needed to raise rates to “restore” Bullock’s “lost credibility”. Good thing economic commentators never have to worry about lost perspective.And so the RBA raised rates and suggested they needed to do so because “growth in private demand has strengthened substantially more than expected, driven by both household spending and investment.”Well, about that … As readers will recall, that surge in investment wasalmost all in AI datacentres. But even apart from the fact they are not great employers, private demand remains pretty weak:If the graph does not display click hereAnd let us also look at the fall in unemployment:If the graph does not display click hereUnemployment has now been below 4.5% for more than four years – long enough to argue that itshouldbe below that as a matter of course.But in December, there was an oddly large 0.2 percentage point drop in unemployment.In the past 48 months a drop of that size has now only happened three times. Once in 2022 when the effects of the pandemic saw unemployment fall quickly for almost a year. The other time was in February 2024, when the rate fell from 4.1% to 3.7%, Funny thing though: by April the rate was back up to 4.1%.At this point, no one has any real clue if unemployment in January and February is going to stay low or bounce back up. However, as I noted last week – the fact that job vacancy numbers seem to be falling suggests a rise in unemployment is the more likely outcome.At any rate, are we seeing any signs of wages taking off?The most recent wage price data is only up to September (the next figures come out in a couple of weeks). But here we see absolutely no signs of wages galloping upwards:If the graph does not display click hereHeck, in December the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, was banging on about how real wages were falling – ie that wages were growing slower than inflation. He was right: in the September quarter real wages fell, and over the past year they were flat.If the graph does not display click hereBut apparently a time when wages are growing slower than inflation is also a time when we need to raise interest rates in order to keep wages down.Make it make sense.The RBA failed to do so, and instead succumbed to meeting the desires of speculators and those who think more unemployment is a good thing for the economy.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaGrogonomicsAustralian economyInterest ratesInflationCost of living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

See that for what it isTue 3 Feb 2026 05.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 08.06 ESTShareIsrael’s official and unofficial spokespeople are in damage control mode after a senior military official admitted last week that Israelaccepts the death tollpublished by Gaza’s health ministry, which currently stands at more than 70,000. This comes after two years in which Israel and its supporters took every opportunity to disparage and dismiss the health ministry’s figures, arguing that they were overblown or fabricated by Hamas.That prestigious list of repudiators, to namejust a few, includes spokespeople for Israel’sgovernmentandmilitary, then-US presidentJoe Biden,US Congress, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) chiefJonathan Greenblatt, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and any number of talking heads at influential thinktanks and policy centres. Adding credibility to their denials were prominent media outlets around the world that often described Gaza’s health ministry as “Hamas-run”, thereby encouraging readers and viewers to treat the death toll with suspicion.In truth, the reliability of the official death toll should never have been in doubt. For one thing, the UN hasindependently verifiedthe accuracy of the health ministry’s figures after each of Israel’s previous bombardments of Gaza going back to 2008. For another, the data published by the health ministry since 7 October isextremely detailed: it includes a full name, date of birth, gender and ID number for all victims whose deaths were confirmed either by hospital morgues or by their relatives.Naturally, mistakes were made amid the intensity of an Israeli onslaught thatvirtually destroyedGaza’s entire health system, but these were remarkably few and promptly rectified:Sky News foundlast year that entries in the death toll list with missing or invalid ID numbers dropped from 2,769 in early April to just 313 by the end of July. As such,severalexternalinvestigationsof the published data found that it stood up to scrutiny.Back in January 2024, my colleague Yuval Abrahamreportedthat Israel’s military intelligence agencies had evensurveilled health ministry personnelin Gaza to check whether their data was accurate; upon finding that it was, they subsequently began using it in internal intelligence briefings. “In every status briefing, when everyone updates each other on what’s happening, there’s a slide that shows the current number of civilians killed in Gaza. And that’s based almost exclusively on the Hamas health ministry,” an intelligence source told him.Yet still the denials continued, for two whole years. And even now, the Israeli army came out quickly after last week’s reports toclaimthat “the details published do not reflect official IDF data” – despiteIsraeli media outletsclearly stating that this is what they were told by a senior official in a private briefing.So are we about to see a wave of mea culpas, or at least a modicum of self-reflection, from all those who peddled the line that the death toll was not to be trusted? Don’t bank on it. In fact, some of them already appear to beshiftingthegoalposts, arguing that while the overall death toll of 70,000 may be accurate, what actually matters is the ratio of civilians to militants among them, which they claim is comparatively low for urban warfare.Throughout the war, Israeli leaders have cited a civilian casualty ratio as low as1:1, or, more recently,1.5:1, and now theyallegethat militants account for as many as 25,000 of Gaza’s dead. But these claims, too,fall apartunder basic scrutiny.To understand why, you need only consider whom the Israeli army defines as a militant. After invading the strip in late 2023, the army began establishing militarised areas that it referred to as “kill zones” with arbitrary and often invisible boundaries, inside which they would automatically kill any Palestinian who entered, including children – andretroactively label themas terrorists. (Thiscurrently includesthe roughly 60% of Gaza’s territory that the Israeli armystill occupiesdespite the ceasefire.)The Guardian view on Trump’s Board of Peace: an international body in service to one man’s ego | EditorialRead moreAnd the army’s own data proves it. Last August, +972 magazine (where I am deputy editor) and the Guardian published ajoint investigationrevealing the existence of a classified Israeli intelligence database that maintains updated information on the status of every Palestinian in Gaza whom, through a combination ofmass surveillanceandAI algorithms, Israel suspects to be a militant belonging to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to data we obtained from this database in May last year, Israel had killed fewer than 9,000 militants at a time when the health ministry’s overall death toll stood at 53,000.The database, therefore, indicated that 83% of Gaza’s dead were civilians, pointing to a civilian casualty ratio with few parallels in modern warfare that adds further weight to accusations of genocide levelled atIsraelby the UN, human rights groups and leading genocide scholars. (The army stated in response that “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without denying the existence of the database and without specifying which data it disputed.)And that’s if we’re going by the health ministry’s figures, which do not include theroughly 10,000bodies still thought to be under the rubble; nor do they include “indirect” deaths from starvation, disease, hypothermia andtreatable health conditions, whichoften exceed“direct” deaths in war zones. Indeed,variousscientificstudiesconducted throughout the war have estimated that the true death toll from Israel’s onslaught may in fact have gone well beyond 100,000.While we won’t know for certain how high the death toll since 7 October really is until Israel stopsbombing Gazaand preventingthe localandinternational mediafrom being able to report freely across the strip, there is one thing we can be sure of: the climate of denial regarding the health ministry’s figures helped Israel keep slaughtering Palestinians en masse with impunity.Ben Reiff is deputy editor at +972 magazineDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’ve lucked out in this golden age of streaming shows, and so have theyTue 3 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareShrinking, the TV series about Jason Segel’s Jimmy, a grieving psychotherapist who can’t stop telling patients what he really thinks,seems pretty innocuous on paper. FromFrasiertoIn TreatmenttoSex Education, there’s no shortage of TV dramas about dysfunctional therapists. What marks Shrinking out from the crowd is the presence of Harrison Ford, who plays Jimmy’s octogenarian mentor. Here we see a Hollywood megastar getting high on edibles, wrestling with his failures as a father and trying to keep a lid on his Parkinson’s symptoms. Though Segel shares top billing with Ford, the latter is the main draw and gets all the best lines.Paramount’s 1923, showrunner Taylor Sheridan’s prequel toYellowstone, similarly draws on Ford’s elder statesman status as it depicts a ranching family’s efforts to maintain their wealth and status during the Great Depression. Ford’s co-star is Helen Mirren, another octogenarian actor who previously appeared with him in the 1986 film The Mosquito Coast. Set in Montana, 1923 is a classy drama that makes high art of its protagonists’ craggy features along with their penchant for brutality.So what should we make of the elders of cinema plying their trade on the small screen? In years gone by, the stars of Old Hollywood would have balked at moving into TV. To do so would have been a sure sign their career was on the rocks, though Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Collins both shrugged off the snobs in the 1980s when they joined the casts ofThe Thorn BirdsandDynastyrespectively. Collins became a bigger star as Dynasty’suber-bitch Alexis Carringtonthan she’d ever been as a twentysomething under contract at 20th Century Fox starring in films such asLand of the PharaohsandThe Opposite Sex. Conversely, Charlton Heston’s toe-curling turn on Dynasty spin-off The Colbys had the opposite effect, all but killing off his career. After that, the actor stuck to comedy cameos andNRA rallies.Today’s TV landscape clearly looks different for Hollywood stars wishing to branch out, offering more variety and, for the most part, a better class of drama than of yore. Think of Meryl Streep,who appeared inthe 2019 second series of Big Little Lies and, later on, gleefully hitched a ride on the hit Hulu comedyOnly Murders in the Building. Or Gary Oldman, who has playedDraculaandChurchillon the big screen, as an ageing spook in need of a wash inTV’s Slow Horses. Or Kathy Bates playing the septuagenarian attorney in Matlock, perpetually underestimated because of her age. Or Sly Stallone making his TV debut as aveteran mobster in Tulsa King, another series from Taylor Sheridan. In fact, Sheridan, who recently cast Kevin Costner and Billy Bob Thornton in Yellowstone and Landman, seems to be on a one-man mission to lure veteran male actors out of retirement.Big stars, little interest: when movie heavyweights fizzle on TVRead moreFew of these ageing stars could be accused of slumming it in what are mostly big-budget productions, even if they have a job on their hands getting noticed in the age of too much telly. There’s little sense of them dining out on past glories, either. When Jeff Bridges, big-screen star of The Fisher King and The Big Lebowski, was persuaded back to TV to play an elderly ex-CIA agent who struggles to put his socks on in the mornings, it was for FX Networks’ unequivocally titledThe Old Man. In Shrinking, Ford is required to lean into his elderly status and depict his character’s struggle with his encroaching infirmity. Compare that to the 2023 Indiana Jones rebootDial of Destiny, where, aged 80, he reprised his whip-cracking, stunt-happy action hero.That meaty TV roles are being written specifically for oldsters can only be good news – it’s certainly an improvement on putting them out to pasture in late middle age, as Hollywood was wont to do until recently – but currently it is still men getting the lion’s share of these parts. In acting, as in life, ruthlessageism has always disproportionately affected women, a situation expertly lampooned in Amy Schumer’s sketchLast Fuckable Day, in which three actors – Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette – celebrate one of their number’s last day of being “believably fuckable” in the eyes of the entertainment industry.Another factor driving the acting old guard to look to TV for work is that the movie industry is still feeling the financial hit of Covid-19 and the 2023writers’ and actors’ strikes. Budgets remain tight and megahits are now few and far between – last year,Snow White,Mickey 17,Christy,After the Huntand the Dwayne Johnson vehicleThe Smashing Machineall bombed at the box office. Meanwhile, viewers have the option of waiting until the big movies turn up on streaming services, which is sometimes a matter of days after the cinema release.Little wonder, then, that older actors want in on TV, where they can be seen by those viewers unwilling to drag themselves to the multiplex and where they can spend time developing complex characters. Meanwhile, the shows in question get gravitas, experience and star quality in return. Right now, there is much to be gloomy about in the creative industries, but this is a golden age for the pensionable actor for whom fresh glories and a third act beckon.Fiona Sturges is an arts writerExplore more on these topicsTV streamingOpinionHarrison FordMeryl StreepJeff BridgesUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

That’s why he’s facing a perfect stormOwen JonesThe Greens are buoyant as Labour struggles. After shredding any semblance of a progressive agenda, fear of Reform is all the PM’s party has leftTue 3 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 05.47 ESTShareLabour’s soul is being laid bare in the Gorton and Denton byelection campaign. Insofar as the party’s masters have had a coherent political strategy, it is this: defineLabouragainst the left, and compete with the right for votes. If the left is squealing or the Daily Mail is cheering, goes the thinking, Labour must be on the right track.Being forced to compete with the left was never part of the plan. Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, “doesn’t have room for compromise with the hard left”, as aformer associate put it, believing “they need to be eradicated from the party because they are so dangerous.” It’s as though the Starmerites assumed that once the left was vanquished inside Labour, it would simply vanish from politics altogether.They did not anticipate a leftwing insurgency in the form of Zack Polanski’s Green party. In Gorton and Denton – where Laboursecured half the votein 2024 – the party is haemorrhaging support to Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK and to the Greens. But it is the Green candidate, the charismatic local plumber Hannah Spencer, who is nowthe bookies’ firm favourite.That should hardly make the Greens complacent. The party has shared with me its latest doorstep data, based on 1,899 conversations in the constituency, that puts them on 34%, behind Reform on 39%, with Labour languishing on 21%. This chimes with theclaimfrom the Times’ Patrick Maguire that Reform’s internal polling places the Greens second. This is a complex, diverse constituency, making precise extrapolation difficult. But one thing is unmistakable: Labour’s left flank is bleeding heavily.Green campaigners believe Labour has miscalculated by presenting itself as the only viable alternative to Reform. This was meant to be a safe seat, after all, and such frantic positioning only makes sense if loyal voters have already peeled away. “Everybody is so fed up with Labour’s only strategy being ‘vote Labour to keep the Tories out’, and now it’s ‘vote Labour to keep Reform out’,” Spencer tells me. “It’s like: how about you actually just do something to make people voteforyou?”But fear of Reform is all Labour has left, because offering concessions to the left is anathema to Starmerism. More than a decade ago, Tony Blair made clear that his hostility to a more progressive agendawas principled, not simply tactical. “I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform,” he said. “Even if I thought it was the route to victory, I wouldn’t take it.”This mentality dominates today’s Labour. According to this worldview, demands to clamp down on migrants and refugees are “legitimate concerns” that must be heeded and acted upon. Those who do not prioritise them are dismissed as out of touch or contemptuous of ordinary voters. By contrast, support for increasing taxes on the rich or public ownership, or opposition to arming Israel’s genocide are afforded no such legitimacy. Instead, such views are branded fringe – even evidence of political extremism.Last August, the pollsters Persuasion UK identified thekey faultlinein British politics. It found that 44% of voters blamed “the rich and wealthy business elites and the politicians who let them get away with things” for Britain’s problems, compared with 38% who blamed “immigrants and asylum seekers and the politicians who let them into the country”.Given Labour was founded to represent workers, you might expect it to channel the former. Instead, Starmer’s faction is bitterly opposed to redistributing wealth and power. Recall when it courted wealthy businesspeople, such as former Tory donorJohn Caudwell, who approvingly declared that Starmer had “taken all the left out of the Labour party” and replaced it with values “in complete alignment with my views as a commercial capitalist”.Many ofStarmer’s alliesare former business lobbyists. As the revolving door between Blair’s government and the private sector demonstrated, Labour ministers and aides will rationally understand that politics offers a springboard to lucrative careers in industries such asprivate healthcareordefence.That is why Labour is so comfortable competing with Reform and the Tories over bashing migrants. It is not because Starmerites are instinctively xenophobic or racist. Most are urban middle-class professionals who find such sentiments distasteful. But if forced to choose, they would rather indulge anger directed at migrants and refugees than anger aimed at bankers and CEOs.Hence Labour’s willingness to introduce one of Europe’s harshest asylum systems, while rejecting awealth tax. It is why it will attack the benefits of people withmultiple sclerosis or cancer, yet oppose awindfall taxon bank profits. “Tough decisions”, in this lexicon, mean stripping support from those already struggling – never confronting entrenched interests.Whether the Greens can win Gorton and Denton will depend on their ability to mobilise enough campaigners in a seat where Labour can traditionally weigh the vote. Such a triumph would be Labour’s worst nightmare for a reason. It would expose its refusal to offer a genuine alternative to a broken economic order not as hard-headed pragmatism, but as a deliberate ideological choice.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsByelectionsOpinionLabourKeir StarmerZack PolanskiGreen partyManchesterGreater ManchestercommentShareReuse this content"

It should be a source of joy and communityTue 3 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 06.22 ESTShareSpain makes the best ham in the world, and a multitude of incredible pork-based dishes. You have your crunchy, saltytorreznos de Soria, fried cubes of pork belly, which make for a fantastic bar snack. Orcochinillo asado, a suckling pig that’s traditionally roasted in a wood oven, and so tender that it’s cut with a plate instead of a knife when serving. For the more adventurous, I recommend exploring the world of regionalmorcillasor blood sausages.Morcilla de Burgos, made with rice and on the harder side, keeps its structure very well and makes an excellentpintxowhen sliced and fried. Or there is the moist and spreadablemorcilla de León, which my local butchersells in jars. Another to look out for is the Basquemorcilla de Beasain– made with leeks, it combines fantastically with black beans, cabbage and pickled green chillies to make one of the tastiest stews you’ll ever have.At the pinnacle, you have the gastronomic and cultural phenomenon that isjamón ibérico. It is distinct from lesser forms of jamón as it comes from the famed Iberian pigs, the best varieties of which are fed on acorns. You’ll see whole legs of it hanging in bars and restaurants across the country, and they’re a staple of the Spanish Christmas hamper, often raffled off by bars to their regular customers. Its standing in Spanish culture transcends the food world: Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz met while filmingJamón Jamón, in which the former beats his love rival to death with a leg of ham. Meanwhile, lower-league football side CD Guijelo’s away kit sees themdressed as a plate of the stuff. It finds its way into Spain’s public festivities, such as the Lance al Jamón in the walled city of Morella, where participants have to climb its walls and grab a leg of hamhanging from the ceiling. The contestant able to hang on the longest gets to keep it.View image in fullscreenCD Guijuelo players in their second kit, 2016.Photograph: César Manso/AFP/Getty ImagesFor all the happiness it brings to people, jamón also has a darker history and it is one that is threatening to re-emerge in our present culture wars.The esteemed place jamón holds in Spanish culture has been used as a tool for social exclusion. The persecution of heretics during the Spanish Inquisition, beginning in 1478 and lasting almost four centuries, particularly targeted Christian converts from Judaism (conversos) or Islam (moriscos), who continued to practise their religion in secret. The consumption of jamón became a symbol of Catholic identity and therefore a huge part of Spanish public life. But it was also a way of excluding those who did not eat pork on grounds of their faith.As a way of getting around it, morisco and converso families would hang sausages in their houses. Indeed, some people speculate that this is how the practice of hanging sausages and hams in Spanish bars and restaurants started. Others would even cook ham that they had no intention of eating, so that the smell from their houses would waft to neighbours or passersby. The slaughter of pigs became the basis of many popular festivals, a number of which continue today, and the families who did not take part would immediately come under suspicion.This has left a lasting impact on Spanish cuisine. “Because of the Inquisition,” wrote food science expertJM Muletin his 2023 book Comemos lo que Somos (We Eat What We Are), “most Spanish traditional dishes contain ham or are cooked in its fat like there’s no tomorrow”. It’s a legacy that goes beyond food and is at the heart of Spanish culture. The second sentence of Don Quixote mentions the dishduelos y quebrantos, comprising scrambled eggs, chorizo and torreznos. It literally translates as “grief and sorrows” – and while its meaning is disputed, a popular interpretation is that this refers to aconverso’s internal strugglewith having to eat ham to avoid suspicion of heresy.I’m not sure how widely understood the Inquisition’s legacy on the Spanish diet is, but seeing history repeat itself is a sign that the past has not been fully reckoned with. So while I’m not here to stop anyone from enjoying their favourite foods or traditions, I’d like to sound a note of warning. Jamón eating is once again being weaponised online as a means of social exclusion among the young Spanish far right against those from Muslim and north African backgrounds.Last November, a content creatormade national newswhen he shared AI-generated viral posts showing shirts and phone cases made from jamón. The posts even featured a superhero called Ham-Man, who would, he said, protect people from being mugged by illegal immigrants of “Maghrebi and north African origin”. And it risks becoming a wider trend. Even before Ham-Man, the comment sections beneath Spanish news articles and videos about crimes committed by young, racialised men elicited dog-whistle phrases such as “¿come jamón?” (does he eat ham?).This memehas been popularfor a number of yearsamong the Spanish far right as a way to persecute Muslim immigrants.When prejudice like this is allowed to go unchallenged in the form of social media memes and reels, it inevitably spills over into real life. After Spain won Euro 2024, a video went viral of a group of fans chanting “Lamine Yamal come jamón” (Lamine Yamal eats ham). This references the north African and Muslim background of the young superstar of the national team, despite him being born in Barcelona. “He’s one of our own” is a popular sentiment in football chants – but I struggle to think of one as perverse as this.You can be born in Spain, score thegoal of the tournamentthat wins the semi-final and provide the assist for the opening goal in the final – and yet for some Spaniards, the Inquisition hasn’t ended. For those looking to divide and exclude, ham is still a weapon of choice, half a millennium later.Abbas Asaria is a food writer and chef based in MadridDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He and its writer/director Bart Layton talk midlife angst, imposter syndrome – and Alzheimer’sTue 3 Feb 2026 11.14 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShare‘It’s like a therapy couch,” saysChris Hemsworth, as he takes a seat on a chaise longue in the London hotel room where we’re meeting. He laughs, but it quickly becomes clear the Australian actor is more than ready to examine his life and the image he has long presented to the world.AsThor, the God of Thunder, Hemsworth has come to embody a certain idea of masculinity: invulnerable, assured, unshakeable. The role, which spanned nine films, put him up among the world’s highest paid actors and made him a global pin-up. Yet the confidence was, in part, a construction. “The character you see in interviews,” he says, easing into the chaise longue, “and the presentation of myself over the last two decades working in Hollywood, it’s me – but it’s a creation too. It’s what I thought people wanted to see.”In his new lead role in Crime 101, director Bart Layton’s cool procedural thriller, Hemsworth plays a different kind of character. An action figure, certainly, but one whose inner world is defined by doubt and vulnerability. “I felt quite exposed in this role,” the 42-year-old says, as Layton sits next to him. “I wasn’t able to hide behind a vocal quality or posture the way I could with Thor and these larger characters. It was about doing the opposite.”When Hemsworth was first cast as Thor, he says he was “far more uncomfortable and goofy” than he was willing to present. Behind the scenes, he was dealing with severe performance anxiety and panic attacks, but the physical transformation helped him feel less intimidated. Training his body, lowering his voice, inhabiting a more imposing posture, he felt able to occupy the space. “I felt like, ‘OK, cool, no one can fuck with me.’ Playing a god became a safety net. It fooled people into thinking I was that confident, that certain.”View image in fullscreenA certain idea of masculinity … Chris Hemsworth in Thor: The Dark World.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“When I met you,” Layton says. “I was expecting a very different kind of human, who was more classically alpha. And what you find is someone who’s really thoughtful and sensitive and insecure in the way we all are.”It was these qualities that Hemsworth had to tap into for Crime 101. Based on a 2020 novella byDon Winslow, the film is about Mike Davis, a gentleman jewel thief whose string of heists along Route 101 have mystified police. When he plans the score of a lifetime, his path crosses with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) and a dishevelled detective (Mark Ruffalo), forcing each to confront their own existential crises.The film, which also stars Barry Keoghan as Davis’s rival and Monica Barbaro as his love interest, is a neo-noir love letter to Los Angeles, and evokes cinematic thrillers such as Michael Mann’s Thief and Heat, as well as The Thomas Crown Affair and The Getaway, both of which star Steve McQueen, Davis’s hero in the film.“We talked about all the movies we grew up with,” says Layton, “and felt, ‘Where are they now?’” That question dovetailed with the British film-maker’s own ambivalence about LA and the status anxiety it breeds, and how easily self-worth becomes entangled with how others see you. “I was fascinated by that. How much of what we all do – even me wanting to direct a Hollywood movie – is about how others see me?”The same preoccupation runs through Layton’s two previous films, his Bafta-winning 2012 documentaryThe Imposter– about a French conman who convinced a Texas family he was their missing son – and the 2018 docudramaAmerican Animals, which dramatised a real-life heist of the library of Transylvania University in Kentucky. Both films interweave fictionalised scenes and interviews with the actual people involved, exposing how easily fantasy and self-mythology can collapse into reality. “Most of us live within a set of social expectations,” Layton says. “What about the people who step outside that?”‘I used to think that if I had the biggest film of all time, or launched another franchise, then I’d feel fulfilled’It makes sense then, that in Crime 101 there are no moral absolutes. The good guys aren’t purely good, the bad guys aren’t purely bad. Davis takes only what insurance can replace and ensures no one he steals from is ever hurt. He even returns his victims’ phones so they don’t lose their family photos. What unites the characters is ambiguity, a sense of being trapped in roles that no longer fit.“They’re all at a point where a transformation needs to occur,” Hemsworth says. “They’re like, ‘I’m done wearing this mask. This personification of myself that has been created via either societal expectations, or my own assumption that if I add these things to my entity then I’ll feel fulfilled.’ But what they’re all searching for is connection, love and friendship.”One film that particularly resonated with the actor was Paul Schrader’s American Gigolo, about a man who possessed all the visible markers of success – the Armani suits, the cars, the beautiful women – yet remained profoundly alone. “There’s such a tragedy to it. He’s still a lonely child, in a way.”View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t able to hide’ … Hemsworth with Monica Barbaro in Crime 101.Photograph: Dean Rogers/Amazon MGM StudiosHas his own concept of success changed over the years? “Absolutely. I used to think maybe if I was nominated for something I’d feel good about myself. Or maybe if I had the biggest film of all time, or launched another franchise, then I’d feel fulfilled. It’s absurd. My self-worth doesn’t rest upon all of those exterior things any more – though I still have to remind myself.”That recalibration has been sharpened by what he describes as a “middle passage” in life. Recent years, and particularly his father’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis, have prompted a slowing down. “My appetite for racing forward has really been reined in,” he says. “I’ve become more aware of the fragility of things. You start thinking, ‘My dad won’t be here for ever.’ And my kids are now 11 and 13. Those nights where they’d fight over sleeping in our bed – suddenly they’re not happening any more.”It has reshaped how he thinks about work. Early in his career, choices were driven by a desire for financial security. “I’d think, ‘I came from nothing. Who am I to turn down that kind of money?’ Justifying things that weren’t the purest creative decision – but I’ll be able to pay for my parents’ house, or I’ll be able to help out my cousins.”Now he’s more conscious of asking himself when enough is enough – a question that mirrors his character’s dilemma in Crime 101. “My wife [Spanish actor Elsa Pataky] jokes, ‘What’s the number?’ I still wrestle with that. But I’m getting better at relaxing, making more curated decisions, working with people I admire.”People talk about the footy and the weather, and no one asks, ‘How are you doing? Are you afraid?’Inhis 2022 documentary series Limitless, Hemsworth disclosed that his maternal grandfather had Alzheimer’s disease, and he himself is eight to 10 times likelier to develop the condition than average. The subject was explored further in a 2025 follow-up,A Road Trip to Remember, which centred on his father Craig’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis.Going public, Hemsworth says, was not an easy decision. “I wondered if I was letting people too far in. Are they no longer going to believe in the action star or theMarvelcharacter? And do I want people to know my fears and insecurities to this level?”View image in fullscreen‘Deeply personal’ … Hemsworth and his father, Craig, in A Road Trip to Remember.Photograph: National Geographic/PABut he regards the documentary as one of the most important things he’s ever made. “It was so deeply personal.

It empowered him for a period, and stimulated memories that were being taken away from him.” He even had strangers with Alzheimer’s come up to him and say they wanted their kids to see the film. “People like to pretend it’s not happening, because it’s so uncomfortable for them, so you suffer in silence. People talk to you about the footy, and the weather and stuff, and no one actually says, ‘How are you doing? Are you scared? Are you afraid?’”Hemsworth’s father worked as a social services counsellor in child protection, which the actor drew on while researching his Crime 101 character Mike. “I’ve discussed with my dad the tragic circumstances kids face, the deep need for love and connection, and how you can go searching in all the wrong places when you don’t get it.” He also usedan appto read testimonies from people on Skid Row, who “wear their heartbreak on every inch of their being”.Layton, meanwhile, spoke to real-life counterparts to all his characters, including jewel thieves in prison. “We heard some crazy stories. One famous jeweller said he would be sending jewels through a FedEx service, and these fake FedEx guys turned up early and pulled guns on them. The stories were more outlandish than fiction.”For Layton, the heist genre offered an opportunity to make something propulsive and thoughtful. “I wanted to deliver what you want from a really fun night out at the cinema,” he says. “It’s not IP-driven. It’s more like the films we grew up loving – while also prompting reflection. And I think people will come out feeling blown away by what Chris has done.”Crime 101 is released in cinemas in the UK and US on 13 February, and in Australia on 12 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsChris HemsworthCrime filmsDrama filmsMarvelThorAlzheimer'sDocumentaryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A severe injury, coupled with a sudden worsening of her health, had left her unable to sit upright, while brain fog and fatigue made reading and writing impossible. So the award-winning novelist and poet fell back on her art school training, using the energy and materials she had to hand to create impressionistic paintings of her surroundings – her cat Uisce, her boyfriend’s PlayStation controller – alongside unsettling imagery of enclosed gardens and flowers decaying.“Making the paintings was a way of coexisting with pain,” says the 34-year-old. “I was on my living room floor in agony for a few hours, but I wanted to get something out of that time. I’ve always been fascinated by artists and writers who turn limitations into formal constraints. I see the paintings as my attempt at that.”The works were made with basic materials: “quite cheap” paper, paints and brushes, as well as kinesiology tape, an adhesive that Lafarge, who has the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, uses to provide support to her joints and ligaments. Seeing as the tape needs to be cut in very specific ways, it leaves behind distinctive butterfly-shaped remnants that Lafarge repurposed into decorative elements. The watercolours will be accompanied by a poem cycle inspired by William Blake’s The Sick Rose and the 13th-century text The Romance of the Rose, drawing on the principles of courtly love to tell the allegorical story of a relationship in which pain is characterised as an “intoxicating, sometimes quite violent” lover.Is Nnena Kalu’s Turner win really a turning point, unless disabled people can afford to be alive in this country?The paintings and poetry will be on display this month at Dundee Contemporary Arts Centre as part of We Contain Multitudes, an exhibition bringing together the work of four artists with disabilities. Also showing are Jo Longhurst, whose latest project is inspired by bindweed, an unwanted yet resilient plant; Andrew Gannon, who creates work modelled on casts of his left arm; and Nnena Kalu, whose highly textural, cocoon-like sculptures and drawingsgained her the 2025 Turner prize– the first time it had been awarded to an artist with learning disabilities.View image in fullscreenDaisy Lafarge: ‘Making the paintings was a way of coexisting with pain.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“I think it’s great that Nnena won the Turner,” says Lafarge. “I’m yet to see her work in the flesh, but I love the way it takes up space, its undaunted physicality. I hope it leads to more inclusion of disabled artists. But I don’t want to be naively optimistic. I just find it so hard to disentangle from the fact that disabled artists are disabled people. So is it really a turning point, unless disabled people can afford to be alive in this country? And that comes down to structural issues: are they able to heat their own homes, pay their carers and access very basic things? It’s been an incredibly bleak time from that perspective. A celebratory representation without actual material change is kind of meaningless.”For many disabled people, the effort of managing complex conditions and chronic pain is exacerbated by the bureaucratic hurdles they face to receive treatment and support. Lafarge, who lives in Glasgow, has never been able to see a specialist for Ehlers-Danlos on the NHS, as there are none in Scotland. Many of her paintings were made while being put on lengthy call queues for adult disability payment, the Scottish equivalent of personal independence payment. “When you’re trying to get support from these institutions, which are punitive in various ways, that can take a lot out of you as well. Those processes can be incredibly difficult.”View image in fullscreenYour Pain Is As Unique As You Are, 2024.Photograph: Eleni Avraam/Daisy LafargeThe welfare cuts implemented by Labour last year were a “huge assault” on disability rights, says Lafarge, but she accepts there has been progress in certain areas, such as the increasing use of access documents, in which art workers set out the adjustments they will require from a venue, such as wheelchair ramps or regular breaks. “Most of the time now, thankfully, they’ll come back and say, ‘Yes.’ But sometimes they’ll say, ‘No, we can’t.’”Lafarge hopes exhibitions like We Contain Multitudes can challenge preconceptions about disabled artists – and by extension disabled people. Its four artists represent a diversity of conditions, and each tackles the subject of disability in a very different way. “One great thing to come out of this show would be for people to say, ‘I wouldn’t have assumed the artist who made that is disabled’ – because it shouldn’t have to be obvious from the content.”View image in fullscreenGate Theory of Pain (III), 2024.Photograph: Eleni Avraam/Daisy LafargeShe hopes her paintings and poems will speak to people regardless of any physical ability. “You don’t have to be disabled to engage with this work. That’s a diminishing of it.”She has thought a lot about the concept of identity. “When I was first diagnosed, I really didn’t want to over-identify with it and say, ‘I am a writer with this condition.’ I just wanted to be a writer, or I wanted to be an artist. There’s this pressure to outwardly identify with something you might feel personally ambivalent about. That’s frustrating.”‘Nnena Kalu was ready for this – nobody else was’: how her Turner prize victory shook the art worldRead moreDisability, she says, shouldn’t be seen as something removed from the everyday, ora separate category of personhood. “People don’t realise that this work is about them as well,” says Lafarge. “Many people will, either through old age or injury or illness, come to know something of that experience. We’reone in fourpeople. It’s not unusual. This implicates all of us.”We Contain Multitudes is atDundee Contemporary Artsfrom 7 February to 26 April.

TV detectives including Morse,BarnabyandRebushave been put on stage, as have sitcoms such asSome Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em,Only Fools and Horsesand Yes, Prime Minister.Asits sequel to that last showtransfers to the West End, the Barn theatricalises another telly comedy: Simon Nye’s 90s peak-time powerhouse Men Behaving Badly – about manchild flat-sharers and the women who try to mature them – whose Christmas 1998 finale was watched by 13.9 million viewers.That’s a huge pool of viewer goodwill to draw on, but making a show from the box successful at the box office can be problematic. A crucial decision is whether the stage cast impersonates or reinterprets the screen stars. In this case, Matt Howdon’s Tony and Tricia Adele-Turner’s Deb would get high marks for doing role originators Neil Morrissey and Leslie Ash on another TV franchise, Stars in Their Eyes. However, Ellie Nunn’s Dorothy and Ross Carswell’s Gary are as distinct from Caroline Quentin’s and Martin Clunes’s versions – respectively posher and rougher – than one Ophelia or Hamlet may be from another, making it sometimes seem as if there are two new housemates.Howdon is effectively trapped into impersonation because Morrissey makes an enjoyable video appearance as a ghost speaking from the present day to the characters in 1999 – the play is set on millennium eve. But, as a result, Joseph O’Malley’s production veers between re-enactment and acting.View image in fullscreenA  last-minute hitching … Tricia Adele-Turner as Deb and Ellie Nunn as Dorothy in Men Behaving Badly: The Play.Photograph: Alex TabriziTV-to-stage plays also struggle with pacing. Two-hour cop shows naturally fit theatre, but the half-hour unit of sitcoms requires stretching that can become forcing. John Cleese expertly turnedthree Fawlty Towers episodesintoseamless theatre farce. Nye’s play goes beyond the TV plots, though the dialogue sometimes refers to choice moments.He introduces two ticking clocks across the evening. In order to inherit from a moralistic aunt, a device seeming more 1890s than a century later, Gary must marry the heavily pregnant Dorothy before she gives birth. (It’s unclear why the presbyterian relative overlooks the couple’s first child.) Deb has flown back from Australia for the last-minute hitching, giving Tony 24 hours to persuade her that he should emigrate to Melbourne and wed her.That’s a lot of plot, but even with an extended musical interval entertainment – nicely done by Neil Jennings and Valerie Antwi as landlord Ken and his girlfriend, Eve, respectively – the audience goes home after 100 minutes. That isn’t enough time to establish if the script is rebuking or celebrating the boys for their boorish sexuality. And while in the original the female characters were at least allowed to enjoy sex, a relatively feminist impulse, in this version they exist mainly to be impregnated in a project that feels like a misconception.AtBarn theatre, Cirencester, until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)TelevisionNeil MorrisseyMartin ClunesCaroline QuentinreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then we asked readers to share their own milestone TV moments. Here are the best.1953:the coronationView image in fullscreenCrowning achievement … the 1953 coronation.Photograph: BBCMum and dad bought a Vidor TV for the coronation in 1953. We used to watch theTelevisionNewsreel on Saturday evening – I was fascinated by the start, which was the BBC revolving round the Alexandra TV tower. I think this (together with listening to the shipping forecast on the radio) is what sparked my lifelong obsession with radio! It is still with me 70+ years later.Phil Holliday, 78, New Zealand1969:the Apollo 11 moon landingView image in fullscreenSatellite TV … the Apollo 11 moon landing.Photograph: REX/ShutterstockI can still remember my father waking me up late at night to watch the first human landing on the moon. He woke me because he had to share this event with someone and didn’t want to wake my mother. He said: “Sorry to wake you up, son, but you must come and see this. You’ll never see anything like this again.” And so we sat and watched it on our old stuttering black-and-white television, and although I wasn’t aware of the immense significance of the moment, I became caught up in my father’s fascination and excitement. I’ll never forget that night.Laurie, West Midlands1972: David Bowie on Top of the PopsView image in fullscreenStraight to the point … David Bowie’s 1972 Top of the Pops performance.Photograph: BBCDavid Bowie’s performance of Starman created a wave of enthusiasm for some, and scandal for others. This was the character Ziggy Stardust who was to forever change the face of popular music, not just in the UK. He was mesmerising and I was enthralled. He had a twinkle in his eye that told me he knew something that I did not. The UK was still very homophobic in the early 70s and Bowie suggestively putting his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson had some people spluttering with indignation. The high point was probably when he looked straight into the camera and pointed at us while singing the lyrics, “I had to phone someone so I picked on you”.Ian Wright, Berlin, Germany1976:Sex Pistols appear on the Bill Grundy ShowView image in fullscreenSwearing in ceremony … Sex Pistols on the Bill Grundy Show in 1976.Photograph: Thames TelevisionSex Pistols on the Bill Grundy show, with a few swear words and the allegedly inebriated Grundy flirting badly with Siouxsie Sioux.

I’d argue that the emergence of a Welsh-language channel was a very important moment, not just for the Welsh language and people of Wales, but for all minoritised people and languages.Liam, Cymru1985:Live AidView image in fullscreenHe will rock you … Freddie Mercury performing with Queen at Live Aid in 1985.Photograph: Langevin Jacques/Jacques LangevinFor one brief moment, it seemed as if the entire world was grooving on a single wavelength that said: “if we’re going to do this, it’s gonna take everyone … ”Christopher,USA1990: Nelson Mandela’s release from prisonView image in fullscreenFree spirit … Nelson Mandela, and his wife Winnie, on the day of his release.Photograph: Greg English/APHaving grown up in a world where apartheid was the norm, it was nearly unbelievable then to see this older, graceful man making his way to freedom. The meaning behind it was beautiful. I watched it with some of my extended family, about 15 of us, and we were all crying.Angela Adams, 55, Hainault1993:Tales of the CityView image in fullscreenOut and about … Laura Linney and Thomas Gibson in Tales of the City.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyI was living in the foothills of Snowdonia, having recently given up teaching French at Bangor University, in favour of following a path of gay activism and becoming Wales’s first HIV outreach worker for the Gwynedd health authority. I had come out in Paris a few years previously, friends were dying with Aids, and I was outraged by the massive cover-up going on in the UK around engaging in effective prevention and care for gay and bisexual men around HIV/Aids. Then cameOut on Tuesday– the Channel 4 series which was the world’s first networked television series aimed at a lesbian and gay audience. It was followed by Tales of the City, a TV dramatisation of a set of novels that were my bible and guiding light towards freedom, love and community. The airing of the book helped me believe that what I was fighting for was possible and not just a dream. I would invite friends round, crack open a bottle of wine and we would live the dream, from our remote Welsh hills.David Lynch, 62, Cambridge1994:Melvyn Bragg interviews Dennis PotterView image in fullscreenThe play’s the thing … Melvyn Bragg interviewing Dennis Potter.Photograph: YoutubeWithout a doubt, Melvyn Bragg interviewing Dennis Potter shortly before the end of the latter’s life. Funny, sad, profoundly moving: as an event it will stay with me always.Judith Rhodes, 73, Leeds1998: David Attenborough and the lyre birdView image in fullscreenI can see a lyre … David Attenborough in The Life of Birds in 1998.Photograph: BBCDavid Attenborough is in a forest with a lyre bird in south-eastern Australia, which mimics the sounds of the chainsaws felling the trees and destroying its habitat. It was a wake-up call to the effects of humans destroying the balance of nature on our planet. It has stuck with me ever since.Amalie Rothschild, 80, Florence2000: Chandler proposes to Monica on FriendsView image in fullscreenRinging in the new millennium … Chandler Bing proposes to Monica Geller in Friends.Photograph: NBC/Getty ImagesWe all thought Chandler had lost his chance. When he burst into the apartment to find Monica there, surrounded by candles, waiting for him, and they both drop to their knees, the joy and relief was palpable. It still makes me cry every time I watch it.Sandra Hochstein, 72,Canada2001: The West Wing – Two CathedralsView image in fullscreenHoly smokes … Martin Sheen as President Bartlet in The West Wing.Photograph: The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock PhotoMy dad used to watch The West Wing when I was young. He wouldn’t allow me to watch the entire episode, but he would let me watch the title sequence. I’m not sure why, but I was obsessed with it. Fifteen years on, it’s my favourite show. If I had to choose one moment, it has to be President Bartlet arguing with God in the brilliant episode Two Cathedrals. When Jed gets the Secret Service to shut down the Washington Cathedral after a funeral and begins to argue with the Lord himself, it’s hard not to appreciate how cool the guy looks doing it. It’s perfect TV.Daniel, 24, France2003:Tim and Dawn finally kiss in The OfficeView image in fullscreenA Christmas miracle … Tim and Dawn finally get together in The Office.Photograph: YoutubeWhen Tim and Dawn get it together in The Office. I’d ached for Tim in his seemingly unrequited adoration of Dawn, who struggled to contain her growing attraction to him. A surprising and unlikely denouement to a series not always kind to its characters.Ann, 75, London2009:the lawnmower incident on Mad MenView image in fullscreenMaking the cut … the lawnmower incident on Mad Men.Photograph: YoutubeMad Men: season three, episode six. The advertising agency is having a party, everyone is pretty loose. Then a secretary starts riding a lawnmower and runs over the soon-to-be head of the company. The scene is graphic and shocking. The agency, and the United States at the time, are on the brink of great change.Maria, London2010:the Tenth Doctor’s regeneration on Doctor WhoView image in fullscreenOh Time Lordy … David Tennant’s Doctor regenerating in Doctor Who.Photograph: YoutubeI was very into Doctor Who as a child, and I remember being enthralled by the Tenth Doctor’s (David Tennant) regeneration into the Eleventh (Matt Smith). My family and I were all sitting in our old living room. I would’ve been about four or five years old at the time, and I’ve probably supplemented this with memories from iPlayer. But the main impact was my eight-year-long obsession with Doctor Who.Issy, 21, London2016:Peter Marsh crashes out on Come Dine With MeView image in fullscreenSour grapes … Peter Marsh (right) on Come Dine With Me.Photograph: Channel 4The best moment is the 2016 Come Dine With Me episode where Peter Marsh does not appreciate his finishing position. So often on TV, everyone is very gracious when losing, congratulating the winners. This time, however, in a very un-British lack of decorum, Peter took umbrage at his loss, and uttered such iconic insults as “Dear lord, what a sad little life, Jane,” and “You have all the grace of a reversing dump truck without any tyres on.” Truly iconic.Mike, 41, Warwickshire2016:The Battle of the Bastards on Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenTough mudder … Kristofer Hivju as Tormund and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in The Battle of the Bastards.Photograph: HBOA sensational episode of television. It captures the raw violence of war on horseback very well and the hopelessness Jon Snow feels when it looks as if he is about to be crushed to death. This episode also has a very satisfying ending, where Sansa Stark gets to exact some sort of revenge on Ramsay Bolton, and not before time. Glorious.Brian Molan, 45, Cork2021:Roman Roy’s accidental sext on SuccessionView image in fullscreenTake your pic … Kieran Culkin as Roman Roy in Succession.Photograph: Graeme HunterI’d love to say something high-brow but that would be disingenuous. My actual favourite TV moment of all time is in Succession (obviously) when Roman Roy accidentally sends a very intimate pic to his father, Logan Roy, and the realisation and fallout of what he has done plays out on screen. One of the most shocking, hilarious, hands-over-your-face, cringing-on-his-behalf moments of TV I have ever seen! Glorious.Paul Cahill, 43, Dublin2022:Andy’s discovery in DetectoristsView image in fullscreenOut standing in their field … Toby Jones and Mackenzie Crook in Detectorists.Photograph: Chris Harris/BBC/Channel XIn the first episode of final series of Mackenzie Crook’s sublime Detectorists, Andy (Crook) sounds a hawking whistle and the landscape flashes back in history to reveal the original owner calling her bird to return in a magical sequence. The scene is given further poignance by the accompaniment of the Unthanks’ equally wonderful song Magpie.Alex Simpson, SolihullThis article was amended on 3 February 2026.

Their next trick? A seance-style tribute to an old friendMark FisherTue 3 Feb 2026 04.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 04.18 ESTShareSpalding Gray used to perform a show called Interviewing the Audience.The celebrated monologistwould invite a stranger he had met in the lobby to join him on stage. Through a sequence of innocuous questions, he would get them to open up about their lives. At one performance, a guest broke the audience’s hearts by talking about her daughter’s murder. At benefit nights, people living with HIV shared their tales. Other times, the anecdotes would be eccentric or amusing. Gray said they showed us “what it is to live in the world”.Watching Gray conjure up this material made a big impression on a young actor calledScott Shepherd. It was the show he saw on his first visit to the Performing Garage, the New York home of the Wooster Group. The pioneering avant garde company had been established a few years earlier by Gray and director Elizabeth LeCompte with their colleagues Kate Valk, Ron Vawter, Jim Clayburgh, Willem Dafoe and Peyton Smith.“Interviewing the Audience was quite amazing,” says Shepherd. “His first question was always the same – ‘How did you get to the theatre?’ – and there would be some story about the subway or the taxi and, somehow, he would find a thread from that into the person’s inner being. It was one of the great early theatre experiences of my life.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s an act of channelling or ventriloquism’ … Scott Shepherd, with Spalding Gray on screen in the background.Photograph: Gianmarco BresadolaBy this time, Valk had had an equally transformative experience at the Performing Garage, a theatre so small there was no room for a foyer and some seats were accessible only by climbing a ladder. As an inquisitive acting student, she had headed along to the SoHo venue to see Spalding Gray in two autobiographical pieces, Sakonnet Point (1975) and Rumstick Road (1977). She was hooked.“I gave up my apartment and moved in upstairs,” Valk says, joining Shepherd on our video call. “It was such an amazing group of artists. I was like, ‘Oh, I’m just going to give up everything and move in here because this is the place to be.’”Valk became part of the Wooster Group in 1979, initially working as a seamstress and soon as an actor. She has rarely worked outside the company since: “I don’t know how to do anything else.”Now, in a kind of posthumous tribute, both actors are returning to the role Gray created in Nayatt School (1978). This was the piece that followed Sakonnet Point and Rumstick Road in the Rhode Island trilogy and was Gray’s first foray into autobiographical monologues, a forerunner to pieces such as Swimming to Cambodia and Monster in a Box.Coming to London’s Coronet theatre, Nayatt School Redux is not exactly a revival, but a reimagining of the 1978 show in a very Wooster Group way. “When we go back to look at the old work, it’s not like an artist can pull out her old painting from the warehouse and look at it,” says LeCompte, who lived with Gray in the 1970s. “We can’t do that. We only have very deteriorated, black-and-white material to work from.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m the survivor’ … Kate Valk.Photograph: Gianmarco BresadolaWhere Gray – who died in 2004 – was once a friend and colleague, he is now a character in a play about a play he made. “We’re getting as close to channelling his performance in Nayatt School as we can,” says Valk. “I’m the survivor, because I’m still in the group. I knew him, I worked with him, I was young, now I’m old and I’m the person who’s translating and telling you what he did. My monologue is like a palimpsest across the top of Spalding.”“It’s another act of channelling or ventriloquism,” says Shepherd, recalling the Wooster Group’sHamlet(2005) in which he mimicked an archive recording of Richard Burton. “It’s even more literal this time, because I’m wearing some of the clothes that Spalding wore when he did the show. It does feel a bit seancey.”Taking its name from a school in Barrington, Rhode Island, where Gray grew up, Nayatt School had all of LeCompte’s celebrated hallmarks. Foremost among these was the collage-like juxtaposition of disparate elements. The production blended vaudeville-style radio skits with TS Eliot’s postwar playThe Cocktail Party, itself a curious combination of drawing-room comedy and esoteric religious debate.View image in fullscreenEllen Mills and Ari Fliakos in Vieux Carré by the Wooster Group at the Edinburgh international festival in 2010.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianEliot’s play fascinated Gray not only because he owned a cast recording featuring Alec Guinness and Irene Worth, but also because one of its characters, Celia Coplestone, goes on a spiritual journey that ends in her martyrdom. It reminded him of his mother, a Christian Scientist, who killed herself when he was 26. (Gray himself is assumed to have jumped off the Staten Island Ferry to his death.)The fusion of pop culture and high art has characterised the Wooster Group’s work. In 1984, LSD (Just the High Points) sat at the meeting point of Timothy Leary’s countercultural drug taking and Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. In 1988, Frank Dell’s the Temptation of St Antony combined Gustave Flaubert with Lenny Bruce. And 1997’s House/Lights was half-Gertrude Stein and half-sexploitation flick.The company has forgedunexpected connectionsbetween baroque opera and sci-fi B-movies, Noh theatre and Chekhov. For LeCompte, who trained in painting and photography, such head-spinning collisions are the way she sees the world. “I grew up with the television and art, and they do that all the time,” she says. “You can go from the most serious soap-opera scene to a toothpaste ad. As a kid, I thought, ‘Oh, they’re in the bathroom and they’re going to come out of the bathroom and continue the scene.’ I didn’t see that you needed to connect those things in any rational way.”She compares her technique to frottage, the artistic practice pioneered by Max Ernst in which pencil rubbings are taken from rough surfaces to create something new. “That’s what I do with the texts and the people,” says LeCompte, rubbing her hands to demonstrate. “The performers are material and I like to rub myself up against them.”“Not in the literal sense,” she adds, hastily, with a laugh.The effect can be discombobulating. It can also be funny. “It seems to be fun when it’s high/low,” says Valk. “For instance, this difficult writing by Gertrude Stein juxtaposed with a girl gang from a 60s B-movie. It’s a fun mix, like a cocktail. Sometimes, it’s not logical or reasonable, but you put the source material and the text so they’re vibrating against each other and then they somehow grow together.”Shepherd adds: “The high and low combination has a double benefit. It takes the high thing down off its pedestal and you can appreciate an earthier humanity that’s encoded in there. And on the flip side, something sublime is exposed in the low thing.”View image in fullscreenWillem Dafoe and Sheena See in To You, the Birdie! (Phèdre) by the Wooster Group at Riverside Studios, London, in 2002.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGetting these combinations to work can be difficult, but once LeCompte has set her course, she never abandons an idea. Shepherd gives the example ofVieux Carré(2008), in which they took a play by Tennessee Williams and layered it on to Paul Morrissey’s films from Andy Warhol’s Factory. “We wanted to get the tone of realism from those movies on to this Tennessee Williams text,” he says. “We had to try and abandon different parts of the films because they didn’t work with the scene. It took us a while to get the right parts. Sometimes we know it’s not working, but not at the level of the whole project falling apart.”‘Theatre puts a finger in the wound’: Willem Dafoe returns to his first love in VeniceRead moreThe matching of live actors to recorded film and audio requires discipline. Even if a Wooster Group performance leaves you bewildered, you never lose admiration for the precision of the actors and technicians. “As performers, Scott, myself and Ari Fliakos – the whole middle period of the Wooster Group – have an athlete spirit,” says Valk. “With the copying, the speed, the deftness and the technical skills to follow and respond physically, there is a feat that needs to be accomplished. All three of us enjoy that.”It is entertaining for audiences too, and if any of this sounds highfalutin, it is to underestimate LeCompte’s sense of joy and wonder. She is less the austere auteur than the enthusiast, delighted at the absurdities of life and art. When Valk refers to the company’s “career”, LeCompte raises her eyebrows, adopts an expression of cartoon horror and draws scare quotes in the air. Imagine calling it a career! Heading for 82 and looking decades younger, she retains her sense of delight and mischief. She flashes another broad smile and heads off to rehearsal.Nayatt School Redux is atCoronet theatre, London, 17–25 AprilIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Now 82, he’s back on tour – and bracing for a warts-and-all documentary made by his many childrenTue 3 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTShareThe big bloke in the khaki suit speaks quietly these days. We are nestled in the corner of Ted Milton’s studio above a rehearsal space in Deptford, London, cocooned by record boxes, poetry books, plus a single big, bright suitcase, and I have to nudge the recorder closer to pick up his voice. Milton – a saxophonist, poet, countercultural survivor and one-time avant garde puppeteer – is 82, and uses a couple of sticks to get around, yet he is once again going on the road across Europe with his long-running band Blurt, as well as releasing a new album with his duo the Odes.Today, he is making record covers destined for the tour merch table with the help of his old woodblock setup. “That orange suitcase?” he points across the desk. “I just bought it.” He booms out a massive laugh, as if to prove he still has the lung power to command a room. “I’m a fetishist about luggage. I know how to survive touring. Haha!”At many gamechanging moments in British postwar culture, Milton was skulking in the background somewhere, with mischief not far away. He recalls sharing taxis with William S Burroughs when the Beat godfather came to London in the early 1960s; he was described as a visionary by old drinking buddy Eric Clapton; his puppet show crashed its way into the Monty Python universe by being featured in Terry Gilliam’s 1977 film Jabberwocky; a legendary lost promotional film for Pink Floyd’s 1967 song Scream Thy Last Scream is rumoured to feature Milton’s overcoat in a leading role via the wonder of animatronics. And there is no band quite like Blurt, a bass-less trio of drums, guitar and Milton’s horns and vocals throwing down raucous, jazzy blowouts. “The groove they had was utterly fabulous,” says long-term fan Graham Lewis, of post-punks Wire.Now, in the autumn of a long and sometimes outrageous life, the tables have been turned by Milton’s own family. He was married three times and had five children, the most recent when he was nearly 70, and a new film by son George Milton,The Last Puppet Show, aims to explore his father’s work and sometimes fraught relationships via the ingenious medium of his newly reanimated puppets. “It’s like a therapy session for kids,” he says of the film, cautiously. It’s your family confronting you with their point of view, I say. “That’s what I’m afraid of.”Milton had a fragile relationship with his own parents, which laid seeds that flowered throughout his rebellious career. “My parents moved to west Africa when I was 11 and I went to a boarding school,” he recalls, which brought independence, but also repression and bullying, and he found solace through music. “I had a Dansette record player – Elvis, Carl Perkins, Little Richard.” But his other safety valve was disobedience. “I was looking to disrupt classes. Just be an arsehole, you know?”He dabbled with art studies in Cambridge, and also the city’s jazz scene, before eventually falling in, quite literally, with the London bohemian set. “I went down to this jazz festival. I was rescued from lying in the mud by a group of beatnik looking people including [poet] Pete Brown. They took me back to London.” Brown encouraged his poetry, which even made it into The Paris Review in 1963. As Milton admits, he sometimes invoked the vocation of struggling poet simply to cadge drinks from strangers.View image in fullscreenMilton at his work bench in Deptford.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBy the middle of the decade, Milton was living with girlfriend Clarissa in “a period of bohemian debauchery in Long Acre [Covent Garden]. Eric used to come round there quite a lot.” This wasEric Clapton, who recalls in his autobiography how Milton would spin Howlin’ Wolf and channel the music into dance and acting: “I understood how you could listen to music completely and make it come alive … it was a real awakening,” he wrote. Milton never lost this knack for performance. But whereas his old mate Pete Brown worked as lyricist for Clapton’s Cream, Milton reckons he passed up similar opportunities for Pink Floyd, whose managers Andrew King and Peter Jenner were also on the scene.“If success was presented to Ted on a silver platter, he’d piss on it,” declares Roger Law, co-creator of Spitting Image. He’s at home in Norfolk at a kitchen table piled with books and illustrations, including Milton’s rough-hewn poetry pamphlets. The pair first met at the Cambridge School of Art and raised hell together, and linked up once again in London, sharing their dark sense of humour and appreciation for the absurd. “If you talk to Ted,” says Law, recalling their benders together, “you can’t tell the surreal from the reality.”In the late 1960s, Milton took a post at a puppet theatre in Wolverhampton. “Then I moved to glove shows.” He mimes a Punch & Judy style performance with his hands. “It’s a whole different dynamic: violence. So I moved to that. I call it performance animation.” Law lauds Milton’s uncanny ability to bring puppets alive; the man behind Spitting Image should know. But for Milton, “puppets’ eyes are dead. They don’t feel challenged, they’re not afraid. This gives you this unrecognised but really potent possibility to get into people, and you can go to places in their head they don’t want you to.”View image in fullscreenPlaying with his son George in 1971.Photograph: Courtesy George MiltonMilton’s skill in puppetry – showcased on Brighton’s West Pier, and then to numerous school audiences across Europe – led to some of the strangest support slots in 70s rock music, for Clapton and Ian Dury among others. Milton compares it to the urban myth of salesmen hardening themselves up by hawking peanuts on the street. “I was doing support for Clapton [in 1976], we were doing a performance in the round. I got the puppet theatre out there, the puppets arethis big– ” he holds his hands a small distance apart “– and we’re talking about 1,000 people. Immediately, a roar comes up: ‘fuck off!’” Dury, meanwhile, would sometimes come to the stage to ask the audience to cool it.But Milton’s outrageous, profane performances, with their anti-authoritarian message and Brechtian aesthetic, featuring characters such as Deepthroat Porker, Constable Nosey Parker and The Egg Dog, eventually gained a rep. Tony Wilson featured Milton’s puppetry on his groundbreaking So It Goes TV show in 1976, which caught the attention of Graham Lewis and Colin Newman, soon to be of post-punk band Wire. The puppet show slotted seamlessly into the violent medieval anarchy of Gilliam’s film Jabberwocky. When Milton then picked up a saxophone a few years later and formed Blurt, Wilson made them one of the first bands from outside Manchester to feature on his Factory Records label, and Wire invited them on to their bills. Milton’s subversive art had found a new home in the post-punk era.View image in fullscreenMilton pictured in 1985.Photograph: Paul WigensMilton is a born performer, and Wire’s Lewis was immediately hooked: “Blurt were totally captivating,” he enthuses. A 1984 solo Milton track, Love Is Like a Violence, would even become an unlikely floor-filler at Glasgow’s hip Optimo club night in the 2000s. Although Blurt bounced between many record labels over the decades, Milton always made his way back to the spotlight eventually.He’s very much front and centre of The Last Puppet Show: the film is a reckoning with the man Milton used to be, which for his associates was a driven artist, and for his family a sometimes wayward father. A chunk of the budget is intended for creating a new set of puppets to dramatise its scenes; Milton says the old ones were either sent to Alaska, or symbolically burned. “I don’t suppose I made any attempt to make any concessions to anybody anywhere along the line,” he admits, looking back on his wilder days. “One person beat me up.” I ask who it was, and it turns out to be one of his own bandmates.While Milton’s anti-authoritarian streak remains as strong as ever, age has now forced him to start making compromises. “The last couple of shows I’ve had to do sitting down, which I really dreaded. But actually it kind of opens up a different dynamic,” he says, looking forward as ever to the next gig. “It seems to make things more concentrated somehow.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t suppose I made any attempt to make any concessions to anybody anywhere along the line’ … Milton and friends.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianI ask what he thinks it was about his performances that gripped Eric Clapton all those years ago, and whether he’s the same person now. “I think we’re talking about charisma. And charisma is a form of psychosis, to my mind.” He cites Alice Miller’s book The Drama of the Gifted Child, whose thesis holds that children are often forced to suppress their authentic selves, to support his point.“This kind of intense self-consciousness has abated, mercifully,” he reflects, with a more easy-going perspective brought by age. “One person described it as feeling like you’re walking about on stilts all the time, and that’s it – every movement it’s like someone looking at you.” In other words, you felt like a performer all of the time? “Yeah. I’m not like that any more. Hahaha!”Blurt are currently on tour across Europe. The Odes’ Déjeuner Sous L’Herbe is released by Not Applicable on 6 February.

But Kermit’s voice takes some getting used to …Lucy ManganTue 3 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 12.14 ESTShareThe Muppet Show celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Or so it is alleged. Obviously this cannot be true, because it would mean that all of us who remember gathering around the television for the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational half hour of the week must also be … Well, anyway. Let us not dwell.Let us remember instead the magic that ensued as Jim Henson’s creation unfurled before us, as the chaotic troupe of puppets put on their traditional vaudeville show. The permanent cast included the inimitable Miss Piggy (“I don’t care what you think of me. Unless you think I am awesome, in which case you are right”), Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, sombre patriot Sam Eagle (“Freakos one, civilisation zero”), assorted pigs (often in space), scientist Dr Bunsen Honeydew and his heartbreakingly hapless assistant Beaker (the latter granting some of us our first stirrings of true empathy), and many, many chickens. There was also a guest appearance each episode by a famous human comedian, actor or musician. It could be anyone from Julie Andrews to Dudley Moore, as long as they could be trusted to play it straight and believe in their co-stars. It was all held together, if only just, by earnest, frazzled host and stage manager Kermit the Frog and his assistant, Scooter, despite constant heckling from the exquisitely cantankerous Statler and Waldorf looking down on the show, in every sense, from their box seats.Itwasmagical. Really, it was.To commemorate the anniversary, Disney (who acquired the Muppetational rights from the Jim Henson Company in 2004) has got the old gang together and added guest appearances from Sabrina Carpenter, Seth Rogen (also executive producer) and Maya Rudolph for a one-off half-hour special.God bless everyone involved – they’ve tried. You can feel it. They want to make it good for us. They know we deserve it. They know the Muppets deserve it. They know everybody at the moment desperately needs a brief, shining moment out of the darkness. But, as Thomas Wolfe so rightly said, you can’t go home again.Look, it’s fine. If you have never seen the original, it’s probably even good. If you have, there are still moments that tease at taste and memory, such as Miss Piggy’s entrance. “Isn’t it wonderful being back in the theatre, giving people what they want?” she sighs contentedly to Kermit. “Moi”. Or Miss Piggy’s first meeting with Sabrina C, who tells the diva she has based her whole look on Miss Piggy. “My attorneys and I have noticed,” says her idol sweetly. “And we will be in touch.” And Miss Piggy’s response to Sabrina telling her how much she loves her: “I grew up with you! My parents grew up with you! Their parents grew up w—” “OK,” Miss Piggy interrupts in her alternative, unmistakably guttural register.View image in fullscreen‘Inimitable’ … Miss Piggy in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+The Bridgerton pastiche captures something of the old Muppet spirit, too, as a pig in a Regency wig confesses he has fallen in love with someone else “whomst I am tornst betweenst”. So does Honeydew’s experiment on Beaker (“This won’t hurt me a bit!”), which causes his eyes to fall out.But all the bits in between? They are drab. The script – including and most obviously Statler and Waldorf’s heckles – is begging for a polish (and for certain jokes, like the one between Kermit and Carpenter about kink, to be cut). Is this, despite the half-century’s notice they’ve had, a rush job? Or has the show’s time simply passed and no one can carry off exuberant silliness any more? Should we give up on frivolity in these decidedly unfrivolous times? Or double down on the attempt? If this one-off does lead to a series, I’d still tune in with hope. There’s enough to build on here.View image in fullscreen‘Our dearest frog sounds jarringly different’ … Kermit alongside Rowlf the Dog in The Muppet Show.Photograph: Disney+There does remain the nagging problem of Kermit’s voice – probably one of the most distinctive in history. Henson himself performed the character until his death in 1990. Veteran Muppeteer Steve Whitmire inherited the role and played it until he was dismissed by Disney for what they called “unacceptable business conduct”, amid a welter of supporting and contradicting claims by those who had been involved in the show. Matt Vogel now plays the character and though he does so perfectly well, our dearest frog sounds jarringly different to anyone born before Vogel’s tenure. It puts the magic even further out of reach. But maybe only to us. And we’ve had our time.If nothing else, it will entertain children for half an hour and give them the not inconsiderable gift of being introduced to Miss Piggy, and perhaps even more valuably alerting their parents to the fact that all five series of the original are available on the streaming platform. Let it soothe you while we all hunker down and pray for a return to simpler, happier times.The Muppet Show is on Disney+ from 4 February.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDisney+Children's TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

You get a vase and one by one intuitively place each stem inside, allowing an arrangement to unfold on its own. It was on this level, as lead curatorNikhil Choprasuggests, that theKochi-Muziris Biennalewas not curated so much as created.On a stroll through the largest contemporary art biennale in south Asia, creation takes centre stage. Against the backdrop of the coastal city’s lush strip of backwaters and the historic Fort Kochi, works by 66 artists animate Kerala’s grand colonial warehouses and bungalows where art feels less installed than encountered.The idea, as the biennale’s title For the Time Being suggests, is to enter, be present and exit, said multidisciplinary artist Chopra, who curated the show with artist-led organisationHH Art Spaceswhich he co-founded in 2013.“This allowed us to use time in a way as material, as clay or wood or charcoal, where we would invite time into each and every one of the artworks we were presenting and be present in the moment.”View image in fullscreenIndelible Black Marks by Kulpreet Singh, 2022.Photograph: courtesy of Mirchandani + Steinruecke galleryIn our age of distraction, the biennale offers no instant gratification. TakeBirender Kumar Yadav’s installation Only the Earth Knows Their Labour on the exploitative brick industry’s forgotten labourers, orKulpreet Singh’s Indelible Black Marks, where a video plays in a straw-walled enclosure, showing as sheets of canvas are dragged poetically across scorched fields, mimicking farmers ploughing the land.“There are a lot of factors that contribute to the pollution in Delhi, but it’s easy to blame on farmers,” said Singh, 40, who was born into a farming family in Punjab.Now in its sixth edition, half of the artists at the show are Indian and Keralan, a quota which Chopra and the curatorial team dedicated much of their time. Not a single international flight was taken to scout invitees, boasted Chopra. Instead, they leaned on relationships the Goan collective forged with artists over the past decade.“There’s a certain very excited sense of freshness that people approach an invitation from the subcontinent,” said Chopra. Among this year’s international invitations includeMarina Abramović, Ghanaian artistIbrahim Mahamaand Argentinian artistAdrian Villar Rojas.“We live in a bit of a jaded world which is overstuffed with art, music, cinema, theatre,” said Chopra. “We are spoiled for choice to such an extent that I think that the world is really interested in ideas and voices from this side of the economic hemisphere.”View image in fullscreenA Jayashree Chakravarty installation.Photograph: Courtesy of Akar Prakar GalleryThe emphasis on the show’s intuitive approach was made clearest by Kolkata-based artistJayashree Chakravarty. Since moving to Salt Lake in the 80s, she has observed as nearby marshlands transformed to concrete. What we’re left with is Shelter: For the Time Being, memorialising a natural world in retreat.“I’m a silent observer,” said Chakravarty, 69. “Whatever I’m observing, I’m trying to bring back in my work.”Resembling capillaries or intricate webs, large suspended scrolls made of cotton fabric, jute fibre and seed pods invite visitors to inhabit and illuminate the works, begging a question Chakravarty keeps asking herself: How can we bring nature closer?The curators knew they had to be agile in an environment rich with mould, patina and moisture, and made it so the artists, too, would understand the conditions of spaces hard to exhibit art in. In 2018, Kerala was devastated by summer monsoon flooding. This year, Chopra said the biggest challenge came in “starting from zero”, renovating derelict places and repairing roofs as the biennale is without a permanent home.The show is expecting a million visitors, with more than 80% hailing from within a 500km radius. It has strived to maintain its reputation for being a people’s biennale (tickets cost between Rs 100 to 200, or less than £2), and all walks of life could be seen thronging the show, as well as the Student’s Biennale and dedicated “non-judgmental”ArtRooms which host workshops led by artists.View image in fullscreenJayashree Chakravarty, installation shot at Kochi Biennale 2026.Photograph: Courtesy of Akar Prakar GalleryKochi, formerly known as Cochin, sits between the Indian Ocean and the Western Ghats. But the communist-led state is not just uniquely placed geographically. It has passed through the hands of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British, and remained a melting pot of cultures and religions: within walking distance of the show are the Santa Cruz basilica, Paradesi Synagogue and the Dharmanath Jain Temple.“Kerala has always been a place for critical thinking. It’s a very self-aware place to be,” said Chopra, who took part in the 2014 biennale. “People do see and find value in a cultural outing as opposed to say a joy ride or a picnic,” he said, before correcting himself. “This is a picnic among the art.”The Kochi-Muziris Biennale is on until 31 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year,Anya Taylor-Joywas linked to the project in the role of the younger Mitchell, as was Streep’s Mamma Mia! co-starAmanda Seyfried.Crowe, whose best-known film is the music drama Almost Famous, has been attached to the project for some years, and in 2023 said that he hoped for a release date before 2026. Speaking three years ago, Crowe explained that – unlike recent films based on brief periods in the life of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen – the film is not based on a biographical book about the star, but rather Mitchell’s own account of her life.“It’s Joni’s life, not [seen] through anybody else’s prism,” he said. “It’s through her prism. It’s the characters who impacted her life that you know and a lot that you don’t know. And the music is so cinematic.”Streep has previously received two Oscar nominations for playing real-life musicians: the violinist Roberta Guaspari in 1999’s Music of the Heart and the titular character in Florence Foster Jenkins, about the life of the amateur singer, in 2016.Explore more on these topicsFilmMeryl StreepJoni MitchellCameron CroweAnya Taylor-JoyAmanda SeyfriedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The current affairs programme spotlighted everything from the realities of apartheid South Africa to the fallout from the publication of Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses.Ali said he wasshockedto not be invited to participate in the BFI’s new season,Constructed, Told, Spoken: A Counter-History of Britain on TV, which has a dedicated evening where it will screen Bandung File episodes in March.“They never contacted me,” he told the Guardian. “The first I saw was in theBFIprogramme that they had an evening of Bandung File stuff but the choices suggest that there doesn’t seem to be a knowledge of what the programme was.”Ali, who wrote about his experiences on the show in hismemoir released last year, said he wanted the programme to be presented correctly and placed in the right context.He said: “The whole thing about Bandung File is that we did it in a way which unified the West Indian and South Asian communities, while looking outwardly as well; 50% of the viewers were white and 50% non-white, our philosophy was that white people also needed to be educated.”The show, which took its name from the meeting inIndonesia held in 1955between newly independent Asian and African states, was part of a wave of programmes made by, and primarily for, a black and south Asian audience.Ali served as series editor alongside Darcus Howe, while the show was commissioned by Farrukh Dhondy, Channel 4’s editor for multicultural programmes. It ran from 1985 until its cancellation in 1989.It was seen as a step change from previous multicultural shows on Channel 4, which were often magazine shows such as Eastern Eye and Black on Black, a chatshow hosted by the Selecter frontwomanPauline Black.Bandung File had a harder edge and was internationalist in scope, ushering in a new type of Channel 4 series such asBlack Bag, which took on serious issues including theCardiff Three scandalwith an investigative rigour.Ali said: “When I show Bandung File to students today the first question I’m asked is: ‘Was this actually on British television?’ They don’t believe it because of the output they see today. It shows what television can do if it’s sustained and properly supported.”Bandung had several journalistic successes, including exposing a vote-rigging scheme in Roy Hattersley’s constituency of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, and uncovering the Greater London Council’s decision to fund a far-right Hindu political group. They also secured an interview with Rushdie amid the controversy over The Satanic Verses.The current chair of the BBC, Samir Shah, also praised the programme for its coverage of theBCCI scandal, which he said “showed what that kind of journalism can achieve”.Ali said a programme such as Bandung File would never be commissioned or succeed now. “At the time South Africa was very big news and we had a clandestine network of film-makers in the country who would send us five to 10 minutes of footage, which we would show every week,” he said. “Do you think that today the government would permit us to show footage from Gaza? I don’t think so.”The programme itself might have been serious and considered but the team behind it had a sense of humour. After being cancelled they held a “funeral” for the show in Kentish Town with invites that read: “Bandung File, born 1985, died 1989; cause of death – execution … dress code: all black.”A spokesperson for the BFI said: “We recognise how vital Tariq was in shaping Bandung File under his editorship with Darcus Howe. It was always our intention to include Tariq in the season and we hope to get him involved. The process of making contact with him has been delayed slightly due to sourcing his details, however it is not unusual for us to confirm guests once our brochure and season comms have been published, and we are in the process of confirming additional contextual contributors to events throughout this season.”Constructed, Told, Spoken: A Counter-History of Britain on TV, looks at multicultural TV departments in the UK that emerged in the 1980s. It will run throughout February and March and includes screenings dedicated to the impact of Stuart Hall and the black gay television series of the 1980s.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBFIChannel 4Samir ShahTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He was captured and imprisoned after being accused of orchestrating attacks that resulted in the killing of five civilians, and convicted on terrorism charges by an Israeli court. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organisation, criticised the trial at the time, arguing that itbreached international law, including the Geneva conventions. Barghouti has consistently denied the charges against him.Barghouti is a member of the Fatah party, a rival of Hamas, and has long advocated a two-state solution. Many argue that Israel’s refusal to release him is driven by concern thathe could emerge as a powerful voice for the Palestinian cause.Born in 1959 in the West Bank village of Kobar, Barghouti grew up under Israeli military occupation after the 1967 war and was arrested multiple times for political activism as a teenager. Over subsequent decades he emerged as a prominent figure within Palestinian politics, advocating Palestinian unity.The forthcoming book will assemble private letters to Barghouti’s family written from prison, correspondence with public figures, press interviews, public statements, historical documents and photographs, alongside extracts from his book 1,000 Days in Solitary Confinement, which until now has been available only in Arabic.Barghouti has spent extended periods in solitary confinement without access to his family and, according to former Palestinian detainees, hasbeen subjected to multiple serious assaults in prison. In November 2025, theGuardian reportedthat he had not seen his family for three years, while his lawyers had been permitted to visit him only five times in the prior two years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been barred from visiting him, a move that breaches international law.The Guardian view on Marwan Barghouti: Palestinians need a political future as well as aid and reconstruction | EditorialRead moreIn August last year, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,shared video footagein which he was seen taunting Barghouti and threatening him with execution.Despite more than two decades in prison, successive opinion polls show Barghouti is the most popular Palestinian politician in Gaza and the West Bank. He is often cited by supporters as a potential unifying leader across factional divides, and hasbeen described as“Palestine’s Mandela”. His continued prominence has fuelled international campaigns calling for his release.The latest waslaunched in November 2025,with coordinated demonstrations and public art installations in Palestine and in cities including London, alongside protests across Europe, the US and South Africa. In December, more than 200 leading cultural figures – including Margaret Atwood, Annie Ernaux, Benedict Cumberbatch, Elif Shafak, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Tilda Swinton, Olga Tokarczuk, Colm Tóibín, Sir Ian McKellen and Gary Lineker –signed an open lettercalling for his release.An introduction to the book has been written by Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa Barghouti, a prominent advocate for his release. “For a long time, I have wished that the world could hear Marwan in his own voice, not through the noise surrounding him,” she said in a statement. “This book finally makes that possible – and I hope it helps people understand who Marwan Barghouti truly is, and how he embodies the Palestinian struggle for freedom and dignity.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPalestineIsrael-Gaza warPenguinMiddle East and north AfricaPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Directors were still saying, ‘If we put a black woman in this role, what does this mean for the whole story? Do I have to cast a black man? Then it’s a black movie. Black movies don’t sell overseas.’”A similar sentiment was voiced by Lupita Nyong’o last year, who won the supporting actress Oscar in 2014 for her performance in Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave.Speaking to CNN, Nyong’o said the range of roles she was offered was dismayingly slim. “After I won that Academy Award, you’d think, ‘Oh, I’m gonna get lead roles here and there,’” she said.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreInstead, she said, the conversations usually began: “‘Oh, Lupita, we’d like you to play another movie where you’re a slave, butthistime you’re on a slave ship.’ Those are the kind of offers I was getting in the months after winning my Academy Award.”More than 30 black actors – including Sinners’ Michael B Jordan – have so far been nominated for the leading actor Oscar, and five have won, while 16 black female actors have been up for the equivalent best actress award.Twenty-five black male actors have competed for the supporting actor award – with seven wins – including Sinners’ Delroy Lindo. His co-star, Wunmi Mosaku, is one of 32 black female actors who have been nominated for supporting actress, with 10 wins. The favourite this year isOne Battle After Another’s Teyana Taylor.Explore more on these topicsFilmHalle BerryOscarsAwards and prizesLupita Nyong'oRacenewsShareReuse this content"

We are all made of stories – they define who we are.”Owusu’s book, coming in at 128 pages, centres on Ray, a fitness enthusiast whose “obsession takes its toll” – he turns to “a dangerous online community for support”, while his partner, Temi, a journalist, watches with concern, according to the publisher’s description.“Having never read a book until the age of 24, I wish I had come across Quick Reads sooner,” said Owusu. “They’re accessible, affordable and gentle in their approach, allowing new or lapsed readers to find their way into the pleasure and fulfilment of reading fiction and nonfiction.“I’m excited to be part of their legacy and to add my voice to something that helps people feel confident enough to pick up a book and look forward to spending time with it,” he added. Owusu is also the author of That Reminds Me, Losing the Plot, Borderline Fiction and the editor of Safe: 20 Ways to be a Black Man in Britain Today.This year, The Reading Agency will launch Quick Reads as audiobooks for the first time, as well as giving half a million Quick Reads books to prisons across the UK. All Quick Read titles “go through a rigorous accessibility review process, including testing for readability, concentration, and suitability for adults rebuilding reading confidence”, according to the charity.Along with Owusu’s Hunger Pains, the other Quick Reads titles being published this year are The Last Bench by Carmel Harrington, The Girl in the Picture by Rachel Hore, The Woman Next Door by Louise Jensen, Sweet Charity by Rosie Goodwin and Cell One by Leye Adenle.Explore more on these topicsBooksStormzynewsShareReuse this content"

In order to break even, the film will need to take around US$100m globally.Donald Trumphas told reporters he “wasn’t involved”in negotiations over the documentary’s huge price tag, while Melania Trump has said the producers approached several distributors, but “Amazon was the best because they agreed to do theatres all around the world”.Ratner – who had otherwise largely retreated from Hollywoodafternumeroussexual misconduct allegationsmade during the #MeToo movement – has called the claims that his film was a favour for the Trumps “ridiculous”.“I can tell you right now, if we were audited and they said, ‘How much was spent on this movie?’ This movie is one of the most expensive movies – documentaries – in the genre ever made,” he said at the Melania premiere. “It wasn’t about getting rich. I mean, I think the Trumps are wealthy and successful enough. This is about giving me the ability to hire the best crew in the world, to not only score the film with the best composer … I mean, when you see the movie, you’ll go, ‘Oh, we see where the money went now.’ This wasn’t about corruption.”In his review, the Guardian critic Xan Brooks described the documentary as “dispiriting, deadly and unrevealing”.“There is a decent documentary to be made about the former model from Slovenia, but this one is unredeemable,”he wrote.The film is currently scoring6%on reviews aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, and hassix out of 100on Metacritic. Meanwhile it has a rating of1.3/10from more than 32,000 votes on the Internet Movie Database – an improvement on its earlier score of 1.0, which made it IMDb’s lowest-rated movie of all time.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaMelania TrumpDocumentary filmsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve lucked out in this golden age of streaming shows, and so have theyTue 3 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 3 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareShrinking, the TV series about Jason Segel’s Jimmy, a grieving psychotherapist who can’t stop telling patients what he really thinks,seems pretty innocuous on paper. FromFrasiertoIn TreatmenttoSex Education, there’s no shortage of TV dramas about dysfunctional therapists. What marks Shrinking out from the crowd is the presence of Harrison Ford, who plays Jimmy’s octogenarian mentor. Here we see a Hollywood megastar getting high on edibles, wrestling with his failures as a father and trying to keep a lid on his Parkinson’s symptoms. Though Segel shares top billing with Ford, the latter is the main draw and gets all the best lines.Paramount’s 1923, showrunner Taylor Sheridan’s prequel toYellowstone, similarly draws on Ford’s elder statesman status as it depicts a ranching family’s efforts to maintain their wealth and status during the Great Depression. Ford’s co-star is Helen Mirren, another octogenarian actor who previously appeared with him in the 1986 film The Mosquito Coast. Set in Montana, 1923 is a classy drama that makes high art of its protagonists’ craggy features along with their penchant for brutality.So what should we make of the elders of cinema plying their trade on the small screen? In years gone by, the stars of Old Hollywood would have balked at moving into TV. To do so would have been a sure sign their career was on the rocks, though Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Collins both shrugged off the snobs in the 1980s when they joined the casts ofThe Thorn BirdsandDynastyrespectively. Collins became a bigger star as Dynasty’suber-bitch Alexis Carringtonthan she’d ever been as a twentysomething under contract at 20th Century Fox starring in films such asLand of the PharaohsandThe Opposite Sex. Conversely, Charlton Heston’s toe-curling turn on Dynasty spin-off The Colbys had the opposite effect, all but killing off his career. After that, the actor stuck to comedy cameos andNRA rallies.Today’s TV landscape clearly looks different for Hollywood stars wishing to branch out, offering more variety and, for the most part, a better class of drama than of yore. Think of Meryl Streep,who appeared inthe 2019 second series of Big Little Lies and, later on, gleefully hitched a ride on the hit Hulu comedyOnly Murders in the Building. Or Gary Oldman, who has playedDraculaandChurchillon the big screen, as an ageing spook in need of a wash inTV’s Slow Horses. Or Kathy Bates playing the septuagenarian attorney in Matlock, perpetually underestimated because of her age. Or Sly Stallone making his TV debut as aveteran mobster in Tulsa King, another series from Taylor Sheridan. In fact, Sheridan, who recently cast Kevin Costner and Billy Bob Thornton in Yellowstone and Landman, seems to be on a one-man mission to lure veteran male actors out of retirement.Big stars, little interest: when movie heavyweights fizzle on TVRead moreFew of these ageing stars could be accused of slumming it in what are mostly big-budget productions, even if they have a job on their hands getting noticed in the age of too much telly. There’s little sense of them dining out on past glories, either. When Jeff Bridges, big-screen star of The Fisher King and The Big Lebowski, was persuaded back to TV to play an elderly ex-CIA agent who struggles to put his socks on in the mornings, it was for FX Networks’ unequivocally titledThe Old Man. In Shrinking, Ford is required to lean into his elderly status and depict his character’s struggle with his encroaching infirmity. Compare that to the 2023 Indiana Jones rebootDial of Destiny, where, aged 80, he reprised his whip-cracking, stunt-happy action hero.That meaty TV roles are being written specifically for oldsters can only be good news – it’s certainly an improvement on putting them out to pasture in late middle age, as Hollywood was wont to do until recently – but currently it is still men getting the lion’s share of these parts. In acting, as in life, ruthlessageism has always disproportionately affected women, a situation expertly lampooned in Amy Schumer’s sketchLast Fuckable Day, in which three actors – Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette – celebrate one of their number’s last day of being “believably fuckable” in the eyes of the entertainment industry.Another factor driving the acting old guard to look to TV for work is that the movie industry is still feeling the financial hit of Covid-19 and the 2023writers’ and actors’ strikes. Budgets remain tight and megahits are now few and far between – last year,Snow White,Mickey 17,Christy,After the Huntand the Dwayne Johnson vehicleThe Smashing Machineall bombed at the box office. Meanwhile, viewers have the option of waiting until the big movies turn up on streaming services, which is sometimes a matter of days after the cinema release.Little wonder, then, that older actors want in on TV, where they can be seen by those viewers unwilling to drag themselves to the multiplex and where they can spend time developing complex characters. Meanwhile, the shows in question get gravitas, experience and star quality in return. Right now, there is much to be gloomy about in the creative industries, but this is a golden age for the pensionable actor for whom fresh glories and a third act beckon.Fiona Sturges is an arts writerExplore more on these topicsTV streamingOpinionHarrison FordMeryl StreepJeff BridgesUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

A professor of American literature at the University of Manchester, McGuire specialises in the late 19th-century realist tradition; at its best his work blends the unsparing violence of Cormac McCarthy with a bleak lyricism reminiscent of Welsh poet RS Thomas.Both The North Water, set onboard a whaling ship dispatched from Hull to Baffin Bay in 1859, andThe Abstainer, inspired by the hanging of three Irish rebels in Manchester a decade later, probed the grisly underbelly of Victorian imperialism, harsh worlds where a “man’s life on its own is nothing much to talk about”. In White River Crossing, McGuire travels across the Atlantic and back another 100 years to the Prince of Wales Fort, a remote trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Company in what is now northern Manitoba. Founded by royal charter in 1670 and granted sole right of trade and commerce across some 1.5m sq km of territory, the British venture was established to exploit the indigenous fur trade, but investors also hoped for other profitable discoveries, particularly silver and gold.It is the frozen winter of 1766 when a ragged pedlar brings a chunk of rock to Magnus Norton, the fort’s chief factor. The rock is “shot through with a pair of thin and branching yellow lines like twin rivers”, proof, the pedlar says, of gold fields in the Barren Grounds 600 miles north. Norton can barely contain his greed. He dispatches his deputy, John Shaw, and two other company men to seek out and claim the treasure, along with two couples of the Dene tribe, known to their white paymasters as Northern Indians, to serve as their hunters, guides and cooks. He is careful not to inform the company of his mission. He lets the other men in the fort believe that the mission is for copper ore. Norton is near retirement, his health is failing. A rich man already, he intends to return to England a good deal richer.White River Crossing moves at a propulsive lick, its bloody meat marbled with cruelty and violenceAlthough the novel moves between the viewpoints of all seven members of the group, it is granted mostly to the bookish Thomas Hearn to tell the story of the arduous and ill-fated expedition. Poleaxed by grief and loss of faith, Hearn, a one-time ordinand, has sealed himself up inside a fiercely austere self-restraint. Shaw, by contrast, is a man of brutish appetites for whom both the land and its peoples are chattels, his to exploit as he chooses. As they travel north the group encounter other communities and, when the younger of the Dene guides, the hot-headed Nabayah, loses his wife to a rival in a wrestling match, Shaw steps in and wins her back. Deaf to Hearn’s warnings, Shaw insists on a night with her as his reward. The consequences of his crude arrogance will undo them all.Like The North Water, with which it shares much DNA, White River Crossing moves at a propulsive lick, its bloody meat marbled with cruelty and violence. McGuire does not let us look away: the clumsy amputation of a gangrenous arm is described in almost voluptuous detail, while the desolate beauty of the vast landscape is summoned with a sharp precision, “the blueish peaks of frost-tipped hills” as crisply vivid as “the piles of shattered marrow bone and antler”.Inside his characters’ heads, however, McGuire moves with less confidence. Backstories provide context but little complexity or depth. Hearn is convincing enough as a man who, broken open by horror, is remade anew, but Shaw, like Drax in The North Water, is a frustratingly one-dimensional villain and Abel Walker, the third company man, mostly overlooked. As for the Dene guides, whose perspective might have given this story a very different complexion, they are quickly swallowed by the plot.In a foreword to the novel, no doubt to pre-empt criticisms of cultural appropriation, McGuire stresses the paucity of first-hand Dene histories and defends his choice in the novel “to emphasise commonality over cultural or historical difference”. The decision is misguided. It is when he abandons that imagined commonality, giving his Indigenous characters the scope to see the world entirely on their own terms, that he succeeds most powerfully: a scene in which a shaman uses his powers to expel an evil spirit from the body of a sick child is one of the most striking – and affecting – in the novel. By emphasising commonalities, in scrupulously eradicating deep cultural difference, McGuire diminishes the power of the four Dene guides to transform the narrative and begs the very question he sought to duck about whether their story was really ever his to tell.White River Crossing by Ian McGuire is published by Scribner (£20).

Back in 2009, Kate Pickett’sThe Spirit Level(co-authored with Richard Wilkinson) argued that inequality was the ultimate cause of almost all our social problems, from obesity and teenage pregnancy to violent crime; more equal societies, they claimed, had better outcomes across the board. While criticised – as most “big idea” books are – for overstating the case and cherrypicking evidence, they struck a chord, and some aspects of their thesis are now mainstream.However, when it comes to the UK, there is an awkward problem, both for Pickett and for economists like me who, while not entirely convinced by The Spirit Level, would still like to see a more equal society. In the first chapter of Pickett’s new book, inequality is once again the root of all (social) evils: “if you know a country’s level of inequality, you can do a pretty good job of predicting its infant mortality rate, or prevalence of mental illness, or levels of homicide or imprisonment”. By contrast, she argues that GDP or GDP growth are very poor measures of overall welfare. Pickett then goes on to list the ways in which the UK has become a worse place to live since 2010 – higher child poverty, flattening life expectancy and child mortality, more people in prison.But what actually happened to inequality and GDP over this period? On Pickett’s own preferred measure, the Palma ratio,inequality peaked in 2008and has fallen considerably since then, as the tax system has become significantly more progressive. Meanwhile, growth in GDP has been very slow compared to the previous two decades. If you’d asked Pickett in 2010 whether she’d have accepted this trade – much slower growth in GDP in return for more progressive taxation and lower inequality, she’d presumably have jumped at it. But now, like most of the rest of us, she’s less than happy with the results.Rather than addressing this puzzle, Pickett largely dodges it. The Good Society has lots of ideas: that is, rather than one unifying concept, it covers policy problems and solutions across health, education, criminal justice, social care, and elsewhere. In each case, she diagnoses the failures of our current model and suggests alternatives, mostly drawn from the successful social democracies of northern Europe.The problem is that because – as she commendably admits – she has neither the expertise nor the space to provide a detailed analysis of these topics, we end up with a whistle-stop tour of the greatest hits of progressive social policy, from Finnish schools to Norwegian prisons. If you’re instinctively sympathetic to the view that we imprison too many people, that we should value care work more, that the education system is too exam-focused and so on, then you will probably nod along to much of this. But if you’re not already convinced, you’re unlikely to change your mind. And for those who do have expertise in one of these topics – and can spot the holes, or at least the oversimplifications – this compendium is less than the sum of its parts.More interesting – perhaps because Pickett has researched the topic in depth herself – is her section on Universal Basic Income. Working with my frequent co-author and friend Howard Reed, she has helped produce detailed, costed blueprints for a UK UBI. I think she overstates the case, though: it’s simply false to claim that a UBI would eliminate the need for means-testing or eligibility tests, since the main drivers of these in the UK system are incapacity and housing benefit, which would still be needed even with a UBI. And most of the small-scale studies of UBI so far have failed to find the transformational benefits she claims. Whether you agree or disagree, however, this at least represents a serious and substantive proposal for tackling both inequality and injustice.Finally, in an attempt to address the political obstacles to achieving any of this, Pickett concludes with an appeal for the greater use of evidence in policymaking, combined with citizens’ juries. Sadly, this just makes her sound out of touch in the current political context. I wish I could believe her claim that “a fairer, healthier, more caring and sustainable society is entirely within our grasp”, but I’m afraid I ended this book no more optimistic than when I started it.The Good Society: And How We Make It is published by Bodley Head (£25).

From Possum Magic and Animalia to Who Sank the Boat? there was a voracious appetite to see Australia represented for kids in a way it hadn’t been before. Like everyone my age, I grew up with these books and I read them to my own children.Forty years on, these books remain beloved – it’s no wonder they’re leadingGuardian Australia’s reader poll of the best picture books of all time. But today the creation ofnewhomegrown classics – which is increasingly important – has become increasingly difficult. The publishing landscape that created and nurtured the success of legacy titles has changed and the prospect of selling five million copies is now itself a thing of storybooks.As Graeme Base saidwhen asked what would happen if you pitched Animalia today: “You’d fail – miserably, I suspect.”Australia’s best children’s picture book poll - vote nowRead moreToday’s children’s authors face challenges their predecessors did not: the proliferation of celebrity authors, AI books, diminished shelf time and the vanishing of school librarians. This has made getting new books into small hands a tricky endeavour. A book that takes two years to make may spend two weeks in a bookshop before being filed away on the shelf, facing what publishers call “death by spine”.Another challenge is the dominance of nostalgic books: classic titles that continue to occupy pole position due largely to the emotional recall of the person buying the book – an adult. Publishers respond by ensuring constant reprints and anniversary editions are in perennial supply.This can give rise to the notion that older books are what kids are reading today; that they are of a better quality and capture childhood in a way new books don’t. This would be a distortion. The standard of Australian children’s books remains world-class – just ask any teacher librarian (if you can still find one!).But what contemporary books do that most legacy titles don’t is reflect the world that children currently live in and its values. Think ofthat pagein There’s a Hippopotamus On Our Roof Eating Cake, where mum suffers through her salad diet – it’s out of whack with the self-acceptance we aim to mirror to our children today. Think of The Tiger Who Came to Tea: a single-income household waiting patiently for dad to arrive home from work is just not the reality for the majority of families.Books that reflect diverse cultures and different family structures allow young readers to see the fullness of their community in fiction. They also feed a child’s natural curiosity and help them develop greater empathy towards others. Stories such as White Sunday, for instance, which welcomes us into the home and culture of a Samoan family; and Come Over to My House, which explores deafness and disability; and Under the Love Umbrella, which represents different family structures, including LGBTQIA+ families.Legacy titles such asthe Rainbow Serpenthave been crucial in representing Indigenous culture over the decades, but other examples from that period are thin on the ground. Meanwhile, there are many contemporary First Nations authors – such as Kirli Saunders, Gregg Dreise and Trevor Fourmile – who are generously sharing their culture and stories with young readers today.View image in fullscreenRoom on our Rock by Kate and Jol Temple, illustrated by Terri Rose Baynton.Photograph: Scholastic AustraliaModern children’s fiction also plays a unique role in helping children unpack difficult social and environmental issues and create space for them to safely explore. My own book, Room on Our Rock, is inspired by the ongoing global humanitarian refugee crisis – an issue that can be difficult for young children, yet one that will continue to be part of the world they grow up in. Fiction permits them to build resilience and critical thinking, while allegory allows them to take from the story what they wish.Writers and illustrators want to help children connect to the world around them and see themselves in these books – but finding reach in a market drawn to nostalgia is an uphill battle.To create the next generation of life-long readers, we need to foster our local creative industry and encourage new classics anchored in this era. Next time we go into a bookshop, we need to ask: what’s new? What are kids reading today? If we don’t make more room on the shelves next to our legacy titles, we may be left asking: Who Sank The Boat?Kate Temple has written more than 40 books for children including the Bin Chicken series.

Well, not quite. The Sundance we all know, with Robert Redford as its head and Park City, Utah, as its location, is over. The festival’s beloved founderdied last yearmonths after the festival also opted fora move to Boulder, Colorado.But on the alarmingly snow-light ground, there was also chatter about what would become of Sundance as a whole, once the shining beacon of American independent cinema, after it entered a new phase. There were standout films as ever but again notquiteenough to override concerns over what the festival now represents in a harsh new world where it’s arguably easier to make an indie (or whatever cobbling together bits of AI slop might be called) but harder to get it sold.‘The world is hurting right now’: politics and protest hit the Sundance film festivalRead moreThe identity of the festival has long been attached to both Redford and Utah as well as a certain type of movie and a certain definition of independent cinema. The old-fashioned dream trajectory for a Sundance movie – rapturous reception at premiere, heated all-night auction, sleeper success upon theatrical release, possibly a few Oscar nominations next – is harder, if not entirely impossible, to achieve in this landscape. There are textbooks examples of this working – films like Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and The Big Sick – but there are now more roadblocks in place as well as a generation of film-makers raised on these films trying a little too hard to conjure the same magic. Attenders, and attention-hungry critics with X or Letterboxd followings, have tried to force this in recent years, often at a high enough volume to convince studios, or increasingly streamers, to bite, but when viewed without all that altitude, hits have turned to misses. There’s been Patti Cake$, Brittany Runs a Marathon, Blinded by the Night, Late Night, and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl all barely existing outside Utah, and while there have always been Sundance gambles that haven’t paid off (Happy, Texas or Hamlet 2, anyone?), we’re at a time when each loss hits harder, risks that much less justifiable in the heads of cautious execs.The idea of a Sundance movie has slowly shifted and stratified over time – the horror breakout, the must-see doc, the arthouse hit, the comedian-does-drama awards play, the sizzle reel for more commercial work – and this year gave us all of that and more. Again, the films that feel less calculated, less factory-made to appeal to a Sundance audience, were the ones that worked best. Last year, narrative standouts for me were films likeLurker(a dark music industry thriller about obsession and celebrity),Twinless(a genre-shifting tale of sex, lies and identity),Together(a wild body horror riffing on extreme co-dependency) andIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You(an abrasive, darkly funny spiral about the exhaustion of motherhood), all uniquely formed, not calculated to speak to a past Sundance or appease the audience at a new one.View image in fullscreenGemma Chan, Mason Reeves and Channing Tatum in Josephine.Photograph: Greta ZozulaIn a similar vein, the best film I saw this year wasJosephine, a devastating film about the fallout from an eight-year-old girl witnessing a sexual assault told in a way we just haven’t really seen before. On paper it sounds too familiar (Serious Issue drama is another Sundance subgenre), but director Beth de Araujo turns it into something wholly original and deeply affecting, a seat-edge parental nightmare that exists somewhere close to horror without dipping into nasty exploitation. It was the film everyone was talking about on the ground (and the one I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since) and managed something relatively unusual in winning both the grand jury prize and audience award. The grand jury prize in itself has lost much meaning (Nanny, Atropia and In the Summers all recent, little-known winners), but scooping up both has tended to be reserved for films with a brighter future (Minari, Coda, Whiplash, Fruitvale Station). I could see Channing Tatum, who plays one of the more fascinatingly written and performed father characters I’ve seen in some time, gaining awards heat (I’d be shocked if he’s not a best supporting actor frontrunner this time next year) but the film is still unsold. I imagine it’s down to the difficult subject matter (the uncensored rape scene is an extremely tough watch) but also the uncomfortable way that it’s handled (I was told of a producer storming out after exclaiming, “That’s it, I’ve had enough!”).Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreIt’s also still a slower sales market than it once was. Sundance is the most market-led film festival we have, the overwhelming majority of films going in without distribution, but buyers have become more wary – at least outside of those with the most cash (see: Netflix). At the end of last year’s festival, titles starring Jennifer Lopez, Josh O’Connor, Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman still hadn’t found buyers, while this year it’s been similarly quiet.View image in fullscreenOlivia Wilde and Seth Rogen.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for CasamigosThere was excitement over Olivia Wilde’sThe Invite, which had a real slam-dunk Saturday-night premiere (Wilde called it “the best night of my life”). The sour, starry comedy, starring Wilde, Seth Rogen, Penélope Cruz and Edward Norton as two couples bickering and flirting through an increasingly revealing, and kinky, night together, played like gangbusters and, as someone who has sat through many an unfunny festival comedy that has still found laughs from an audience eager to delude themselves, this was a rare communal experience I could take part in. It led to an old-fashioned auction with pretty much every major studio or streamer making a bid, but Wilde, who has shown herself to be a craft-first film-maker who really cares about classic cinema, rightfully demanded a theatrical release and found the film a home at A24. I’d say it’s more sophisticated studio comedy than “cool” indie (more Toronto than Sundance ultimately, I was hoping Warner’s new independent label would win out) but it was a reported $12m-plus sale for a film that more than deserves it. Wilde had quite the festival, also impressing in a far different comedic role in Gregg Araki’s otherwise lukewarm dom-sub rompI Want Your Sex, earning herself belle of the ball status, something that many had expected Charli xcx to snag, starring in three films being unveiled. But her big mock docThe Momentunderwhelmed and smaller, cameo-sized roles in comedies didn’t do much to reassure that her big-screen assault (there are more films to come) will be Brat-sized.The Invite review – A-list ensemble electrify hilarious couples night gone wrong comedyRead moreThe other major sale, albeit on a far smaller scale, was a far more organic Sundance success story: a small, Australian queer horror calledLeviticus. I remain cold on the rather misleading title but the film, about a conversion therapy curse that causes gay teens to be plagued by a demon looking like the one person they most desire, was a knockout. The instant Heated Rivalry comparisons felt a little SEO-inspired (gay sex did in fact exist before that show), but I think its inescapable success did help nudge a film such as this, which was heavy on gay love and lust, from a Shudder maybe to a Neon yes. The company, which has had major awards success in recent years and a hit-and-miss track record with horror, paid around $5m, which does at least take pressure off the film to become a mega-hit (last year’s $17m sale of Together led to just $21m at the US box office). With a smart campaign and an almost perfect critical score so far, it could be a nice small-scale late summer breakout, if not a Talk to Me-sized hit. It also helped to maintain the festival’s horror credentials with other offerings (Buddy, Rock Springs, Saccharine) disappointing.View image in fullscreenLeviticus director Adrian Chiarella and his stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen and Mia Wasikowska.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesDisappointments, well there were many, most of which felt like limp attempts to speak to older, better Sundance movies (overdirected and underwritten small-town dramedies likeCarouselandChasing Summer). The worst was the Dead Pigs director Cathy Yan’s star-packed art world satireThe Gallerist, which wasted Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Catherine Zeta-Jones. It was a grating, antically unfunny slog (even though, like most Sundance films, it was short, it did not feel that way), plus it had the misfortune of premiering right after The Invite, where laughs dissipated into groans. Despite that cast (three Oscar winners!), there has been no buzz over a potential sale.Once Upon a Time in Harlem review – remarkable Harlem Renaissance documentaryRead moreThe festival started on the same day as the Oscar nominations, which brought good news for last year’s narrative crop – nods for If I Had Legs I’d Kick You and Train Dreams – but great news for documentaries. Last year, four of the five nominated docs were Sundance premieres, but this year it was all five, the festival having turned into the most desirable place to premiere a nonfiction film, and while this year was lighter on more obvious breakouts, there were enough to suggest the Academy might once again turn to the festival for recommendations. The doc everyone was talking about wasOnce Upon a Time in Harlem, a slick assemblage of archival footage from a 70s dinner party that reunited key figures from the Harlem Renaissance. Summer of Soul, which also premiered at the fest and was a film that breathed new life into old footage also in Harlem, managed to snag an Oscar win, so while sales news has been quiet, I would expect a deluge of offers.With whispers over who might buy what limited to mostly The Invite, most people I spoke to were more curious over what Sundance might become when it moves to Boulder. The festival has maintained a steady stream of rich Utah attenders who have very little respect for personal space (I’ve never had more jackets unfolded over or on to me in my life) but a lot of money to splash on priority passes and premiere tickets. A similar community will exist in Colorado with similarly big hats, but it’ll take time to get them onside, especially with both the Denver and Telluride film festivals already taking place in the state. What the state does have on its side is better politics (a rumoured concern for leaving Utah with an increase in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation among other issues) and more affordable lodging, a hope that a more diverse cross-section of critics might be able to attend (Park City remains absurdly overpriced).The biggest questions are more existential. What is Sundance now? What do we want or need from independent cinema? What does the system allow or encourage as it now stands? A change of location isn’t going to change the films that are being made, and while quality might have weakened, it remains an important American institution especially as new, awful mergers threaten to squeeze out the underdog. Sundance will return next year in Colorado with a lot of expectations, and hopefully a refresh will mean sights will be set less on the old and more on the new.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2026Sundance film festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are the diamonds of future law-abiding peacetime prosperity under communist rule – that is, effective rule by those who started the war invading Poland in league with the Nazis – preferable to the ashes of wartime suffering which at least offered certainty and purpose?The scene is a provincial Polish town on VE Day, 8 May 1945. Across the continent, there are complex and unresolved feelings under all the celebration, nowhere more so than in Poland, the historic centre of the European war. Maciek (Zbigniew Cybulski), Andrzej (Adam Pawlikowski) and Drewnowski (Bogumił Kobiela) are three fighters in the home army resistance movement, patriotically opposed to communists as much as Nazis. They consider their mission in no way halted by the end of the war, but they have just grotesquely bungled their latest task of assassinating Communist party apparatchik Szczuka (Wacław Zastrzeżyński); lounging around and sunbathing before the hit, they accidentally kill two innocent young people.Nauseated by his failure, horrified by accidentally witnessing the grief of a young woman engaged to one of his two innocent victims, and realising himself exhausted by the war’s end, Maciek is nonetheless ordered by his superiors to try again. He must kill Szczuka, who is due to attend a victory banquet and stay overnight at the seedy state-run Hotel Monopol, whose name is a twist of black comedy on its own. Maciek gets a room next to the one occupied by Szczuka, who is to learn that his own teenage son is working for the insurgents. Maciek flirts with barmaid Krystyna (Ewa Krzyżewska) and inveigles her to his room, which is now more important as the site of lovemaking than a base for political killing. He is struck by a terrible epiphany: he is in love with Krystyna, or at any rate he knows he is now a lover, not a fighter. The war is over. If he refuses this mission, it won’t mean he is a coward or a traitor … will it? Why did he want to kill this man anyway? Or anyone? What has it all been for? “I can’t kill or hide any more!” he wails to his commanding officer, who remains unmoved.Meanwhile, the banquet continues and degenerates into a drunken bacchanal. Drewnowski gets horribly drunk while angling for a job in the press under the new dispensation; scenes showing squares of newsprint used as lavatory paper give a clear indication of just how noble that is. Maciek and Krystyna wander the streets, encounter a ruined church where the crucified Christ now swings crazily upside down, encounter Norwid’s poem and make a terrible discovery about who else is there.Why does Maciek wear dark glasses, asks Krystyna. Maciek replies: “A souvenir of unrequited love for the homeland.” The sunglasses make him look perennially in disguise, incognito, unable to show his loyalties. He will ultimately take them off, but there is no corresponding liberation or revelation. Everywhere in this film is sadness and a kind of delirium: the film was made just 13 years after the events it described; the original novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski on which it is based just three years. It is a testament to Poland’s crisis of identity and ideology.Ashes and Diamonds is at the BFI Southbank, London, on 4 February then tours as part of the Kinoteka Polish film festival.Andrzej Wajda: Portraits of History and Humanityis at BFI Southbank, ICA and Ciné Lumière in London until 26 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAndrzej WajdaSecond world warPolandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The first is the brown bear, which was hunted out of existence in the region by the early 2000s.Now the bears are back, around 70 of them, thanks to efforts by conservationists backed by the European Union. The film opens with footage of a 200kg delivery by helicopter, lowering a crate on to the mountainside out of which a bear comes thundering out.The airmail delivery is necessary because of local opposition – farmers are barricading the roads, painting “no to bears” on the tarmac, saying that bears kill their livestock. Shepherd Yves, 63 – flat cap, cigarette dangling from his mouth – is against the reintroduction of the bears. He is training Lisa, a shepherd in her 20s, but their way of life is the other endangered species, with few young people joining the industry.In the local bar, an expert on the TV explains that 85% of a brown bear’s diet is vegetarian, and protein mostly comes from insects and other small creatures. “Pah!” say the shepherds, who have woken up to find their sheep half-eaten, sometimes still breathing. Whichever side of the argument you instinctively find yourself on – team bear or team shepherd – the film resists snap judgments. Keegan shot the footage over three years, and the locals clearly see him as part of the furniture and ignore the camera.We hear a slightly hectoring pro-bear commentator on TV say that we humans must to learn to live in harmony with the natural world. Tell that to the shepherds, who are constantly outdoors, with the changing mood of seasons breathtakingly captured by Keegan and his co-director of photography Clément Beauvois. But then a farmer is taken by her budding wildlife photographer son to view a bear and its two cubs, and is awestruck by the beauty of it. There are no easy answers here.The Shepherd and the Bear is in UK cinemas from 6 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsConservationFarmingFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Our hero is one Merrick Beckford, played by Myles Clohessy (son of character actor Robert Clohessy), who has been entrusted by William H Macy (in a single-scene cameo) with a wagonload of medical supplies in need of a courier.Along the way, Merrick encounters a father-son duo, Mule (Thomas Jane) and Billy (Ryan Masson), a wrong ’un called Edmund (Armie Hammer, appearing on screen for the first time since 2022’s Death on the Nile), and a wounded husband (Eli Brown) and defenceless wife (Mary Stickley). As obvious weak link Billy, Masson is particularly good; poor decision-making feels written into his physicality and way of being in the world, and you’re just waiting to see how this weird little guy is going to mess up.There’s probably at least one too many of the others, though. Clohessy, Brown, Jane and Hammer make for a quartet of handsome guys, playing varying shades on the moral spectrum. Attempts have been made to disguise said handsomeness under layers of grizzle and grime, but any one of them could and has played the hero. Because this is a film determined to be character-driven, it takes time to unravel their various issues, giving rise to a surfeit of talky scenes – somewhat at odds with a genre whose greatest poetic strength was always the ability of a man of few words to telegraph endless meaning with a lingering glance.The model here should perhaps have beenthe Ranown Cycle: inexpensive but beautiful and brisk character-driven westerns none of which are longer than 80 minutes. Still, Frontier Crucible does look lovely, with plenty of evocative shots of Monument Valley and, while gorehounds may feel they have to wait too long for it, there’s some effectively staged violence reminiscent of2015 breakout hit Bone Tomahawk, with whom it shares some of the same creative team.Frontier Crucible is on digital platforms from 2 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsArmie HammerreviewsShareReuse this content"

What are the implications for a community when a woman lies dead in her home for more than a year without being discovered? All the signs are there, from the slowly seeping stench in the hallway to the maggots emerging in the homes of her neighbours.Questions of responsibility and culpability, both individual and systemic, are raised in Najib’s play. Its central, sad scenario is not as far-fetched as it may sound: the deceased, Shirley, is fictional but the play takes inspiration from the real, lonely deaths of several women listed at the beginning of the script, includingSheila Seleoanewho lay dead for more than two years before she was discovered.Three storytellers (Marcia Lecky, Sam Baker Jones and Safiyya Ingar) describe events leading up to Shirley’s discovery from the point of view of her neighbours – a single mother, a cleaner, a middle-aged widower and his grieving daughter among them. The drama underlines its artifice rather redundantly (we are actors, the actors tell us). But there is intimacy and richness in the stories they tell, with a deft creation of interior life even though the third-person narration should technically distance us.The Rat Trap review – teenage Noël Coward’s jaundiced marital portraitRead moreIn a production directed by Jess Barton, a spotlight is used to create focus and stillness (lighting design by Peter Small), backstories are folded into the present and humour is entwined into a story of death and desolation. Caitlin Mawhinney’s set design, with the beauty of dried flowers overhead even as we are told about maggots and skeletal remains, delivers in irony.But there is a fuzziness in the play around bigger systemic failures that lack the forensic detail needed to devastate. The pushand pull between the human need to connect versus urban isolation is reminiscent of Alexander Zeldin’sBeyond Caringand Kae Tempest’sLet Them Eat Chaos, but the play does not tie together the personal and political nearly half as rigorously. The central arc around the maggots appears to be building to a surrealist horror on insect invasion but stops short to serve as little more than backdrop.It has an anticlimactic effect, as does the leavening of darkness with a benign tone of goodness and warmth. Najib has a knack for drawing you into her world, even if she pulls her punches in it.AtBush theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Noël Coward’s characters often struggle to fit their romantic and creative ambitions into conventional shapes. This rarely seen, jaundiced marital comedy suggests that the interest started early – Coward was just 18 when he completed it at the end of the first world war, though it was first staged in 1926.A century on, playwright Bill Rosenfield and the enterprisingTroupe theatre company“reimagine” the play – streamlining the plot and florid dialogue. Two young writers, novelist Sheila and budding playwright Keld, embark on marriage, pursuing domestic bliss and artistic success. Something has to give – and, although she’s the brains of the pair, it is Sheila who relinquishes ambition to allow Keld to flourish.View image in fullscreenScent and spite … Zoe Goriely in The Rat Trap.Photograph: Mitzi de MargaryRosenfield relates the play to Ibsen (you might think of A Doll’s House), while other observers mention Strindberg’s acrid marriage plays. These sombre lodestars suggest that The Rat Trap isn’t exactly a comedy – Coward hadn’t yet developed his chrome-plated twists of phrase or predatory banter.Lily Nichol’s Sheila begins in eye-rolling splendour. Her boho prints and flappy trousers (spiffy costumes by Libby Watson) create art deco curves between hip and shoulder. As trouble hits paradise, she shrinks, stills, stops taking up space – subdued in politely pressed pleats. It’s dismaying to watch her light dim, and Kirsty Patrick Ward’s production, which can’t lift the play’s bickering comedy, is tender with its misery.Ewan Miller doesn’t disguise Keld’s self-regard. He may be ruffle-haired and boyish, but he also bridles and bullies and is foul to the shrewd housekeeper (an excellent Angela Sims). He’s a second-rate talent, insufferable even in abjection.Characters around the central pair question what marriage means: Gina Bramhill’s shrewd singleton or Zoe Goriely’s minx, arriving in a cloud of scent and spite. There’s no template for love among the artists, and an unexpected ending hardly lifts the spirits.Troupe make a staunch case for Coward’s youthful effort. “I think it will only be interesting as a play to ardent students of my work,” he said – but though he would later write more piercingly about intractable desires, he sharpened his claws in The Rat Trap.AtPark theatre, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreNoel CowardComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

For Christie has found her happy place: serenely single, professionally triumphant (on the telly too, after years not finding a niche there), and absolved by menopause of the need to give a toss about almost anything. There’s comedy in that freedom from care, and Christie mines it plentifully in an entertaining 90 minutes majoring – like her Channel 4 showThe Change– in what life looks like for women (or at least, this woman) when oestrogen gets out of the way.But Jacket Potato Pizza feels like a placeholder of a show, lacking the fervour or clownish fury of her best work. Its short first half begins by contrasting quotations from Presidents Obama and Trump – but that gives a misleading impression of what’s in store. More indicative is the routine that follows, in which Christie re-enacts a story as told by her menopausal pal, a banal tale of a night out turned into a symphony of digressions, malapropisms (mixing the Benjamins Zephaniah and Netanyahu, most memorably) and vocabulary tantalisingly out of reach. It’s as much sketch as standup, and our host brings it to life with characteristic pop-eyed dismay.View image in fullscreenPeachy material … Bridget Christie.Photograph: Natasha PszenickiSuch is life for the fiftysomething female, as Christie would have it: recording her farts for friends on WhatsApp; reporting to her doctor ever more exotic bodily malfunctions; socially invisible and entirely pleased about it. Two anecdotes early in the show contrast eager-to-please young Christie with her later-in-life counterpart – the one indulging a date’s improbable sexual fetish, the other caring not a jot when her gardener catches her eating cake directly from the bin.You can’t not enjoy this stuff: Christie’s demob-happiness is infectious, and her flair intact for constructing, routine by routine, mini-carnivals of her own ridiculousness. But there’s a sense too that she’s in her comfort zone with this material – and that one or two routines aren’t quite up to snuff. The number on Alan Carr and The Traitors is too throwaway to justify the clunky segue from ICE killings in Minnesota. A joke about Jimmy Savile and adding new clauses to her will feels a bit arbitrary and unmoored.There’s peachy material too, like the routine (which she wishes us to understand – honest, guv – doesn’t draw on her own family life) on the thermonuclear obnoxiousness of 15-year-old girls. But I found myself wishing for more of the political edge that animates a later section, in which Christie takes issue with the TV drama Adolescence. The excitement, of an opinion both passionate and provocative, and ventured with her trademark 10-ton sarcasm, is palpable.‘My reproductive life is over? That’s liberating!’ Bridget Christie on comedy, TV and the menopauseRead moreWhile the show concludes with sobering words about the state of the world, the politics are seldom integrated into the comedy here.

Sea Beneath the Skin takes that a whole ocean further. The brainchild of the Samoan director, artist and choreographer Lemi Ponifasio, it’s an unclassifiable music-theatre piece that’s less a collision of worlds than a collusion between them.It begins with a woman walking on to the dark, glossy-floored stage, on which two white pillars stretch up to the roof to represent the trunks of giant kauri trees. Her song, rich-toned and short-phrased, is eventually answered by another woman high in the auditorium, and their duet grows in urgency and intensity. Later there will be four black-clad men dancing a neat cyclical routine involving lots of body percussion, then a third woman facing us down with terrifyingly aggressive shouted chants, and then a young man in Kiribati ceremonial dress, pouring white sand on to the stage from a black plastic bucket. What do these mean? It’s not clear, but they all frame and link the six movements of Mahler’s song cycle, in which the two singers are on stage as characters in some kind of undefined narrative.View image in fullscreenStrikingly different … Sea Beneath the Skin/Song of the Earth.Photograph: Mark AllanThe first notes of the Mahler sounded ornate, strange and almost bejewelled in this new context, even though theBritten Sinfoniawere playing a version by Iain Farrington that condenses Mahler’s huge orchestra, efficiently and imaginatively, to just 16 players. There were translations of the texts for the Mahler songs but not the Pasifika chants, which reinforced the idea, perhaps inevitable in London, that the latter were the “exotic” components – but you could argue that this allowed the imagination more space. The actual texts of the Mahler seemed of secondary importance to the passion put into their delivery by the tenor Sean Panikkar, sounding especially heroic of voice in the first song, and the velvet-toned mezzo-soprano Fleur Barron.They and the conductor Nuno Coelho were only partly visible, playing from behind a gauze at the back. The gauze formed the screen for some largely monochrome videos: flowers opening, underwater explosions, people who might have been wading through floods. Blurry and broken up by the tree trunks, they were often hard to make out and didn’t seem designed to coincide with the music with any precision. For this reason Sea Beneath the Skin, which was first seen in its current form in Luxembourg in 2024, still has the feel of a work in progress. Yet put it next to other works on the theme of climate change – theBarbican’s Fragile Earthseries is showcasing several – and it feels absorbingly, strikingly different: not a lecture but an appeal to the senses and the imagination.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaTheatreGustav MahlerBritten SinfoniareviewsShareReuse this content"

The paintings themselves are substantial – as large as 8ft by 16ft – and their intricacy compels lengthy gazes. Furthermore, the artist has impeccably arranged the space, conjuring an impactful and holistic experience from start to finish. “I’m always interested in talking with architecture and planning out how you can have an experience that unravels over time,” Sze told me via video interview.Long known as a masterful practitioner of collage, Sze here draws on landscapes as a general means of organizing the space on her canvas, but then radically alters them to offer experiences that at once feel both subtly familiar and utterly fresh.Artist Sarah Sze: ‘We’ve created a system that can destroy us. That’s new’Read more“I wanted there to be just enough so that you’re constantly reading it as a landscape, but you’re still having to put it together,” Sze said. “The goal is to get to a place where the work is talking back to you.”In creating works that feel as though they are constantly in flux and constantly forcing viewers to reorient, Sze was inspired by contemporary society, where the proliferation of images and video recorded on smartphones, as well as the exclusive spread of AI deepfakes and misinformation promulgated by powerful actors, has led to a world that feels fundamentally unmoored.“I feel like we’ve become so preoccupied with images outside of our eyes. How do we place ourselves in a world that constantly feels like it’s shifting all the time, when it’s not very obvious if information is even true or not?” Sze pondered. “With these images I want you to be actively trying to orient yourself within them, to actively be in that state of trying to find an orientation.”View image in fullscreenSarah Sze – Escape Artist, 2026.Photograph: Photo: Maris Hutchinson, courtesy the artist and GagosianChromatically cohesive, the six paintings are awash in the colors of dusk and dawn – ultramarines, lavenders, pastel yellows and icy blues – spattered with bursts of light that call to mind globular clusters of stars. They also drop in subtle touches, like a pair of hands spreading out a deck of cards as though inviting the viewer to take one, or a shadowy fox that seems to be dashing across the painting. Broad, jagged vertical bands shoot through these works, while skinny lines burst and skitter at all angles. The result feel like a contradiction, paintings that are constantly vibrating with a feeling of movement yet restful and contained in their wholeness.“I want there to be this experience where you are teetering all the time – you’re disoriented, and then you orient yourself and then you’re disoriented again,” said Sze. “A work of art is finished when everything teeters. I want this idea of the perfect tension, where everything is on a tightrope.”For her video installation Sleepers – one of two featured in the show – Sze drew on two very different personal experiences: the escalating terror of a moment when she nearly drowned, and the contemplative intimacy of watching her daughters sleep. The rising human breath that grounds Sleepers is Sze’s own breathing, which she recorded while running, taking the idea from a powerful memory of her own gasping as she fought for her very life. “I had a near drowning experience,” Sze recalled, “and I realized I was in trouble when I could hear myself gasping. The idea that your body can talk to you is important for that piece.”View image in fullscreenSarah Sze – Sleepers, 2024.Photograph: Photo: Maris Hutchinson, courtesy the artist and GagosianVisually, Sleepers is based around video recordings that Sze made of her two daughters while they slept. In part the installation is about what it’s like to be a mother, of watching time slip away as one’s daughters speedrun the accelerated experience that is childhood, and trying to grab on to those fleeting moments of calm and closeness that are a part of raising children. “There’s a kind of real intimacy and tenderness when you see someone else asleep,” said Sze. “Their vulnerability and your own inability to engage in what they’re engaged with. That idea of being there and being completely in a world that you can’t enter.”In trying to change how we look at our image-saturated world with Feel Free, Sze was inspired by two major figures of the 19th century – Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey – for how their studies of animal movement changed the way people saw the world. Among other things, Muybridge settled the debate about whether all four of a horse’s hooves leave the ground when it gallops, and Marey, among other things, showed how cats manage to always land on their feet. “Muybridge and Marey were really interesting to me, they were arguably the first film-makers. They used images to prove something physical in the world, to see the world in a way that we might not notice otherwise,” Sze said. “I think it’s a really interesting idea that art can be a tool for sharpening the way we see the world.”View image in fullscreenSarah Sze – Feel Free, 2026, installation.Photograph: Maris Hutchinson/Photo: Maris Hutchinson Courtesy GagosianBeyond wanting to challenge audiences to look differently at the vast array of images that are now a part of everyday life, Sze also took great pleasure in making these pieces. Contrasting these paintings with others that she has really struggled to bring together, this body of work put her into more of a flow state where she was able to act on her intuition and sink into the creative process. “There was a lot of pleasure in making the work,” she said. “I really enjoyed making them, and I think that joy probably comes out in them. I did things that were strange for me, and one thing just led to the next and I just kind of trusted it. I wanted the videos and the paintings to just really meld.”Sze hopes that Feel Free will help audiences tap into what is going on inside of their own brains, helping them explore the treasure trove of memories that each person holds. “I think paintings are super important right now because they are vehicles to see things in our own heads,” she said.In their continual deconstruction and reconstruction, these paintings give insights into how our very view of the world is in fact a creative process, one that is in part informed by the many images we are constantly taking in. “That becomes a subject of the show, how an artwork can be not only a way to see the world but also an active way of seeing how we construct images,” Sze said. “Hopefully that idea is being activated.”Sarah Sze: Feel Free is on display until 28 February at Gagosian Beverly HillsExplore more on these topicsSarah SzeArtDesigninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The sudden flood of light, that howling rush of air. Clearly, it’s not just me who thinks trains are the new (old) planes, with 2025 having seen a7% risein UK train travel, and more Europeans than ever looking to hit the rails.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s late December, and I’m heading out on a slow-train journey across the historic railways of the Swiss Alps and the Italian lakes. It’s a trip of roughly 1,800 miles (2,900km), crossing five countries, almost entirely by scenic daytime trains.What is clear from the off is how easy, and slightly disorientating, this type of train travel can be: drifting through stations, across platforms and over borders, it’s hard to believe we’ve hit three countries in less than a day – the UK, France and Switzerland – such is the ease of each passport stop. Gone are the sweaty finger scans of airport border control, replaced by the most polite immigration police I’ve ever encountered. “You’ve travelled a lot,” one says, with a wry smile and a German shepherd, to which I reply “legally”, just to cover my back.View image in fullscreenJonnie Bayfield took the spectacular Gotthard route.Photograph: Jakub Korczyk/AlamyOutside, the French countryside soon blurs into Swiss hills, all behind a thin veil of white, wintry light. The fields, with their clumps of bare trees, seem suspended in mid-freeze, as though bracing for the full blast to come. As we roll into Zurich, we catch our first glimpse of the milky Alpine peaks.This is the thrill of train trips: the steadily shifting scenes, the rise and fall of the landscape, leavened like fresh bread. Next morning, we’re greeted with crisp blue skies for our mountain ascent via one of Europe’s most historic train routes, theMatterhorn Gotthard railway. The original line opened in 1882 and was the railroad that changed Europe, slicing a path through inhospitable mountains and isolated villages.What becomes clear is how easy, and slightly disorientating, this type of train travel can be: drifting through stations, across platforms and over bordersWe catch one of the historic trains (the IR46) – keen to avoid anything routed through the Gotthard base tunnel, which bypasses the beauty. In summer, atourist train– with bigger windows and a bigger price tag – takes the exact same route, famouslydepicted by JMW Turnerand described in awed terms by Goethe. “Here,” he wrote, “it is necessary to submit to nature.” Though it’s the cafe car selling Swiss coffee at eye-watering prices that forces me to revise Goethe: here, it is necessary to submit toinflation.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner’s painting of the Devil’s Bridge, St Gotthard Pass.Photograph: AlamyPhones duly on charge (as is slow-train travel etiquette), we sit back and gawp out of the window for three hours, eating Swiss truffles as the tracks snake the mythic Alps via the famous Gotthard “spirals” – corkscrew tracks built inside the mountains for a steady ascent. It’s the stuff of oil paintings all right – vertiginous gorges, frothing rivers and snow-capped peaks.At Göschenen, we opt for a lunch stop via a short, even steeper rack-and-pinion route high into the former garrison town of Andermatt, now reinvented as a chic ski retreat. Up here, the snow is thick. Between that and the dark Alpine stone, it’s as though we’ve stepped out into a monochrome photograph. A comforting lunch at the excellentBiselli, along with several glasses of Swiss Ticino red (liquid lunch being another perk of slow-train travel) takes the edge off a dense mist that has crept over the rest of the day’s rail route. Thankfully, Italy soon pushes back, with clear skies andterracotta valley towns, and – just like that – another border is crossed, bringing with it a welcome drop in the cost of a cappuccino (from €5 to €2), enjoyed while skimming the edge of the ice-blue Lake Lugano.By dusk, we’re at Lake Como. Bags dropped, we catch the last of the light with an easypasseggiata(stroll) round the perimeter of the famous lake, mercifully lacking its high-season crowds. Ornate street lamps line the water’s edge like washed-up pearls and, in the distance, the funicular up to the hillside town of Brunate shines with a string of golden lights that dangle down the slope like lost jewellery. It’s hard to imagine Como any other way.In Turin we find a vibrant, easygoing student city that appears contentedly trapped in some kind of temporal raguNext morning, having got into the swing of slow-train transience, we pack up in record time and take coffee at the station. For our final stop, we’re heading in the direction of a much-needed metropolis. Ditching Milan – Italy’s least interesting city – we roll into Turin, one of its most underappreciated.Stepping off the rickety regional train at Torino Porta Susa, what we find is a vibrant, easygoing student city that appears contentedly trapped in some kind of temporal ragu; a place where 1920s art deco neon signs cling to 18th-century baroque buildings that house vintage shops run by students dressed as if they are in the 1990s.Miraculously, all this gels, and the student cohort rub along just fine with their more conservative elders, united beneath the impressive porticos that run, unbroken, for more than 18km and are lined with boutiques and historic coffee bars. We round out our first night with anaperitivoat the classic art-school hauntCaffè Università, with its frayed edges and charmingly outmoded daily buffet.Next morning, Turin’s enviable portfolio of museums and galleries beckon, most free to enter with theTorino card. Here, the time-warp vibes continue within the soaring spire of the 19th-century Mole Antonelliana, now housing the superbMuseo Nazionale del Cinema– surely, the only neoclassical building that’s home to an xenomorph egg from the film Alien? Likewise, another repurposed building, the Lingotto complex, boasts an even more outlandish upcycle: the famous Fiat test track on its roof has been reimagined asLa Pista 500,a panoramic garden walk, where art installations live alongside the historic skidmarks. Proof that Turin is not interested in simply preserving history, but also evolving.View image in fullscreenThe cupola and spire of the Mole Antonelliana in Turin.Photograph: Steve Tulley/AlamyWith a chill in the air, we duck in for a perfect meal at the unassuming yet excellentOsteria Rabezzana, part of theMangébin circuitthat promotes Piedmontese cuisine. Thebrasato al barolo(beef braised in barolo wine) and localagnolotti delplin(beef- and cabbage-stuffedpasta) are excellent. This family-run restaurant and winery opened just after the second world war, and judging by the convivial atmosphere – full of local people on office festive outings – it has served the city well ever since.Next morning, we are up and out to catch the 7.36 TGV all the way back to Paris. Drifting in and out of sleep, we take in a last glimpse of the Italian Alps. By the time we reach our Parisian pit stop, day is folding in on itself, and soon enough, we’re slumped back on the Eurostar, flanked by bags of clinking wine bottles cushioned by crushed panettone. Homebound and heady, we reluctantly plunge back into the black of the Channel tunnel, leaving all that light behind us.Transport was provided byInterrail; passes allowing seven days of travel within one month are £255 youths, £339 adults, £305 seniors (under-12s travel free).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.What’s the difference between white and red miso, and which should I use for what? Why do some recipes not specify which miso to use?Ben, by email“I think what recipe writers assume – and I’m sure I’ve written recipes like this – is that either way, you’re not going to get a miso that’s very extreme,” says Tim Anderson, whose latest book,JapanEasy Kitchen: Simple Recipes Using Japanese Pantry Ingredients, is out in April. As Ben points out, the two broadest categories are red and white, and in a lot of situations “you can use one or other to your taste without it having a massive effect on the outcome of the dish”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Salty, savoury miso is (usually) made by steaming soya beans, mashing them with salt andkoji, then leaving to ferment. “And the age is what changes the colour,” says Anderson. “White miso is not aged for very long – three to six months – and so it retains that beany, beige/yellow colour and tastes fresher, while red miso is aged for six months or longer, resulting in a darker colour and more funk.” The parallel Anderson often draws is that of a mild cheese and an aged or mature cheese. “Gouda is a good example,” he says. “It can be quite mellow and salty, but as it ages it develops a buttery, caramelised flavour.”As to which miso to use when, the general rule is: if you want to keep things light, use white; if you’re after something more savoury, something richer, then go red. “There’s a recipe in my new book for misotrone [AKA minestrone seasoned with miso] and that’s a good example of what miso can do to food,” says Anderson. “White miso accents the tomato’s acidity and freshness, but if you use red, you get a richer, more concentrated tomato flavour.”Likewise, Emiko Davies, author ofThe Japanese Pantry, dollops red miso on top of fried or roasted aubergine, while lighter misos are for soups with clams or other seafood. Millie Tsukagoshi Lagares, author ofUmai, meanwhile, leans on the latter to crank up dressings, marinades for white fish, and bakes or sweet treats (hello, miso caramel). But the other thing you could – and should – do, adds Davies, is mix your misos: “You can customise a more complex flavour – think of it like a blend.”Other misos you might come across include shinshu (yellow) miso, which, happily, can offer the best of both worlds. “It has the right amount of savouriness and nuttiness,” says Tsukagoshi Lagares, and is best used for miso soup and sauces. Then, there’s sweet white miso, or sweet rice miso, which is “fresh and not very salty or funky,” notes Anderson, making it a good call for mild ingredients (think the classic Nobu miso marinated black cod). At the other end of the spectrum is hatcho miso, which is aged in open barrels for a minimum of 18 months, turning a very dark brown, and “has all these rich flavours, such as cocoa, Marmite and molasses”. And if you can find it, check out Anderson’s favourite category: nama miso, or unpasteurised miso. “It has an interesting, lively aroma that you don’t get from other misos,” he says, and it works like a dream as a marinade. “It’s some of my favourite stuff.”Got a culinary dilemma?

I’ve imagined bringing new flavours home, letting them transform the kitchen – but with all the madness in today’s world, that dream must stay a dream, for now. So, these recipes become my journey, a way to reconnect with that spirit and taste the magic of the Arab golden age today.Kbeibat bulgur with spring onion and pomegranate (pictured top)This dish originates in Latakia, a port in Syria.Kbeibatbulgur in Arabic translates to “smallkibbeh”, and refers to a range of dishes that are popular across the Arab world and beyond. It has many variations from Turkey to Iran, even Brazil, but what they all have in common are complex layers of flavour: sweet, sour and spicy. Serve with the spicy fennel and herb salad below, plus bread to mop up the beautiful juices.Prep10 minSoak20 minCook50 minServes4For the kbeibat200g fine bulgur wheat1½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground coriander1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling and greasing1¼ tsp salt55g plain flourFor the sauce4-5 large spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced (150g)5g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped, plus extra for sprinkling1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped4 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp red pepper paste or harissa2 tsp lemon zest2 tbsp lemon juice¾ tsp ground cumin45g pomegranate molasses1½ tsp caster sugar, or honey¾ tsp saltMix the bulgur with the spices, olive oil and salt in a bowl, then add 300ml just-boiled water and mix well. Cover the bowl and leave to soak for 20 minutes, until the bulgur has absorbed all the water. Add the flour to the bowl, then mix it in well with your hands, squeezing the mixture until you have a sticky paste. Have ready a bowl of oil next to you (to stop the mixture sticking to your hands), then shape into 20 balls of about 30g each; roll them between your palms to make smooth balls. Put the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover and set aside while you make the sauce.Put all ingredients for the sauce in a large bowl and mix well to combine. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, then carefully slip in the kbeibat, stirring gently so they don’t break up or collapse, and cook on a medium heat for 15 minutes.Using a slotted spoon, lift the bulgur balls out of the boiling water and into the bowl of sauce. Once they’re all in there, stir gently until coated all over with sauce. Spoon into serving plates and finish with chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil.Spicy fennel and herb saladView image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’s spicy fennel and herbs salad.This bright, aromatic salad works beautifully at any meal, but is especially good as a fresh, cleansing contrast to the richness and complexity of kbeibat bulgur. Crisp fennel brings sweetness and crunch, while chilli, herbs and capers add heat and sharpness. Thinly sliced kohlrabi would make an excellent substitute for the fennel, offering a similar texture with a milder flavour.Prep20 minCook10 minServes4For the dressing2 tbsp lemon juice, plus 1 tsp zest2½ tbsp olive oil1 tbsp capers, drained and choppedSalt and black pepperFor the salad2 fennel bulbs, trimmed, halved and thinly sliced (about 400g)1 green chilli, stalk discarded, flesh thinly sliced100g castelfranco radicchio, or white endive, torn into bite-size pieces3g mint leaves, roughly torn3g picked coriander leaves3g picked dill leaves2 tsp black sesame seeds, toastedFirst, make the dressing. Put the lemon juice and zest, olive oil and capers in a large bowl. Add a half-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and whisk well to emulsify.Add the fennel and chilli to the dressing bowl, then toss well so the fennel is coated.Add the radicchio or endive, most of the herbs and the sesame seeds, and toss again, this time gently.

The nutty, mildly bittersweet seed appears in ice-cream parlors and doughnut shops alongside matcha and ube – offerings as standard as chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry are stateside, says Sophie Hung, a California-based registered dietitian nutritionist who grew up in Hong Kong.Now, black sesame’s popularity is growing in the US, with Yelp naming it atop food trendfor 2026 based on user data (searches for “black sesame matcha” are up almost 150% since 2023). Yet, beyond its appealing flavor and striking color, what exactly are you getting nutritionally when you add black sesame to your diet?What is the nutritional profile of black sesame?“I love sesame seeds because they pack a nice nutritional punch without a lot of volume,” says New York-based registered dietitian nutritionist Robin Foroutan.Black sesame is “really high in specific minerals, like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium”, says Foroutan. “These are nutrients important for bone health specifically, but also for cardiovascular health and balanced blood pressure.”Does it even need to be said? No, you don’t need to do a ‘parasite cleanse’Read moreA 2025reviewanalyzing data from 521 adults found that eating a tablespoon, or about 10 grams, of sesame products a day for eight weeks led to modest improvements in markers of heart and metabolic health, such as blood sugar and cholesterol levels, though the authors caution that these observed effects may not reliably “reflect true clinical benefits”, so, take them with a grain of salt.A serving of sesame is roughly one tablespoon of whole seeds, with dietitians recommending between one and three servings per day. The particular nutritional profiles of sesame products differ depending on whether you’re consuming whole seeds or denser sesame products such as ground sesame or blended tahini paste, which comes in black or white varieties. For instance, a tablespoon of tahini is about90calories, while a less dense spoonful of whole sesame seeds is about 60 calories. Black, brown, and white varieties of sesame have similar macronutritional profiles – low in protein and carbohydrates, high in unsaturated fat – though black sesame containsmoreminerals, antioxidants, and slightly more fiber than paler counterparts. If you’re eating sesame for its mineral content, be sure you’re buying the seeds with the calcium-rich hull on, rather than just the translucent inner kernel often seen atop burger buns.There is also a “decent amount of zinc in sesame seeds and sesame paste”, says Foroutan. “Zinc is really important to the immune system. It plays into how your body makes healthy white blood cells, and is also protective in an antiviral way,” she says. “Zinc blocks the replication of certain viruses so they don’t overwhelm your immune system.”Is black sesame a beautifying ingredient?“My grandma gave me one spoonful of black sesame powder every morning because in China, we believe it’s great for hair,” says Zoey Xinyi Gong, a Brooklyn-based chef and registered dietician who grew up in Shanghai and specializes in traditional Chinese medicine food therapy. Indeed, in parts of Asia, some claim that eating black sesame can even make gray hair go back to black. “That’s definitely more of a folktale,” says Gong; sesame is “not going to reverse gray hair or hair loss”. However, the seeds do contain the mineral copper, about 25% of your daily value per tablespoon. While copper biochemicallysupportsthe proteins collagen, elastin, and keratin, and the pigment melanin, in our bodies – all of which are involved in the maintenance of healthyskin, hair, and nails – no cause-and-effect studies on the beautification properties of dietary copper exist.In traditional Chinese medicine practice, Gong explains that nutrient-dense sesame is considered a “moistening” ingredient, particularly beneficial to eat during the cold, dry winter season. “It ‘moistens’ the intestines, meaning if you tend to have things like constipation or dryness,” having some black sesame is thought to help. “And it’s consistent with western nutrition,” says Gong. Indeed, sesame’s healthy fats, similar to those found in olive oil and avocado, are widely known tosupportskin and gut health.Should anyone not eat black sesame?“Because sesame does lower blood pressure moderately,” people taking blood pressure medications or blood thinners should check with their doctors before significantly increasing their daily servings of sesame, advises Hung.And because sesame is relatively high in fat and calories, “you don’t want to overdo it, especially if you are trying to manage your weight,” she says.Sesame is also a fairly commonfood allergyin the US. According to the National Institutes of Health,17%of children with any food allergies are also allergic to sesame.While rare, some people may have stomach pain from eating sesame due to the seed’s oxalates and phytates, anti-nutrients which many seeds evolved to have to help them bypass digestion in animals and grow into new plants. Consider soaking your nuts and seeds, which willbegintheir sprouting process, to increase their digestibility and nutritional profile.What does it mean that sesame contains phytoestrogens?Some people “talk about sesame in terms of phytoestrogens”, because, like flaxseeds, sesame contains antioxidants called lignans, says Foroutan. Lignans are converted by gut bacteria into compounds that weakly mimic estrogen, but may bind to estrogen receptors and slightlyeasemenopausal hot flashes, though clinical effects are neither significant nor uniform across trials. Observationaldatasuggests that higher lignan intake is associated with a slightly lower risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer, but effect sizes are modest and not clearly protective for all patients. The takeaway? Including lignan-containing foods like sesame in a balanced diet is safe and healthy. But researchers worry supplements that contain higher doses of lignan may havenegative effectson those with estrogen-sensitive conditions; talk to your doctor before taking any.How can you incorporate black sesame into your diet?In addition to sprouting, grinding black sesame is a way to improve your body’s ability to absorb maximum nutrients from the seeds. Hung likes to grind her sesame into a powder and keep it in a vacuum-sealed stainless steel jar to prevent oxidization, adding a spoon to her pre-workout shake or as an oatmeal topping, “for a little taste without having to add extra sugar”, she says.Gong also prefers ground sesame, and recommends using toasted seeds for the best flavor. “Sprinkle it on salad, or on yogurt … or blend it with warm milk,” to make a black sesame latte at home, she suggests.Sesame is versatile in both sweet and savory applications, as tasty in a dish of noodles as in a Japanesegomashiovegetable dressing or a white chocolatecookie. But consider it as just one part of the nutritional arsenal of nuts and seeds rather than a standalone superfood. It’s good to eat a variety of seeds, “because each different type of seed has a different profile of not just vitamins and minerals, but also antioxidants”, says Foroutan.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFoodHealth & wellbeingNutritionDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"
