It’s a wild, thrilling ride whose portrait of a toxic friendship is fantastically stylishLucy ManganSun 5 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhat would you do if your most reckless friend from your teenage years got back in touch? What if you were dying of cancer and had nothing to lose? What if you felt guilty for landing your friend in the clink 10 years ago? If you were the one she landed in the clink and you were only being released to die of cancer in her care? If you used to be a nearly unbeatable pair of scam artists who still had a stash of disguises left over from your glory days and a longing to feel some excitement again?All this and more are the questions that Frauds, a new drama starring Suranne Jones and Jodie Whittaker, flings at us on a wild, thrilling six-part ride that follows two conwomen bent on pulling off one last job. As with 2023’sMaryland, Jones co-created this with Anne-Marie O’Connor – who wrote every episode – and it has all the same strengths. Just as the mystery-thriller formula there was used as background to the psychodramas gradually unveiled, here the grand heist Jones’ character Roberta (Bert) has carefully planned in prison since her diagnosis is the vehicle for an exploration of friendship, betrayal and love in all its forms.Bert is released into the care of Sam (Whittaker), who lives nearby in the Andalucían hills. Guilt stopped her from ever visiting Bert, but she has stayed close and worked no cons without her – “Bit crass with you in prison for a job I fucked up.” And for her new, if brief, life on the outside she has bought her plenty of new underwear, because there are many ways for female friends to offer contrition and one is the purchase of “a big lady-bra” after a decade of underwire-free prison-issue rubbish.Sam wants to carry on leading her quiet life and look after Bert till the end. Bert has other ideas. And when your daftest friend has other ideas – well, those tend to be the ones you follow. Their old dynamic gradually reasserts itself and Bert’s plans are already in motion by the time she lays out the full blueprint for the heist. The series plays around with the timeline – to good rather than eye-rolling effect – to give us the set-pieces first and then the explanations. So we watch the pair slipping jewellery and watches off wealthy guests’ wrists at a funeral – and bagging a golden crown of thorns because why wouldn’t you if you could? – before ripping off their wigs and turning their mourning clothes inside out to become colourful suits as they stride out and down the church steps, awash with adrenaline and assets.They need the assets to fund the plan. This involves recruiting a forger (with, unbeknown to them, a gambling problem that is due to attract unwanted attention) in the form of magician’s assistant Jackie (Elizabeth Berrington), who has the technical know-how to help them remove and replace the target painting (Salvador Dalí’sThe Great Masturbatorat the Museo Reina Sofía). They also enlist feminist art collector Celine (Kate Fleetwood), who specialises in works by male artists exploiting women. She is as ruthless as any of the gangsters the forger and their funeral robbery are drawing towards them, including – most perilously of all – their old boss Miss Take (Talisa Garcia), a modern-day Fagin who had them running scams for her from their teens. She did not take well to the pair’s assertion of themselves as independent conwomen so there’s ground to make up there.Plot twists are layered between deepening revelations about Bert and Sam’s history, so you get all the satisfactions of a Thomas Crown Affair-ish caper – executed with no shortage of brio and admirable willingness to skate over rampant absurdities – plus a mesmerisingly intricate portrait of a friendship that is possibly as toxic as Bert’s cancer but just as impossible to uproot. Jones gives perhaps her finest and most complex performance yet, as the damaged, resentful Bert with her lifetime pursuit of excitement to distract from the gnawing pain within that has nothing to do with metastasising cells. Whittaker stands with her, doing brilliant work in a slightly less interesting part, and together with O’Connor they create a fantastically stylish, emotionally rich and profoundly intelligent piece of entertainment that is feminist to its bones without preaching and in every way a triumph.

She slammed her dressing room door and went in search of her producer.“Just who is that woman in the green room?” she asked. “She says she’s a guest on the programme.”“That must beKemi Badenoch,” the producer replied.“Who’s she?”“She’s this year’s leader of the Tory party.”“And why am I talking to her?” said Laura. “Couldn’t we get anyone better?”“It was her or Chris Philp.”“FFS. We can’t keep filling up our show with nobodies. Our ratings will fall through the floor. The Tories are an irrelevance. They might not even exist in a few years’ time.”“But it’s theirparty conference. We have to look as though we’re taking them seriously. Even if no one else is.”“OK,” said Laura. “Just this once. We’ll fit her in somewhere near the end. But get me someone better next week.”Kemi was entirely oblivious to this conversation. She’s oblivious to most things. She imagines she’s a winner. Someone who can cut through the bullshit and tell people uncomfortable truths. The sharpest of minds. Hard working. If only. The reality is that Kemi has achieved the seemingly impossible: she has taken the Tories even further backwards. The 2024 general election a high point in her party’s fortunes. Her personal ratings in freefall. She and her party a mere sideshow. A curiosity. Mainly interesting for how much worse they can get.After devoting the first 40 minutes of her Sunday TV show to an interview with Shabana Mahmood, followed by a pre-record of one with two rabbis from Manchester, Kuenssberg reluctantly turned her attention to Badenoch. You could tell her heart wasn’t really in it, but she was nothing if not professional. Though there was still an undercurrent of tetchiness. This wasn’t her idea of fun.After a brief discussion of the Manchester synagogue attack, in which Kemi claimed that only the Tories had the credibility and competence to be taken seriously – Laura’s mouth opened and closed in amazement at this – on antisemitism, the conversation turned to Badenoch’s big first-day policy announcements. Deporting150,000 people a yearandleaving the European convention on human rights.“Where would the 150,000 people go?” asked Laura.“That’s the least relevant question,” replied Kemi. She has never really quite got a grip on the interview format. She still likes to think that she gets to both ask the questions and deliver the answers. That only she knows what the public really wants to hear. It’s a peculiar solipsistic variant.So it was like this. As it didn’t really matter who she deported – legal or illegal immigrants, they had all basically just come here to rape our women – it didn’t really matter where we sent them. They could go anywhere, as far as she was concerned. And if they got imprisoned or tortured on their return, then so much the better. It saved us the effort. Laura tried to point out that this wouldn’t necessarily work. What if other countries didn’t want them? But Kemi was having none of this. Foreigners would go wherever we told them to. Only the Tories had the credibility and competence. Just remember the stunning success of the Rwanda plan. She said this in all seriousness. If she could forget, then why couldn’t the rest of us?View image in fullscreenThis wasn’t Laura Kuenssberg’s idea of fun, but she was nothing if not professional.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PABy now Kuenssberg was already on autopilot. Just willing the ordeal to be over. At one point a little banner was put up on the screen – “Kemi Badenoch: leader of the Conservative party”. To help all those who were struggling to understand why we were being put through this. Laura looked at her notes. Perhaps we could talk about the ECHR. Did Kemi really want to join Russia and Belarus as the only countries not to be signed up?Badenoch nodded eagerly. Neither the US nor Canada were signatories. It rapidly dawned on Laura that she was dealing with an idiot. Er … the US and Canada were not in Europe. The clue was in the title. Kemi wasn’t backing down. The US and Canada could have been European if they had wanted to be. In any case, Italy was trying to change the ECHR. Er … That was different from leaving it. We never did get round to discussing the Good Friday agreement.The Tories were never going to out-Reform Reform, Kuenssberg pointed out. But all her party had managed to do in the past year or so was to play catch-up. There was no coherence to anything. No sense theConservativeshad understood how badly they had failed during their 14 years in government. That the country was still waiting for some kind of acknowledgment. If an apology was off the cards.“I am doing politics differently,” Kemi said defiantly. You can’t argue with that. Tin-eared, tone-deaf. A determination to learn nothing. A residual belief that sooner or later the country would fall in love with the Tories again, without the party needing to change. All it required was sitting tight and waiting out the tricky patch. Or maybe Kemi is a sleeper agent. Determined to destroy the Tories from within. When you’ve eliminated all that is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.There was the same sense of existential futility inside the conference hall. The place was like a ghost town. The bars and stands empty. As if no one had cared enough to come, apart from those who were contractually obliged to be there. A place where the Tory party had come to witness its own extinction. The conference highlights were ghosts of the past. Some Margaret Thatcher mementoes and a Winston Churchill AI.The Times columnist and Tory arriviste Matthew Syed tried to galvanise the room. Now was the time for some penitence, which is why Kemi was the only possible leader. Hmm. It’s possible he’s never met Kemi. Either way, it was a curiously flat Kemi who later gave the first of her two conference speeches on the main stage. She seemed bemused by the Autocue, bemused by the lack of energy in the room, bemused by her own speech. She didn’t even seem to realise she had finished. There again, even by her own standards it had been incoherent. The triumph of the Conservative years. The fightback started now. Leave the ECHR.“We can win the next election,” Kemi insisted. Not even a very sweaty Chris Philp looked as if he believed that. It’s going to be a long four days.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa CrerarOn Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchLaura KuenssbergConservativesConservative conferenceBBC OnecommentShareReuse this content"

Dietitians give the lowdown on those you should take and those you can ditchAmy FlemingSun 5 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTShareIused to proudly eschew health supplements. Doctors always told me that if you eat a healthy diet, you’d only be flushing money down the loo. Studies showed that people who popped multivitamins didn’t live any longer, with some even dying a little younger – a 4% higher mortality risk according toone just last year. But now I’m unequivocally post youth, my supplement intake has crept up to four a day: vitamin D (byNHS decree), magnesium (for sleep, muscle relaxing, brain and stress; pretty sure it’s helping), lion’s mane mushroom (cognition; no idea if it’s working), biotin (hair health; ditto) and I’m considering crowbarring more in if I can afford them. Am I a total sucker, though? Do women really need to start taking supplements when they hit middle age?“There are plenty of reasons why we might need supplements as we age,” says Claire Pettitt, a specialist women’s health dietitian, who works in the UK and Singapore. “It’s not drastic, as if all of a sudden we need a drip,” she says. “But as we age, our body doesn’t work as well, and there are some nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and calcium, that we start to absorb much less efficiently as we get older.”Hormonal changes are another valid reason to take supplements, she says, because waning oestrogen “impacts so many parts of the body, whether that’s our bone health, our metabolism, cardiovascular disease risk or muscle mass, and there are various nutrients that will help reduce all of those disease risks.” That said: “There’s no blanket. You’re entering perimenopause; you’re going to be deficient in all these things.”I would say to menopausal women: go for dairy, or maybe a fermented dairy like kefir, or a fortified milk alternativeBefore considering any supplements, it’s best to take a cold, hard look at eating habits. “We might have poor dietary patterns, especially in middle age, where we’re thatsandwich generationand our time is not our own and we don’t always put ourselves first,” says Pettitt. Social ideals around body size and diet often encourage drastic measures, such as ditching meals for a buzzy green smoothie, or cutting out dairy. “Sometimes fad diets end up meaning you don’t have a balanced diet.”Another basic consideration to master, saysNichola Ludlam-Raine, a specialist dietitian and author ofHow Not to Eat Ultra-Processed,is consuming an adequate amount of protein: “About 1.6g per kilogram of ideal body weight a day, spaced throughout the day.” (Ideal body weight meaning what a person would weigh with a BMI between 18 and 25.) If you’re really active, up to 2g per kg is good, she says, “alongside resistance training, two to three times a week, for bone health and muscle mass preservation”.Getting enough fibre is fundamental too, she says, “because if you look after your gut, it will support almost every single bodily function, from immunity to mood”. It will also help your friendly gut microbes digest and produce more nutrients – an in-house supplement factory, if you will.View image in fullscreen‘The most common thing a woman would need to supplement is vitamin D, which is crucial to bone health,’ says Claire Pettitt.Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Pankova/Getty ImagesHow to spot deficienciesOur bodies will usually tell us if they’re not getting what they need. “I think we lose the skill of paying attention to our body. We’re too busy,” says Pettitt. “It’s noticing when things change, like if you’ve got fatigue, muscle weakness or hair loss, which could all reflect any number of micronutrient deficiencies.”Looking at your lifestyle, medications and dietary patterns can also provide clues. “If you’re vegan, you might need a supplement with B12,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Or if you’re on a proton pump inhibitor [to reduce stomach acid] or metformin [for type 2 diabetes], they can reduce absorption.” It’s easy to inadvertently lower calcium intake by switching to organic plant-based milks. “These are not fortified with calcium and iodine,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Calcium is essential for bone health. Iodine is essential for thyroid function. So I would say to menopausal women: go for dairy, or maybe a fermented dairy like kefir, or go for a fortified milk alternative.”Women can bleed more heavily during perimenopause, which could cause iron deficiency. Another question Pettitt would ask is whether you have digestive health issues, “like coeliac disease or anything that impacts absorption of nutrients”.Serious deficiencies can usually be verified with a blood test. “See a dietitian, a doctor, get some blood tests done to look for black-and-white evidence,” says Pettitt.Which supplements work?“The most common supplement a woman would need is vitamin D, which is crucial to bone health, immunity, muscles and even your hormones,” says Pettitt. General advice is to take it during autumn and winter, but if you have darker skin, wear high SPF or are covered up when you go out, consider taking it all year, says Ludlam-Raine. “A lot of my patients, especially if the BMI is above 30, are deficient. Look to take a minimum of 10mcg (400IU) of vitamin D (vitamin D3 is more effective than D2) – a supermarket own-brand will do!”Pettitt has had a flurry of questions about magnesium from clients lately. “It has been used a lot in the past for muscle relaxation, if you get cramps. Muscle health is important in our nerve stimulation, so it’s part of our nervous system. It’s important for that, brain health, and helps with sleep and stress.”The problem I often see is people start all these supplements at the same timeLudlam-Raine bought some for herself – a mix of three types commonly sold together. Sounds like a no-brainer, although Pettitt says you might not need it if you eat a wholegrain diet along with nuts, avocado and black beans. “I often say: what’s your baseline?” says Pettitt. “Where are we at with our lifestyle? And can you make these changes and see if they make any difference? If you want to try it, try it, but are you going to monitor your symptoms?”View image in fullscreenIf you don’t eat oily fish at least once a week, your omega-3 might need supplementingPhotograph: Vicuschka/Getty Images“The problem I often see is people start all these supplements at the same time,” says Pettitt. She recommends starting each one in isolation for four to six weeks, ideally three months, “depending on what you’re trying to change. You can’t necessarily expect a change in your mental health overnight with a supplement.”If you don’t eat oily fish at least once a week, your omega-3 might need supplementing. “Omega-3 is a powerful anti-inflammatory,” says Pettitt. “It’s going to help minimise your risk of cardiovascular disease. It’s also important for brain health, joint health, and all of these are changing as we age and go through menopause.” She says it doesn’t matter what kind of supplement you take, “because obviously there are all these different ones, saying all the other ones are rubbish. You want to get enough EPA and DHA [two of the three types of fatty acid that are known as omega-3s], but choose a brand that’s third-party tested.” This means the product’s ingredients have been independently verified.Some supplements that are labelled ‘food grown’ are actually highly processed, or may not be more easily absorbedOther claims you’ll see on expensive supplements include “food grown” and “micronised”, both promising superior absorption, but Pettitt cautions that these terms are ambiguous, with no standardised definition, and can be misleading. “‘Food grown’ refers to supplements that claim to be derived from whole foods or fermented ingredients, as opposed to synthetic or isolated nutrients, and therefore might be better absorbed or more bioavailable to the body because they contain other naturally occurring cofactors, like enzymes, phytonutrients, or other beneficial compounds,” she says. “However, this is not always true, and some supplements that are labelled ‘food grown’ are actually highly processed, or may not be more easily absorbed.” Similarly, micronised is often more of a marketing term “than a scientifically validated claim. The goal is to make nutrients more bioavailable, but whether this process improves absorption or effectiveness is often unclear or lacks robust evidence.”Ludlam-Raine agrees: “For most people, the key is taking the right nutrient in the right dose for their needs. My advice is always to focus first on getting nutrients from food where possible, and use supplements when needed as a top-up or safety net. Paying more for ‘micronised’ or ‘food-grown’ versions isn’t usually necessary.”Fibre powders and probiotics (live microbes) have become popular, as health advice increasingly focuses on the gut, but Pettitt believes we should prioritise packing these into our diets. “Foods that have fibre bring so much more. If you eat lots of fruits and vegetables, you’re getting all the micronutrients, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, the phytochemicals (plant chemicals) that bring benefit to our bodies. Most people should be eating more fruits and vegetables.”Ludlam-Raine does try to take a probiotic when she remembers, but this is in addition to eating naturally probiotic fermented foods. She believes that “in the future, the UK will have recommended servings a day, like ‘five-a-day’ for ferments”. Kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, natural yoghurts all count. “I think kefir is almost the most acceptable and versatile. You can have it for breakfast; as a snack.”Collagen is, says Pettitt, “a really trendy one. Most of its evidence is around joint and bone health, which is important in perimenopause, and as we age.” It’s increasingly touted as a brain-health boost too, but she says there’s not as much evidence for that yet. “You could probably try it and see if it makes any difference.” Ludlam-Raine is turning 40 next birthday and has started taking it for her skin health. It certainly won’t do her any harm. “It is such a safe supplement and a bit of a protein boost.”Ludlam-Raine often works with people who have had bariatric surgery for obesity, of which hair thinning can be a side-effect – but hair loss can also be caused by dropping oestrogen levels in perimenopause. “Biotin is a really popular supplement for this,” she says. She only recommends it in cases where a biotin deficiency has been identified through a blood test, “which is what the evidence supports for hair health, but I would suggest people focus on a food-first approach: eggs, salmon, nuts, seeds, sweet potatoes, legumes, mushrooms and avocados, etc”. But as it’s water soluble and we don’t store it in the body, she is not against people trying the supplement, “just in case it may help”, as long as they remember to stop taking it three days before blood tests, as it can skew some results.As for my lion’s mane mushroom capsules, Ludlam-Raine says that, while the fungus has been shown to improve cognition and nerve regeneration in some animal trials: “We don’t have large-scale human studies.” But as long as you’re getting a good diet, a supplement won’t cause any harm. “If it makes you feel good, then do it. But don’t do them as a first line. You can’t compare mushrooms to HRT, if that’s been recommended, which we know can help with brain fog.”“Creatine is having a moment outside of the gym,” says Ludlam-Raine, where it’s known for providing a fuel boost for hard-working muscles. It’s one of the most-studied supplements – and benefits to brain health and cognitive processing are a growing field of interest. Unless you have a kidney condition (in which case, talk to your doctor first), she says: “Taking three to five grams a day is safe, so I almost think, why not give it a go for four weeks and see how it goes?” It’s still worth trying even if you’re not technically deficient, she believes, “because we do use up creatine stores, especially if you’re working out. The research is now quite substantial that shows when you supplement, even if you’ve got a healthy, balanced diet, you may reap these other benefits.”All manner of vitamins and micronutrients now come in highly palatable gummy form, which on the one hand might mean you’re more likely to take them regularly. But, says Ludlam-Raine, “the sugars in chewables can add up. Check the ingredients and how many you are taking, because it might be like eating half a packet of fruit pastilles.”Warnings and cautionsIt’s easy to think “the more the merrier” with all these wonder-nutrients, but despite the unregulated mega-doses being sold, you can have too much of various supplements, including iron, vitamin A, vitamin D and magnesium. Make sure you don’t take more than you need.“Pharmacists are such an underutilised resource,” says Ludlam-Raine. “If you have pre-existing medical conditions or you’re taking other prescribed medications or supplements, always double-check with a pharmacist, because there might be some sort of interaction.”The power of pulses: 15 easy, delicious ways to eat more life-changing legumesRead morePettitt cautions against thinking of a supplement as an easy short cut. “It’s often seen as something that we can take control of now, whereas changing your lifestyle, changing your job because it’s too stressful, getting a divorce because you’re not happy in your marriage, those are really big things that take time to change. And actually, it’s much easier to say: right, I’m going to buy this supplement, and it’s going to help me sleep and I’m going to be less stressed.”Ludlam-Raine thinks people who are feeling chronically under par are vulnerable to “marketing over evidence. I think it’s a case of remembering the pillars of health: your diet, your physical activity, your stress, sleep and also social connection, and just remembering that you need to get the basics right before even considering a supplement.”Explore more on these topicsNutritionHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It really is time for a new approach ...Sun 5 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 16.31 EDTShareMy current cultural comfort food isThe Gilded Age, Julian Fellowes’ deeply silly Manhattan toffs-in-bustles drama, in which one storyline (summarily dealt with due to lack of taffeta-rustling opportunities, I suspect) features a tycoon’s downtrodden steelworkers going on strike for “888”: eight hours each of work, sleep and recreation.That wasn’t a revolutionary demand in the 1880s. The slogan, coined by the utopian social reformer Robert Owen, dates from 1817 (hisNew Lanark millworkers still did 10.5-hour days, though). Even then, it wasn’t unprecedented: apparently, a16th-century Spanish ordinancelimited New World construction workers to eight-hour days.So what would Owen or Philip II of Spain think of “996”? That’s working 9am to 9pm, six days a week – 72 hours of grind. Originating in the Chinese tech industry, 996 wasdescribed as a “blessing” by the e-commerce behemoth Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma. Chinese workers disagreed, mobilising against it online, andlaunching – and winning – court cases against employers.Now 996 is back (although it probably never went away; in 2022, the FT reporteddiscontent among UK TikTok employeesat expectations of 12-hour days). In Silicon Valley, “grinding ‘996’ is the way to get ahead”, according to theNew York Times.Wiredfound job listings explicitly stating absurdly long hours are expected (and applicants shouldn’t apply unless “excited” by that) and recruiters being instructed that a willingness to work 72-hour weeks was non-negotiable. TheSan Francisco Standardproclaimed: “Grindcore culture is back and grindier than ever”, with one founder summarising the vibe as: “No drinking, no drugs, 996, lift heavy, run far, marry early, track sleep, eat steak and eggs.” Another posted on X: “We routinely are at the office through the weekend and do some of our best work late into the night.” Sign me up!I don’t get it. Hadn’t we all fallen out of love with hustle culture? We’ve witnessed the overwhelming success offour-day week initiativeswith almostall trial participants electing to continue. We’ve looked at other countries and realised more enlightened approaches to reconciling family, community, life and work don’t necessarily come at a productivity cost, and make for happier, healthier citizens. The average working week in the Netherlands is32.1 hours, but theOECD’s economic surveysays it has been “outperforming peers” economically; it ranks fifth in the newestWorld Happiness Report(the US is 24th).I keep reading, too, about the new work-agnosticism,especially among the young. Respondents toDeloitte’s 2024 Gen-Z and Millennial surveyranked work-life balance as the most important factor in choosing an employer (and “the most admired trait among their peers”).Randstad’s workmonitor 2025surveyed 26,000 people in 35 countries and also concluded work-life balance was the top motivator, coming ahead of pay for the first time.So what fresh, fire emoji,locked-inhell is this? I have two theories. Maybe it’s the last gasp of a dying philosophy; the “extinction burst”, if you will, of grindcore? Alternatively,research published this yearindicates what we all suspected: overwork makes your brain go funny. “Overworked individuals exhibited significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation,” the researchers concluded, and looking at some of Silicon Valley’s prominent alumni, that tracks. Surely only people with “structural brain changes … in regions linked to cognition and emotion” – as the study puts it – could think this work culture is healthy or productive?Tech bros love novelty, so maybe we can convince their addled brains that their inhumane working practices are old hat with audacious alternatives. But what? My own work equation (equal parts scrolling, blank staring, hen husbandry and hot drinks) is too complex – and unsuccessful – to catch on. I’m tempted to suggest 0/0/0, but that requires a tireless 24/7/365 commitment to overthrowing capitalism. The majority of people I asked actually dream of working three-day weeks (not far offthe economist John Maynard Keynes’ quixotic 15 hours), but I’m not sure that’s buzzy enough. How about a 1:12 ratio of Teams meetings to tea breaks? Or one day in the office, six days screaming into the void (make SIV the new WFH)? An hour’s work, an hour questioning your life choices, then a lifetime hiding in the woods? I reckon with a catchy name and a rumour itmakes you immortal, any of these could be Silicon Valley’s next big thing.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some of those artists, and supporters like Alice Cooper, recall a major moral panicGarth CartwrightSun 5 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 06.11 EDTSharePrince’s Purple Rain album had been bought by 11 million Americans by May 1985. One of them was 11-year-old Karenna Gore. Back home, Karenna’s mother was shocked to hearPrincesing, on the album’s fifth track Darling Nikki: “I knew a girl named Nikki / I guess you could say she was a sex fiend / I met her in a hotel lobby/ masturbating with a magazine.”“I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Karenna’s mother, Tipper Gore. “The vulgar lyrics embarrassed both of us. At first, I was stunned – then I got mad!”Parents getting upset by their offspring’s musical enthusiasms is nothing new, but Tipper was no ordinary Tennessee mum– she was married to rising Democrat politician Senator Al Gore. Determined to do something, Tipper reached across the Democrat-Republican divide to Susan Baker, wife of James Baker, the treasury secretary under Ronald Reagan. They brought in two more women and co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). As all four women had husbands with strong connections to government, the US media dubbed the committee “the Washington wives”.View image in fullscreenLyrical flow … Tipper Gore and Susan Baker giving evidence at the Senate hearing in September 1985.Photograph: James Colburn/Globe Photos/ZUMA/AlamyThe PMRC organised a US Senate hearing for September 1985, its aim to increase parental controls over recorded music. Even before hearings began the PMRC had remarkable momentum: funding came from Beach Boys vocalist Mike Love and Joseph Coors, owner of Coors beer, both active Reagan supporters, and the committee gained considerable media coverage, earning support from the likes of Jerry Falwell, US televangelist and co-founder of the Moral Majority. The campaign arrived at a favourable time. While video nasties served as folk devils in the UK, in the US Ronald Reagan’s emphasis on “family values” had empowered the religious right: with the surging popularity of MTV, the music video channel, musicians were now drawing increasing ire from Christian organisations.“Initially, I didn’t pay much attention to the PMRC,” says Blackie Lawless, leader of Wasp, one of the bands targeted by the organisation. “Then it went on to have a huge impact, took on a life of its own.”The US had experienced occasional outbreaks of music-related moral panics before. The mid-1950s saw Elvis Presley damned by segregationists for making “jungle music”, while John Lennon’s 1966 observation “The Beatles are more popular than Jesus” led to bonfires of Beatles records. But there had never been a concerted government attempt to censor music. As the Senate hearings got under way it became clear censorship was now on the agenda.View image in fullscreenRock in a hard place … Frank Zappa, left, and Twisted Sister’s Dee Snider hold up papers relating to the 1985 PMRC senate hearing at Capitol Hill.Photograph: Mark Weiss/Getty ImagesFor the hearings the PMRC compiled a list of 15 contemporary songs – the “Filthy Fifteen” – that they determined had “objectionable” qualities: sex, violence, references to drugs or alcohol, occult themes and bad language. Prince was linked to three of them, as an artist, writer and producer. The list also included Mary Jane Girls, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, all listed for singing very coy, pro-female sexuality songs. Heavy metal bands (then the biggest selling genre in US music) dominated: AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Mötley Crüe, veterans of attacks by evangelical organisations, were included, along with newbies Def Leppard,Judas Priest, Twisted Sister and Wasp, who suddenly found politicians and religious fundamentalists calling for their music and videos to be removed from radio and MTV.“I had been following all of this building up on the news so I wasn’t completely surprised,” says Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford, “although being called ‘enemy of the people’ was a stretch.”In the Senate hearings the PMRC requested the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) develop a form of music rating akin to that used by the Motion Picture Association for film classifications. Their agenda included calling for printed warnings on album covers, requiring record shops to put albums with explicit covers under the counter, pressuring television stations not to broadcast explicit videos and, more ominously, reassessing “the contracts of musicians who performed violently or sexually in concert”.Putting Parental Advisory stickers on albums surely backfired as they became the ones kids wanted to buyAlice CooperIt wasn’t just the musicians on the Filthy Fifteen list who expressed opprobrium at the PMRC’s campaign – veteran rockers Frank Zappa andAlice Cooper, both of whom had courted outrage early in their careers, protested about what they saw as the PMRC serving as a cover for encroaching censorship.Cooper was a a veteran of censorship battles in the UK. In the summer of 1972 his eponymous group’s song School’s Out topped the charts in the UK, prompting calls for its banning. “I sent Mary Whitehouse flowers and Leo Abse a box of cigars,” Cooper chuckles at the outraged response from, respectively, the conservative activist and the Welsh Labour MP at the time.The PMRC campaign 12 years later was less of a laughing matter: for Cooper a sinister example of government overreach. “It was like they were saying to kids: ‘You can’t see something or hear something because you’re not smart enough to deal with it,’” he says. “If something is really violent or horrible it should be a talk between the parents and their kids, not the government and the kids.”View image in fullscreenSigns of the times … Protesters outside the Senate hearing in Washington, September 1985.Photograph: Mark Weiss/Getty ImagesAs the Senate hearings got under way, Zappa travelled to Washington DC. There he was joined by pop-folk singer John Denver – who, like Zappa, happily appeared as a witness despite not featuring on the Filthy Fifteen list – and Twisted Sister’s vocalist Dee Snider, who did appear on the list. The trio testified during the hearings as to why music censorship was a bad idea. Zappa, dressed conservatively in suit and tie, provided the enduring image of the hearings as he sparred with the PMRC and their supporters, saying that “the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children [and] infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children”.Denver, meanwhile, noted how his song Rocky Mountain High had been misinterpreted by those who deemed it a paean to taking drugs (when it was a celebration of Colorado’s natural beauty) while Snider asserted the PMRC misconstrued the lyric to Twisted Sister’s Under the Blade – it wasn’t about sadomasochism (as Gore claimed), but surgery.Judas Priest’s Halford wasn’t at the hearings, but says that the PMRC misinterpreted his lyrics, too. The committee claimed the song Eat Me Alive was about the forced performance of oral sex at gunpoint. Today Halford says it was in fact about gay S&M sex, although in 1985 he said nothing.

Not subtle but not obscene, either. “Originally I was going to attend the Senate hearings and testify,” he says, “but EMI – our record label – requested that we didn’t go. They didn’t think it was a good idea. Frank, John and Dee all did a really good job in speaking on artists’ behalf, not that it made much difference.”The trio may have spoken eloquently but US record labels caved before the hearings ended: the RIAA agreed to put Parental Advisory stickers on any album containing “controversial” content. This led to certain retailers – including Walmart (then the US’s largest record retailer) – refusing to stock albums carrying the stickers. “At the time the hard right cornered Walmart so they had no choice,” says Halford. “I would imagine that sales took a hit for every label.”Lawless, meanwhile, claims that the PMRC Senate hearings endangered not only his career but his life. “In the US there was an element of society who thought: ‘The world would be better off without these people,’ and we began getting death threats. I was twice shot at – not in concert, thankfully, although once while we were playing someone threw a heavy glass jar and it hit me right on the top of my head and split my scalp open.”Musicians replied to the PMRC in song: Judas Priest’s Parental Guidance and Alice Cooper’s Freedom both damned the organisation, while on Wasp’s Live … In the Raw album Lawless dedicates the song Harder, Faster to the Washington wives: “They can suck me, suck me, eat me raw!”View image in fullscreenFreak out … Frank Zappa giving evidence at the Senate hearing in September 1985.Photograph: James Colburn/Globe Photos/ZUMA/AlamyThe Senate hearings broadened discussion around censorship in the US while inspiring lawsuits against “offensive” musicians. San Franciscan punk band Dead Kennedys became embroiled in a court case not for their songs, but due to an insert of HR Giger’s artwork Penis Landscape inside the cover of 1985’s Frankenchrist album: a parent offended by their teenage daughter’s purchase of the album sued the band. On 7 March 1990, Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra debated Tipper Gore on the Oprah Winfrey show, with Biafra asserting Gore’s defence of being “a liberal Democrat” was undermined by her PMRC cheerleading, noting how the committee had fuelled the Christian right.Both Cooper and Lawless argue that that Tipper’s motivation behind the PMRC was to help build support for her husband’s 1987 campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination (Al Gore would lose the race, but later become Bill Clinton’s vice-president, before losing to George Bush in contentious fashion in the 2000 presidential election). “Just as McCarthy used the red scare to gain more power, this was a campaign to build a political base through suggesting musicians were bringing sexual perversion and the occult into children’s bedrooms,” says Lawless.Rap would soon overtake rock as the US’s most popular youth music and gangsta rap’s rhymes would attract even greater outrage. In 1989, NWA and 2 Live Crew generated huge controversy – the former for rhymes that, among other things, celebrated shooting LAPD officers, the latter over the explicit sexual content on their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be. After a federal judge ruled the album to be obscene – an unprecedented verdict for a US music recording – Bible belt states began prosecuting stores that sold the album, and that hosted their performances. The US court of appeals would ultimately overturn the obscenity ruling, but by then the controversy had helped both outfits sell millions of albums – though the myriad legal battles would fracture both groups.“I found the whole thing patronising and stupid,” says Cooper. “And putting Parental Advisory stickers on albums surely backfired as they became the ones kids wanted to buy.”Despite the PMRC officially disbanding in the mid 1990s, its legacy can be seen in the Parental Advisory stickers that continue to be employed on many US albums. In the internet age where seemingly anything, no matter how offensive, is just a click away, the committee’s attempts to censor popular music now seems archaic. Still, there are echoes of their crusade today in the attempts to censor comedians such as Jimmy Kimmel over his comments on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.“We are in dangerous times around the world,” says Halford. “I’ve lived long enough to witness history repeat itself.”Alice Cooper’s album The Revengeof Alice Cooperis out now on earMUSIC.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalCensorshipAlice CooperJudas PriestPrincefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vegard Rabban had little doubt about what he was seeing when a strange red light appeared between his house and garage on Norway’s west coast one cold Friday night in late September.The father-of-three, a salmon fisher and firefighter, had just driven his teenage son home from football practice when they were stopped in their tracks by something above in the clear Norwegian sky.“Between the garage and the house I react to a strange light that is not normally there. Me and my boy see straight away it’s a drone,” he said. “We stand for two minutes and look and we see the red lights. I could see it was a very big drone. Maybe 1.5 metres wide.”As a regular drone user, he was well aware of the restrictions near his home close to Ørland airport, a key base for Nato and the Norwegian air force.It was unusual to see a drone flying at night. But it was not until the next morning, when he read about the drone incursions at Norwegian airports, that he started to think more about it.View image in fullscreenA specialist Danish police unit inspects an area near Copenhagen airport.Photograph: Steven Knap/EPAHis sons were nervous. He tried to calmly explain. “As it stands now, we are far away from the war that’s happening but I think someone is watching us and trying to see how we react to drones,” he said.Rabban says he is not personally afraid yet, but the sightings have already had some psychological effect on Norwegians. He believes the situation inEuropecould escalate fast. “As more people see the drones, more people are asking what is happening. They are curious.”Sincethree drones were shot down in Polish airspace last month, sightings of unmanned aerial vehicles have spread across Europe, including those that have closed major airports.Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, addressed the nationafter the closure of Copenhagen airport. “We are at the beginning of a hybrid war againstEurope,” she said.Anincursion over Munich airport on Thursdayforced air traffic control to suspend operations, leading to the cancellation of 17 flights and disrupting travel for nearly 3,000 passengers.But these are just the sightings made public. The Guardian has learned that drones started to regularly appear late last year around the industrial parks of two major energy plants near Auvere and Narva, in eastern Estonia, close to the Russian border.View image in fullscreenMilitary police secure parts of a damaged object shot down by authorities in Wohyń, Poland.Photograph: Rafal Niedzielski/APThe first sightings came months before the Baltic states synchronised their electricity grids with the rest of Europe and cut ties with Russia and Belarus.“This year we have confirmed 22 unregistered drone flights,” said Raine Pajo, chief executive of Enefit Power. “There has been no practical impact on our operations. We are also in close cooperation and contact with Estonian police and border guard board and monitoring the situation closely.”It has yet to be confirmed that the drones were sent by order of the Kremlin. Russia predictably denies involvement. When asked this week by a mirthful moderator why the Russian president was sending drones overDenmark, Vladimir Putin laughed. “I won’t do it any more,” he said, adding that Nato was a “paper tiger”.The most common explanation is that Moscow wants to test the capabilities of its Nato neighbours. “The provocations are regular,” said Egert Belitšev, the director general of the Estonian border force. “How to test our activities, how to test our abilities, how to test the reaction from our side.”There is also a psychological impact that is less appreciated, said Dr Beryl Pong, who leads theCentre for Drones and Cultureproject at the University of Cambridge.It brings the war into the relatively cosseted lives of western and northern Europeans, asking them whether this is something they want.View image in fullscreenPolice after the temporary closure of airspace in Copenhagen.Photograph: Steven Knap/ReutersEarlier this year the Imperial War Museum hosted an immersive installation, Beware Blue Skies, which sought to illustrate the experience of being under drone surveillance.Its title came from a 13-year-old boy in evidence to Washington lawmakers about the the psychological impact of living under drones in Pakistan.“I no longer love blue skies … in fact, I now prefer grey skies. The drones do not fly when the skies are grey,” he said.Pong said that much of academic research into drones focused on strikes and carnage and not enough on the insidious impact on those below.She said: “I think the incursions are a way to spook and to provoke. So drones kind of operate in this grey zone where they assert their presence, their capabilities, they show that you’re vulnerable, but they don’t kind of yet tip into that full-scale aggression that we’re seeing in Ukraine and Russia.“There’s that hint and that suggestion. We don’t yet know whether it is Russia, we have feelings it is, but there is still this plausible deniability … you don’t know what its motivations are, right? It could be benign or, you know, it could just kind of be the end of your life, right there.”View image in fullscreenArmed security personnel stand guard during an informal summit between EU leaders at the Danish parliament.Photograph: Emil Helms/EPADr Richard Carter, who worked with Pong on the project, said that since man used flight in war, one of the consequences was to “turn peaceful skies into a source of persistent threat”.He said: “It certainly has a value in terms of probing what the security operators may do in response but also as a way of disrupting everyday life, disrupting how people see their everyday world, to suddenly see it being threatened by these unknown objects.”The incursions in Scandinavia also have an informative historical context, said Dr Robert Bartholomew, a senior lecturer in the department of psychological medicine at the University of Auckland.French military detain two after boarding Russia-linked oil tanker suspected of launching dronesRead more“It has been said that history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes – and what we are currently seeing over northern Europe is the rhyming of history,” he said. “There is a long history of UFO scares over this region where the culprit was believed to have been either Russia or the former Soviet Union.”During the 1930s it was “ghost planes” that caused panic, believed to be hostile Soviet aircraft on reconnaissance missions as a prelude to an invasion.“Many of these reports correspond with known astronomical objects like Venus low in the horizon,” said Bartholomew. “No aircraft of the time could have remained aloft for the periods that it was often observed. Fast forward to 1946 and northern European countries were panicking over mass sightings of ‘ghost rockets’.”After the second world war, Russian troops occupied Peenemünde, the former centre of Nazi rocket science. The sightings were attributed to the Soviets deliberately firing rockets to intimidate neighbouring countries.“We now know that the ‘ghost rocket’ flap coincided with a rare confluence of two events: geomagnetic comets and unusually high solar activity, which generated an array of spectacular auroras and amplified the appearance of meteors streaking across the sky,” said Bartholomew.“Then you get to the 1970s and 80s and there were the USO reports – unidentified submerged objects thought to have been Soviet submarines.View image in fullscreenA V2 rocket developed by Nazi Germany in Peenemünde in 1944.Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy“However, they were omnipresent and the vast majority could not possibly have been Soviet subs – there were just too many reports; people were seeing them everywhere.”The drone sightings of 2025 cannot be said to a figment of anyone’s imagination but Bartholomew said they were being experienced amid a “perfect storm of geopolitical tensions stoked by Russian aggression and anxieties over the unpredictability of longtime Nato ally the United States under Donald Trump”.“Suddenly, many European countries like Denmark are feeling more vulnerable than they have in recent memory,” he said.“Within this atmosphere, what we are seeing is a collective anxiety attack where the sky has become a social barometer of the times, driven by the fallibility of human perception and fear.“It’s almost autumn and the days are getting shorter, which means more hours of darkness which should not be underestimated as it contributes to the ambiguity … it cannot be good for anyone with an anxiety disorder.”"

Jewish community leaders, police and Keir Starmerhad called on Palestine Action protestersto refrain from demonstrating after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.Mahmood will also look at all anti-protest laws, with the possibility that powers to ban some demonstrations outright could be strengthened.Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer and former shadow attorney general, warned that the government should pause before passing draconian powers that could end up in the hands of a Nigel Farage-led government.“Street protest that isn’t a bit of a nuisance isn’t usually effective. But any government seeking to further restrict it should think about new powers in Farragist hands,” she said.Two Labour MPs also expressed concern at the move. One told the Guardian: “However distasteful the protests in favour of Palestine Action have been, we must not fall into the trap of making rushed laws which can be used in future to stop justifiable protests.”If a protest such as Saturday’s in support of Palestine Action takes place at the same site on several occasions, and causes repeated disorder, the police will get the power to instruct organisers to hold the event elsewhere, limit numbers and to set time limits,Home Officesources said.The changes will amend sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act of 1986, under which anyone breaching conditions set by police faces up to six months in jail, an unlimited fine, or both.Speaking on Sunday to Sky News, Mahmood said she believed there was “a gap in the law” that required action, and she aimed to act at speed.“What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption, that is to say the frequency of particular protests in particular places, is in and of itself, a reason for the police to be able to restrict and place conditions,” she said.View image in fullscreenShabana Mahmood, centre, who visited the scene of the Manchester synagogue attack on Thursday, said on Sunday that repeated large-scale demonstrations over Gaza had caused ‘considerable fear’ for the Jewish community.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesSpeaking later to BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mahmood denied this was about banning protest: “This is not about a ban. This is about restrictions and conditions that would enable the police to maybe put further time restrictions or move those protests to other places.“What I’m allowing is for the police to be able to take cumulative disruption into account, and it is important.”The Liberal Democrats warned that the plans for further protest restrictions would lead to a greater waste of police time while letting off those inciting violence.Max Wilkinson, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “The Conservatives made a total mess of protest laws. I fear Labour seem to be following them down the same path, instead of properly reforming these powers to focus on the real criminals and hate preachers.”The plans could be challenged in the courts because they mirror failed moves by the former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman to curb protests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May 2024,the high court agreed with Libertythat Braverman’s legislation had been unlawful.Home Office sources pointed out that Liberty won the 2023 case because ministers tried to change the definition of “serious public disorder”, lowering it to cover any crime “more than minor” through a statutory instrument.Officials believe the measures this time will be more robust because they are not trying to lower the threshold and are planning to use primary legislation.Tom Southerden, a director at Amnesty International UK, said the government’s proposal was “ludicrous” and may be a “cynical” attempt to look tough.Akiko Hart, Liberty’s director, said: “The police already have immense powers to restrict protests – handing them even more would undermine our rights further while failing to keep people safe from violence like the horrific and heartbreaking antisemitic attack in Manchester.”Defend Our Juries said there would be mass civil disobedience defying the ban from 18 to 28 November, in the lead up to and throughout the judicial review.In a letter to chief constables on Sunday, Mahmood warned that “the country faces a period of heightened tensions and division” and thanked police for their response to Thursday’s attack.“I have confirmed the government will bring forward legislation to increase the powers available to you to tackle the repeated disruptive protests we have seen, and continue to provide the reassurance to communities that they need.“And I will review more widely the full suite of public order legislation, to ensure that it keeps pace with the continued changes in the scale, nature and frequency of protests,” she wrote.The planned new powers follow protest-related measures in the crime and policing bill going through parliament, which would ban the possession of face coverings or fireworks or flares at protests, and criminalise the climbing of certain war memorials.Explore more on these topicsProtestPoliceUK civil libertiesLondonShabana MahmoodIsrael-Gaza warHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

And we will do so in the same calm and responsible way, working out the detail before we rush to announce.”Tories to pledge to create immigration taskforce modelled on Trump’s IceRead moreThe plan to leave the ECHR was announced just before the conference as part of a radical and sometimes draconian package of anti-migration measures including a pledge that all asylum seekers arriving by unofficial means would be sent to their own or a third country within a week.Another plan involves the formation of a “removals force”, billed as being modelled on Donald Trump’s semi-militarisedImmigration and Customs Enforcement(Ice) agency, with a remit to deport 150,000 people a year.In a speech directly after Badenoch, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that if a foreign national in the UK expressed “racial hatred, including antisemitism”, or supported “extremism or terrorism”, they would be deported.It was not immediately clear whether this would apply only to people convicted of a crime for such actions. The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.Unveiling the plan to leave the ECHR, Badenoch said this followed a review of the issue by Lord Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, who concluded the only feasible way to gain control of borders was to quit the treaty.“And so to me and the shadow cabinet, the resulting policy decision is also clear,” she said. “We must leave the ECHR and repeal the Human Rights Act. Conference, I want you to know that the next Conservative manifesto will contain our commitment to leave.”Badenoch said there would be “particular challenges in Northern Ireland”, where the ECHR is included in the Good Friday agreement. She said she would get Alex Burghart, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, “to examine this issue”.The address contained no policies that had not been previously announced, with Badenoch repeating her mantra that the party needed to learn from its 2024 election defeat and take time to put together a cohesive platform.“People won’t listen to us again unless we showed them we have learned from our mistakes and changed,” she said. Badenoch went on to take a swipe at Liz Truss’s mini-budget, saying: “We will never repeat the financial irresponsibility of spending commitments without saying where the money is coming from.”Much of her conference speech and that of Philp’s were focused on migration, with the shadow home secretary in particular using large parts of his address to list a sequence of criminal offences committed by asylum seekers. “This is sick. We must do whatever it takes to end this madness,” Philp said.He set out details of the new removals force, saying it would have twice the budget of the current system and be able to take advantage of the removal of many rights and avenues of appeal.“Stripping away the legal obstacles, that I have described, and doubling that budget means we can remove 150,000 people a year that have no legal right to be here. That is three-quarters of a million over the course of the next parliament. This illegal immigration scandal will end.”Badenoch took a similarly hard right tone in places, saying the UK had “tolerated the radical Islamist ideology” and that the country could not “import and tolerate values hostile to our own”.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochImmigration and asylumConservative conferenceHuman rightsConservativesRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

The enhanced tier covers countries and entities deemed a particular risk and requires extra disclosures. As a result, anyone doing undeclared work on behalf of Iran or Russia faces five years in prison.The Guardian reported in the spring that instead of targeting China as a whole, ministers were considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have been accused of interference in the west on the enhanced tier.Such entities include: China’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service; theChinese Communist party(CCP); the United Front Work Department, which is often referred to as the international arm of the CCP; and the People’s Liberation Army, which is China’s military.Watchdog cleared ex-Tory minister to work for offshoot of firm linked to China surveillanceRead moreThe government insists that countries’ designations in Firs are kept under review. The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.Ministers are under pressure concerning the consequences of their rapprochement with Beijing and are facing questions about the collapse of a trial of two Britons, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China.The trial of Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary aide to Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, and his friend Christopher Berry had been due to begin this month, but the case was suddenly dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service on 15 September. Cash and Berry denied the charges.The Sunday Times and the Telegraph reported that the government’s refusal to describe China as an “enemy” in witness evidence from a security official ledto the case being abandoned.Jonathan Powell, the prime minister’s national security adviser, is said to have chaired a meeting in Whitehall last month where he told officials the government’s evidence would stop well short of calling Beijing an enemy.Whitehall sources denied the claim that Powell was involved in restricting government evidence.The Sunday Times reported that Powell told the September meeting that additional evidence in the trial expected to be given by Matthew Collins, a deputy national security adviser, would have to be based on Labour’s new national security strategy published this year.That describes China as a “geo-strategic challenge” and not an enemy. Cash and Berry had been accused of allegedly breaching the 1911 Official Secrets Act, which says that a person is guilty of spying if they pass on information that is “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”.Government sources said while the meeting involving Powell had taken place, it had been mischaracterised. They said it would not be possible to insist that Collins cite 2025 government policy when the alleged offences had taken place previously, between 2021 and early 2023, when the Conservatives were in power.Collins had already given written evidence that had been cited by the CPS in its initial summary of the case in April 2024, at which point the accused were said to have acted in a way “prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK” by passing on information “directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state”.Government sources said that no evidence put forward by the state was withdrawn or changed and that no pressure of any kind was placed on the CPS. Collins’s evidence was considered important because it would help spell out the impact any alleged espionage would have had.Cash worked as an aide to Kearns, a backbencher, and was accused of passing on information to Berry. The CPS said he in turn wrote up 34 reports, at least some of which were about the British political system, for a Chinese individual assessed to be a member of the country’s intelligence services. The Guardian reported that Cai Qi, China’s fifth most senior official, was believed to be in receipt of this intelligence.Allies of Cash have indicated that while he did supply information to Berry, it was said to be public material on how parliament or UK politics works – or his personal analyses, such as who he thought would win the next election. Berry’s lawyers were expected to argue that he was working for a corporate client in China looking to expand in the UK.The CPS has said that the case had been “kept under continuous review” and that it was abandoned because the “evidential standard” was “no longer met”.On Sunday, officials pointed to a letter from Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, who had said in a letter to the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, that prosecutors had not been subject to “any disclosure or pressure” by politicians in deciding to drop the case ahead of trial.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, told broadcasters that there had been no “ministerial involvement” in the collapse of the case.Senior Tories have accused the government of collapsing the trial to avoid upsetting China, although the Conservativesalso declined to designate the country as a national security threatwhen they were in power.In the latest sign of warming relations with Beijing, the Guardian understands that a senior Foreign Office official met Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, over the summer to discuss the prospect of lifting the ban on the Chinese ambassador entering parliament in return forBeijing lifting its sanctions on UK parliamentarians.A string of high-level government figures have travelled to China on official visits since Labour came to power, including Peter Kyle, the business secretary,for trade talks last month, and Powell, the national security adviser, over the summer.Keir Starmer is widely expected to make a bilateral trip to China early in the new year, though the timing may depend on Donald Trump, who has said he intends to visit in early 2026.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismChinaEspionageAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

SinceHamas’s partial acceptanceof his plan to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza on Friday, the US, Israel and Hamas have all said they believe aceasefire is within sight.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the Cairo talks were “the closest we’ve come to getting all the hostages released” in an interview with ABC on Sunday. He warned that talks could still falter over logistics, however, and that details of the hostage release needed to be worked out.Rubio said there were long-term challenges in implementing the deal, in particular the creation of a technocratic governing body to overseeGazain place of Hamas. He emphasised that the current priority was the hostages’ release and ensuring Israeli troops withdrew to an agreed upon line in Gaza.Trump’s plan would mean Hamas releasing all hostages within 72 hours, surrendering ruling power to a transnational authority headed by the US president, and laying down its arms. In return, Israel would gradually withdraw its troops from Gaza and return more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal would release a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, parts of which are in famine, as well as reconstruction funds.On Saturday night, Trump shared a map of Gaza that delineated the initial withdrawal line of Israeli troops in Gaza, which ranged from 1.2 miles (2km) to 4 miles deep within the territory. He said if Hamas agreed to the withdrawal line, a ceasefire would begin immediately.Israeli forces are meant to completely withdraw to a buffer zone at the edge of Gaza under the terms of the plan, although the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that regardless of any deal, troops would remain in most of Gaza.Optimism about a potential ceasefire has grown across the world, with western and Arab leaders urging Hamas and Israel to come to a deal. On Sunday, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, called Netanyahu and expressed support for the Trump plan, describing it as “the best chance for peace”, according to a readout.Israeli officials have also said they hope to announce an end to the war in the coming days.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse the group was “very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions”.Trump threatened Hamas with “complete obliteration” if it did not reach a deal on Gaza in an interview with CNN. He also said Netanyahu was onboard for ending the bombing of Gaza.Despite Trump’s request that Israel stop its assault and despite orders for the military to only conduct “defensive operations”, it has continued bombing the Palestinian territory. At least eight people were killed in separate strikes on Gaza City, while four other people were shot dead while seeking aid in the south of the strip.“While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there’s no ceasefire in place at this point in time,” said Bedrosian.At least 67,139 people have been killed and about 170,000 injured by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza ministry of health, which said roughly half of those were women and children. Israel launched the campaign in retaliation after an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and involved 251 others being taken hostage.The UN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world’s leading association of genocide scholars have concluded thatIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the accusation and says it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaEgyptUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.”The remaining trekkers would arrive in Qudang in stages under the guidance and assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported. Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, according to an earlier report by state-backed Jimu News.Jimu estimated that nearly 1,000 people had been trapped. The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. It was also unclear if trekkers near the north face of Everest – also in Tibet – had been affected or not.Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted by villagers after enduring an evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning.“Back in the village we had a meal and were finally warm,” Chen said.The north face of Everest, due to its easy access by paved road, regularly draws large numbers of tourists.

He then compared that with his return drive through the parallel road, Bury New Road, where the Jewish community were “out in the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear”.Neville, who has built a vast property empire in Manchester since retiring from football in 2011, said he took down a union flag being displayed on one of his building sites.“Funnily enough on one of my development sites last week there was a union jack flag put up and I took it down instantly,” he said.“Some people might be watching this and thinking: ‘Gary you’re not really patriotic.’ I’ve played for my country 85 times, I love my country, I love Manchester and I loveEngland.”Neville, 50, said that in the years he has been building in the city, he had never seen union flags at the current rate and questioned why this was the case.“The union jack flag used in a negative fashion is not right and I’m a proud supporter of England, of Great Britain, of our country and will champion it anywhere in the world as one of the greatest places to live,” he said.“But I think we need to check ourselves, check ourselves and start to think about bringing ourselves back to a neutral point because we’re being pulled right and left and we don’t need to be pulled right and left at all.”The Sky Sports commentator has frequently voiced his opinions on political and social issues,including that people should “detest” the poor working conditionsfor migrant workers in Qatar and NHS staff in the UK, and criticising Boris Johnson for“fuelling” racism and hatredwhen he was prime minister.In his LinkedIn video, Neville commented on the diversity of football, saying that he played with people from across the UK and from around the world. “We were a beautiful team, united as one,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives.“Through our ‘plan for change’, we are putting more money back into working people’s pockets and making a simple dream a simple reality.”The government did not outline how it might prevent sellers passing any freshly inflated costs back on to first time buyers through higher house prices.The consultation process will cover the whole of the UK – even though the process of buying a home differs significantly depending on which nation the property is located in.For example, in England and Wales, there is no legal requirement to obtain a survey of a property before you buy it – although many buyers choose to commission one. In Scotland, however, the seller must provide a“home report” before they can put their property on the market– unless the property is a new-build home.The consultation process will also examine providing an option for buyers and sellers to sign binding contracts “to stop people walking away from agreements after buyers painstakingly spend months in negotiations”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alcohol-related deathsare at an all-time high.“The epidemic of alcohol and drug use is getting worse. The government says we’re drinking less, but I don’t see that,” said Dr Niall Campbell, a psychiatrist specialising in addiction at the Priory group of clinics which commissioned the survey from Censuswide. The group has seen a 40% rise since 2019 in the number of people seeking help for addiction, including more women than men.The survey found:10% worry that they drink too much and 5% that they use drugs too often.26% worry that a partner, family member or friend drinks too much.16% are concerned about a loved one’s use of illegal drugs.Families that earn more than £50,000 a year are three times more likely to contain someone with an addiction problem.Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive ofAlcohol Change UK, said: “Sadly these findings are not a surprise and mirror our own studies on the widespread nature of alcohol harm across the drinking spectrum.“It also offers a stark reminder of the ripple effect of alcohol harm beyond individuals on those around them. With more than 10 million people in the UK exceeding the ‘low risk’ guidelines of 14 units a week – and these stats highlighting that over a quarter of us are worried about a loved one’s relationship with alcohol – it’s fair to estimate there are millions out there struggling with a family member or friend’s drinking, many of which will sit outside the realm of addiction.”In addition, one in seven respondents (15%) said addiction had affected multiple generations of their family. Campbell suggested that genetics might help to explain that, and some people may be copying the behaviour of one or both of their parents.The Priory, which treats private and NHS-funded patients at its UK clinics, is launching a campaign called Break the Chain to highlight how common intergenerational addiction is.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it was rebuilding NHS drug and alcohol treatment services in England after years of neglect. “This government inherited a situation where patients had been let down by years of under-investment into addiction services,” they said.“We have provided an additional £310m in 2025-26 to improve drug and alcohol treatment services and recovery support in England, on top of the public health grant. Our plan for change will shift healthcare towards prevention, including through early intervention, to support people to live longer, healthier lives across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholismDrugsHealthAlcoholNHSPrivate healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Especially online.As a government shutdown loomed in the US last week, the presidentposted an AI videowhich depicted Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black House minority leader, wearing a sombrero and exaggerated moustache, with mariachi music playing in the background.Hispanic groupscriticizedTrump’s posts as “racist”, “dangerous” and “reprehensible”, but Trump doubled down, posting a new video which showed himself wearing a sombrero and playing the guitar behind a rendering of Jeffries.It wasn’t the only situation where Trump’s behavior has seemed unusual. Last weekend Trumpreposted to Truth Socialan AI-generated fake video which promoted “med bed hospitals”. Trump has reposted AI content before, but the difference was that this video showed an AI version of himself speaking.“Every American will soon receive their own med bed card,” the AI rendering of Trump, apparently seated in the Oval Office, said. “With it, you’ll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world.”Setting aside the fact that the idea of “med beds” is a rightwing conspiracy theory – one version of the theory posits that the government and/or a group of wealthy Americans have access to medical bed-like devices that can cure almost every illness, but are withholding the technology – Trump’s post prompted a number of questions.Did Trump, 79, believe that the video really showed him announcing med bed hospitals? Does the president think he gave a speech about med beds at the White House? Does he believe that his government is about to send “med bed cards” to every US citizen?The post was ultimately deleted, but it remains baffling, and the White House’s response did little to allay the confusion.“I think the president saw the video and posted it, and then took it down,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary,saidwhen asked about the video on Wednesday.“And he has the right to do that. It’s his social media. He’s incredibly transparent, as you all know. You hear from him directly on social media. He likes to share memes, he likes to share videos, he likes to repost things that he sees other people post on social media as well and I think it’s quite refreshing that we have a president who is so open and honest.”Leavitt’s words did little to explain Trump’s thinking as to why he might have posted the fake video. But, in truth, it was only the most recent example of increasingly odd behavior from Trump, who has – like his predecessor Joe Biden – beensubject to questionsover his mental acuity in recent months.Ina recent speech at the White Housewhere Trump claimed –against most existing evidence– that Tylenol could contribute to autism if women take it during pregnancy, Trump confusingly spoke of “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby”.Announcing that 13 grants would be awarded to investigate autism, Trump added: “They have to move quickly. They, they – when the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let’s do it now. I was just saying to Bobby [health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr] and the group, let’s do it now. Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”A week earlier, during a press conference with British prime minister Keir Starmer, TrumpconfusedAlbania with Armenia when discussing a peace deal struck between Armenia and Azerbaijan – a mistake Trump also made duringan appearance on Fox News.Back in the social media world, on Sunday Trumpwrote on Truth Socialthat he had “been briefed” on a shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan which killed four people. “The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do,” Trump wrote.He did indeed post again. But it was not an update on the still unfolding tragedy in Michigan. Instead, three hours later, he shared a video which showed an array of gold fixtures and fittings.“Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House. Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, ‘freak out’ when they see the quality and beauty. Best Oval Office ever, in terms of success and look!!! President DJT,”he wrote.He did not comment again that day on the Michigan shooting, although he did complain about the newNFL kickoff rule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”Trump continued: “I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.“We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”In the same speech, Trump claimed that cities including San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles are “very unsafe places and we’re going to straighten them out one by one”. The president then casually mentioned that he had told Pete Hegseth, the newly-annointed secretary of war, that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military”.The address prompted immediate concern, including from former military members. Barry McCaffrey, a retired general,told MSNBCthat Trump’s performance was “one of the most bizarre, unsettling events I’ve ever encountered”.“The president sounded incoherent, exhausted, rabidly partisan, at times stupid, meandering, couldn’t hold a thought together,” McCaffrey said.Trump’s speech was enough for Madeleine Dean, a Democratic congresswoman from Pennsylvania, to confront the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, in Washington on Wednesday, although Johnson appeared unconcerned.“The president is unhinged. He is unwell,”Dean told Johnson, in an encounter filmed by journalists.“Well a lot of folks on your side are too,” Johnson responded.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The response to Trump’s plan proves the international community hasn’t learned from catastropheDiana ButtuSun 5 Oct 2025 09.03 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 09.15 EDTShareFor two years, the world has watched asIsraelhas systematically destroyed the Gaza Strip, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and maiming an untold number more. As dangerously, Israel continues to methodically target the healthcare, education, water and sewage systems to ensure that life cannot resume in the Gaza Strip.Western governments’ responses to Israel’s actions have ranged from cheerleading and unconditional support in the first year of Israel’s attack on Gaza after 7 October 2023, followed by statements of concern and handwringing, to, more recently, occasional expressions of consternation and empty threats that continued Israeli attacks may, at some unspecified time, lead to an arms embargo or adrop in trade relations. In the last few months, there have also been the greatly celebrated proclamations ofconditional recognitionof a Palestinian state. The irony cannot be more profound: tepidly recognizing a state as it, and its people, are being erased without mercy.As I write this, confusion swirls aroundDonald Trump’s planto end the war and hope is mounting for a hostage and prisoner swap. While an end to the bombing, the freedom of captives on both sides and allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza would bring some relief in an otherwise unbearably bleak landscape, it would be a mistake to view the plan as a historic breakthrough for Palestine. Trump’s vision is yet another American-Israeli concoction cooked up without any input from Palestinians that would retain Israel’s perpetual control over Gaza’s future.How to burst the Israeli bubble | Noam SheizafRead moreThe world has never listened to Palestinian voices or taken seriously the existential threat Israel poses to Palestinian life, and this has not materially changed despite the increase in performative angst. To the contrary, Palestinians have for three-quarters of a century endured the world telling us that Israeli “security concerns” – however defined by Israel – are more important than our rights and lives. As a result Palestinians live with two omnipresent forms of violence: Israeli violence directly inflicted upon our bodies, land and society, and western violence, where only our erasure prompts the world to notice us and see our humanity – but only barely.I reach this conclusion from observing up close, for a quarter-century, how this mode of western thinking and operating plays out. Despite two years of carnage inGaza, and everything the world has learned about Israel’s true intentions, that mode is repeating itself as I write this, with global powers lining up behind a proposal that does little to ensure Palestinians gain any say over their future.Rhetoric without consequence has been the west’s modus operandi for decades. The cost has been catastrophic.View image in fullscreenA magic pillAt the end of September 2000, I joined the Palestinian negotiating team as a lawyer involved in the negotiations with Israel. This was a big journey for me: I am the daughter of Palestinians born before the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing ofPalestine. My parents’ families, unlike the vast majority of Palestinians, did not flee in 1948 and later became Israeli citizens, living in Nazareth, in a state that did not want them. In 1967, they decided to emigrate to Canada, where I was born, raised and educated. I had not lived in Palestine before joining the negotiating team except for a few months at a time. Now, I had committed to being in Palestine for a year. I joined the team as a lawyer after a friend, also a member of the legal team, informed me that one of the flaws of the “Oslo peace process” was its vagueness. I had believed, naively, that the team could remedy that.This was the height of the peace process, as it was labelled at the time, which began under President Bill Clinton in 1993 with the historic handshake between Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Through a series of agreements, the Palestinian Authority was created and the West Bank and Gaza Strip were further subdivided, with new Israeli checkpoints scattered throughout. Major issues such as borders, settlements, the rights of millions of refugees and Jerusalem were taken off the table indefinitely.The ‘peace process’ became a magic pill rendering the occupation invisible to the westAll of these were now bilateral issues for Israel and the Palestinians to to be resolve between them, with the rest of the world theoretically standing by as neutral observers. But they were not neutral, and the two main actors were not equals. The US was then and remains to this day Israel’s biggest supplier of weapons and diplomatic support and Europe is Israel’s largest trading partner. Before entering into this negotiations process,Palestinians sought assurances, particularly from the US, that the asymmetry in power would be addressed. Such assurances were tacitly provided but never honored, throughout decades of negotiations.From the early 1990s, global applause for peace talks abounded. But what ultimately happened is that endless calls for a “two-state solution” that evaded explicit realization of Palestinian self-determination and freedom replaced calls for an end to Israel’s military occupation. The “peace process” became a magic pill rendering the occupation invisible to the west, disguising its metastisizing, omnipresent and ever more violent form. Palestine was now reduced to a subject of “negotiation” requiring concessions, with the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine swept under the rug to be forgotten.View image in fullscreenPresident Bill Clinton (center) stands between Yasser Arafat (right) and Yitzahk Rabin as they shake hands for the first time, on 13 September 1993 at the White House in Washington DC, after signing the Israel-PLO Oslo Accords.Photograph: J David Ake/AFP/Getty ImagesWith this magic pill swallowed, Israel used the cover of the “peace process” to build and expand Israeli settlements, correctly believing that these facts on the ground would strengthen their position at the negotiating table. And with the settlements came settlers and checkpoints and an expanding Kafkaesque system of military control. By 2000, the West Bank became unrecognizable: Palestinians were navigating a maze that erratically changed on a daily basis as the West Bank was now divided into tiny islands, with some areas administered by the Palestinian Authority but with Israel retaining overall control.By the time I arrived to take up my post, a few months had passed since Clinton convened the July 2000 meeting at Camp David, which was touted by the US as aiming to bring about a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. It was clear to anyone paying attention to the years of negotiations, and their endless delays and convolutions, that this meeting would not produce the result that Clinton hoped for. In fact, the Palestinian delegation had warned the Americans of this evident risk before the parties convened. By this point, Israeli settlements antithetical to any agreement had swelled, in factnearly doubled, with close to 400,000 settlers the living in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Palestinians were cut off from traveling to Jerusalem, to and from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and into Israel.The Americans promised the Palestinian delegation that no blame would be attributed to either side should the negotiations not yield an agreement. Yet, owing to then Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak’s “fragile” governing coalition, Clinton blamed the failed meeting on Palestinians. “Fragile coalition” had long been the phrase countless diplomats invoked to demand that Palestinians accept Israeli settlement construction, racist incitement, mass closures and arrests – lest extremists in the Israeli government sabotage the talks.I arrived in Palestine on 28 September 2000. That very day, Ariel Sharon, then head of the Likud party, went to al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City in a show of force, surrounded by more than 1,000 armed Israeli police officers, to demonstrate that he, and by extension Israel, would never “compromise” on Jerusalem. As Palestinians demonstrated against Sharon’s brazen provocation, the Israeli police did what they always do: shoot. They killed at least four Palestinians that day and injured about 200.Two days later, a Palestinian cameraman from Gaza, Talal Abu Rahma, capturedvideo of Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son Muhammadunder fire on Salah al-Din Road, south of Gaza City. Jamal desperately tried to shield his son as bullets rained down on them, to no avail. Muhammad al-Durrah was mortally wounded and died soon after. The image of Jamal trying to shield his son went viral and sparked further and widespread protest. Within five days,Israel killed 47 Palestinians. The second intifada had begun.View image in fullscreenJamal al-Durrah and his son Mohammed, 12, hide behind a barrel to protect themselves from Israeli-Palestinian crossfire on 30 September 2000.Photograph: EPAIt was in this environment that I began to observe the workings of international diplomacy and negotiations up close, through in a never-ending series of meetings with a constellation of ambassadors, international organizations and representatives from the most powerful governments in the world.To be clear, the negotiations process was flawed from the outset: these were not negotiations between two equal and sovereign nations, negotiating over a border or future relations between two states. Rather, this was a process of negotiations between Israel – which controlled every aspect of Palestinian life – with the people it relentlessly controls, the Palestinians. This was not just a question of asymmetry of power but of complete control.I have frequently been asked to relate events from these negotiations that illustrate this central structural failure – and there are plenty. But that misses the point: given that the Israelis stole our land and expelled our people, I did not expect that they would suddenly have an about-face and admit that they wronged us. The greater insult came from those who promised us that this process would lead to our freedom and who instead chose to prioritize Israeli “security concerns” and “domestic constraints” over the crushing weight of the increasingly repressive regime required to maintain the system of supremacy that Israel is founded upon.As the second intifada continued, it grew bloodier. By the time it ended in 2005, more than 3,000 Palestinians and650 Israeli civilianswere killed, along with about 300 Israeli soldiers.As Palestinians were besieged, gunned down and assassinated with helicopter gunships, F-16s, and Apache helicopters firing the most sophisticated weaponry on Earth at Palestinian refugee camps, Arafat, himself holed up in his office, was told he needed to “stop the violence”. as if there was some on/off switch that he was refusing to flip, to control each and every rightless Palestinian. Absurdly, those living under occupation were expected to provide “security” to the occupier.I would often see an Israeli tank just outside my office in Ramallah including, at times, when we were supposed to be in negotiations. At one point, the Israeli army took over my apartment, also in Ramallah, at gunpoint in the middle of the night, sending me outside into a gun battle. I could not return for three days.Over time, as Israel’s methods of control became ever more brutal, Palestinians were fed with cliches: “Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?” I was asked by diplomats. No one dared ask: “Where is the Israeli Charles de Gaulle?” Palestinians were routinely asked to condemn Palestinian violence but rarely was Israel asked to condemn its own violence. This remains the case to this day. The inherent violence of Israel’s military occupation was thus normalized.What the diplomats, and others, fail to acknowledge and internalize is that occupation, by its very nature, is violentIsrael used this period, once again, to expropriate more Palestinian land to build and expand settlements, which continuously popped up throughout the West Bank – no area was spared. The point: to destroy the “two-state solution” no matter how it is defined. The settlements are considered war crimes under international law and a violation of the stated policy of virtually every government around the world. Yet, here too, the magical “two-state solution” pill prevailed, obscuring a brutal reality with the vague promise of an unattainable goal.A striking example is illustrated in an area now called Givat Assaf situated just off the major north-south highway in the West Bank, close to Ramallah and the Israeli settlement of Beit El. Givat Assaf was established by a group of armed squatters who one evening in 2001 decided to take over a piece of privately owned Palestinian land, to avenge the killing of a settler. This was done illegally, even under Israeli military law. The Israeli government claimed that it could not do anything to stop the armed thugs who decided that this land would now be theirs. “Fragile coalition,” we were told.At the time, diplomats travelled through a designated checkpoint and passed Givat Assaf every time they entered or exited Ramallah. It was impossible to miss. For Palestinians, the presence of this new outpost meant a new random checkpoint, for Palestinians only, sprang up daily. The Israeli army routinely kidnapped Palestinian men from cars, while other Palestinians were violently forced out of vehicles, often beaten and made to stand in the scorching sun for hours as Israeli cars whizzed past. The pop-up checkpoints were replaced by a permanent one, requiring that more Palestinian land be taken over to “protect” the illegal squatters. Over time, the outpost grew and soon electricity lines, approved by the government, replaced the power generators. One day, a pizzeria popped up. To this day, the squatters remain, plainly visible to the diplomats driving past, and the Israeli government is in the process of “legalizing” the outpost. Today, there are more than 750,000 settlers in the West Bank and that number is on the rise.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier walks past the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Givat Asaf, north of Ramallah in the West Bank, in 2009.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APMeanwhile, Israel filled its prisons with Palestinian men, women and children – including avowedly nonviolent activists – reaching up to 10,000 people at one point, huge numbers of whom were imprisoned for months without charge or trial. “It is terrible,” I would be told by diplomats. Yet no matter what Israel did to Palestinians, to Palestinian land, Palestinian homes or even to the schools and clinics funded by these very same diplomats, nothing would break their unshakable faith in the magic pill. Their sole fixation was to ensure any Palestinian response to the violent Israeli occupation remained peaceful.I cannot recall a single month in which a Palestinian was not killed in these 25 years. What the diplomats, and others, fail to acknowledge and internalize is that occupation, by its very nature, requires violence to maintain. Our warnings that Israel’s use of force was escalating were met with indifference. Palestinian lives did not matter. Palestinian voices did not matter. Palestinian experiences did not matter.View image in fullscreenThe Gaza cageBut nowhere was this failure to listen to Palestinians more acutely felt – and more deadly – than in the Gaza Strip. Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on Earth, filled with Palestinians and their descendants who fled from their homes in what became Israel. For Israel, the Gaza Strip has always been a “problem”: a reminder of 1948 because its residents demand to return to their homes just a few kilometres away. Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister, once said of Gaza that it would be good if it was swallowed up by the sea.Israel has always sought to dominate Gaza. To that end, it built 21 settlements that cut off the north of the narrow strip from the south. In addition to the 7,000 settlers, Israel established impractical and unnecessary farms, taking up 20% of Gaza’s land, and draining its scarce water.In 2005, Sharon, by then Israel’s prime minister, devised a plan to “disengage” from the Gaza Strip. The settlements were removed but Israel’s control did not end. In many ways, it intensified.View image in fullscreenIsraeli border police remove a Jewish settler youth from Palm Beach Hotel in the Gush Katif settlements bloc in the southern Gaza Strip, in 2005.Photograph: David Furst/AFP/Getty ImagesAt that time, I moved to Gaza to join the Palestinian team working on the post-disengagement plan. Living there was both magical and difficult. Everyone I met in Gaza was welcoming and warm. Beyond the overcrowded housing, Gaza was home to some of the world’s oldest churches, monasteries and mosques. The sea was a beautiful outlet – but not one to explore very far. In the distance there were always Israeli navy ships, ready to shoot at Palestinian fishers who dared to venture beyond an always changing arbitrary point that Israel enforced. Palestinians were caged by land and sea. Above, Israeli airplanes were always in the sky. I never saw a commercial airplane fly above Gaza but Israeli jets broke the sound barrier with regularity.“You can turn Gaza into Singapore!” the Israelis told us, as though we had the power to develop the territory into something modern and shining, and as though we wanted to. (They had not yet becomeobsessedwith Dubai.) But Gaza would be completely cut off from the world after the disengagement – Israel would continue to control the airspace, the territorial waters and all of the crossing points. Nothing could enter or exit the Gaza Strip without Israel’s permission. We kept pushing the Americans, the Europeans and others to demand that Israel open Gaza: that it be allowed to build an airport, a seaport and that we be allowed to travel to and from the West Bank and to the rest of the world.The destruction of Palestine is breaking the world | Moustafa BayoumiRead more“Work with the Israelis,” the US and the Europeans told me in 2005.“But if you do not pressure the Israelis, Israel will turn Gaza into an open-air prison,” I said.“Oh, they would not want that.”“But they said they would not relinquish any control which means that Gaza will be turned into an open-air prison. Imagine what that will do.”“We believe that this is best solved bilaterally. But of course we are here for support.”One such attempt at support included observers from an international organization. The meeting, in the lead-up to Israel’s evacuation of settlements from Gaza, involved Israelis from the Ministry of Defense discussing how goods would move between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israelis insisted that all goods entering and exiting Gaza be searched for “security reasons”.“We can provide scanners,” said the representative from the international organization.“No,” said the Israeli Ministry of Defense representative. “The scanner specifications that we have are so high that there is no such scanner that exists.” I laughed out loud.“So there is nothing that will meet your ‘security needs’?” I asked.“Not yet,” he responded, deadpan.Later that evening, the representative from the international organization and another diplomat stressed to me and others: “It is important that you try to work with the Israelis to figure something out.”I countered: “What incentive does Israel have to want to see goods and people move from the West Bank and Gaza and back?”And the predictable diplomatic reply: “You have to remember, this is a fragile coalition so the statements that they make in public are not what they actually mean. They have told us that they do not want to see Gaza closed.”In August 2005, Israel evacuated its settlements and on 12 September, the Israeli armyliterallyclosed the gate to the Gaza Strip. Gaza was now isolated from the rest of the world: no one and nothing could enter or exit without Israel’s permission. In June 2006, I, too, was forced to leave after the Israelis refused to renew my permit to be in Gaza.Yet, there was euphoria that day. For the first time in decades, Palestinians in Gaza felt free. I was able to take a taxi from Gaza City, where I lived, to Rafah, without having to go through the Abu Houli checkpoint (cruelly named after the man on whose land it was erected).The day Israel evacuated, I visited the mother of Muhammad al-Durrah, the boy who Israel shot to death five years earlier. She had a little baby girl in her arms, no more than six months old. Like so many people in Gaza, the mother was looking for something to be optimistic about. “At least she will grow up and not have to see the Israeli army,” she said. I could not hold back my tears, thinking about her murdered son and fearing that her predictions would prove wrong.The euphoria was indeed short-lived. Within days – and this was before Hamas was elected to govern Gaza – Israel was back to killing Palestinians and breaking the sound barrier. In response, Palestinians fired crude rockets into Israel, and in response to that, Israel placed Gaza under further lockdown.The impact was devastating. Much-needed radiation equipment to treat cancer would not be allowed into Gaza due to “security concerns” and those with cancer would not be allowed out easily for treatment elsewhere – also due to “security concerns”. With the general election in 2006, in which Hamas won the popular vote, Israel tightened the restrictions even further. The army was even making precise calculations of Gaza’sdaily caloric requirements.And yet, Israel’s successive bombing campaigns in Gaza did not break the west’s unshakable faith in the magic pill of the “two-state solution” or their unwavering support for Israel’s “security concerns”. As Israeliswere boastingthat they were bombing Gaza back to the stone age, diplomats barely uttered a word.Instead, the international community shunned Hamas, with some referring to them as the “de facto authority” in Gaza, refusing to even use the group’s name. Hamas was isolated, completely cut off from the world, and so too, Gaza. As Palestinians languished in the largest open-air prison in the world, the group doubled down on its military strategy, paving the way for the 7 October attack.View image in fullscreenHistory repeats itselfBut for Palestinians, there is no magic pill.The west continues to entertain proposals, like the one currently hanging over the region, giving Israel the ultimate say over the future of Gaza. How is it that the country committing genocide is granted any say in the future of the people against whom it has committed genocide?View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians evacuating southbound from Gaza City travel on foot and by vehicle along the coastal road in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip on 13 September 2025.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the latest plan, there are absolutely no guarantees that aid will be allowed into Gaza, that control will be ceded by Israel, that Israel will pull back or that Gaza will be rebuilt. Instead, if Palestinians give up their claims for accountability for Israel’s war crimes, we may get a vague “pathway to self-determination and statehood”. Not a state – a “pathway”. How generous.We are witnessing a willful repetition of the mistakes of the pastI find myself thinking back on my experience over the years, wondering what would have happened had there been a genuine, robust attempt to end Israel’s military rule. What if, instead of looking the other way, the international community had imposed sanctions on Israel? What if instead of just endlessly repeating that they believe in the “two-state solution”, states had actually taken tangible action to bring it about?And so, two years into Israel’s genocide, we are witnessing a willful repetition of the mistakes of the past. This time, some more countries have recognized a “state” with great fanfare but still do nothing to ensure a free and prosperous Palestine. They cannot even ensure the basic protection of Palestinian life.Diana Buttu is a lawyer and former adviser to the negotiating team of the Palestine Liberation OrganizationIllustrations by Edmon de Haro"

He’s a great fit for this breezy show, which is definitely not The TripGraeme VirtueSun 5 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 17.02 EDTShareWhile the Euro-hopping reality competitionDestination Xmight not have been the Traitors-rivalling summer smash the BBC were hoping for, it did give host Rob Brydon a lovely glow-up. The convoluted coach trip clearly wanted to give off a jet-setting vibe, so its master of ceremonies was outfitted in deluxe tailoring: boldly coloured three-piece suits, silky cravats and yacht-ready blazers. All of a sudden, Brydon had the debonair look to match his vintage Roger Moore impression.His latest three-part series, Rob Brydon’s Honky Tonk Road Trip, also features someMr Benn-style thematic wardrobe. The genial Welshman goes fullYellowstonecowpoke in a parade of flannel shirts, rugged jackets and the occasional Stetson hat. It’s all part of a premise that sees him piloting an imposing Ford Ranger pickup truck on a 2,000-mile circuit of the southern US for a crash course in country music.Brydon has been tasked with marking the centenary of the genre – or at least the 100th anniversary of the Nashville radio show that evolved into the Grand Ole Opry, cornerstone and kingmaker of country music for generations – via the time-honoured celebrity travelogue tradition of driving around, gabbing to locals and immersing himself in the culture. That the centenary has coincided with country becoming, he claims, “the fastest-growing genre in the UK” – thanks to Taylor Swift and recent countrified albums fromBeyoncé,Post Maloneand others – offers another angle to explore.We know Brydon is up for a road trip and a chinwag thanks to the various incarnations ofThe Tripwith Steve Coogan. But at first he seems unsure if he is truly qualified to be our guide. Watching him confide to a dashboard-mounted camera certainly brings back beta male memories of Keith, the sad-sack cabby from Brydon’s TV breakthrough, Marion & Geoff. En route to Nashville, he phones his Gavin & Stacey co-star Ruth Jones for a pep talk. She reminds him that he has some genuine country bona fides: their 2009 Comic Relief cover ofIslands in the Streamwas a UK No 1. (“Dolly and Kenny only made it to No 7!” she points out.)If the “full sensory overload” of a night out in Nashville is a little too much for Brydon – a line-dancing attempt with the UK actor turned country singer Twinnie sees him tap out during the opening Shania Twain song – the 60-year-old is far less wobbly legged in the interview segments. His respectful lines of questioning seem to gel well with southern manners, efficiently extracting Johnny Cash stories and general musings on the spirit of country music from silvery-haired veterans like the Grand Ole Opry fixture Bill Anderson and 92-year-old tailor-to-the-stars Manuel Cuevas. His gentle manner also works with younger guns, like the scraggly-bearded hitmaker Luke Combs and the bluegrass banjo maestro Tray Wellington.While some of the anecdotes feel well worn, the opening episode does contain at least one genuine curveball. What on earth is Gary Barlow doing hanging out in a homely east Nashville studio? Apparently he has been coming to Tennessee to hone his songwriting since the 1990s, and points to Glen Campbell as an influence on Take That’s bulletproof ballad Back for Good. Here, at last, is an interviewee Brydon can needle, mock and wind up without fear of causing a diplomatic incident. (Barlow, bless him, is very game.)With an entire century of country to contextualise and celebrate, it is understandable that this southern-fried tour through Tennessee and Kentucky (with pit stops in Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi to come) wants to focus on music and not necessarily engage with the current political moment. But it cannot help but seep in a little. While guesting on the glossy morning show of the Nashville radio station WSM – proud founder of the Grand Ole Opry – Brydon jokingly wonders if the US and Canada are still friends, which throws his slick hosts off their stride. We do not get to see the presumably icy aftermath.But for all his apparent self-doubt, Brydon is clearly a good fit for this sort of breezy, bite-size format: amiable, interested, self-effacing and always ready to dress the part, even if he struggles to find a fancy cowboy shirt that comes in a medium. Should Coogan be concerned that his wingman can do the whole travelogue thing without him? Definitely.Rob Brydon’s Honky Tonk Road Trip aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer. It continues on Sundays at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRob BrydonCountryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Meghan’s choice of Balenciaga – a French house founded by a Spaniard with an Italian designer - was notable for the absence of any links to Britain.View image in fullscreenPierpaolo Piccioli sees himself as an architect building shapes that never touch the body.Photograph: ShutterstockIntriguingly, the theme of Piccioli’s “manifesto”, as he described the collection backstage, was female emancipation.His starting point was Cristóbal Balenciaga’s 1957 sack dress, a silhouette that sits proud off the body to neither amplify nor constrict a woman’s curves.The look was a radical expression of a zeitgeist that was beginning to shift from 1950s conservatism towards the 1960s, said Piccioli. “It was about progress for women. It freed women from the weight of clothes that sit on their body and talk about their body. The sack dress allowed women to be free in space.”View image in fullscreenBalenciaga’s most iconic silhouettes were included in the show, such as this ‘cocoon’ coat.Photograph: ShutterstockClothes that hold their own shape are at the heart of Balenciaga. Piccioli likened this way of designing to being an architect: building shapes that never touch the body, but all the while thinking about the humans who will move within.“Cristóbal Balenciaga was obsessed with the body and with fabric, and with a third element – the air between the two,” he said.View image in fullscreenFirst on to the catwalk was a reworking of the sack dress, a look that ‘freed women from the weight of clothes that sit on their body and talk about their body’, said Piccioli.Photograph: ShutterstockPiccioli, who at 58 wears strings of beads and charms around his neck and exudes an air of hippie-ish serenity, isn’t interested in seeing fashion as an ego battle.

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Celine Nonon at Arlington Artists. Archive image: courtesy of Anthea TurnerBorn in 1960 in Stoke-on-Trent, Anthea Turner began her broadcasting career as a runner for BBC Radio Stoke before moving into children’s television, presentingBlue Peterfrom 1992 to 1994. She went on to front primetime shows including GMTV, The National Lottery Live and Wish You Were Here ... ? More recently, she has appeared on reality series from Celebrity Big Brother to Dancing on Ice, and continues to work across TV, radio and publishing. She is teaming up with Corgi to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Thunderbirds.During Christmas1992,there was a high demand for Tracy Island, the Thunderbirds’ secret headquarters playset. The manufacturers hadn’t ordered enough, so Blue Peter came to the rescue, declaring: “Don’t worry! You can make one at home instead!”When I made one on TV, however, the DIY instructions ended up being so sought-after that our little offices became snowed under with letters. That’s what’s behind me – Royal Mail bags full of stamped addressed envelopes from children wanting to know how to make it. There were probably parents all over the country scratching their heads, thinking: “Why did we think we could help our child craft this intricate thing?” Tracy Island was not for the faint-hearted. I practised so many times to get it right for the live show. There were 8 million viewers – I couldn’t mess it up.These were such fun and innocent times. Everything was slower in the 90s, but there was more unity and the viewers were so engaged. I was 32 when I got the job and glad to be a little older, as it meant I could deal with the pressure of recording two shows a day. They were looking for someone who could hit the ground running, and by this point I had done Saturday morning television and Top of the Pops, so I was ready to jump in with both feet.I could have seen myself following a PR path. Because when it comes down to it, I’m just hustlingDespite how much I enjoyed being part of the team, I spent my Blue Peter era scared to death that I was going to get found out. I was dyslexic, and remember filling in the forms for a Blue Peter medical and thinking: “Oh shit, they’re going to give my job to someone else because I can’t spell.” I ended up getting away with it, but it made me more studious; I had to learn every trick to cover it up. Each morning I would go through my script and learn my and my co-host’s lines by heart, even though there was an Autocue. Nobody knew how to deal with dyslexia back then, but instead of becoming a weakness, it made me even more diligent and creative.I left the show in1994because I was offered a presenting spot onGMTV. In my heart, I wished I could have stayed at Blue Peter for a few more years because I was so happy, but opportunities like that were rare. Transitioning out of children’s television can be tough, so I had to take the leap. The Blue Peter producer Biddy Baxter was a legend but, I had assumed, not my No 1 fan, as she didn’t initially want me for the show. However, when I told her I was leaving, she tore a strip off me, saying: “I cannot believe what you’re doing!” Biddy had various opinions about GMTV, none of which were glowing. I left with mixed feelings, but the Blue Peter team remain a family. There are WhatsApp groups. I did Celebrity SAS in 2020 and remember arriving at this small airport and feeling scared. I looked around and saw the former Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton and immediately felt safe again.There was a part of my life after Blue Peter where I was in the newspapers a lot. How did I cope with the intrusion? Celebrity didn’t all happen overnight. The media’s focus on me was a slow burn; it wasn’t like one day I woke up and was famous. After a while, you get used to the attention, and it wasn’t an issue. But it did mean that when something went wrong – personal stuff like break-ups – stories did end up in the Daily Mail. I don’t feel bitter about it. Being a public figure can be full of joy. If I’m out and about and need help from someone, I always get a warm response from strangers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Getting older isn’t an issue – but a bit of vanity, wanting to fit into some nice clothes, that doesn’t hurt anybody. That said, the elixir of youth is not in a pot of face cream. (Even though I do sell a line of face cream.) Instead, it is in your attitude. I’m trekking Kilimanjaro soon – I guess I thought I needed a challenge. I like to shove myself out of my comfort zone and do something that’s good for my health. Especially now I’ve got more air miles behind me than in front of me. I’m in sniper’s alley! Of course, there are the odd days where I stand in front of the mirror and hold my chin up a little and go: “Oh gosh, that bit doesn’t look quite as good as it used to.” You can turn yourself inside out with that fear of ageing, and I don’t want it to consume me.It’s also harder to get your voice out there these days, because there are so many people scrambling to get people’s attention online. I have fully embraced social media and I love Instagram. I know it gets a bad rap, and some areas of the internet are dark and nasty. But thankfully I’m not involved in those circles, and instead my tribe is positive and enlightening. I might not have millions of people following me, but the right people do.I’m a Gemini, so there are lotsof jobs I think I could have done. As a child I had wanted to be a ballet dancer. I did a few shows, and was intermediate. For many years, I chastised myself, thinking: “I did all that training, and I never actually pursued it properly.” But that core of dance and the discipline ballet requires has been instrumental to almost every job I’ve had. When I did [the winter sports reality show] The Jump, me and Kimberly Wyatt both treated it like a dance competition.The other option for me was PR. Before I got Blue Peter, work wasn’t flowing in, and a friend and I set up a company called Parker Turner PR. I could have seen myself following that path. Because when it comes down to it, I’m just hustling. Whether I am presenting a current affairs show or telling people how to make Tracy Island, I’m selling. But in a nice way, of course.I’ve never been so busy representing my generation. Whether it’s lifestyle or travel, I’m out there. This year I’ve modelled for clothing brands, and have been reporting from St Lucia and Tanzania. Most days I look at my diary and think: “Wow, this is a good life, isn’t it?” For a dyslexic from Stoke, I’ve made a little go a long way.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFlashbackPhotographyBlue PeterGMTVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The author and activist behind the term ‘enshittification’ explains what’s gone wrong with the internet – and what we can do about itCory DoctorowSun 5 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you,terrifying.In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us:enshittification. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It isn’t just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?Here’s the natural history of enshittification:1First, platforms are good to their users.2Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.3Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. TakeAmazon, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan forAmazon, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?Stage1: good tousersAmazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hardnotto shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook, Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.Stage2: abusing users, good to businessesAmazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threatssimply because they were large. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.It was under this theory thatJimmy Carterstarted to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. ThenRonald Reagancame along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reaganstarted under Carter, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including)Joe Biden.The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.Stage3: a giant pile of shitAmazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, tocream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.Same withFulfilment by Amazon, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.Top results in a product search aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to be top of the listHere’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to theUS Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than$50bn every yearcharging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “Amazon’s pricing paradox”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there,andthe merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page isbad. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.The internet is not the most important issue facing us. But it is where fights against genocide, inequality and racism will be wagedThis is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If theydocheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Whywouldthe company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.Aconfession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawnedOccupyandBlack Lives Matterhas become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.Audre Lordewas far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buyingRead moreYou won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers andwarehouse workers. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.Martin Luther King Jronce said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important.This is an edited extract from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow, published by Verso at £22 on 14 October.

Set during the doldrums of the Trojan war, seven years in, it speaks of conflict as well as of Troilus and Cressida’s star-crossed love. But is this a history play highlighting the hopelessness of war, or a send-up of Homer’s heroic masculinity with a romance thrown in?No doubt Hamlet’s pontificating Polonius would have a hyphenated answer to the mixing of genres (is this what he meant by a “tragical-historical-pastoral?”). Director Owen Horsleyhas an answer too: this is satire – if not war-farce – in which the “heroes” of classical antiquity are roundly ridiculous. A giant, Pythonesque foot sits on the stage (great design by Ryan Dawson Laight), to set the tone.Horsley’s direction brings clarity to a dense play – the cast-list is trimmed (there is no Priam, Aeneas, Calchas or Andromache, among others) while long, sabre-rattling speeches are hemmed in or made buffoonish. The warring men flex their muscles, showboat in gold armour like Marvel superheroes, and bask in our applause on circular daises placed in the pit. It is clear, through the satire, that their war is driven by vanity and power. Several gender inversions (Ulysses, Thersites, Pandarus) are used effectively for the same end.View image in fullscreenLucy McCormick as Helen of Troy.Photograph: Helen MurrayAchilles (David Cave) is a slob, refusing to fight in the war as his pretty-boy lover Patroclus (Tadeo Martinez) hangs by. Ajax (Ibraheem Toure) is a convincing meat-head, manipulated to encourage Achilles back to the battlefield. Ulysses (Jodie McNee) is a strategist pulling all their strings.Much of it is amusing and inventive: Cassandra (also McNee) is dressed as an activist, and delivers her urgent predictions through a megaphone. Romantic fixer Pandarus (Samantha Spiro) is a beautician and bawd, dropping crass nudge-winks after Troilus (Kasper Hilton-Hille, ardent, earnest) and Cressida (Charlotte O’Leary, headstrong yet pragmatic) spend the night together. The shambolic fool, Thersites (Lucy McCormick), is inventively reincarnated as a prancing, twitching goth in gold shorts and bra.It bursts with ideas and invention, perhaps too much so. There are so many ideas and comic inversions that they create complication that verges on chaos. And even at its trotting pace and with its streamlined script, it still feel too long, with a tone that strays into the wacky. The cast double up in what seems like significant pairings, but it is unclear why McCormick plays Thersites and Helen of Troy in the same twitching manner – is it a clownish send-up of the central love that sparks the Trojan war?View image in fullscreenKasper Hilton-Hille and Charlotte O’Leary as Troilus and Cressida, with Samantha Spiro as Pandarus.Photograph: Helen MurrayThe dark turn in Troilus and Cressida’s love story is made graphic as Greek soldiers grope Cressida after she is traded to the Greeks by her own father. But it does not quite carry the chilling echoes it should, butting awkwardly against the comedy.Yet Cressida is still a force in her depiction here: a survivor who understands war is about power, and is determined to come out of it alive. Her disappearance, after she is traded, gives this play its inherent unresolved and unsatisfying end. War simply rumbles on, as do these lustful men. Pandarus tries, heroically, to bring the last few laughs here. It is a heroic attempt at comedy all round.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, until 26 OctoberExplore more on these topicsShakespeare's GlobeTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

After literally centuries of women seeking to serve as leaders in the church, a woman will now hold the most senior position in the Church of England. And the news was welcomed not simply becauseSarah Mullallyis a woman, but because she is a wise, intelligent, courageous and compassionate leader.Of course, some people are unhappy – either because of her sex or because of her support for the blessings of same-sex relationships. And some raise concerns about a serious safeguarding case five years ago thatwas not handled wellon her watch by the diocese of London safeguarding team.Nonetheless, Bishop Sarah – while quite diminutive in stature – has broad shoulders, which she will need. She has survived seven years as bishop of London, which covers one of the most polarised parts of the country when it comes to female priests and bishops.One in five churchesin London have passed resolutions to limit women from being vicars or from consecrating the bread and wine. She has been on the receiving end of misogynistic behaviour: in February of this year at General Synod, the church’s national assembly, she broke down in tears as she brought to mind the many “micro-aggressions” she has been subjected to. I would hazard a guess that some of those incidents were not micro at all.As archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop Sarah will preside over a church that is open to women being priests and bishops but, at the same time, has seven serving bishops who welcome her as their new archbishop but would not personally receive communion from her (the bishops of Blackburn, Chichester, Beverley, Fulham, Oswestry, Richborough and Lewes); and one bishop (the bishop of Ebbsfleet)who does not believewomen should be in authority over men in the church. Furthermore, there arestill nearly 600 churches, according to Women and the Church, that continue to limit women, where she might not be able to preside over the bread and wine or preach.In her global role as head of the Anglican communion – the 85 million people in more than 165 countries who call themselves Anglicans – Bishop Sarah will also face challenges because of her sex. Although most provinces in the Anglican communion do now accept female priests and bishops, some do not. Her position on same-sex relations – she is supportive of allowing clergy to bless same-sex relationships, if they agree to do this – is also criticised by some. Significant and powerful factions of the Church of England and Anglican communion resist this. Gafcon (the Global Anglican Future Conference), a network of conservative churches, has already announced that it receives the news of Bishop Sarah’s appointment “with sorrow”.So how will this all play out?By the time Bishop Sarah is “enthroned” as archbishop in March next year, she will only have six years before she will be expected to retire at age 70. There is nonetheless a lot she can achieve in that time. To do that, I believe, she will need to demonstrate leadership that takes the church in a clear direction. In the past, the rallying cry has been unity and our leaders have gone round in circles to agree with everyone – despite there being proper processes for making difficult decisions through prayerful debates and votes at General Synod.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The temptation will be to ask for more alternative episcopal oversight on other issues, such as same-sex blessings. But this direction will lead to further division and more people being unable to give or receive the bread and wine together (something that is at the very heart of what it means to be a church). Having the courage to follow due process, take decisions and not always make complicated and expensive provision for those who don’t win the vote will bring not only clarity, but ultimately greater unity too.Recently, I was in a Church of England school teaching a sixth-form class and one young woman said that a boy she knew had told her that the Bible says women need to be under the authority of men. I would have liked to have been able to tell her that this is not what the Church of England believes, full stop. But I could not – as churches are allowed to teach this. In a world with so many problems, so much hatred, misogyny and racism, it would be good for the Church of England to have an authentic voice at its top that calls out the systems of male privilege that drive violence and abuse against women and addresses the institutional misogyny that is currently being ignored. Hopefully, the appointment of our first female archbishop of Canterbury will be a big step towards this.The Rev Martine Oborne is the chair of Women and the Church (Watch) and vicar of St Michael’s church in Chiswick, LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The central reason for what may have to be upwards of£20bn of tax risesis the Office for Budget Responsibility’s backward-looking reassessment of the UK’s productivity potential.Step one for Reeves was to plant this complex idea – that we are still catching up with the true scale of the economy’s weakness after 14 years of Conservative austerity.But just as the winter fuel allowance decision was missing a rationale – aside from the “black hole” in the public finances – a tax-raising budget with no narrative aside from balancing the books risks being unpicked.Back in the summer, some around the chancellor were hinting Labour had been nudged by its fiscal predicament into (belatedly) weighing radical tax reform.But that would require a clear story about what is wrong with the current system, and who is getting off too lightly – which will take time to develop publicly.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Helen Miller urged Reevesin a recent FT articleto “stop thinking in terms of isolated tax increases and start with a vision”.She pointed out that the tax system as it stands is riddled with unfairness and distortions, such as “people on similar incomes can face wildly different tax bills”.If Reeves chose to move in this direction, there would be no shortage of ideas out there for tackling the gap between the tax rate faced by wage earners and the generally lower rates charged on income from wealth – what the Resolution Foundation calls the“tax bias against employees”.Recent researchby the thinktank Demostried to test potential public support for a £20bn-plus slate of progressive tax changes recommended by the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax), many of which were aimed at reducing that bias.These included charging national insurance contributions (NICs) on rental income – worth a handy £3bn – and an £11bn upgrade of the capital gains system, to equalise the rate with income tax but at the same time sharpen incentives with an investment allowance.Through polling and focus groups, Demos found the public were potentially receptive to these and other reforms – much more so than a manifesto-busting increase in income tax or NICs.When they presented participants with a mocked-up BBC news story describing the chancellor as making “nine large tax rises” to “‘slash loopholes and rebalance the tax system”, those who felt positive about the idea outnumbered those who felt negative by 10 percentage points.Most individual revenue-raising measures were viewed positively, too – including levying additional council tax on homes worth more than £2m and charging the equivalent of employer NICs on the pay of partners in law and accountancy firms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves raised an additional £8bn from higher-income individuals, they point out – once measures such as higher capital gains tax, VAT on private school fees and inheritance tax on farms are totted up.Those dots were never joined at the time, however – opening Reeves up to criticism from the left that her team finds especially irksome: that she has failed to tax the UK’s wealthiest more.Many tax reform measures recommended by the IFS, CenTax and a battery of other thinktanks would have the benefit of being pro-growth as well as pro-fairness by reducing incentives for taxpayers to bend their economic behaviour to minimise their bills, for example, by setting up pointless one-person companies.But it would be a courageous chancellor who presented £20bn to £30bn of additional taxes as though they were solely aimed at boosting Britain’s productivity.Instead, Reeves should reach for the language of solidarity, social justice and fairness, that this particular Labour government tends to recoil from.The chancellor stressed in her speech that she believes in “a Britain founded on contribution”. She has less than eight weeks to make the case that some of us should contribute a bit more.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Economics viewpointRachel ReevesTax and spendingLabourBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

Splashy, lurid pink ads told me that systemic and societal barriers would fall in the face of my self-confidence.Researchershave since debunked the notion that an individual can fix their lives through positive thinking. Will Storr, in his book Selfie,unpacks how theneoliberal mythof the level playing field underpins much of the self-improvement movement.Yet there is a part of me that still believes that if I work hard and glue together a sturdy vision board, I should be able to achieve my wildest dreams: the only thing standing between me and my destiny is me. How do I find a point of equilibrium, a balance between believing that I am capable of anything but am not responsible for every failure?My generation agonises over how to act and what to say. We have to learn to go with the flow | Bertin HuynhRead moreThe answer, according to Saint Augustine, a North African Catholic bishop and philosopher from the fourth century CE, is humility. Augustine wrote that humility was the foundation of all other virtues, and that for someone seeking God “the first part is humility; the second, humility; the third, humility”(Letters 118:22).For a lapsed Catholic like me, the word “humility” may trigger a range of negative emotions. I grew up in an era of the church when caring about your looks constituted the sin of vanity; sexual desire was unacceptable outside of procreation; and just thinking about masturbation was a punishable offence.I don’t think that this was Saint Augustine’s intention, but for many years, I conflated “humility” with shame.Being humble, according to psychiatrist Ravi Chandra, is not about self-loathing. Someone who is healthily humble is proud of their abilities and achievements while acknowledging that there is always more to learn. Chandra defineseight kinds of humility: cultural humility; intergenerational humility; intellectual humility; humility of knowledge; humility of skill; humility of wisdom; humility of awe; and humility in the face of suffering.Psychological researchhas also identified a range of benefits arising from intellectual humility, including greater resilience, tolerance and relatedness.In my work as a pastoral care practitioner in aged care, I now think about humility as the act of being present to the other. Humility is an act of re-grounding: coming back, breath by breath, to the carpet beneath my shoes and the person sitting in front of me.There are some residents who tell me the same five anecdotes from their lives, over and over again, every time I see them. Instead of watching the clock, I try to listen. I try to stay curious. What can I learn from this person and the stories that have stayed with them when so much else has gone?I try to live with the Taoist attitude that theological scholar Huston Smith described as “creative quietude”.Taoist philosophers encourage humans to quiet the ego and live aligned to the flow of creation.This might be especially relevant as humans seek to repair the damage our species has done to the natural world. In her bookFathoms: The World in the Whale,Rebecca Giggs explains that being humble allows us to re-connect with “the animalinside,the creature that quakes at what twitches beyond the campfire light”. Taking a position of humility, of not-knowing, allows us to remember our species is a part of a larger whole.There is a barrenness and hopelessness that comes with believing you can do anything: success – whether this means getting rich, losing weight, or winning the presidential race – becomes the only acceptable option. Humility allows for grace and failure. I am humble, rooted in the earth, which means I have everything I need to grow.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

I wish I did tooPolly HudsonI’m disillusioned with Keir Starmer’s government. But my late father’s passion for his political career makes it difficult to imagine putting my cross in another boxSun 5 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 03.30 EDTShareWith hindsight, perhaps my expectations were slightly too high. WhenLabourwon the 2024 election I thought the whole country was going to live happily ever after, like the end of a fairytale in which good triumphs over evil.Spoiler alert: that hasn’t quite happened.In not unrelated news, last week a former Labour candidate, Matthew Syed, wrote a column in the Sunday Times entitled “I’ve joined the Conservatives”. Unexpectedly, it made me somewhat envious.I’d never go over to the Tories like him, but disillusioned with Starmer’s party generally (and specifically, including but not limited to: winter-fuel-cuts-gate, Mandelson-gate,“golden-ticket”-gate,Angela Rayner-gate), this might be the moment to question my allegiance. If I could. That’s why I’m jealous of Syed – he has a choice, but I don’t.My dadwas a Labour MP, and later a working peer in the House of Lords, for more than 30 years. He took me to cast my first vote, age 18, walking me right up to the booth, placing a hand on my shoulder, and telling me solemnly to “Do the right thing”.There was no doubt in my mind what that was. The running gag in my house was that my parents would help me, no matter what – if I got pregnant in my teens, or became addicted to drugs, they would be there. “But if you ever vote Tory, you’re on your own!” went the punchline. As Freud said, there are no jokes.I rebelled in many different and increasingly imaginative ways during my teenage years and beyond, but not once did I consider not voting Labour, let alone actually going through with it. My dad died in 2012, I am a grown woman with full autonomy, but this is still very much the case. You might argue that he wouldn’t have known which box I put my cross into even when he was around, but I’m certain he would have instantly sensed my betrayal: psychically, telepathically, by echolocation.Punchlines and guiding hands aside, it feels impossible to go against my dad because of how passionately he believed in what he was doing. How hard he worked. How regularly I had to bite my tongue while people ranted about all politicians being selfish, unscrupulous egomaniacs (nobody was going to accept that he was different via the highly impartial source of his daughter). It sounds almost twee to describe how important it was to him to do good. Even now, if I walk down the high street in either of his former constituencies, some stranger will come up and tell me that my dad helped them, in a manner they have never forgotten.His job was also a complete pain on many occasions. I grew up and went to school in the first area he was an MP so many of my classmates’ parents knew who he was. “I’ll tell you what’s wrong with Labour …” they would say when I came round to play, which is hard to care about when you’re seven and far more interested in dolls’ tea parties than political ones. My dad missed class plays and sports days, concerts and parents’ evenings because he was always at work. At secondary school, my staunch Conservative French teacher hated me on sight, and barely bothered to hide it,malheureusement. Often, I wished dad had a normal, boring career.Labour members feel disconnected from government, says Lucy PowellRead moreThe last time my dad left home before he died was to vote on a bill in the Lords. He was so clearly on his last legs that it must have been obvious they wouldn’t see him again, and when he got up to leave both sides of the chamber gave him a standing ovation. He came outside and into the car where my mum was waiting for him without mentioning it. We only know because a colleague told us at his funeral. Short of extracting a dramatic promise from me on his deathbed, I can’t think of much that would be more persuasive to stay true to the party he dedicated his life to than that.Like anybody who has lost someone they love, I’d give anything to spend even five minutes more with my dad. There’s lots I want to tell him, and I wouldn’t mind introducing him to his grandson, but also I’m desperate to know what he thinks of Labour in 2025. Oh, and if he remains of the opinion that going Green is sadly a wasted vote, or if it’s OK in the current circumstances. Somehow, I suspect the answer is still no.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As far as I could tell, “the special relationship” meant that a British passport carried a sort of immunity akin to that enjoyed by diplomats; it was a mobility that allowed me to work, after all, as a journalist unscathed across west Africa’s restive Sahel belt for years.Things began to fall apart after I attended a pro-Palestine protest on campus in September last year. We had brought a job fair to a standstill – because it featured booths fromBoeingandL3Harris, companies that supplied Israel with the armaments it needed to carry out its genocidal campaign in Gaza. Although I was there for just five minutes, I was subsequently banned from campus, a punishment that felt like a kind of house arrest because my home was on the university’s Ithaca campus in upstate New York. While I could continue living there, I was barred from entering the university premises.In January, as Donald Trump steamrolled into office brandishing an arsenal of executive orderstargeting non-citizen student protesters, I left my home and went into hiding at the remote home of a professor, fearing the reach of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Three months later, I self-deported to Canada, then flew to Switzerland. I was prompted to flee after a friend, who had spent time with me in Ithaca, was detained at a Florida airport – on the other side of the country – and questioned about my whereabouts. I did not return to the UK as reports that pro-Palestine journalists had beenarrestedthere made me fearful.I hoped my arrival in Switzerland would mark the end of my ordeal. But two weeks in, two distressing emails reached my inbox. The first was from Cornell, informing me that the US government had effectively terminated my student visa status. The second came from Google, informing me that it had “received and responded to legal process” and handed my data to the Department of Homeland Security. These emails arrived 90 minutes apart.The quickfire emails confirmed my hunch that I had been under surveillance and that if I attempted to re-enter the US, I would likely be detained by Ice,like other student protesters. But the secrecy surrounding these procedures and the lack of due process to challenge them raised more questions than they answered.Was there any correspondence between Cornell and US government agencies prior to my visa being terminated? (I asked the university this, among other questions, and have not heard back.) What did the most powerful government in the world want with my Google data?Why did the US authorities go after me? Had they woven a yarn of suspicion based on my years working as a journalist covering the US-led “war on terror”? Was I targeted because I was Black and Muslim?I may never get the full answers, but aninvestigation by Amnesty Internationalsheds new light on the alarming ways that the US government has deployed shadowy AI tech to mass-monitor, surveil and assess non-US citizen students and immigrants.Amnesty saysthat Babel X, software made by Virginia-based Babel Street, allegedly scours social media for “terrorism”-related content and tries to predict the likely intent behind the posts. The software uses “persistent search” to constantly monitor new information once an initial query has been made. It is possible that my reportage – on everything from Guantánamo to drone strikes in the Sahel and the role the British secret services played in the Libyan civil war – was flagged. Amnesty International says that probabilistic technologies have a wide margin of error, “can often be discriminatory and biased, and could lead to falsely framing pro-Palestine content as antisemitic”. Babel Street did not respond to Amnesty’s requests for comment for their investigation.View image in fullscreenA federal agent threatens to Taser protesters outside a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, 13 June 2025.Photograph: Andrés Kudacki/Getty ImagesThen there is Palantir’s ImmigrationOS, which creates an electronic case file to centralise all information related to an immigrant investigation, allowing authorities to link multiple investigations to draw connections between cases. Using ImmigrationOS, Ice can also track self-deportations and it was rolled out in April, the same month I left. It may help explain why the US took action to bar my re-entry into the country when it did. (Palantir told Amnesty that it does not specifically target student protesters, nor are their products powering rights-violating immigration enforcements.)This all exists in the pre-crime space that has expanded exponentially since the launch of the US-led “war on terror” – catch (or kill) now, ask questions later. To this day, I have never been accused or prosecuted for any crime, or for exhibiting antisemitic behaviour. As has been made clear by a recentcomplaintby the University of Chicago Law Clinic, submitted on behalf of me and eight other non-citizen protesters to eight UN special rapporteurs, I’ve merely exercised my first amendment free speech rights to oppose the slaughter of innocent people. It is the US government that has actedunlawfullyand immorally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re seeing this play out in Gaza, where Israel’s “algorithmic warfare” has reduced the territory to a wasteland of corpses and rubble, leaving Palestinians with nowhere to go and nothing to eat. The investigation further shows that the US is mobilising tech to strip asylum seekers and migrants of their basic human rights, consigning them to arbitrary detention before they have a chance to defend themselves or ask for safety.While I am far from regretting my actions, I now live in a month-to-month limbo of precarious living arrangements and nagging doubts about whether I can finish my degree before my funding is cut. I have been forced to jump through hoops to access life-saving medical treatment. I was perhaps naive to think that as a British national with aLondon accent, at an Ivy League university, I was above these horrors. But just before I left the US, Joe, my African American barber, reminded me that: “You’re just Black.” My Blackness made my status in the US conditional. And because I am also Muslim and write about these identities does not help matters. It is no surprise that in a country with a legacy of racial slavery and post-9/11 Islamophobia, I would get flagged.With this technology in the hands of an administration that has little regard for constitutional safeguards, we should all beware.

No dictator has ever pleaded for generals and admirals to applaud his remarks, followed by deafening silence.Donald Trumpis used to entering to the din of a mob jazzed up with YMCA. “I’ve never walked into a room so silent before,” Trump said when he addressed the country’s highest-ranking military leaders at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on Tuesday. “Don’t laugh. Don’t know if you’re allowed to do that.” He was trying to force some tittering, an old lounge act gag to rouse a dead audience. “You know what? Just have a good time.” The comedian who felt his routine was bombing before he even began sought to relax the room. Then Trump instinctively replaced the ingratiating gestures with threats. “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.”Trump’s syllogism perfectly encapsulated his psychology of victimhood and politics of retribution. If you do not bend the knee to him, he is personally wounded. Your failure to worship him must be punished. Your slight of his majesty condemns you to ruin.Trump cannot grasp that the silence of the commanders during his unprecedented address to them demonstrated their highest duty. Their discipline showed fidelity to uphold their oath to the constitution. By their stillness they presented themselves as models for the rest of the officer corps and the troops. They are not loyal to Trump or any cult of personality, but to his constitutional role. They were being used as a backdrop for a campaign-like rally, but they were resistant to serving as partisan players.Trump’s inability to understand their stolidity in the face of his provocations showed his incomprehension not only of the military but the presidency under the law. When he took offense at their stoney silence his rebuke disclosed that he saw them merely as his pawns. They were to his mind no different from his personal attorneys he had installed at the Department of Justice to do his bidding, including the suppression of theEpstein files.Trump had come on an urgent mission for them to carry out. He was there to tell the military chiefs they were to be his unquestioning agents for the greatest reversal of military strategy since the “war on terror” –a new war to be waged against his perceived political opponents at home in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the domestic deployment of theUS militaryas a police force.All the senior generals in all the world had been gathered for the unprecedented event at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on the order of secretary of defense,Pete Hegseth. They had no inkling for what momentous occasion they were being summoned. They dared not speculate that Hegseth brought them to be his captive audience for his self-referential vanity Ted talk attempting to rehabilitate his image and assert his authority. That would have seemed too stupid for words.When will US generals stand-up to Trump? | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreBut the commanders could have gotten more than a hint that they were being rounded up for the latest episode of It Can’t Happen Here, by reading Trump’s executive order of 22 September, Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization, an “organization” that does not exist. This was followed by aNational Security Presidential Memorandum No 7on 25 September citing themurder of Charlie Kirkand a series of disparate events as pretexts: “This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns … ”According to NSPM-7, a new “national strategy” would be implemented against an ideology of “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Jimmy Kimmel was not mentioned.These vapors were not a description of an ideology so much as a hodgepodge of Maga shibboleths. If there were any ideology expressed it was an inchoate fascism based on a repressive impulse that conjured up an all-purpose enemy called “Antifa”. Any sense of irony, of course, was completely missing. In fact,January 6was the last attempt to overthrow the US government, incited by Donald Trump. The leadership of Trump as a paragon of “traditional American views on family, religion, and morality” defies satire and only underscores the recurrent demand for the release of the Epstein files.The theatrical presentation at Quantico began with Hegseth darting back and forth on the stage. He was a motivational speaker as a drill sergeant with a book to hawk – and a warm-up act for the headliner. Observing him was like seeing the negative of a photograph. The darkest parts were reflections of his own grievances at the criticism and censure provoked by his past behavior.The former national guard major said he had been been “deemed an extremist”; he wasflaggedas a possible “insider threat” by fellow officers. (Hegseth has denied that he is an extremist). Despitenumerous accounts of his alcoholism, he told Megyn Kelly in an interview: “I never had a drinking problem,” but then reportedlypromised a senatorthat he would “not touch alcohol while I have this position”. Hegseth wasaccused of sexual assault in 2017, andsettled a lawsuitbrought by the woman who had accused him. (The settlement terms were confidential. Hegseth has said the allegations were false).As a Fox News host, Hegseth had been a prominent advocate for pardoning or granting clemency to service members accused or convicted of war crimes. Hegseth described them as “warriors” rather than “war criminals”. “If he committed premeditated murder, then I did as well ... Put us all in jail,” he said about one of them. Hegseth voiced support for members of his own unit in Iraq killing threeunarmed detaineeswho were told to run and then shot. Once Hegseth was confirmed, hepurged the top-rank judge advocate general. He’spushing a planto send many of the rest to work in immigration courts.Hegseth said that the military should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement”, his long-time complaint against rules designed to protect civilians and enforce military law against war crimes.Now, in his speech, Hegseth declared he was clearing away “the debris”. He encouraged loosening regulations aimed at preventing forbidden violence within the armed forces. He announced the “overhauling” of the inspector general and whistleblower complaint process, which would undermine legal protections and shield violent or reckless offenders from accountability. He would, he said, impose discriminatory measures of “gender-neutral” or “male level” physical standards for combat roles, stating: “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it.” (In 2023, more than 17% of the military force was composed of women, with thousands in combat roles.)Hegseth swaggered in front of the commanders, barking obscenities – “Fafo”, or Fuck Around and Find Out. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris. As I’ve said before and will say again, we are done with that shit.”The generals sat expressionless at his vulgarity that could be charged under the Uniform Military Code of Justice as a violation against indecent language that “neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline”.According to Pete, it was the flabby generals who needed to work out like Pete. “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It’s a bad look,” he said. “No more beardos.” That means you, Gen Grant.What do Trump and Hegseth’s inflammatory speeches to military generals signal? | Moira DoneganRead moreHegseth, at last, was seemingly getting his revenge for being tagged as an “insider threat”. He shouted: “No more side-tracking careers, no more walking on eggshells.” He accused the brass of harming the military by evaluating the mental stability of officers: “We’ve weeded out so-called toxic leaders under the guise of double-blind psychology assessments, promoting risk-averse, go-along-to-get-along conformists instead.” Then he plugged his book: “You might say we’re ending the war on warriors. I heard someone wrote a book about that.” The title of his book was The War on Warriors.Not once did Hegseth mention “Russia” or “Ukraine”. He made not the slightest reference to Russia’s huge missile attacks bombarding Ukraine, Russia’s drones over Romania, Estonia and Denmark, the tensions over US wavering within the western alliance, or utter anything that might be construed as a strategic thought.After his menacing speech, Hegseth made way forDonald Trump. Trump displayed his usual contempt for the military by baiting them with an array of partisan barbs to which they remained rigidly motionless. He slipped into a whirlpool of self-celebration followed by anxiety. There were bits about the “Gulf of America”, calling Joe “the autopen” and watching the 1950s TV series Victory At Sea, before Trump came to his worry of falling down stairs. “Every day, the guy is falling downstairs,” Trump said about Biden. “We can’t have it. I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs,like, I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly.” He could not contain his envy of Barack Obama. “So one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs. I’ve never seen it. Da-da, da-da, da-da, bop, bop, bop. He’d go down the stairs. Wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great. I don’t want to do it.”In the middle of his stream of consciousness, he dropped his new mission for the military against the “enemy from within”, with major American cities as the “training grounds … the ones that are run by the radical-left Democrats … And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.” Silence.The next day, 1 October, in Memphis, Hegseth appeared as a member of a posse with attorney generalPam Bondiand White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to speak before a rally of Ice agents and federal marshals in anticipation of the arrival of a contingent of national guard troops. Miller delivered his imitation of Patton. “The gangbangers that you deal with – they think they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are. They think they’re hardcore? We are so much more hardcore than they are.” Miller, not any mere general, gave the order. “You are unleashed.”You could tell Stephen Miller embodied the new “warrior ethos”. No beard. Shaved head, too.

More recently, the abuse scandals that led to theresignationof Justin Welby last year have also gravely diminished the authority of the established church.Yet at a time of polarisation and disturbing social division, the Church of England still has a vital role to play. As the far rightco-optsthe symbols of Christianity to promote hostility and intimidation towards perceived outsiders and minorities, Britain’s faith movements have a duty to be standard-bearers for an ethos of tolerance, generosity and inclusion. In that context, the historicnominationof Dame Sarah Mullally as the first female archbishop of Canterbury should be seen as a landmark moment.A former chief nursing officer, Dame Sarah has been a powerful advocate for the rights of women in the Anglican church, becoming the first female bishop of London in 2018. Just over three decades after the Church of England ordained the first female priests, her appointment completes a once bitterlycontestedjourney towards equality. Within an institution that endured an annus horribilis last year, it sends a message of necessary renewal and openness to change.On Friday, during her firstaddressas archbishop-designate, Dame Sarah highlighted the importance of belatedly improving safeguarding structures for young people in parishes. That is an urgent task if the church’s credibility in local communities is to be restored. The rest of her in-tray will be just as challenging.An institutional inability to fully embrace the validity of same-sex love continues to leave Anglicans out of step with the nation they seek to serve spiritually. Charged with leading fraught church discussions on sexuality, Dame Sarah was instrumental in the recentintroductionof “prayers of love and faith” for same-sex couples. Those reforms have met deep resistance among traditionalists, but failed to satisfy liberals seeking full equality through the endorsement of same-sex marriage.Across the country, sparsely populated pews, ashortageof clergy and acute financial pressures have contributed to a crisis of morale in many parishes. Meanwhile, rebellious conservatives in the worldwide Anglican communion are likely to see the appointment of a female archbishop as further grounds forrejectingspiritual leadership from Lambeth Palace.Such entrenched divisions will be difficult to overcome. But speaking more broadly on Friday, the day after the appalling terrorattackon a Manchester synagogue, Dame Sarah struck the right initial note. Referring to the need to soften the hard edges of “an age that craves certainty and tribalism”, she deplored the “hatred that rises up through fractures in our communities”. As migrants and minority ethnic groups find themselves increasingly scapegoated and targeted, that is a message that needs to resonate throughout society.In one of her Christmas messages while bishop of London, Dame SarahcitedEmily Dickinson’s poetic vision of hope as a small bird that “perches in the soul” throughout dark times. For progressive Anglicans, the Crown Nominations Commission’s decision that she should become the 106th archbishop of Canterbury is a hope fulfilled. The rest of us should wish her well as she takes on a daunting role at a critical moment.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet Britain seems remarkably ill-preparedSun 5 Oct 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe cause isn’t clear, but the impact has already been devastating. More than a month has passed sinceJaguar Land Rover(JLR) was targeted in a cyber-attack that forced the car manufacturer to turn off computers and shut factories. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, last week claimed Labour had taken “decisive action” to support JLR’s supply chain, but the government’s promise to guarantee part of a £1.5bn commercial loan looked more like an attempt to weather the party conference than an act of genuine support.The firm will survive. It made pre-tax profits of £2.5bn last year and has a rich owner. Its suppliers aren’t so lucky. The Guardian has reported thatthousands of workershave already been laid off across its supply chain. JLR is paying itsdirect suppliers, but this money will take time to pass down to smaller firms. The sight of banks asking parts makers to put up their family homes as guarantees for emergency loans is outrageous. Small suppliers shouldn’t have to take on debt to cope with a crisis for which they’re blameless. Either JLR will have to act fast to prevent bankruptcies, or the state will need to step in to funnel cash directly to small parts makers.The details of the cyber-attack have not yet been established, and JLR hasn’t confirmed whether it was held to ransom. Even so, there are similarities with the ransomware attacks against Marks & Spencer and the Co-operative Group earlier this year. All three companies had outsourced some of their IT functions. All three are big-name brands, making them attractive to“big-game-hunting” attackerswho extort huge payments. (The Guardian was hit by aransomwareattack in 2022.) Not long after the JLR attack, hackers held a nursery chain, Kido, to ransom and posted pictures of children online. These cases should be a wake-up call: cybercriminals pose a seismic and increasingly sophisticated threat.For one of the world’s most targeted nations, Britain seems remarkably ill-prepared.Almost a thirdof British businesses aren’t insured against cybercrime (notably, JLR did not have cyber-insurance), and many policies exclude state-backed attacks. In a world where hostile states, particularly Russia, support attacks on western institutions, this leaves firms distinctly vulnerable. The National Crime Agency, which investigates cybercrime, is supposed to be Britain’s answer to the FBI, but it looks underfunded and amateurish by comparison. Morale is low, pay is risible and staff turnover so high that the amount it spent on temporary consultants increased by369% between 2015and 2023.The creaking state of Britain’s public sector makes it particularly vulnerable. The British Library and Hackney council arestill recoveringfrom cyber-attacks on their systems, while the WannaCry attack that originated in North Korea caused life-threatening danger to NHS patients in 2017. Many local authoritiescan’t affordcyber-insurance, andalmost a thirdof central government runs on antiquated computer systems. As of 2019, the government was spendinghalf its annual IT budgeton keeping these running.A serious cyber-attack on the NHS or vital infrastructure should alarm ministers. Yet the Home Office, which leads on ransomware security, pays far more attention to small boats than cybercrime. The government’s proposedcybersecurity and resilience billhas still not been introduced to parliament, and it remains unclear whether Britain willfollow the EUinmaking software companies liable for cybersecurity defects. In the meantime, hackers are already inside the systems of their next victim.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromGabriele Hodgson,Selina OsmanandDeirdre BurrellSun 5 Oct 2025 12.13 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 12.31 EDTShareAs a British Jew, I was extremely disappointed to read about Shabana Mahmood calling pro-Palestine protests “fundamentally un-British” in the wake of last Thursday’s tragedy, when a synagogue was attacked by a terrorist (Home secretary calls Gaza protests in wake of Manchester attack ‘un-British’, 3 October).I am extremely proud to be both British and Jewish, and I believe that the conflation of Zionism withJudaismis wrong and contributes to antisemitism. I am mourning the loss of life in Thursday’s attack. But in no way does that prevent me from calling out the Israeli government and its war crimes.The Jewish people of the UK have varying stances on issues, like any other group. We are not all Zionists, and to conflate the two fuels antisemitic stereotypes. Some members of the community support Israel, while others like me have been protesting against its actions.I can’t pretend to speak for all Jews – no one can – but at many of the protests there have been Jewish voices loudly declaring “not in our name”; I hope the government will listen to us too. We must not allow the acts of a deranged few silence the calls for humanity of many.Tomilyn RupertLondonThe decision of the Metropolitan police to ask the organisers of a protest against the Palestine Action ban to postpone it in order to free up officers in the wake of a terror attack raises serious questions about the logic of law enforcement’s approach to these protests (Report, 2 October).If these activities are, as the police describe them, a protest, then why have participants been arrested in the past? If, on the other hand, they are crimes, then why write to the organisers to postpone their criminal activities until it’s more convenient for the police to make arrests? Are they also writing to criminal gangs or real terrorist groups, asking them to reschedule their illegal activities for a more convenient time?Can I also point out that apart from supporting freedom of speech, these protests are about people being murdered on a daily basis in large numbers. Are these lives less valuable than British lives?Gabriele HodgsonLondonI’m sorry that Jonathan Freedland had to write this article (In a time of hate and rancour, two Jews sought to pray – and were killed. Let Manchester be a turning point, 3 October). The only positive I can take from it is that it forced me to confront something that I’m ashamed to admit: I’ve been one of those people who conflate Israel with Jewish identity.As a Black person and a Muslim, I deeply resent it when people reduce me to labels or politics I didn’t choose – yet I haven’t extended that same courtesy or understanding to Jews. That’s not OK.Jonathan’s article helped me recognise that. I’ve seen the security around Jewish institutions and, shamefully, I never questioned why it was necessary. It’s unacceptable that any community should have to live with that kind of fear – anywhere. Thank you, Jonathan, for helping to open my eyes.Selina OsmanOslo, NorwayJonathan Freedland is absolutely right that for us Guardian readers who have the time and inclination, we can educate ourselves about the fact that “anti-Israel” is not necessarily “anti-Jewish”. Sadly, when the prime minister of Israel himself conflates those two positions, and accuses his government’s critics of antisemitism, for many people the situation becomes very confusing.Deirdre BurrellMortimer, BerkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This experience confirms that unless there is full accountability for police discrimination, the behaviour will simply carry on. The failure to have accountability is part of the institutional discrimination highlighted inthe Casey review.The failure of the police to tackle racism in its own ranks has a long history. Over the past seven years, 13 convictions have beenquashed at the court of appeal– victims of the racist, corrupt British Transport Police officerDet Sgt Derek Ridgewell’s squads in the 1970s. There will be more cases. Ridgewell was imprisoned for seven years in 1980 for conspiracy to steal goods from the very depot at which he had prosecuted several British Rail employees for the same offence three years earlier. (Ridgewell died in prison in 1982.)We represent several family members of those fitted up by Ridgewell, whose fathers did not live to see their exonerations. They are calling for a change in the law that when a police officer is imprisoned, an automatic order is made as part of the sentence to review their files for miscarriage of justice cases. If that had been done in 1980, it would have avoided decades of misery for Ridgewell’s victims. It also would have helped challenge a culture of police racism decades earlier.Matt FootCo-director, AppealShabana Mahmood says police chiefs have been given the power to “automatically sack officers who fail background checks”. However, one has to question the effectiveness of such background checks if the Met employed a BBC reporter who then operated underground for seven months in one of its stations.Harvey SandersLondonCongratulations to the setter of the Wordsearch on police (G2 print section, 2 October) for avoiding words such as “racist”, “homophobic” and “sexist”.Rev Richard StainerBradfield St George, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Luckily, Europe is not devoid of the tools required to rise to this moment. The European Political Community – which met in Copenhagen last week – was cobbled together to present a united front with Ukraine, but has quickly established itself as a fixture of the diplomatic calendar, and one of the sole forums that can still convene post-Brexit Britain, Erdoğan’s Turkey and the non-EU “eastern flank”. It’s already proving to be the flexible and inclusive vehicle for common action that European security demands.Meanwhile, original thinking and a willingness to break out of institutional silos may yet help the EU itself overcome the “delay and fudge” Menon identifies. On this front, an EU economic security council is an idea whose time has come – a simple-to-implement framework, in the model of its American equivalent, which would deliver the geostrategic assessment of key decisions that the EU desperately needs. The EU itself will probably never exercise hard power, but if we can hardwire a sense of economic statecraft throughout Brussels policymaking, the institutions will be better able to leverage the power they do possess – not simply for peacetime prosperity, but in the service of continental security too.Luuk van MiddelaarFounding director,Brussels Institute for GeopoliticsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Furious fans had surrounded the Rangers team bus in Falkirk.Rangers fans angry at Russell Martin blockade team bus after Falkirk drawRead moreThe Rangers board had been reluctant to part with Martin, who was only hired in June, despite vociferous protests from supporters. However, there was an understanding the 39-year-old’s position became untenable. Rangers have won only one of their top-flight games to date, which has been combined withdismal performances in Europe. Overall, Martin won only five of 17 competitive matches with a passive, muddled brand of football that earned him few friends.“While all transition periods require some time, results have not met the club’s expectations,” said a Rangers statement on Sunday night. “Assistant head coach, Matt Gill, and first-team coach, Mike Williamson, will also be departing. Russell and his staff have worked exceptionally hard throughout their time at the club. We thank them for their efforts and wish them well for the future.”Gerrard won the title with Rangers in 2020-21, their only championship since 2011. His performance in Glasgow before then, coupled with struggles at Aston Villa, raises questions about his managerial capabilities. Yet he is held in high esteem by the very group of supporters Rangers desperately need back on side. The reappointment of the Liverpool icon, who last managed in Saudi Arabia, would prove hugely popular. Gerrard will also be aware of what few options he has to be a manager in significant leagues.View image in fullscreenRangers fans made their feelings seen and heard during their side’s draw at Falkirk.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockMartin’s exit will intensify scrutiny on Kevin Thelwell, the Rangers sporting director. He had been hugely supportive of the manager while publicly revealing a net spend of £20m in the summer window. Martin had signed a three-year contract.Martin, who had previously been in charge of MK Dons and Swansea, managed Southampton to promotion to the Premier League in 2024 after being appointed the previous summer. He was sacked last December after the Saints won only one of their first 16 games.He was named Barry Ferguson’s successorin June, afterthe interim head coach had succeededthe sacked Philippe Clementin February.Danny Röhl, the former Sheffield Wednesday manager, and Sean Dyche, most recently in charge of Everton, are among others who are likely to enter the frame for the Rangers hotseat.In Sunday’s match, Rangers took the lead when Bojan Miovski slid the ball in from close range shortly before half-time, but the chants against the manager continued and increased in volume when John McGlynn’s Falkirk levelled spectacularly in the 73rd minute, Henry Cartwright curling in a vicious right-footed drive from 25 yards.Explore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

It extended the manager’s winless run to seven games since he succeeded Nuno Espírito Santo last month. Yet Postecoglou, who unusually started with a back five, detected signs of progress as he prepared for vital talks with directors to discuss the future. “Yes, it’s a lost cause,” he said, sarcastically. “I see it as an exciting opportunity. You have to be up for the fight and the struggle. I’d be silly to be sitting here at the age of 60 if I lacked self-belief or fight. Even in the schoolyard I picked fights with people that beat me up.”Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães adds to Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest crisisRead moreWarming to his theme, Postecoglou gently mocked the pantomime of Premier League football that almost demands that at least one manager is always deemed under pressure. “I get that it’s part of the fanfare of the Premier League that it needs one manager to be in the spotlight. If people want to assess me three and a half weeks into the job, there’s nothing I can say or do that will change that.“But what I have seen and felt in this period is that we are heading in the direction I want us to. The results will come. In the meantime it is a struggle and a fight and there is nothing wrong with that. We don’t have things handed to us on a plate in life, we have to fight. I have fought for things all my life. Why does everyone want everything neatly packaged? The attitude today seems to be that as soon as something goes wrong, you change it.”Amid much hilarity, he suggested that one reporter might have been “a lost cause at some point but your parents didn’t give up on you”.Postecoglou then reiterated that he had walked into the City Ground with his eyes wide open and always understood that his attempt to alter Forest’s playing style would not be straightforward. “I knew this was a big challenge,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with that. I don’t know why people think challenges are a burden, I love a challenge. The alternative is sitting at home watching games and I don’t want to do that. If you guys have a lot fun around it I don’t care. I couldn’t care less.”Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouNottingham ForestNewcastle UnitedAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Lando Norris andOscar Piastri, fighting for the drivers’ title, reached an angry flashpoint that might overshadow the moment long after the fizz has gone flat.Beneath the floodlights of the Marina Bay circuit George Russell won the race with a dominant drive from pole to flag for Mercedes, a deserved first win for the British driver in Singapore but one eclipsed by the continuing soap opera atMcLaren. Their efforts to maintain an almost impossible level of equality between their title protagonists took another torturous, and many might consider inevitable, turn, since the team set the precedent of potentially intervening each time one driver believed the other had been given a slightly larger slice of cake.Norris rejects Piastri’s complaints after McLaren duo clash in SingaporeRead morePiastri, the calm, assured Australian who has barely shown even perturbed pique this season, was, as they say in Melbourne, mad as a frog in a sock with his teammate and team after Norris barged past him at the start. The pair finished in the same order, third and fourth behind the Red Bull ofMax Verstappen, ensuring Norris took three points off his rival, who leads by 22 with six meetings remaining. There may yet be a reset back at base but at the time Piastri’s feelings were clear.Norris knew beforehand that he must take every chance to put points on his rival and leapt at the first opportunity. He burst out of the blocks from fifth on the grid and made up two places past Kimi Antonelli and, crucially, Piastri to claim third, uncompromising in elbowing past his teammate up the inside through turn three. He had a snap of oversteer mid-corner and just clipped Verstappen in front of him, which banged him into the Australian, edging Piastri toward the wall. All three emerged but Norris had the place.View image in fullscreenLando Norris (foreground right) steals a march on his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockPiastri was aggrieved while McLaren were forced to consider how to manage the situation. “Are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way?” Piastri said. “I mean that wasn’t very team-like, but sure …”It was the opening salvo in what appeared to be a race-long cauldron of discontent in his cockpit. He was furious with the team’s response that they would review it afterwards because the contact had occurred as Norris tried to avoid Verstappen. “That is not fair, I am sorry, that’s not fair,” Piastri said. “If he has to avoid another car by crashing into his teammate then that is a pretty shit job of avoiding it.”Quick GuideF1 Singapore GP resultsShow1George Russell(GB) Mercedes1hr 40mins 22.367sec2Max Verstappen(Neth) Red Bull+5.430s3Lando Norris(GB) McLaren+6.066,4Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren+8.146,5Andrea Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes+33.681,6Charles Leclerc(Mnc) Ferrari+45.996,7Lewis Hamilton(GB) Ferrari+1m 20.251s8Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin+1:20.6679Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas+1:33.52710Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams+1 lap11Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls+1 lap12Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull +1lap13Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin+1 lap14Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams+1 lap15Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls+1 lap16Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine+1 lap17Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber+1 lap18Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas +1 lap19Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine+1 lap20Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber+1 lapFastest lap:Hamilton1m 33.808s on lap 48Drivers' standings:1Piastri336pts, 2Norris314, 3Verstappen273, 4Russell237, 5Leclerc173, 6Hamilton127, 7Antonelli88, 8Albon70, 9Hadjar39, 10Hulkenberg37, 11Alonso34, 12Sainz Jr32, 13Stroll32, 14Lawson30, 15Ocon28, 16Gasly20, 17Tsunoda20, 18Bortoleto18, 19Bearman18, 20Colapinto0, 21Doohan0Constructors' standings:1McLaren650pts, 2Mercedes325, 3Ferrari300, 4Red Bull290, 5Williams102, 6Racing Bulls72, 7Aston Martin66, 8Sauber55, 9Haas46, 10Alpine20Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Afterwards the team, still in the throes of celebrating the title, felt it had been a racing incident. “We’re letting them race, as you can see,” said the McLaren CEO, Zak Brown. “Tough racing, but when you’ve got three or four cars all stacked up, that’s going to happen every once in a while. We’ll look at it in more depth on Monday but clearly just hard racing.”Norris concurred it had been just a spot of cut and thrust with no ill intent, and that his nudge on ­Piastri had been caused by his light biff with Verstappen. It would likely be viewed as nothing more were it not for McLaren’s previous intercessions creating such a grey area. It is a problem of their own making, so scrupulously have they attempted to manage their drivers with a commitment to giving both an equal shot. They are free to race one another but the team have intervened for the purpose of “fairness” over the last two seasons.F1 driver standingsMost notably at Monza this year, they had Piastri give Norris a place back after he had lost it to his teammate through a slow pit stop. Both drivers have appealed to the team at various points expecting them to intercede as part and parcel of the racing process, rather than as is more usually the case just letting them have at it and sorting out the ­argy-bargy afterwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a decidedly disenchanted response from a driver usually so calm and engaging and evidence this is a rankle that may last.What followed on track in comparison was somewhat prosaic as Russell sprinted to the flag, the order unchanged as it had been at turn three behind him, and took the win by five seconds. It was redemption at last after he crashed out with a shot at victory in 2023.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri’s slow pit stop will not have improved his mood.Photograph: Fazry Ismail/ReutersAfterwards Piastri maintained he had full confidence in McLaren and how they were handling this two-horse title run-in and that he did not expect their approach to change; the stance was confirmed by the team principal, Andrea Stella. However, if nothing else Norris gave him notice he would be bold and unyielding in this title fight and that Piastri must match that on track, rather than with in-race horse-trading. There is likely, then, some steel on steel to come in this contest.Antonelli was fifth for Mercedes, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finished in sixth and seventh for Ferrari, Fernando Alonso eighth for Aston Martin, Oliver Bearman ninth for Haas and Carlos Sainz 10th for Williams. But Hamilton was investigated after the race for repeatedly exceeding track limits when he was struggling with his brakes in the latter stages and received a five-second penalty, dropping him to eighth behind Alonso.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMcLarenLando NorrisOscar PiastriRed BullMax VerstappenAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The Broncos batted down Jalen Hurts’ last-gasp pass on the final play of the game to send the Super Bowl champions to just their second loss in their last 22 games. The Broncos (3-2) caught a huge break in their rally when the Eagles had a late fourth-down conversion called back on an illegal shift penalty whistled against running back Saquon Barkley.Houston Texans 44–10 Baltimore RavensCJ Stroud threw for 244 yards and four touchdowns, and Houston (2-3) strolled to a 44-10 win over a depleted Baltimore team, matching both the most lopsided road win in Texans’ history and the most lopsided home loss in Ravens’ history. Baltimore (1-4) were without two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, and that was far from their only problem. Defensive standouts Kyle Hamilton, Roquan Smith and Marlon Humphrey all missed the game, and the Ravens already were weakened on that side of the ball because of a neck problem that ended Nnamdi Madubuike’s season. Baltimore were also without All-Pro fullback Patrick Ricard and tackle Ronnie Stanley.Washington Commanders 27–10 Los Angeles ChargersJacory Croskey-Merritt scored two touchdowns, and the Washington Commanders (3-2) rallied from a 10-point deficit after forcing a big fumble in the second quarter to score 27 straight points and beat the Los Angeles Chargers (3-2). Washington’s Jayden Daniels was 15 of 26 for 231 yards and a touchdown after missing two games with an injured left knee. The Chargers were one of the least penalized teams in the first three weeks of the season, when they were 3-0. But they were done in by sloppy play last week, with 15 penalties for 107 yards in a 21-18 loss at the New York Giants. Back home at SoFi Stadium, it happened again. They had 10 penalties for 85 yards and three turnovers in Washington territory.Las Vegas Raiders 6–40 Indianapolis ColtsJonathan Taylor ran for three touchdowns and a two-point conversion, and Daniel Jones threw two touchdown passes as the Indianapolis Colts routed the Las Vegas Raiders. The 34-point margin was Indy’s largest since 2013. Jones finished 20 of 29 for 212 yards and moved to 4-1 as a starter this year, surpassing his combined victory total over the past two seasons with the New York Giants. Taylor rushed 17 times for 66 yards and caught three passes for 20 yards. The Colts converted a blocked punt, two interceptions and a turnover on downs into TDs. Las Vegas fell to 4-1.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 38–35 Seattle SeahawksLavonte David intercepted Sam Darnold with 58 seconds left and Chase McLaughlin kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4-1) a thrilling win over the Seattle Seahawks (3-2). Baker Mayfield tied it for the Bucs with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard with 1:08 left, and the Seahawks took over with the chance to drive for the winning score. But David’s pick on a deflected ball negated the need for any further heroics by Mayfield. He threw for 379 yards and two touchdowns, and Darnold threw for 341 yards and four TDs.Detroit Lions 37–24 Cincinnati BengalsDavid Montgomery ran for a touchdown and threw for one on a trick play in his hometown and the Detroit Lions (4-1) rolled to their fourth straight win, this time over the reeling Cincinnati Bengals (2-3). Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes for the Lions. Montgomery, a seven-year veteran, had passing and rushing scores in a game for the second time. He played quarterback at Cincinnati Mt Healthy High School and had more than 20 friends and relatives at the game. The Bengals have dropped three straight by a combined total of 113-37 since star quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a toe injury during a win over Jacksonville.Dallas Cowboys 37-22 New York JetsDak Prescott threw four touchdown passes, leading the Dallas Cowboys to an easy victory over the New York Jets. Dallas scored on two 90-yard drives in the second quarter, despite missing four starters on the offensive line. Javonte Williams ran for 135 yards and a touchdown and also caught a TD pass. The Cowboys, now 2-2-1, bounced back from a 40-40 tie against Green Bay last week. The Jets remain winless at 0-5 in Aaron Glenn’s first season as head coach.Tennessee Titans 22–21 Arizona CardinalsCam Ward throws for a career-high 265 yards, leading the Tennessee Titans to an improbable victory over the Arizona Cardinals. The Titans snap a 10-game losing streak with a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback. The Cardinals led 21-6 in the fourth quarter but made crucial mistakes. Emari Demercado dropped the ball before crossing the goalline, resulting in a fumble. The Titans capitalized, scoring a touchdown. Later, Dadrion Taylor-Demerson intercepted a pass but fumbled, allowing the Titans to score again. Joey Slye’s 29-yard field goal sealed the win. Calvin Ridley had five catches for 131 yards.Minnesota Vikings 21–17 Cleveland BrownsVikings receiver Jordan Addison caught a 12-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz with 25 seconds left to give Minnesota victory over the Cleveland Browns at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 10-play, 80-yard drive gave the Vikings (3-2) a much-needed win on their historic international road trip, which started with a 24-21 loss to the Steelers in Dublin last week. It also spoiled Dillon Gabriel’s firstNFLstart, as the Browns rookie put his team (1-4) in position to win by throwing two touchdown passes. Fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins rushed for 110 yards on 23 carries. Wentz shook off a shoulder injury that briefly sent him to the locker room and led two scoring drives in the second half.Miami Dolphins 24-27 Carolina PanthersBryce Young threw for two touchdowns and Rico Dowdle ran for 206 yards and a touchdown as the Carolina Panthers rallied past the Miami Dolphins in Charlotte. Young’s short pass to rookie tight end Mitchell Evans with 1:59 to play gave the Panthers (2-3) the lead for good as they matched the largest comeback to win a game in franchise history by overcoming a 17-point hole. Young had a horrific first quarter, but he ended up 19-for-30 passing for 198 yards with an interception. Dowdle, filling in for injured Chuba Hubbard, did his work on the ground on 23 carries, coming up four yards shy of matching the single-game franchise rushing record. Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa completed 27 of 36 throws for 256 yards with three touchdowns and Jaylen Waddle gained 110 receiving yards on six catches and scored a touchdown, but the Dolphins (1-4) dropped to 0-3 in road games.New York Giants 14–26 New Orleans SaintsSpencer Rattler passed for an 87-yard touchdown to Rashid Shaheed, safety Jordan Howden returned a fumble 86 yards for a score, and New Orleans defeated the turnover-prone New York Giants for the Saints’ first victory under rookie coach Kellen Moore. Rattler earned his first victory in 11 career starts, passing for 225 yards without a turnover. Giants rookie QB Jaxson Dart, who won his first career start last week, passed for 202 yards and two touchdowns, but also turned the ball over three times. New York turned the ball over five times in all, none more costly than when Bryan Bresee stripped running back Cam Skattebo, leading to Howden’s TD. Both teams are 1-4.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week they blew a 33-7 lead to draw with Exeter. This time they responded, claiming a nervy 37-35 win over a resurgent Gloucester, narrowly denying them what would have been the largest ever comeback win in English domestic rugby.“It was a carbon copy, almost,” Phil Dowson, Northampton’s director of rugby, said with a mix of relief and frustration. “We lost momentum and discipline. We were poor for large periods of time. The same thing is happening.”The idea of a contest was a fantasy midway through a game that would have required binoculars to be viewed from the southern end of the ground, where only 13 of the 72 points were scored. IfGloucesterwere poor in the opening exchanges, conceding four tries in 35 minutes, they were magnificent thereafter, dotting down five times.The home side had the lead with only eight minutes to go when the prop Afolabi Fasogbon scored with a splash that would have made Chris Ashton proud. But the home fans’ joy was ripped away from them when the fly-half Ross Byrne was harshly penalised and sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on. “Rough,” is how Gloucester’s director of rugby, George Skivington, termed the decisive decision. Anthony Belleau’s penalty under pressure from the left tram proved the difference.Everyone in attendance got their money’s worth, though those with trypophobia might have benefited from a trigger warning at the start. Gloucester’s defence was filled with holes; through midfield, around the fringe and out in the wide channels. All Northampton had to do was run straight off first-phase play.Quick GuideGloucester 35-37 Northampton teams and scorersShowGloucesterC Atkinson; Loader (Edwards-Giraud 70), Joseph, S Atkinson, Thorley; Byrne, Williams; Knight (McArthur 63), Blake (Innard 49), Fasogbon, Thomas, Jordan (Alemanno 51, Jordan 59), Basham (Taylor 56), Venter, Mann (Bokenham 54).TriesJordan 2, Joseph, Venter, Fasogbon.ConsByrne 5.Sin-binByrne 72NorthamptonHendy; Todaro, Litchfield, Hutchinson, Martin; Belleau, McParland (Weimann 67; Iyogun (Fischetti 49), Walker (Smith 55), Millar Mills (Kundiona 16), Coles, Van der Mescht (Lockett 47), Scott-Young, Pearson (Iyogun 60), Chick.TriesPearson, Litchfield, McParland, Hendy.ConsBelleau 4.PensBelleau 3.RefereeAdam Leal.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That’s exactly what Tom Litchfield did on five minutes to get his team going. He wouldn’t score but he provided momentum for Tom Pearson to rumble over from close range. Five minutes later Litchfield had a five-pointer of his own when he gathered a short pass off Rory Hutchinson’s shoulder to slide under the poles.“I thought we would be a little more connected,” Skivington said, citing the arrival of 13 new signings as a reason for this disharmony. “We’ve learned things about the new lads. It’s hard not to be disappointed but the second half should give the lads confidence with what we can do.”View image in fullscreenRobbie Smith (centre) shows his relief at the full-time whistle after Northampton secure a narrow win.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockAnother quick double strike from Northampton after the half-hour seemed to put the game to bed. A scrum 45 metres out did not carry any obvious threat but Hutchinson exploded through a gap from first receiver and then fed the supporting Archie McParland on his inside. The bonus point was secured when George Hendy found an edge down the left with a schoolboy show-and-go. He was tackled short of the line but regained his feet to dot down.At 31-0 some supporters were making an early dash for the bar but those who stayed got to see Cam Jordan burrow over from close range. When the try was awarded after a second look, an ironic cheer rippled around the ground.They were roaring just after the break when Will Joseph gathered the ball in the left tram around halfway. He stepped infield off his left leg before sending McParland with a dummy. From there he motored away from the chasing Saints to reanimate a crowd whose belief ramped up when first Hendy and then Pearson were shown a yellow card for straying offside in the red zone. After sustained pressure against 13 men, James Venter scored a converted try that closed the gap to 13.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was round nine before Exeter won a league match last season and Baxter said: \"Eight points from two games and we are in the top four, and in the first block of five games last season we didn't win a game, and we were bubbling away towards the bottom.\"It shows how quickly those extra points can change the feeling of things and we are in a position now where we know we have got something to genuinely fight for over these next three weeks, as we could easily, with some hard work and positive performances, be in and around that top four after the opening block, and that would be a fantastic place for us to be in after five games, when you consider where we were at this stage last year.\"Owen Farrell made a triumphant return to the StoneX Stadium but it was the rampaging Tom Willis who starred inSaracens' 50-17 victory overBristol. Farrell made his first appearance at the north London ground for 504 days having returned from a season-long spell at Racing 92 during the summer and he finished with a 13-point haul. Saracens plundered seven tries with the wing Jack Bracken pouncing twice and on a day when most elements of their game fired beautifully, Willis emerged as the standout performer.In another blow to the Bears, the wing Louis Rees-Zammit had to be helped off in the second half because of injury. The centre Joe Jenkins had already departed with a knock. Pat Lam said later that the Bears are being forced to recruit additional players to deal with the injury crisis. Tom Jordan was also unable to finish the match for Bristol, who on the opening weekend lost  AJ MacGinty, Harry Randall and Gabriel Ibitoye to injuries that have resulted in surgery.\"The recruitment team will be looking around for some extra players,\" Lam said. \"But it's finding the right players, people in contract, so that's always a tricky one at this time of the year. There are players who are dead keen but then getting released is the other side of it.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Now it was one-way traffic. Gloucester’s lineout and scrum gained the ascendancy and the Cherry and Whites were camped in Northampton’s 22. Jordan had a double with another stiff carry on the hour before Gloucester took the lead with a try to make all front-rowers proud. Skivington said he would have a word with Fasogbon about cosplaying as England rugby’s all-time leading try scorer, but even he had a smile on his face as he recounted the prop’s swan dive.Once Gloucester had their noses in front they never looked like losing control as their astonishing Lazarus act was close to completion. But it was not to be. Belleau’s late penalty came like a dagger in the night and Northampton kept possession until the final whistle. “We wrestled momentum back,” Dowson added, though he admitted that it felt as if it had permanently slipped away. A remarkable slugfest ended with both teams providing the other an appropriate guard of honour.Geoff Parling finds home comforts at Leicester despite lack of furnitureRead moreExplore more on these topicsPrem RugbyGloucesterNorthamptonRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He is the seventh Arc winner for the racing and breeding operation founded by the third Aga Khan in 1921, a sequence that stretches back to Migoli’s ­success in 1948, and also the first winner in the green and red silks since the unbeaten Zarkava’s success, with Christophe Soumillon in the saddle, in 2008.Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe 2025: Daryz catches hot favourite Minnie Hauk to win thriller – as it happenedRead moreSoumillon, who also rode Dalakhani to victory in the same colours in 2003, was a major player in the latest running too, and briefly seemed to have made a winning move on Minnie Hauk heading into the final furlong. Ultimately, though, it was in a supporting role, as ­Mickaël ­Barzalona and Daryz emerged from the pack to chase down Aidan O’Brien’s filly by a head, with Sosie, fourth last year, going one place better this time around but nearly six lengths behind the runner-up.This was a first Arc success for ­Barzalona and for Francis-Henri ­Graffard, Daryz’s trainer, and set the seal on an outstanding season for Graffard, who also took the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July with the gelding ­Calandagan, who was barred from lining up for this race.One of very few setbacks for the stable this season, in fact, was Daryz’s disappointing run behind ­Ombudsman in the International Stakes at York in August, but Graffard feels the experience contributed to his colt’s success here.“When I was planning to run at York, I said to Princess Zahra: ‘We are not going to win, but we need to toughen him up for the autumn.’” Graffard said. “I think the defeat at York helped us to win today because my horse was, for the first time, very professional and mature.View image in fullscreenDaryz and Mickaël Barzalona return in triumph after the Prix de l’Arc Triomphe.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock“It’s a great experience and today was exactly what we planned to do. My horse was very tough to catch up with the filly. To win the Arc today in these colours is just crazy. In the past, it was just a dream, but now it’s happening to me.”Barzalona famously won the Derbyat Epsom as a 19-year-old in 2011 aboard André Fabre’s Pour Moi, when he stood up in the saddle before the line to celebrate what was a very narrow victory. There was no chance for a similar flourish on Sunday but immense satisfaction all the same that his extended wait for an Arc winner is at an end.“We’ve always rated him,” ­Barzalona said. “When we went to York it was a messy race, but he came back a lot stronger. Mentally and physically, he has improved a lot and today he was very relaxed. He travelled very well, he picked up very well. Everything combined today to win the race.”Minnie Hauk, unbeaten in her four previous starts this season, ran up to her best form and was a long way clear of the third horse home. There is every chance that she will stay in training at four, with a return trip to Longchamp at the top of her to-do list.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday tipsShowPontefract1.58 Dacres Cross 2.33 Brazen Rascal 3.08 Hell Yeah He Did 3.43 Trilby (nap) 4.15 Tele Red 4.50 Action Pact 5.25 Emperor CaradocStratford-On-Avon2.05 Serious Chat 2.40 Just Chasing May 3.15 Stardrop 3.50 Not So Sobers 4.25 Fourtowns 5.00 Trapista 5.35 Hay MaxYarmouth2.20 Mcmurray 2.55 Lexington Express 3.30 Lyrics Of Life 4.05 Bella’s Path 4.38 Pergola 5.13 Distinct Spirit 5.45 Due Date (nb)Wolverhampton4.20 Zambezi Magic 4.55 Mc Moan 5.30 Guernsey Angel 6.00 Miss Lady Grace 6.30 Lion Ring 7.00 My Clementine 7.30 Venezuelan 8.00 Bright Start 8.30 Rising SkyWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“No excuses,” Soumillon said. “When I felt Mickaël coming in the last 200, I kept a little back for the end and we went together, but his horse has a strong dash and he loves the ground. If you take him out, she would have been one of the most impressive Arc-winning fillies, but that’s racing.”There are no plans as yet for the winner, but the final word on the 2025 Arc undoubtedly belongs to Daryz’s owner, the third generation of her family to welcome back an Arc winner. “This is the pinnacle for a breeder,” Princess Zahra said. “My dad was always so over the moon to win an Arc, and now I know what it felt like.”Explore more on these topicsPrix de l'Arc de TriompheMickaël BarzalonaHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is talent in their squad, and desire. You can see it in every tackle, every gut-busting run and in the frustrated body language when a pass doesn’t quite come off. That energy is matched on the sideline. Rehanne Skinner was animated throughout her side’s 2-0 defeat – “hold the line”, “come closer”, “talk to her” and “Fion can’t get out” were among the many commands from the technical area, with those behind the dugout treated to the thoughts of the manager while the action was under way. Skinner is in it, she is engaged, the players are engaged, so what is not working?Five games in and they have no points, have conceded 16 goals and scored twice. They can score though, five different goal scorers in a 5-1 defeat of Charlton in the League Cup on 24 September a brief respite from defeat before Chelsea scored three in 15 minutes last weekend to put them firmly back in their place. Against the Blues the Hammers weren’t bad throughout though – that 15-minute calamitous spell was an outlier and, while many feared a complete second-half collapse, they regrouped, thrived with their backs against the wall, and only conceded one more to the champions.WSL clockwatch: Spurs edge Brighton, London City Lionesses beat Liverpool and more – as it happenedRead moreConsistency across a whole game has been a regular problem. The first five minutes and second half against Chelsea were periods to be proud of, as was the opening 45 against Arsenal and closing 45 against Brighton.Against Villathe story was familiar, the visiting team dominating possession in Dagenham but the Hammers having chances too, nine shots to Villa’s 11. They were in it in the first half, challenging, playing well enough to be able to take something from the game, the difference though was that West Ham had only a single shot on target, as opposed to Villa’s four.West Ham are not being let down by their style, grit or managerial decisions, they are being let down by players not being clinical when they get in good positions. It is that decision-making in the final third that needs work, the five goals scored against Women’s Super League 2 side Charlton perhaps points to the issue: when they have time on the ball they make the right moves, when they are being pressed and harried by top-flight opposition it’s almost like they struggle to think quickly enough.View image in fullscreenKirsty Hanson (right) celebrates after scoring Villa’s first against West Ham.Photograph: Alexander Canillas/SPP/Shutterstock“I don’t think we were clinical enough in the final third and we just lacked that cutting edge where the final ball was sometimes a bit over hit, not quite with the right quality and then just being prepared to take on shots a little bit earlier,” said Skinner. “Based on the players, when I’m watching them individually, I just feel like they’re all a little bit hesitant compared to where we were previously. The desire to run at people and be quite assertive was really, really strong and we just need to get that fight back where we’re a little bit more ruthless in and around the box, where we are a bit braver to go 1v1 and where what will be will be but we’re committing players and we’re trying to create opportunities. That’s something that we’ve just sort of taken our foot off the gas a little bit on and we’re looking for passes as opposed to being a little bit more direct and being a bit more confident in our own ability.”On Sunday afternoon that was costly again. Moments after Viviane Asseyi glanced a header wide, they were punished at the other end, Kirsty Hanson collecting her short corner back from Lynn Wilms before lashing the ball into the far corner. Seven minutes later and Natalia Arroyo’s side had a bigger cushion, Wilms’s free-kick lifted over the wall and in.The Hammers’ lack of points on the board will inevitably lead to questions being asked about Skinner’s future. That would be wholly unfair though.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The summer recruit Tandberg had already scored in wins over Everton and Leicester this season and grabbed another decisive goal for Spurs when she finished off a smart cross by Jessica Naz after 26 minutes. It proved enough to ensure Tottenham continued their fine start under Martin Ho, with the north London club now on 12 points and up to four wins – only one short of their overall tally in the 2024-25 campaign.Noémie Mouchon's 81st-minute strike rescued a late point forLeicesterat home toEverton. Ornella Vignola finished off a quick counter-attack for the Toffees after 51 minutes at the King Power Stadium to open the scoring. The visitors pushed for a second but were hit late on when Mouchon scored to ensure the spoils were shared.PA MediaPhotograph: Liam Asman/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is work to be done for sure, confidence must improve, and the players must bear some responsibility for that, but this is a team that is struggling from a lack of love and care from the club as a whole and Skinner is a victim of that rather than the architect of the team’s struggles.This summer, nine players departed and only four came in. The quality of those coming in this time round was arguably higher overall, but a tight budget has meant that, season on season, West Ham have lost their best players to better teams. Before questions are asked about Skinner’s tenure, she deserves a chance to show what she can do unhindered and that means the club upping its game – and the same could be said for several WSL sides.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWest Ham United WomenAston Villa WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The remaining two-thirds of the seats will be selected through province-based electoral colleges, with seats distributed by population.There has been no direct popular vote as the interim authorities said the displacement of citizens and the loss of documents during the war years would make such a step impossible at this stage.During a speech at the National Library in Damascus, Sharaa said: “There are many pending laws that need to be voted on so that we move forward with the process of building and prosperity. BuildingSyriais a collective mission, and all Syrians must contribute to it.”The interim authorities dissolved Syria’s rubber-stamp legislature after taking power.The new 210-member body, the People’s Assembly, will be tasked with passing a new elections law and constitution. According to the organising committee, more than 1,500 candidates – just 14% of them women – are running for the assembly, which will have a renewable 30-month mandate while preparing for future polls.Under the rules, candidates must not be “supporters of the former regime” and must not promote secession or partition.Those standing include Syrian-American Henry Hamra, the first Jewish candidate since the 1940s.Elections were postponed indefinitely in Druze-majority Sweida province and in areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces due to tensions between the local authorities and Damascus.Critics argue the electoral college system could favour well-connected candidates, giving the interim government an unfair advantage while excluding some ethnic and religious minorities. But for others, the election was a sign of progress.When approached by election officials to join the electoral college, Lina Daaboul, a doctor in Damascus, said she initially refused, fearing the responsibility and the “ugly image” of past assemblies. But after learning she would only be part of the voting body, she agreed, calling it “a national duty”.On election day, Daaboul said: “This is the first time I’ve ever voted in my life. I’m happy, and I don’t mind standing in line for a long time.”Lara Eezouki, a member of the national elections committee in Damascus, noted that the new assembly includes all sects and groups and said it was “the first time in Syria’s history that the ballot box truly rules – when the results are not prearranged”.Ibrahim Halabi, a former soldier under Assad’s rule who defected after mass anti-government protests were met by a brutal crackdown and ensuing civil war in 2011, said: “This is the first time in our lives we’ve participated in a democratic electoral process without outside pressure.”Sharaa’s Islamist forces leda coalition that ousted Assad in December.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of people attended the vigil in central London, the same location where almost500 people were arrestedat a demonstration against a ban on the proscribed organisation Palestine Action the previous day.“I still feel very, very safe and I think England’s a very tolerant country,” said Fitter, who lives in London and said he had not personally faced antisemitism. With a step ladder in hand, he made his way tothe Speakers’ Corner in Hyde Parkwhere he said he speaks most Sundays for Israel’s right to exist and defend itself.“Most people there, they’re not antisemitic, they’re anti-Zionist,” he added. “I conduct myself correctly. If I meet someone with a bad attitude I try to find out why and explain the other side of the story, ask them to reflect on it and I generally find that works well.”To a largely silent audience, hemmed by large screens displaying images of some of the 1,200 killed on 7 October, Keith Black, the Jewish Leadership Council chair, said the Manchester attacks showed just “how deadly this virulent antisemitism has become”. “Our streets have been filled with protesters screaming Jew hatred, our students had faced relentless waves of abuse on campus.”Chief rabbi urges ‘national soul-searching’ after Manchester synagogue attackRead moreKeir Starmer called on Saturday’s protests not to go ahead after the synagogue attack, but organisers argued that to cancel would be to conflate the actions ofIsraelwith Jewish people around the world.During the event, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, 23 candles were lit on stage for those affected by the 7 October attack, and chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis recited the Kaddish, a traditional Jewish memorial prayer as the crowd joined, followed by chants of “bring them home” for the remaining hostages in Gaza.“Today, we recall the precious lives who were mercilessly taken from our midst on 7 October,” Mirvis told the crowd. “Today, we remember all subsequent atrocities since that original day.”Other speakers included Shaun Lemel, a survivor of the attack on the Nova music festival and Sharone Lifschitz, whose parents were taken hostage in the 7 October terror attacks. Speakers called for an end to the war and for the release the remaining 48 hostages in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.Some expressed concerns over a rise in antisemitism in the UK, withrecent researchshowing a sharp decrease in feelings of safety in the community. People said they attended Sunday’s event not only to show solidarity, but because they felt alone or that they had no other space to express their grief over 7 October.Louise and Daniel Coleman attended on Sunday to show their support for the wider Jewish community. They said they felt angry, anxious and in a “state of disbelief” after the Manchester attack for which they blamed the government.“There’s a lot of talk but very little action at the moment from all the senior people in the UK and this is a real indication that the Jews are pulling together. They are very committed to the UK and we are just left to the atrocities that we are seeing,” said Coleman on the Trafalgar square steps.“We haven’t personally experienced [antisemitism] but it is happening and people are being abused in the street,” said Louise.Her husband, Daniel added: “Antisemitism has been here for a long period of time. It’s been bubbling under the surface, now it’s openly acceptable to be antisemitic, and that can’t be tolerated.”Explore more on these topicsJudaismAntisemitismIsraelReligionLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The move came just weeks after national guard troops were sent toWashington, where the president federalized the city’s police force in what he described as a “crackdown” on crime, a pattern now extending to a string of other US cities. “We’re going to be doing Chicago probably next,” Trump had said at the time.Noem defended the administration’s course of action, insisting on Fox that residents supported the government intervention. “They understand that where we have gone we have made it much more free,” she said. “People are much safer, we have got a thousand criminals that are off the streets ofChicago, just because we’ve been there.”Appearing on CNN’sState of the Union with Jake Tapper on Sunday, the DemocraticIllinoisgovernor, JB Pritzker, accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. “They are the ones who are making it a war zone,” he said.“They need to get out of Chicago. If they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they are going to do, they need to get the heck out.”Border patrol agents on Saturday shot and injured a woman while firing at someone who tried to run them over. The woman who was shot was a US citizen and was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, noting that the woman was accused in a US Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin last week of doxing agents.Pritzker also condemned the deployment in a post onXon Saturday, writing: “The Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.” Pritzker called the decision “absolutely outrageous and un-American,” and added that it had been made “against our will”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationKristi NoemUS politicsChicagoIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

Peacehaven has always been a place of kindness, respect and mutual support, and we will continue to embody those values. We ask everyone to reject division and respond to hate with unity and compassion.”Sussex police said on Sunday evening: “This is not being treated as a terror-related incident at this time.”They have released images of two people they wish to identify in relation to the investigation. The photos show two masked individuals, with one wearing a distinctive black jacket with a Pre London logo in white on the chest, and the other wearing bright red gloves.View image in fullscreenCCTV footage issued by Sussex police of two people they wish to identify in connection with a suspected arson attack at a mosque in Peacehaven.Photograph: Sussex police/PAAppeals have been made by the police for anyone with information or footage captured on CCTV, dashcam, doorbell or mobile phone to contact the police.Det Supt Karrie Bohanna said: “We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result.”The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said the attack had followed what it described as “a disturbing pattern of violence and intimidation”, adding that an imam was stabbed last week in Hounslow, west London, and mosques had faced bomb threats and coordinated hate campaigns.Wajid Akhter, the MCB secretary-general, said: “These incidents do not occur in a vacuum. This comes as media and political figures escalate collective blame and deliberate misrepresentation of Muslim communities, their causes and their faith.”The incident was condemned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which said: “Every faith community has the right to worship free from fear.

The centre-right Spolu coalition of the outgoing prime minister, Petr Fiala, came second on 23.4%.“I have promised to … show the president a solution that will be in line with Czech and European laws,” Babiš, a polarising figure whose previous premiership from 2017 to 2021 drew mass protests, said as the talks got under way on Sunday.Pavel said afterwards that he would not attempt to appoint a new government until November at the earliest, adding that he would insist on “a pro-western direction” for the country and “the preservation of all the institutions of a democratic state”.While he hailed the “historic result” as “the absolute peak” of his political career, Babiš has significant hurdles to clear to become prime minister, and to win and maintain support for the single-party minority government he has said he wants.Analysts have also said that even if he succeeds, Babiš is unlikely to join the populist, authoritarian prime ministers of Hungary and Slovakia, Viktor Orbán and Robert Fico respectively, as a fully fledged member of the EU’s awkward squad.Mainstream parties have ruled out entering any coalition with ANO, forcing Babiš to seek backing from two fringe – and potentially fractious – rightwing groups, Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) and Motorists, to win a parliamentary confidence vote.“We will lead talks with the SPD and the Motorists, and seek a single-party government led by ANO,” Babiš, the country’s seventh-richest man with a net worth estimated at $3.9bn (£2.9bn), said on Sunday.ANO campaigned on pledges of faster growth, higher wages and pensions, and lower taxes. It also promised to fight the EU’s migration pact and green deal, and to end the shells-for-Ukraine“Czech initiative”, instead backing Kyiv solely through the EU.The party shares some common ground with the far-right SPD, which is also opposed to EU climate and immigration policies, as is the smaller rightwing Motorists party.But the Moscow-friendly, anti-Nato SPD also campaigned on a “Czexit” promise to pull the Czech Republicout of the 27-member bloc, which Babiš has rejected out of hand. He has insisted repeatedly his party is “pro-European, and pro-Nato”.Both the Motorists and the SPD have said they are open to talks with ANO, but it is unclear how far either party is willing to support a minority ANO government rather than seek a binding coalition accord – or how long their support could last.Analysts noted that the SPD’s 7.8% vote share was significantly lower than the 13% it was forecast to win before the election, meaning its negotiating position in talks on any confidence-and-supply deal may not be as strong as previously imagined.Even assuming Babiš is able to present Pavel – who defeated the billionaire to become president in elections held in 2023 – with a multiparty agreement representing a 101-seat majority in parliament, his problems may not be over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also said he was taking legal advice on a possible conflict of interest concerning Babiš’s sprawling business interests.Babiš has promised to resolve the problem, but Pavel has the constitutional right to reject him as prime minister if he considers the solution inadequate. That is unlikely to happen, but may give the billionaire pause for thought about his proposed cabinet.European far-right leaders including Orbàn, who posted on social media that “truth has prevailed”, and France’s Marine Le Pen, who said “patriotic parties” were being “called to power … all over Europe”, rushed to congratulate Babiš.However, although ANO sits in the far-right Patriots for Europe group in the European parliament and Babiš has called himself an admirer of Orbàn, the bloc’s disruptor-in-chief, it is unclear how far he will align himself with the anti-EU camp.Analysts say Babiš’s politics are more pragmatic than ideological and that he is unlikely to pick a serious fight with Brussels as long as the Czech Republic needs EU funds and the billionaire’s businesses continue to benefit from being in the bloc.Czech institutions are also likely to constrain the billionaire at home, with radical shifts likely to be hindered by the senate, which can veto any proposed electoral law or constitutional change and must approve judges appointed to the constitutional court.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But Stevie O’Hanlon, a co-founder and spokesperson for Sunrise, said the projects will aim to build a world where climate action is possible.“In order to win the bold action that we’ll need to prevent climate catastrophe, we’re going to need a country where we have the right to dissent and protest,” she said. “How are we going to win on climate under authoritarianism?”One key focus will be campus organizing to urge schools toresist Trump’s attemptsto control theircurricula and rules around political dissent, the letter from Shiney-Ajay says. Another will be garnering rapid responses to the administration’s deployment of troops and immigration policies to cities, and attempts to “infringe on our first amendment rights”. And a third expansion area will be training young activists to “recognize authoritarianism” and resist it using non-violent tactics.Climate activists gather in New York for ‘Sun Day’ solar energy and anti-billionaire ralliesRead moreThe missive formalizes work already underway at Sunrise. Last month, the group helped organize student walkouts at four Washington DC universities to protest Trump’sdeploymentof the national guard and their intimidation ofactivistsandimmigrants. Two weeks later, the organization staged a comedy show-cum-demonstration outside ABC’s New York headquarters in response to the network’s temporarysuspensionof Jimmy Kimmel Live!.Chapters have been taking on localized fights for free speech and immigrant rights, as well. At Duke University’s Sunrise chapter, activists have focused on protecting a belovedcampus bus driverwhose temporary protected status was revoked by the Trump administration last month – and who subsequently lost his job of 20 years. They are also urging school officials to overturn anti-protest policies and developing pro-worker campaigns alongside labor justice groups.“In order to win a Green New Deal, climate justice, labor justice, racial justice, etc … we’re gonna need to defeat authoritarianism,” said Artivista Karlin, a junior at Duke University who organizes with the campus Sunrise chapter, who said that under Trump, the US has seen an “unprecedented manifestation of fascism”.Future Sunrise Movement efforts could include nationwide efforts to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids, campaigns to back city officials standing up to Trump, and actions to resist Republicans’cuts to healthcare programs. The organization will also build toward a mass student mobilization on 1 May 2028, when United Auto Workers president Shawn Fainhas calledfor a general strike.The refocus comesseven years afterSunrise captured national headlines when its members stormed the office of then incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Joined by then freshman New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the group demanded the rapid phase-out offossil fuels, the creation of good jobs, and the strengthening of social programs across the US. The policy platform, which they called theGreen New Deal, helped inspire some of Joe Biden’s green policies, most notably theInflation Reduction Act.O’Hanlon sees the new tactics as an outgrowth of the fight for a Green New Deal, which highlighted how climate is intertwined with all other major social issues.How are we going to win on climate under authoritarianism?Stevie O’Hanlon, Sunrise co-founder and spokesperson“The Green New Deal is critical for laying out an alternative world from the one thatDonald Trumpis portraying,” she said. “We’re going to keep talking about that, keep fighting for that vision, but in the short term, we need to also be confronting, their assault on our communities and on our rights.”The shift also comes as climate concernsslip slightly down the listof electoral concerns in favor of economic issues, thoughevidence showsmost people still want to draw down emissions.“My guess is you’re not going to see a lot of politicians using the word ‘climate,’ because people see that as a nice-to-have [concern], not a must-have, and right now they’re in the must-have mode,” Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, told reporters in New York last month.Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris last year came under fire for messaging around thethreat Trump poses to democracy, rather than economic concerns, with some blaming the shift for her loss of the 2024 election. But O’Hanlon says concerns about authoritarianism feel more potent to Americans amid current attacks from the administration, and that Sunrise’s new campaigns will be far more concrete than Harris’s.“A lot of the messaging on the Harris campaign was focused on this abstract idea of democracy, of saving democracy, but I think most people in this country feel like democracy is pretty broken,” she said. “When you’re talking about saving democracy, then people understand that as saving a broken political system that very, very few people think is working, and Donald Trump was able to position himself as the person who is going to disrupt and change the broken system.”Global academic freedom group warns Trump is dismantling US higher educationRead moreSunrise, by contrast, will focus on the need for major changes, including theremoval of corporate interestssuch as the fossil fuel industry from politics.“We’re being very clear that yes, we need to defend rights to free speech, [but] we also need to be serious about overhauling our democracy so that we are not in a situation where someone like Donald Trump can consolidate power in this kind of way ever again,” O’Hanlon said.The expansion comes amid an all-out assault from the White House on both green protections and progressive organizing. Since January, the president hasrolled backhundreds of environmental rules demolished Biden-era incentives for carbon-free technologies. In recent weeks he also designated the decentralized antifascist movement, antifa, a “terrorist organization”, and issued a memorandum aimed at reining in what he calls the radical leftwing domestic “terror network”.Last week, Trump said George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who funds the Open Society Foundations (OSF), is “a likely candidate” forprosecutionfor unspecified charges. Sunrise obtained $2.1m from the foundations between 2019 and 2023,OSF’s website shows.“We will raise our voices against this authoritarian abuse of power,” Shiney-Ajay said.Trump this week also postedTrump 2028hats on social media, indicating interest in a potential,unconstitutionalthird term.“We are just seeing outright disrespect for our constitutional rights, and we can’t accept that,” said O’Hanlon.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmental activismDemocracy and justiceClimate crisisUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The US must lead on clean energy, Trump and the others wrote, to avoid “catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet”.Today, the letter is jarring. The world continues to dawdle politically in its response to the climate crisis but clean energy is booming,responsible for almost all new energy capacityand drawingdouble the investmentof fossil fuels globally. The market, as those business leaders from 2009 would now note, has shifted.Most starkly, though, Trump has become the planet’s foremost advocate of fossil fuels, throwing the might of the US presidency into a rearguard battle to keep the world mired in the era of combusted carbon. There is now no fiercer single opponent to the collective effort to stave off climate breakdown than Trump.When world leaders gather for UN climate talks in Brazil next month, the escalation of Trump’s hostility towards climate action will be apparent. The US state department’s office that deals with climate negotiations has beenabolishedas “unnecessary”, making it unclear who, if anyone, will represent the world’s leading economic and military superpower in Belem.As in his first term, Trump has againwithdrawnthe US from the Paris climate deal,thrown openmore land and waters for oil and gas drilling, and set about dismantling clean air protectionsthat would have prevented thousands of deaths across America. These rollbacks will “drive a stake through the heart of the climate change religion”, as Lee Zeldin, Trump’s head of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, gleefully put it.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaking in the White House this week during the announcement of a drug-pricing deal with Pfizer.Photograph: Francis Chung/EPABut Trump’s latest spell in the White House has gone even further, to extremes that have surprised many onlookers.Rather than simply boost a fossil fuel industry thatdonated handsomelyto his election campaign, Trump has set about obliterating clean energy projects:halting offshore windfarmsthat had already been approved, banning wind and solar from federal land, and eliminating subsidies for renewables and electric cars (whilehanding fresh taxpayer dollarsto a seemingly futile effort to revive coal).graph“We are certainly in a different environment than we were in the first Trump administration,” saidKim Carnahan, who was the chief climate negotiator for the US during Trump’s first term.“There’s a focus on dismantling rather than building. It’s hard to see. We’re not present for a major global issue and are ceding that ground to our competitors, which is not good for the United States.”Not content with jettisoning Republican free-market orthodoxy in the US energy market, Trump has sought to intervene in other countries’ climate policies, scolding the UK for erecting wind turbines and for not drilling enough oil for his liking. He has also pushed the EU toagreeto buy $750bn (£550bn) in US oil and gas over the next three years, as well as striking fossil fuel deals withJapanandSouth Korea.“Countries are on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda,” Trump told stony-faced leadersduring a UN speech last month. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”The president has tried to rewire language around energy and climate, too. Trump, who was seemingly radicalisedby his disgust at viewing wind turbines from his Scottish golf course in 2011, has called wind energy “ugly”, “disgusting” and “pathetic”. The climate crisis is, in his words, a “hoax”.Graphs showing the falling cost of different types of renewable energyHis administration has cut or hidden inconvenient climate research, deleted mentions of climate change from government websites and createdan error-strewn studyin their stead and even, despite Trump’s supposed support for free speech, drawn upa list of banned terms, such as “decarbonisation”, “sustainable”, “emissions” and “green”. The mere reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is nowverboten,too.Fossil fuels, meanwhile, have been rebranded. “I have a little standing order in the White House,” Trump confided to the UN. “Never use the word ‘coal’, only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”All of this has slowed the adoption of clean energy in the US: in the first half of the year, spooked businessesclosed or downscaledmore than $22bn in clean energy projects, costing more than 16,000 jobs, most of them in Republican-held districts.Energy prices are rising for Americans as a result; and the US’s planet-heating emissions, while still falling, are expected toworsen their already sluggish descentin the years ahead.graphThis agenda is perplexing even on Trump’s own terms, experts have said. The president has spoken of making American energy “dominant” and of the need for jobs and new generation to fuel AI data centres, and yet has undercut this by attempting to stamp out renewables.“I do struggle with this – if you are serious about American energy dominance you need to deploy, deploy, deploy,” said Abraham Silverman, an energy expert at Johns Hopkins University.“It’s puzzling and very strange to say wind and solar has no role in the American system when these are often the quickest and cheapest sources. There’s a real tension in the administration’s main messages.”The US government’s abandonment of climate concerns raises broader questions about America’s place in the world, too. In the geopolitical struggle with China, two very different visions are being touted to the rest of the world: one that remains hooked to the fossil fuels touted by the planet’s largest oil and gas producer, or one that shifts to clean energy components, probably made in China.View image in fullscreenPhotovoltaic panels on a barren hill in Pingjing village in Anqing, China.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/Rex“Trump continues to embarrass the US on the global stage and undermine the interests of Americans at home,” said Gina McCarthy, the former top climate adviser to Joe Biden.McCarthy believes that American cities and states committed to climate actioncan help to fill the voidleft by the federal government. Markets and sub-national governments will continue to shift, even if Trump tries tohalt statesfrom cutting pollution. But from China’s perspective, the race to shape energy, and thereby alter the overall trajectory of this century, may already be over.“The last chance for the US to jump on the green bandwagon has left the station,” said Li Shuo, a China climate policy expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute, of Trump’s dismemberment of the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate bill. “In China, this isn’t even treated like a competition. The US is just not in the game.”At home, Trump may order mentions of the climate crisis and its impact to be scrubbed from the internet, and mock those who worry about such things as “lunatics”, but the effects of an overheated planet will continue to mount, regardless.graphFloods inTexas, fires inCaliforniaand uninsurable homes inFloridacan only be dismissed for so long, as can the lure of cheap, abundant clean energy. Trump’s 2009 call for action on climate may be delayed, but it is unlikely to be denied.“There is a dip now, there is less willingness to talk about decarbonisation,” said Carnahan. “But this is against the tide of what you see happening with renewable energy in our biggest competitors. They are not just all in, but really driving ahead.“All of this won’t go away because the problem hasn’t been solved. There will still be concerns about action on climate change because there is no other choice.“The problem is still there and the realities of its impacts will just become more and more clear over time.”Explore more on these topicsClimate science scepticism and denialThe big emittersRenewable energyFossil fuelsClimate crisisEnergyWind powerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They are at odds over whether to push ahead with an entirely new planning bill, which the prime minister has said is “almost certainly” needed, but which some ministers believe would be an unnecessary distraction.A government source said: “The Treasury is desperate to make announcements on planning, but the truth is we are already doing most of the stuff we wanted to, and trying to reopen all of that is not a good idea.”Alexa Culver, a planning lawyer at RSK Wilding, said the government was presiding over a “chaotic slew of destructive new bills, with no strategy, vision, due process, consultation or democratic mandate”.A government spokesperson said: “The chancellor and the housing secretary are working together to reform the outdated planning system that’s been holding this country back – so we can build the 1.5m homes hardworking people need and have given the green light to projects like the Lower Thames Crossing to drive jobs and growth.”Reeves and Keir Starmer have put planning reform at the heart of their growth plans, launching a bill earlier this year to make it easier to buildwithout paying as much for expensive wildlife protection.However, ministers encountered a backlash from developers when theywatered down the bill earlier this summer. The government then decided to change the bill after pressure from Labour MPs and set stricter rules for companies on how and when they must put in place mitigations to protect nature.As a result, Reeves has been looking for ways to strengthen the bill again in the Lords.Labour using Brexit to weaken nature laws, MPs sayRead moreAlthough she has not taken any final decisions, she is understood to be looking at a proposal by theLabourpeer Philip Hunt to make it easier to build projects that are likely to have a minimal environmental impact. She is also exploring a separate amendment by the Conservative peer Charles Banner to make it easier to adapt project plans once they have already been approved.Other changes could include further restrictions on who can bring a judicial review against an infrastructure project and how many times they could do so, as well as banning judges from quashing a planning approval if legal cases are still being heard.Reeves will announce her support for changes to the bill in the hope that it will pass the Lords and receive royal assent before the budget. If she does so, officials believe the Office for Budget Responsibility could judge it to add about £3bn a year to the economy in the long term.Nick Williams, who advised the prime minister on infrastructure until earlier this year, said: ‘The existing planning and infrastructure bill is already a hugely ambitious reform but there is room to go further, whether through amendments to the current bill or future legislation.”Some in government, however, believe the chancellor risks reopening a bruising political fight over the bill if she pushes for significant changes, and think that some of the problems identified by peers could be solved without legislation.One senior government official said: “The risk is by doing this she makes the bill even harder to pass and that will have the opposite effect to what is intended.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he is encountering resistance from other parts of the government, including officials at the housing ministry, who say such a bill would be unnecessary.One senior government source said: “What would a new bill even say? There would be about two clauses and that would be it.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyLabourHousingInfrastructureRachel ReevesKeir StarmerWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

If movement were a pill, it would be the most powerful drug on the planet, yet it remains under-prescribed.“Integrating it as a treatment into mainstream healthcare would transform lives on a scale no drug could”, said Dr Davina Deniszczyc, Nuffield Health’s charity and medical director.The analysis found that if 184,000 of the 334,000 MSK patients inGreater Manchestertook up Nuffield’s offer of free exercise, that would deliver £1.7bn of “social value”.Expand this to cover the whole and that figure would rise to £34bn, the researchers said. That would be made up of £18bn of benefits of improved health, £13bn of benefits to relatives and carers, a £3bn boost to the economy and £230m in direct savings for the NHS.For example, participants’ health-related quality of life rose by 13%, which was calculated to be worth £6,680 in financial terms. Similarly, their drop in sick days was estimated to be worth £501 while the 10% increase in their family’s life satisfaction was valued at £4,765.Nick Woolley, a manager at Frontier Economics, said at the start of Nuffield’s joint pain programme, one in four of those who attended the classes could not work and by then end of the 12 weeks, almost one in 10 were fit enough to return to work.Prof Tim Cable, the director of MMU’s institute of sport, said the research showed “the transformative role of movement” in alleviating pain among the 25 million Britons with one or more long-term health conditions and are “a blueprint” for a nationwide programme of NHS-provided exercise.The truth about vitamin pills: should midlife women start taking supplements – and if so, which ones?Read moreThe NHS should “include structured exercise programmes in best practice guidance” and encourage hospitals and GP practices to refer eligible patients to them, the analysis said.However, the chief executive of the charity Versus Arthritis, Deborah Alsina, said that while exercise improved quality of life for people with the condition, it was not the “solve-all” the analysis suggests; they could have trouble fitting exercise into their lives and often experienced “challenges in accessing effective treatment and support from the NHS, long delays to secure a diagnosis and lack of treatment options”, she said.A six-week pain reduction programme of education, exercise and self-management run by some NHS trusts in England, called Escape Pain, which 15,000 people have used, has been found to improve quality of life for people with arthritis and also save the NHS time and money.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We know that living with chronic pain can have a significant impact on quality of life. We will transform the NHS by shifting care from sickness to prevention to keep people healthy and independent for longer through our 10-year health plan.“We will also harness the power of technology which can help keep people active. This includes ensuring all patients with chronic pain have access to wearable technology as part of their care, especially in areas of deprivation.”Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessNHSManchester Metropolitan UniversityGPsGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

In a post on X, Chikli described Robinson as “a courageous leader on the front line against radical Islam”.Robinson said he had accepted an invitation by the Israeli government to cover the cost of his flight and hotel stay for a few days, adding that he intended to travel after an appearance in court on 13 October.He said he would visit the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to meet government leaders andvisit “Judea and Samaria”, a term typically used by rightwing Israeli politicians for the West Bank.However, the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council said of Robinson: “His presence undermines those genuinely working to tackle Islamist extremism and foster community cohesion.”View image in fullscreenAmichai Chikli had ‘proven himself to be a diaspora minister in name only’, two leading Jewish bodies in the UK have said.Photograph: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock“Minister Chikli has proven himself to be a diaspora minister in name only. In our darkest hour, he has ignored the views of the vast majority of British Jews, who utterly and consistently reject Robinson and everything he stands for,” they added.Labour Friends of Israel, which includes MPs and others, called on Chikli to withdraw the invitation, noting Robinson’s multiple criminal convictions and adding: “He’s no friend to the Jewish people. Amichai Chikli should withdraw this invitation now.”Robinson has long been accused of seeking to weaponise a self-proclaimed role as an ally against antisemitism as a way of stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. At the same time, he has repeated far-right tropes such as the “Great Replacement”, which have antisemitic roots.In 2023, organisers of a British march against antisemitism urged Robinson to stay away . In 2018, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in the US urged the first Trump administration to reject a visa application by Robinson.In the past, he has been a member of the far-right British National party, which had historically been a political home for antisemites.Robinson’s media platform, Urban Scoop, appears to have buried a long text it published online in 2022 under the title: “Tommy’s Statement: The Jewish Question”.While it is no longer accessible in its original form on the site, the piece was intended to be Robinson’s attempt to analyse the antisemitic comments of the rapper Kanye West about the role of Jewish people in Hollywood and the media.“[W]e should be able to discuss this elephant in the room now that Kanye has opened the door, and because its firmly in the public consciousness,” it said.“There are powerful Jewish people, claiming to be Zionists, who have their fingers on buttons of power in the entertainment industry, in big tech, in mainstream media, in the music industry, in Hollywood and in governments.”In a section headed “Do Jews control the media?” Robinson drew on pseudoscientific sources and added that they were in positions of power because “Jews (generally speaking, at least the white European Jews) have an average IQ of 110”.Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonIsraelThe far rightAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, the company reported a pre-tax loss of £377,000.However, turnover at the company, the maker of hits including Father Ted, Trigger Point and Outnumbered, fell almost 28% from £48.4m to £35m year on year.The return to profit came as Hat Trick successfully debuted a 10-episode series ofHave I Got News for Youin the US on CNN in the run-up to last November’s US presidential election, with a further 20 episodes running this year.View image in fullscreenHat Trick Productions produced the sitcom Father Ted.Photograph: Ronald GrantThe number of series produced, a key measure of the company’s performance, rose from seven to 10 last year.In total, the London-based company paid out an interim dividend of £1m,down on the £4.7m in 2023.Of this, £900,000 was paid to Jimmy Mulville and his wife, Karen, who received a £4.2m payout in 2023, while the chair, Patrick McKenna, received £100,000.Hat Trick was founded in 1986 by Mulville – an aspiring standup turned TV executive – and his ex-wife, Denise O’Donoghue, who together created comedy shows including Drop the Dead Donkey and Room 101 before herdeparturefrom the company in 2005.Earlier this year Mulville spoke about his attempt to “buy out” Graham Linehan from a planned Father Ted musical. Mulville said Linehan, the co-creator of the hit series that ran between 1995 and 1998, refused to grant Hat Trick permission to make it even if he “drops dead”.In light of Linehan’sactivism and outspoken views on transgender issues, Mulville said he suggested to him the controversy would be a hindrance to getting the Father Ted musical into theatres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Customers inside the restaurant continued eating.“Then it was like non-stop bang bang bang,” Aysegul said, adding she could smell the live rounds inside the restaurant.They called police who told her and her customers to shelter inside the restaurant, which they did until about 10pm. The restaurateur said she knew the alleged perpetrator, but not by name, and understood he had moved to the area recently.Traffic was flowing again on Georges River Road on Monday morning, although the northern side of the street was still blocked off. Several bullet holes were visible in a building and a bus stop. Shattered glass was strewn across the footpath.Specialist officers were examining an awning in front of the window from which the gunman allegedly opened fire. Officers were visible inside the apartment.Six people hospitalisedSix people were hospitalised. A man in his 50s self-presented to Canterbury hospital with gunshot wounds, including one to the neck. He was transported to Royal Prince Alfred hospital in a serious condition.A man and a woman, both in their 30s, went to Campsie police station with glass injuries and were taken to Canterbury hospital, authorities said.Two men were treated at the scene for glass injuries, with one subsequently transported to RPA and the other to another hospital.Paramedics treated 16 people at the scene for minor injuries. Some were injured by shattered glass as bullets hit their windows. Others were treated for shock.TheNew South Walespolice commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said police body-worn cameras showed how close officers had come to being hit as they took cover during the “serious and terrifying incident”.“You can hear numerous gunshots, and certainly impact, not too far from the camera,” Lanyon told Sydney radio 2GB on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He alleged there were “at least 50” shots fired.“It’s unprecedented for Sydney to have something like this, with such a large number of shots fired,” he told ABC radio on Monday. “We’re very fortunate that we didn’t have more damage and certainly more injuries or indeed fatalities.”King said it would have been terrifying for the general public and police. “What I can say is that those initial police were fired upon. We have damaged police vehicles and we’re very fortunate that no police have been injured.”No known motiveA motive for the shooting was yet to be determined, but Lanyon said there was no known link to any terrorism or gang activity.The 60-year-old man was under police custody in Bankstown hospital and was expected to be questioned and formally charged on Monday.A high-calibre rifle was seized during his arrest, police alleged.King said the alleged gunman was undergoing medical treatment in hospital. He said the incident didn’t appear to be alcohol or drug-related.“But certainly, there’s nothing in relation to history, in relation to … gang or other associations that would indicate why this has occurred.”View image in fullscreenPolice investigate the scene of a shooting in Croydon Park.Photograph: Sitthixay Ditthavong/AAPOne witness to the shooting told the ABC he was driving by and “heard a bang bang bang on the left side of the car, the taxi”.“And then I looked next to me, and I saw a couple of holes through the window right next to – on the passenger side,” he said.“And I didn’t realise there was actually a hole on the roof as well. And I smelled the gunpowder, but I assumed because it was [NRL] grand final night, [it was] somebody throwing firecrackers.”Matt Iocco, who lives locally, arrived in the area at about 8pm on Sunday to find the street blocked off. He waited as the police operation unfolded.Iocco works at a vet clinic next to the apartment from where the gunman allegedly opened fire. It was “very scary” to think what could have happened if he had been walking by only minutes earlier, he said on Monday.Michelle Baldock was at home across the street at about 7.30pm when she heard what she thought were firecrackers. She said the shots were going off in bursts. “It sounded considered,” she told Guardian Australia.Baldock said there were bullet holes in the windows of her neighbour’s home.Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

They were stopped by riot police using pepper spray and water cannon.“No one will escape responsibility. This includes political responsibility,” the Georgian news agency Interpress quoted the prime minister as saying.Officers detained at least five demonstrators, including two members of the United National Movement, the largest opposition party, and the opera singer turned activist Paata Burchuladze.View image in fullscreenPaata Burchuladze (left, in dark jacket), an opera singer and one of the rally’s organisers, marched with opposition supporters in Tbilisi and was detained by police.Photograph: Zurab Tsertsvadze/APLocal media cited the health ministry as saying 21 members of the security forces and six demonstrators had been injured in clashes in the centre of Tbilisi.The South Caucasus country has been in turmoil since Kobakhidze’s ruling Georgian Dream (GD) partyclaimed victoryin last year’s parliamentary election, which the pro-EU oppositionsays was stolen. Since then, Tbilisi’s talks on joining the bloc have been frozen.Kobakhidze said up to 7,000 people attended Saturday’s opposition rally but their “attempt to overthrow the constitutional order” had been thwarted despite what he said was EU backing.“Several people have already been arrested – first and foremost the organisers of the attempted overthrow,” he told reporters, saying the country’s main opposition force “will no longer be allowed to be active in Georgian politics”.View image in fullscreenIrakli Kobakhidze, seen here last week at a meeting of the European Political Community in Copenhagen, said Georgia’s main opposition force would ‘no longer be allowed to be active in Georgian politics’.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/EPAOpposition figures had called for a “peaceful revolution” against GD, which they accuse of being pro-Russian and authoritarian. The party has been in power since 2012.Thousands of protesters gathered in the heart of the capital, waving Georgian and EU flags, after months of Kremlin-style raids on independent media, restrictions on civil society and thedetention of dozens of opponentsand activists. The jailed reformist ex-presidentMikheil Saakashvilihad urged supporters to protest on election day for what he called the “last chance” to save Georgian democracy.Kobakhidze accused the EU’s ambassador to Georgia, Paweł Herczyński,of meddling. “You know that specific people from abroad have even expressed direct support for all this, for the announced attempt to overthrow the constitutional order,” he said, adding that Herczyński “bears special responsibility in this context”.“[Herczyński] should come out, distance himself and strictly condemn everything that is happening on the streets of Tbilisi,” said Kobakhidze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She talks about dreams of Oxford, the deaths of friends and how tragedy has shaped the person she has becomeSun 5 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareBatool Abu Akleen was having lunch in the seaside apartment that has become the latest refuge for her family of seven, when a missile struck a nearby cafe. It was the last day of June, an ordinary Monday in Gaza City. “I was holding a falafel wrap and looking out of the window, and the window shook,” she says. Within an instant, dozens of men, women and children were dead, in an atrocity that wasreported around the world. “It doesn’t feel real sometimes,” she adds, with the nonchalance of someone numbed by living with horror.But this impression is misleading. At just 20 years old, Abu Akleen is becoming one of Gaza’s most vivid and unstinting witnesses, whose debut poetry collection has already won accolades from the novelist Anne Michaels, the playwright Caryl Churchill and the poet Hasib Hourani, among others. She has thrown her whole being into finding a language for the unspeakable, one capable of articulating its surrealism and absurdity as well as its daily tragedies.In her poems, missiles are fired from Apache helicopters, fleetingly referencing both the US’s role and its history of annihilation; an ice-cream vendor sells frozen corpses to dogs; a woman wanders the streets, carrying the dying city in her arms and trying to buy a secondhand ceasefire (she can’t, because the price keeps going up). The collection itself is titled 48Kg. This, Abu Akleen explains, is because it consists of 48 poems, each representing a kilogram of her own weight. “I consider my poems to be part of my flesh, so I collected my body, in case I was smashed and there was no one there to bury me.”We are talking via videocall to a workhub near her home. Abu Akleen is elegantly dressed in chequered black and white, twiddling rings on two fingers that testify both to the fashion sense of someone barely out of her teens and to yet another catastrophe. One of her close friends, the photojournalist Fatma Hassouna, was killed in a strike this spring, a month before the Cannes film festival premiere of a documentary about her life,Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk. Fatma loved rings, says Abu Akleen. The two were chatting about them, and sunsets, the night before she died. “Now I wonder whether I should remember her by wearing my rings or taking them off.”Abu Akleen is the oldest of five children born into a professional family in Gaza City. Her father is a lawyer and her mother worked as a site engineer. She started writing aged 10 “and it just clicked”, she says. Before long, a teacher was telling her parents that their daughter had an exceptional talent that must be nurtured. Her mother has ever since been her first reader and editor.At 15 she won an international poetry competition and individual poems started to be published in journals and anthologies. When she wasn’t writing, she painted. She was also a “nerd”, who excelled at English, and now speaks it fluently enough to be able to translate her own work, although she has never ventured beyond Gaza. “I used to have big dreams and one of them was to go to Oxford,” she says. To egg herself on she stuck a notice to her desk that read: “Oxford is waiting for you.”Before the genocide, I used to complain about my life. Then I found myself just running and trying to surviveShe settled for a degree in English literature and translation at the Islamic University of Gaza, and was about to start her second year when Hamas launched its 7 October attack on Israel. “Before the genocide,” she says, “I was a spoilt girl who used always to complain about my life. Then suddenly I found myself just running and trying to survive.” This theme, of the privileges of peace taken for granted, is present in her poems: “A busker used to fill our street with boredom,” begins one, which ends, begging, “may boredom return to our streets”. Another remembers the “casual hospital death” of her grandfather, who had dementia, which she lamented “in poems as casual as your death”.There was nothing casual about the murder of her grandmother, in a missile strike on her uncle’s home. “Why haven’t you taught me to sew?” a granddaughter asks in a poem, so she could stitch her grandmother’s face back together and kiss it one more time. Dismemberment is a constant motif in the collection, with severed limbs crying out to each other across the cratered streets.Abu Akleen’s family decided to join the hordes fleeing Gaza City after a neighbour was hit by two missiles in the street outside their home as he walked from one building to another. “We heard the screams of a woman and no one dared to look out of the window to see what had happened; there was no phone signal, no ambulance. Mum said: ‘Right, we’re going to leave.’ But where? We had nowhere to go.”For several months, her father stayed in north Gaza to protect their home from looters, while the rest of the family moved to a refugee camp in the south. “There was no gas cooker, so we did everything on a wood fire,” she recalls. “Unfortunately my mother’s eyes were allergic to the smoke so I used to bake the bread. I was always angry and burning my fingers.” A poem inspired by that time depicts a woman melting all her fingers one by one. “Middle Finger I raise between the eyes / of the bomb that hasn’t yet reached me / Ring Finger I lend to the woman / who lost her hand & her husband / Little Finger will make my peace / with all the food I hated to eat.”After composing the poems in Arabic, she rewrote all but a few in English. The two versions are presented side by side. “They’re not translations, they’re recreations, with some words changed,” she says. “The Arabic ones are heavier for me. They carry more pain. The English ones have more confidence: it’s another version of me – the more recent one.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m less timid now.”Though their old home was destroyed, the family decided during the short-lived ceasefire in January this year to return to Gaza City, renting the apartment in which they now live, with a view of the sea. Below their window, Abu Akleen can see the tents of those who are not so lucky. “I live & a thousand martyrs fall / I eat & my father starves / I write & shelling shatters my neighbour’s hand,” she writes in a poem called Sin, which negotiates her survivor’s guilt. It is laid out in two columns which can be read horizontally or vertically, making concrete the gap between the living, writing, eating poet and the victims on the other side of the ampersand.Armed with her new assertiveness, Abu Akleen has continued to study online, has started teaching young children, and has even begun to travel a bit on her own in Gaza, which – with the broken logic of a destroyed society – was considered far too dangerous in the good old days. Also, she says, surprisingly, “I learned to be rude, which is good. It means you can use bad words with bad people; you don’t have to be that polite person all the time. It helped me so much with being the person that I am today.”As a child she had to be cajoled into reading. Still, she says, “I read the world more than I read books.” In the imagery of her own poetry, the horrors she has witnessed have put an old head on young shoulders. “This is what happens when death is chasing after you,” she says. “You run so fast through life to live as much as you can, because you know you don’t have the luxury of being young and making mistakes.”48Kg by Batool Abu Akleen, translated in collaboration with Graham Liddell, Wiam El-Tamami, Cristina Viti and Yasmin Zaher, is published by Tenement.Explore more on these topicsPoetryGazaPalestineinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Then along came the patriarchy, and much bloodshed and oppression later, here we all are.This notion of matriarchy and patriarchy as polar opposites – with a switch having been thrown between them – was seeded in the 19th century by Marxist theory, taking root in archaeology without much evidence. From there it spread to public consciousness.Anthropologists tended to be more sceptical. They saw plenty of diversity in gender relations across human societies, both modern and historical, and some of them suspected that diversity was the rule in prehistory, too. It was difficult to prove, though, in part because biological sex – let alone gender – was often hard to determine in ancient remains. Then about 20 years ago, that changed.The so-called ancient DNA revolution – the ability to extract DNA from ancient bones and analyse it – meant that suddenly it was possible to determine the sex of long-dead people, and to ask how they were related to each other. The chemical makeup of their bones and teeth – specifically, the ratio of isotopes or variants of certain elements found there – revealed if they had lived in different places and undergone dietary changes as a result. The picture emerging thanks to these new tools is that diversity in gender relations was very much the rule in prehistory, and that there was no watershed when one system gave way to its mirror image.The Marxist idea, actually credited to Marx’s collaborator Friedrich Engels, was that humans were egalitarian until agriculture spread out of the Middle East about 10,000 years ago. With the more sedentary lifestyle and accumulation of wealth that farming brought came the need to defend that wealth and to fix rules for its inheritance. As populations grew, men monopolised the elites that formed to coordinate these things, in part because they were better at warfare, and wealth gravitated to the male line. Male kin were also more likely to stay put, with their female mates moving to live with them. Female oppression was often a byproduct of these changes.An alternative theory, put forward by the Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas in the 1960s, was that woman-centred societies dominated for longer in Europe – until 5,000 years ago – when they were toppled by incoming, patriarchal nomads from the steppe.Matrilinearity (where wealth passes down the female line) and matrilocality (where female kin stay together) often go together, and both are associated with higher female status and influence. In 2017,American geneticists reportedthat for more than 300 years around the 10th century an elite matrilineal group inhabited Chaco Canyon, in what is now New Mexico. Then, this June,Chinese researchers reporteda matrilineal farming community that thrived for nearly as long in eastern China, more than 3,000 years earlier. These findings join others, suggesting that matrilineal societies have existed on all inhabited continents, at least from the arrival of agriculture on.But though they enjoy higher status, women in matrilineal societies don’t necessarily make decisions. That generally remains the preserve of men – just of women’s brothers rather than their husbands. And since ancient DNA and isotopes can’t tell you much about female agency, gender power relations in prehistory remain a matter of debate. In fact, this line of work has forced researchers to ask themselves what they mean by power. If the female consort of a male ruler influenced his entourage through patronage and back channels, and his own policies through counselling, was she any less powerful than him?Archaeologists know of several examples of couples ruling jointly in the bronze age – the period after those nomads arrived in Europe – and laterhistorical records attestto elite women shaping decisions in such ways, continents apart. Perhaps they did so in earlier times, too. Females exerting soft power in male-dominated societies may even have predated Homo sapiens. In his 2022 book about sex and gender,Different,primatologist Frans de Waal described how an alpha female chimp, Mama, anointed a successor to the alpha male – who outranked her – with a kiss.In recent years something else has become clear. Although Engels may have been broadly right in associating wealth with patrilinearity, other factors shaped gender relations, too – such as how a society makes a living. In February,Chinese and British researchers reportedthat traditionally matrilineal villages in Tibet have become more gender-neutral over the last 70 years, as they moved from an agricultural economy to a market-oriented one. Conflict also plays its part. Although matrilocal and patrilocal societies are equally warlike, says anthropologist Carol Ember of Yale University, internal strife – as opposed to war against an external enemy – prods societies towards patrilocality, because warring clans prefer to keep their sons close.Meanwhile, evidence is accumulating that womenfought,huntedand acted asshamansin the distant past. No role or position has been barred to them always, everywhere. And though female decision-makers may have been rare, they haven’t been absent. Newancient DNA findingsfrom Trinity College Dublin show that there were at least pockets of matrilinearity throughout Britain, when Celtic tribes dominated the island in the iron age. Combined with archaeological evidence for female warriors and Roman descriptions of female tribal chiefs, it looks as if Celtic women could wield hard as well as soft power.Matrilineal societies still exist today –the Mosuo of Chinaare an example, as are the Hopi of Arizona, descendants of those Chaco Canyon clans. Their numbers are dwindling, as national governments flex their patriarchal muscles, but they serve as reminders that some extinct societies tilted more towards gender equality than many of our modern ones, and that all societies have the capacity to change.Further readingDifferent: What Apes Can Teach Us About Gender by Frans de Waal (Granta, £10.99)The Patriarchs: How Men Came to Rule by Angela Saini (4th Estate, £10.99)Eve: How The Female Body Drove 200 Million Years of Human Evolution by Cat Bohannon (Penguin, £12.99)Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyThe big ideaWomenScience and nature booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To spotlight Palestine’s rich tradition of film-making, we asked prominent Palestinian film-makers and entertainers to share their favorite Palestinian movies.‘By the end, I was moved to tears’: Mo Amer on All That’s Left Of YouView image in fullscreenA scene from All That’s Left of You.Photograph: Courtesy Sundance InstituteCherien Dabis’s film All That’s Left of You, which premiered this year at Sundance, is a rare film, unflinching and unforgettable. By telling the story of a single Palestinian family, from its origins in pre-Nakba Jaffa through generations of displacement, it does not just tell a story – it honors a legacy.The cinematography is rich and transportive. Every shot feels intentional, every frame a memory – the orange groves of Jaffa, the streets of Nablus, the alienation of exile. The performances are unforgettable, showcasing Dabis’s extraordinary range alongside three generations of Bakris – the family of actors most synonymous with Palestinian cinema. They are layered, restrained and heartbreakingly real.What’s most impressive is how seamlessly the film moves between time periods without ever losing its emotional throughline. Each decade of the Palestinian story is brought to life with stunning precision, both visually and emotionally. The direction is masterful in that way, guiding you through years with clarity and care.By the end, I was moved to tears. All That’s Left of You isn’t just about the past, it’s about the invisible ways it shapes who we are. It’s a film that lingers – not because of spectacle, but because of truth.Mo Amer is a Palestinian American actor and comedian and the creator of the Netflix showMo‘The most wildly original Palestinian film ever made’: Cherien Dabis on Divine InterventionView image in fullscreenA scene from Divine Intervention.Photograph: Ognon/Soread-2m/Kobal/ShutterstockA sunglasses-clad Palestinian woman defiantly struts through a checkpoint. Israeli soldiers look on, guns raised, baffled. Her beauty disarms them and brings the watchtower crashing down. It’s an iconic moment from Elia Suleiman’s Divine Intervention that has stayed with me ever since I first saw the film. I was a second-year graduate film student at Columbia University when it opened in the US in 2003. I remember being stunned by its power, its defiance, and its sheer audacity.At a time when most Palestinian cinema leaned toward the solemn or tragic, Suleiman carved a new path. Through dark humor, deadpan performance, and near-silent observation, he captured the surreal absurdity of life under occupation. Playing the film’s mute protagonist himself, he placed his own gaze at the heart of the narrative. That choice felt radical. His presence was calm and understated, which only magnified the tension all around him.Divine Intervention is both deeply personal and politically charged. Its visual language is universal, yet rooted in the fractured reality of Palestinian identity. Suleiman transforms disconnection, exile and resistance into something approaching poetry. The result is poignant, surreal, sometimes hilarious and always painfully honest.There was nothing remotely like it in Palestinian cinema at the time. There still isn’t. It remains, for me, the most wildly original and imaginative Palestinian film ever made.Cherien Dabis is a Palestinian American director, writer, producer and actor, whose most recent film,All That’s Left of You, is Jordan’s official selection for the 2025 Academy Awards‘Palestine has gained a talent’: Hany Abu Assad on To a Land UnknownView image in fullscreenA scene from To a Land Unknown.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyFor me, a great movie needs to do two things. It needs to deliver an experience that’s unfamiliar, emotional and smart. It needs to give me something I’ve been missing – a point of view that contradicts my belief system, a way to think about issues beyond my own world, a window to a different time and place. In short, I need to feel enriched, emotionally and intellectually.Second, it needs to impress me with its talent. A talent that is not busy trying to impress me but is used to open my eyes to something more important.The film To A Land Unknown, which was released last year, is precisely this kind of film. Made by Mahdi Fleifel, it is a story about two Palestinian friends searching for better lives as refugees in Greece.To A Land Unknown made me feel what it’s like to be a vulnerable refugee, in a strange land, where everything works against your attempts to escape the ghetto. It showed me that in some cases, even when circumstances beyond your control conspire against you, you yourself can still become your own worst enemy. And its dance between content and visual form floored me in its artistry.In To A Land Unknown,Palestinehas gained a talent that will serve its cause without spilling a single drop of blood.Hany Abu-Assad is a Palestinian Dutch director, screenwriter and two-time Academy Award nominee for his filmsParadise NowandOmar‘It shows Israel views even cows as a threat’: Basel Adra on The Wanted 18View image in fullscreenA scene from The Wanted 18.Photograph: Courtesy Ina FichmanOne of my favorite Palestinian films isThe Wanted 18. It tells the story of Palestinians in Beit Sahour, a village near Bethlehem in the West Bank, during the first intifada of the late 1980s. It documents their attempt to build a local dairy farm, a small operation centered around a herd of 18 cows that was deemed a “threat” by the Israeli occupation, which sought to confiscate the cattle.The animated film is powerful and creative, and highlights an often overlooked aspect of the occupation: it’s not just about stealing land, but also about undermining the Palestinian economy and creating economic dependency on Israel. When people have independent sources of income and can provide for their families, they are more likely to engage politically and resist oppression. Israel knows this, which is why it works so hard to prevent self-sufficiency among Palestinians.By keeping the people in the West Bank – where I live, and where my village experiences regular incursions and demolitions – dependent on military-issued work permits, the army can effectively silence them, keeping many Palestinians focused on daily survival rather than systemic change. They steal land and give it to settlers, while preventing Palestinians like me to build factories, schools, plastic houses for agriculture and even tents.As The Wanted 18 showed, Israel views even Palestinian cows a threat.Basel Adra is a journalist and activist fighting to save his community, Masafer Yatta, from forced eviction. His filmNo Other Landwon best documentary at the 2025 Academy Awards‘I watched it with my gut, not my brain’:Tamer Nafar on AjamiView image in fullscreenA scene from Ajami.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyOut of countless worthy Palestinian films, one of my absolute favorites is Ajami, from 2009, which highlights the underrepresented voices of Palestinian citizens of Israel.The first time I watched it, I felt I was watching my own story. Not only as a Palestinian, but as a native son of Lod – one of the Middle East cities most ravaged by drugs and violence. The film takes place in nearby Jaffa – but the accent is the same as mine. The film even captured the Hebraicized words we use, and our slang.It’s a film I watched with my gut, not my analytical brain.Palestinians live at the mercy of a three-headed monster: one head slaughters in Gaza, one settles in the West Bank, and one inflames clan-based conflicts within our communities inside the state of Israel.The murder rate within Arab society in Israel has soared since the film’s release. Young people are fleeing the country because they feel unprotected, with no one to turn to – not even the police, who rob us of our taxes and give nothing in return. And here we are, still stuck between hammer and anvil, trying with courage and vanishing resources to create art.“For me, the film is Palestinian,” said director Scandar Copti on the red carpet when the film was nominated for an Oscar. That alone opened the gates of fascism against him. The culture minister called to strip him of funding.State funding for films like these – also taken from our taxes – is held over our heads like ransom. Palestinian identity is not just kept from the screen; it is chased from it. All I can do is respect the fragile lives that films like Ajami breathe into existence.Tamer Nafar is a pioneering Palestinian rapper, author, actor and screenwriter, and the co-writer and star of the filmJunction 48Explore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza: two years onPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

One, called October 8, focused on the “emergence of antisemitism on college campuses, on social media and on the streets” after Hamas forces killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians. The film, executive-produced by Debra Messing, was widely released by Briarcliff Entertainment, a maverick distribution studio that has also handled Trump biopicThe Apprenticeand Jamal Khashoggi documentaryThe Dissident; Messing promoted the film on mainstream programs such asMSNBC’s Morning Joe. It ultimatelygrossedmore than $1.3m domestically, a high total for a political documentary.The other film,The Encampments, faced a tougher road. A documentary on campus protests against Israel’s retaliatory destruction ofGaza, focusing in part on activistMahmoud Khalil– by thendetainedby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for his activism – got no celebrity morning show promotion. Its specialty release at New York’s Angelika theater led tothreats of violence, an incident of vandalism in the theater’s lobby and social media censorship of its ads. That it was released at all – and made $80,000 in its opening weekend, asignificant win for the specialty box office– is due to Watermelon Pictures, an upstart, Palestinian American-led film-financing and -distribution company founded by brothers Hamza and Badie Ali to help films with Palestinian perspectives reach audiences they otherwise would not, in a market that has otherwise ignored or deprioritized them.‘A chilling effect’: is Hollywood too scared to touch hot-button documentaries?Read moreThe two documentaries evince the different landscapes for Israeli and Palestinian narratives in the US – one concentrated and often backed by more mainstream institutions, the other fractured and more ad hoc, yet growing. The two-year anniversary of the 7 October attacks throws the contrast into sharper relief – this weekend marks the limited release of The Road Between Us, Barry Avrich’s documentary following retired Israeli general Noam Tibon’s efforts to save his son’s family from Hamas forces on 7 October. A gripping Taken-like tale of survival, trauma and mourning that does not mention Israel’s subsequent killing of at least 66,000 Palestinians in retaliation, The Road Between Us receivedsupportfrom celebrities like Messing and Amy Schumer, andwonthe People’s Choice Award for best documentary at the Toronto film festival. US distribution rights were quicklysnapped upby Forston Consulting.It’s difficult to get any hot-button, politically challenging film financed,let alone releasedin the US, especially under the second Trump administration. But films featuring Palestinian perspectives, or films challenging the narrative of a government that has turned the horrors of 7 October into aweapon of warjustifying an internationally recognized genocide in Gaza, have found it especially challenging, sometimes impossible, to reach audiences. “I’ve never made a film about Palestine that’s ever been distributed,” said Amber Fares, the director of Coexistence, My Ass!, a documentary about Israeli comedian Noam Shuster-Eliassi confronting her upbringing as “the literal poster child for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process” in the wake of the near-complete destruction of Gaza.With an acclaimed festival run, Fares, who is Lebanese Canadian, had hopes for a distribution deal for Coexistence, My Ass! “We thought that there could be a chance that Coexistence could break through just based on Noam and what she stands for (–) it’s such a unique way of looking at the issue,” Fares said. But deals never worked out; the team ultimately opted for a self-release strategy starting later this month, handled by the same company that arrangedNo Other Land’s self-release earlier this year. That film, a searing documentary by an Israeli-Palestinian collective about generational efforts to resist occupation in a small West Bank community, won a bittersweet Oscar for best documentary; weeks later, Israeli settlersseverely beatco-director Hamdan Ballal, who was thenarrestedby soldiers allegedlymocking the award. It’s still not available for streaming in the US but made more than $2.5m at the US box office (making it the highest grossing of the year’s Oscar-nominated docs).‘We need to do something’: the company releasing Palestinian films no one else willRead moreAll That’s Left of You, a sweeping epic on three generations of a Palestinian family displaced in 1948, also sought distribution out of a strong festival run, but ran into concern from distributors over the “subject matter”. “We had high hopes that one mainstream distributor would come through,” said Palestinian American director Cherien Dabis. One conversation with an unnamed company ended, according to Dabis, with a pass, citing too many films on their slate. “That’s exactly what they told another Palestinian film that more recently premiered at a festival. It all feels like political cowardice,” she said.The reality, according to Watermelon co-founder Hamza Ali, is that “there are not a lot of distributors that are going to support Palestinian films”. Major streaming companies have steered clear. But Paramount recentlyacquiredthe global streaming rights to Red Alert, a four-part scripted series produced in part by the Israel Entertainment Fund, which depicts the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel that, per the logline, “turned southern Israel into a war zone, testing humanity and forging heroism through chaos”. Paramount CEO and chair David Ellison touted the series as evidence of the company’s “continued commitment to storytelling through artistic excellence and accuracy”. And HBO Maxacquiredthe US rights for One Day in October, a scripted series based on first-hand accounts of the attack that will debut on its second anniversary.Meanwhile, “I don’t think a single Palestinian film has ever gotten mainstream distribution in the US”, said Dabis, who has since formed her own distribution company, Visibility Films, in wake of the roadblocks. “No one’s really been willing to take a risk on proving that these films could be seen widely.”“It’s unfortunate that we haven’t had that same support,” said Hamza Ali. “Not a single film of ours has been picked up by a mainstream streamer.” Still, “the industry is definitely shifting”, he said, pointing to the recentpledgesigned by more than 3,900 prominent entertainment figures to not work with Israeli film institutions “implicated in genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians, adding: “But it seems, unfortunately, like the streamers are not following suit.” (Liev Schreiber, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Messing were among the celebrities who signed arebukecalling the pledge a “document of misinformation”; several cited Israel’s Oscarsubmissionof The Sea, a film about a Palestinian boy who tries to visit the beach for the first time but is denied entry at a checkpoint. Notably, Israel’s version of the Oscars isfacing government defundingafter The Sea won the top prize.)View image in fullscreenA still from The Voice of Hind Rajab.A new wave of Palestinian-led, challenging films is finally beginning to crest even without major corporate backing – Watermelon signed on with Dabis’s Visibility Films to co-distribute All That’s Left of You, Jordan’s official submission to the Oscars, which will begin its limited theatrical release in January; Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem joined as executive producers. Watermelon also represents Palestine’s official Oscar submission, generational epic Palestine 36, and is executive producer on Kaouther Ben Hania’sThe Voice of Hind Rajab, which drew rave reviews and a major award at Venice; that film, which reconstructs the killing of a five-year-old girl in Gaza with her real voice, will be distributed in Europe by The Party Film Sales, and has yet to find US distribution.Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, Sepideh Farsi’s essay-film on thekillingof Palestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, along with six of her family members, by an IDF airstrike in Gaza this April, willopenin New York in November, with an expansion to follow.With both opportunities and opposition, the hope is to demonstrate, as The Encampments and No Other Land have before, that there is a market for films that challenge the long-standing narrative of Palestinian violence or erasure. “There’s this quandary where no one has proven that there’s an audience for these films,” said Dabis. “But that’s simply because no one has taken a chance on these films. So how can you know if there’s an audience or not an audience? And how could there not be an audience right now when we’re watching a livestreamed genocide?”“I absolutely know there’s an audience,” said Fares, referring to both Coexistence, My Ass!, as well asPalestine36, All That’s Left of You, The Voice of Hind Rajab and No Other Land. “I don’t know if there’s been another time when there’s just been so much interest, and also gatekeeping, where people have to seek these films out.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s also a love letter toBaltimore– to its artists, its crabs and its streets – and a Bildungsroman that finds its heroes in Lupe Fiasco and Frederick Douglass alike.Burney, a Baltimore native, culture critic, and essayist, guides us through a memoir about the art, whether films or paintings or song lyrics, that have informed his personal and professional trajectory. He writes about growing up amongst artists with Black family traditions rooted in the Chesapeake, his journey through fatherhood at 19, and then to New York, where he helped spearhead Vice’s coverage of lesser known rap and hip-hop artists otherwise left out of mainstream media coverage.The book, which gets its title from a phrase from the documentary Girlhood, comes at a time when the country is facing a crackdown on cities, including Baltimore, on art, on culture, on education, and on attempts at racial reckoning. Burney sat down to talk about his writing journey, and what his memoir means in this moment.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.There’s something always inherently political in talking about Baltimore. But it feels even more intense this year when cities are under attack by the actual president. You started this book before the election, but how much of that factored into how you wrote it?At least for the past 30 years, Baltimore is always politicized and heavily racialized. As I get deeper into my craft and my knowledge and just my maturity, I feel like I’m always talking about the same things with Baltimore.In my early writing career, it would be more passion and anger behind it. The first time I wrote anything about Baltimore to the mainstream media was in 2015 when the Freddie Graysituationhappened. I wrote about police violence – a very short essay about how I had already [gone] through this in my own family. My stepbrother had been beaten pretty [badly] by the police in 2013 or [2012]. It was caught on camera, and he sued and didn’t get any money from it even though it was documented pretty clearly.Now I try to write about it more from a historical lens of when this city became majority Black. It has deep segregation. I think it was the first city to legally implement redlining in 1910. You can still feel that now. You can go one block away and see a complete universal change. But it has this public facing image that you just know to not be true when you live in it.It does have a lot of societal ills, but it’s not as widespread in every second of the day that you would think from watching the news. I always tell people that Baltimore has probably the worst PR of any city in America. There could be great art coming out, it could be really interesting music coming out of it, but if it doesn’t hit those targets, it’s like, we’re not even interested. And I find it interesting. It’s unfortunate, but I think it’s a good case study for just America in general, the way that it’s framed.Building on that, you createdTrue Laurels, a zine, to platform the artists and voices of Baltimore. But you also write for some of the biggest publications in the country. What kind of writing feels truest to yourself?The perfect mixture of all my interests wasprobably a storyI did for Vice in 2017 about this rapper from Baltimore named Young Moose. He was one of two of the biggest rappers in the 2010s in Baltimore from the same side of town that I’m from. It was very clear that the police were kind of railroading him because he’s from probably a top three worst neighborhood in the city.He was about to open up for Lil Boosie, who was kind of his mentor, and the police locked him up the day before that show and threw some phony charges on him. He was locked up for maybe six to eight months.So, I was doing a story on getting him out and I knew about the cop that put him in jail because he would rap about him. This guy namedDaniel Hersl. But while I was reporting that story, those cops, Daniel Hersl and the rest of the country’s taskforce got indicted on federal racketeering and robbing citizens and selling drugs and defrauding overtime and all this. The story went from this rapper trying to find their way back after being railroaded to this rapper calling out this cop who’s actually being indicted by the feds.I was like: ”This is perfect.” This is something I know to be true and it just so happened that these cops got indicted while I was doing the story. It’s about Baltimore, about anti-Black policing, and anti- poor policing, which is also important to say because all Black communities aren’t terrorized to the same degree.The emotional tone of each chapter is so different – sometimes devastating, sometimes funny. I was really struck by when you talk about the car accident you were in – the ramp up to it is almost funny and lighthearted and then it just hits you. How much did you think about how you balance tone and emotion throughout the book when you were writing those chapters?I wouldn’t say I focused a ton on tone. But I did focus a lot on kind of emotional range because when you absorb whatever [cultural] production you absorb, it strikes an emotional chord that sometimes sticks with you more than something being like: “My god, what amazing prose in this book or what amazing cinematography in this film.” All of that is amazing and it shows a level of skill, but I think none of that comes close to just emotion.I know a lot of people remember a time in their lives when they were trying to belong or trying to find their footing as they went from adolescence to early adulthood. A lot of straight young men deal with this whole: “How do I present myself in terms of masculinity? How do I not identify myself as a mark within this society” And I wouldn’t say I felt those things, but certain things just kind of stick with you throughout time. Why do I feel like Lupe Fiasco’s music was so crucial to me? To a lot of people he just might be like a cool rapper, or maybe even kind of cheesy to some people, but to me I think he actually changed the course of my life.One of the interesting things here is you’re challenging the perceptions of Baltimore and it’s parallel to you challenging the perceptions of yourself. Like you just said, what it means to be“hard”, but you’re also going to church, you’re going to before [school] careand then you talk about later being perceived as “country” when you’re in New York. What was it like writing about that vulnerability? Were there moments where you were like:“I can’t believe I’m telling everybody this?”Alot of that stuff I think I’m so far removed from it that it can’t really hurt. Me going to church – I mean most Black people go to church. The before care part was like – I guess that’s kind of embarrassing. That’s not a thing that was acceptable. Even though I went for two years and I hated going even when I went, I felt extremely insulted in terms of my ability to navigate the world as a kid. Maybe I felt like I was being sheltered, but when I back away as an adult now, I’m like any parent that would try to prevent their kid from getting on public transportation at 11 years old at night. I saw people get robbed at gunpoint. I saw people get jumped or preyed on. I understand why my father did that for me.The only thing that I felt vulnerable about as I was writing was fatherhood, and navigating what it took for me to take [a job in a different city] and to break away from my young daughter. On the one hand, I’m used to being around her almost every day, but I’m miserable professionally. And then I had this opportunity to really break into this field that I’m extremely passionate about. I chose the harder option, but I felt like it had the potential reward at the end. Talking about those emotions wasn’t easy. That essay probably took me three months to even crank out a first draft ’cause every time I sat down to write it, it was just like eating me inside.This book feels so intimate in talking about your hometown, eating crab legs at your grandmother’s house with your family, but I feel like it’s equally intimate when you talk about Johannesburg and Lagos. Why did you feel like it was important to cover those journeys in the same book?Being at a place like Vice and observing people jet set and go all around the world every day basically, I was like why wouldn’t I take advantage of this? The reader has gotten to know me fairly intimately, they know the place that I’m coming from. I think that informed my experience in Lagos or Johannesburg, me being a person from Baltimore ending up there felt extremely unlikely.Also being from a place like Baltimore that has this mixture of dilapidation and development and segregation and two groups of people [living] completely different lives really prepped me for understanding a place like Johannesburg.That’s why I say I think Baltimore is a good microcosm, not even just for the social aspects of America, but the social aspects of the western world in general. It’s a good primer for understanding class conflict, racial tension, so on and so forth.Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureArtVice magazineVice MediaBaltimoreUS policingMarylandinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Having been rediscovered by the TikTok generation, early hitNaiveis powering towards a billion streams, recent album Never/Know returned the band to the Top 10, and they’re now playing the biggest shows of their career. In Manchester tonight, 18,000 mostly teens and early twentysomethings hurl plastic glasses in the air or climb on each other’s shoulders, generating an atmosphere of joyous celebration before the band have played a note.It would take a truly disastrous performance to lose in this environment, but instead, thousands of voices turn hits such as Eddie’s Gun or She Moves In Her Own Way into epic, euphoric singalongs, while even the slighter tracks have a new robustness. The Kooks’ were never as feted as the Strokes or the Libertines, but haven’t been hampered by boredom or health issues, and play as if they’re still loving every minute. It’s the day after theManchester synagogue attack, and frontman Luke Pritchard sets off a wave of cheering when he talks of “throwing a bubble around the arena and it’s all peace and love”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Izzy Clayton/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.Although most of the 26-song setlist is trademark indie/60s beat pop/rock’n’roll, there are various curveballs, including what Pritchard not inappropriately calls “the disco section”. Then one young lad holding up a sign asking to play Seaside finds himself being hauled on stage to accompany the singer on acoustic guitar. Pritchard shifts to piano for 2014’s See Me Now, about his father, who died when he was three. The 40-year old explains that they’re performing the song again because he’s a father now himself, and asks the audience to help if he “chokes up”. When the crowd light up the arena with their phones, it’s unusually raw and touching.‘We even did it as reggae’: the Kooks on how they made NaiveRead moreVoices and guitars swell loudest for Ooh La and a triumphant Naive.

Head to Jane Upton’s panoramic and boundlessly imaginative, Bruntwood prize-shortlisted play. It zips through scenes from M’s life after the birth of her first child – an old school flame tells her he “expected more” from her; she bickers with her husband about not wanting sex anymore – but (the) Woman is much more than an ordered presentation of ideas. M (a gut-punching Lizzy Watts) is a writer, and what we’re watching is her attempt to create a play that captures motherhood with all its messy, unvarnished edges.Angharad Jones’s production weaves M’s writing process into the action. The title of each scene is typed, deleted and rewritten across the back wall of the stage. There are glitches and line repetitions, as M’s artistic vision struggles into shape. In a boardroom scene, she meets two commissioners who agree she can write a play about motherhood – so long as it involves crime, a possessed baby and a few musical numbers.It is metatheatre at its finest, with the play feeling as if it’s being written live. “Wait, am I in the play right now?” asks M’s friend, gazing out at the audience in recognition of the blurred line between performance and reality. Structurally, the play is an unpredictable explosion – just as motherhood is too.View image in fullscreenIntimate revelations … Watts and Jamie-Rose Monk.Photograph: Charlie FlintUpton blends uproarious humour with intimate revelations. On a special care maternity ward, M confesses she feels disconnected from her tiny newborn, covered in wires and fighting for his life. Elsewhere she compares herself to other parents, who serve their toddlers plates of steamed vegetables, and didn’t commute to London for meetings during pregnancy.It’s a play that feels like a roar from a place of isolation. Although we never see M’s children, their presence engulfs her life. While she watches other people’s careers soar, she can’t help but fear she is missing out on opportunities. Each scene chips away at the myth that motherhood is supposed to come naturally and that mothers don’t ache for the people they were before. “I’m not the sort of woman who should be in a play,” M says. But Upton more than proves that hers are the kinds of complex, wonderfully considered stories that demand a place on stage.(the) Woman is at thePark theatre, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Director Ramon Ayres employs a similarly striking blend of sound, visual effects and physicality in Uprooted, but the story does not quite cohere, despite some individually superlative scenes.Rewind review – ingenious portrait of oppression and dissent in Latin AmericaRead moreThe drama is once again set in Latin America, and this time depicts the advent of western imperialism and its ruinous effects on ecology, indigenous life and the climate. Deviser-performers Eyglo Belafonte, Josephine Tremelling, Louise Wilcox and Vanessa Guevara Flores give spirited performances, and there is an overarching eco-feminist message that connects gendered violence to the rape and exploitation of the land.Musical compositions by Alex Paton, who sits on a raised platform on one side of the stage, certainly carry great levels of drama. Marco Curcio’s magnificent sound design adds ambience, embroidering bird-sounds with the babble of streams, the sound of chainsaws and earth-rattling rumbles. Tremelling’s lighting design is wondrous too, using miniature models of houses lit up from the inside to depict displacement, and shadow-play from within a recycling bin, as well as imaginatively using of wind-machine and muslin to depict rippling water and, at one point, a thunderous landslide.View image in fullscreenMartian-like occupiers … Louise Wilcox and Ephemeral Ensemble.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut despite this stagecraft and immersive atmosphere, there is little specificity to the story and minimal character building. Characters fight against the colonial destruction of their land and are angry, but they are almost as faceless as the occupiers, who wear martian-like metal facemasks.Uprooted touches on more issues that it can possibly do justice to within its hour-long duration, from female activism against colonialism and climate disaster to child labour, economic disruption to local communities, violence against women and more.It is frustrating that the script seems so generic in its messages and didactic in its delivery. Indigenous people fought and resisted western occupiers, we hear, and one defender of the land is still killed every other day. A quiz delivers more facts and figures. Strident statements are made about the centrality of the earth, progress versus plunder, and hopelessness being a luxury we cannot afford in the fight against environmental catastrophe. But they sound generalising and familiar. Where Rewind led with specificity to evoke intense emotion, this is a disjointed screed that leaves you impressed yet oddly unmoved.AtNew Diorama theatre, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreEnvironmental activismreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is extraordinary, as is the history of the family,” Thomas Bompard, the vice-president of Sotheby’sFrance, told the Guardian.“This painting is the Taylor Swift of surrealism,” Bompard said. “If you were to ask a group of schoolchildren to do a presentation on the surrealist movement this painting alone would be enough to define it. I call it the superstar of surrealism.”The Belgian-born Magritte worked as a designer in a wallpaper factory and created advertising posters until 1926, when he produced his first surrealist work. The following year, he had his first exhibition in Brussels but the critics were savage and a dismayed Magritte moved to Paris, where he failed to make his mark.He returnedBelgiumin 1930 and formed an advertising agency with his brother Paul.“Life for Magritte was very difficult at this time. The Great Depression that started in 1929 in the US hit France in the early 1930s. For two years, between 1930 and 1932, Magritte sold nothing and had no exhibitions,” Bompard said.“Nobody was buying paintings by surrealists. They were considered revolutionary troublemakers.”View image in fullscreenRené Magritte with his work The Barbarian (Le Barbare)Photograph: René Magritte/Latrobe Regional GallerySpaak’s husband, Claude, a celebrated Belgian playwright, knew Magritte and was a benefactor, commissioning portraits of his wife and children andarranging a monthly stipend for the artist and his family.In 1934, Suzanne Spaak’s sister Alice Lorge, known as Bunny, bought La Magie Noire to mark the birth of her first child with Emile Happe, a Belgian industrialist.“The Spaak family was to Belgium what the Mountbattens were to the UK; like royalty and they pulled Magritte out of difficulty,” Bompard said. “It was bought to mark the birth of a child but it was a rebirth for Magritte who was struggling to get himself back on his feet.”The model for the series was Magritte’s wife, Georgette Berger, who is portrayed in a classical manner resembling a marble statue resting her hand on a block of stone. Her upper body gradually blends into the sky behind her while her lower half retains its natural tone.Magritte went on to paint 10 similar portraits, most of which were given different names. In this work, the first of the series, Berger is portrayed with a dove on her right shoulder. One-third of the background shows a semi wood-panelled interior wall.View image in fullscreenResistance heroine Suzanne SpaakPhotograph: WikipediaSuzanne and Claude Spaak were living in Paris when war broke out in 1939. After the Nazi occupation of the French capital, she joined the resistance and was a member of the “Red Orchestra” intelligence unit. Spaak used her considerable fortune to save 163 Jewish children from deportation, hiding a number of them at her home before they could be moved to safety.In October 1943, the Nazis arrested Spaak along with 600 members of the Red Orchestra. On 12 August 1944, days before the liberation of Paris, the Gestapo executed her in her prison cell. She was 38 and has since been honoured by Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for her efforts to save Jewish people.Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on 15 August 1967 and is buried in Brussels.The painting, which has been displayed in the Magritte Museum in Brussels, has been rarely seen outside Belgium in more than nine decades.La Magie Noire will be exhibited at Sotheby’s Paris between 17 and 23 October before its sale on 24 October.Explore more on these topicsRené MagritteSecond world warFranceBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And during that time the show has charted society’s change in social, culinary and interior design tastes.“It’s been a kind of historical snapshot,” said its editor, Henry Hainault.Lamb said that in the UK, contestants have become, “more sophisticated in their approach”. Mike Beale, the managing director of ITV Studios Creative Network, which owns the production company Multistory Media, said they have moved from basic dishes such as spaghetti bolognese to more complicated meals with the advent of more cookery shows.One of the reasons for its popularity, Hainault said, is families can watch it together, but also because “it’s one of very few shows that celebrates people in their own homes …[plus] fundamentally people are interested in people”.View image in fullscreenClips from the show have become immortalised on social media for their comedy value; for example, Kev and his whisk.Photograph: Channel 4“It’s five people that wouldn’t necessarily be having dinner together, that’s how the show started and it still works today.”Lamb likes that it shows different people can get on: “It’s a really diverse representation of the people of Britain … not only does it travel around the country, but you get a lot of different types of people within it and they sit very naturally alongside each other. It’s really reassuring that that Britishness is so multicultural and so tolerant … it feels like it can do a job unifying us a bit at the moment.”View image in fullscreenAmong the more adventurous dishes to feature on the show was the sausage trifle.Photograph: Channel 4The UK show has created not only memorable moments – a pet snake once defecated on a table, one contestant did a rap in Thai and another was caught cheating using food from a restaurant – but also long-lasting friendships (some groups still meet once a month), romantic relationships and even a baby.View image in fullscreenAnother unforgettable moment was delivered by series seven’s Pete, who was put out that his fellow contestant Jane, won, uttering the line: ‘What a sad little life, Jane.’Photograph: No  creditAnd it has also brought people with opposing viewpoints around the same table. Beale recounts that the Israeli version features Arabic and Hebrew contestants: “It does bring people together … from different backgrounds who wouldn’t necessarily get on.”The most successful dish overall is tiramisu, but one of the least successful, Hainault recalled, was a UK contestant’s prosecco cheesecake. “One thing you could say about the British one, I think it’s probably low down the list in terms of the standard of cooking,” he said.Beale said that, in France, the cooking is taken “very seriously”. Other culinary differences across the world include the eastern European series featuring a “lot of potatoes” and the Mexican version numerous bean-based dishes.A nation’s culture also creates variations. Beale said: “It’s interesting how each territory localises [the show] or culturally adopts it.” He said that Germany likes trying new twists, basing the show in a castle one week, while in Turkey the most important thing is the entertainment the contestants put on to impress their fellow diners.View image in fullscreenContestants are judged on the quality of their entertainment as well as their cooking. Take series 45’s Jamie’s silent disco, for example.Photograph: Channel 4The series has always been popular with students and from November, Channel 4 will air a teen spin-off. Hainault said he had admiration for the youngsters, as for “most of them, it’s the first time they’ve ever cooked for other people. And in some cases, the first time they’ve ever been around to other people’s houses to have a meal and of their own age.” Interestingly one couple had not even eaten soup before, “because it looked too liquidy”.Globally, the series has adapted before, with celebrity versions and a couples’ spin-off – which enabled the format to travel to the Middle East, where previously it had not been aired due to the mixing of men and women.View image in fullscreenThe show’s editor, Henry Hainault, says comedy comes from the difference between people’s view of themselves and how they actually come across.Photograph: Channel 4One of the universal truths that crosses borders, said Hainault, is “fundamentally, there is a vast chasm between people’s opinions of themselves and the person they actually present to the world. And the gap between who people think they are and who other people think they are is where a lot of the comedy happens.”Lamb also said his voiceover had “become a little kinder over the years”, although he always makes sure “I shouldn’t say anything I wouldn’t be prepared to say if I was sat around the table with the people who are on it.”Explore more on these topicsCome Dine With MeReality TVFood TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Trotter brothers (David Jason as Del and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney) were reunited, and Mickey remained a regular presence all the way through to the programme’s final Christmas special in 2003.The character had been mentioned several times after Only Fools and Horses began in 1981, including in the story of Mickey stealing Rodney’s girlfriend, but did not initially appear on screen. When Sullivan wanted to expand the supporting cast, the producer, Ray Butt, recalled Murray’s performance in a TV commercial for Pizza Hut, unsuccessfully chatting up two women, and suggested him for Mickey. The actor was auditioned on a Friday and began work on the series three days later.Mickey was conceived as “Del Boy lite”, less savvy but, like Del, usually seeing his money-making antics go wrong. “Mickey will try anything, but he’s not very trustworthy,” Murray told Steve Clark, author of The Only Fools and Horses Story. “He’s always stitching Rodney up, and Del is always threatening to clump him for it.” The spiv persistently ridicules Rodney about his lack of girlfriends while lying about this own romantic “conquests” and flitting between jobs.View image in fullscreenPatrick Murray as Mickey, right, with, from left, Steven Woodcock as Jevon, Roy Heather as Sid, and Kenneth MacDonald as Mike, during the filming of the Only Fools and Horses Christmas special, “The Jolly Boy’s Outing”, in Margate, Kent, in May 1989.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyOne 1989 storyline had to be rapidly revamped after an accident in which Murray fell over his dog at home and crashed through a glass window, severing a tendon in his right arm and losing five pints of blood. With the actor’s arm in a plaster cast, Sullivan rewrote the next episode to incorporate Mickey being roughed up by local gangsters.The sitcom’s final episode was screened in 1991, but Murray was among those cast members who returned for Christmas specials for another 12 years – and remained popular at fan conventions.Murray was born in Greenwich, south London, to Juana (nee Romero Tejero), a dancer, and Patrick, a London Transport inspector, and attended St Thomas the Apostle college, Nunhead. Aged 15, he spotted an advert for a theatrical agency in the Daily Mirror and within a week had been cast in a stage play. He was soon getting television roles, starting in 1973, aged 16, in Places Where They Sing, a BBC play based onSimon Raven’s novel about student unrest on a college campus. It was quickly followed by a starring part in the children’s adventure serial The Terracotta Horse, filmed in Spain and Morocco.He also had roles inBarrie Keeffe’s short TV play Hanging Around (1978), about disaffected youths, and the film The Class of Miss MacMichael (1978), starringGlenda Jacksonas an idealistic teacher trying to inspire juvenile delinquents, before his big break came.InScum,Roy Minton’s play about the brutal borstal system, he was Dougan, a good-natured inmate whose head for figures means he is trusted to deal with money discreetly brought in by visitors, which he collects on his tea trolley round. He even manages to negotiate down the “daddy’s” percentage when Carlin (Ray Winstone) assumes that role.The drama, made for Play for Today in 1977, was banned by the BBC for the extent of its violence, although it was eventually broadcast in 1991. In the meantime, the director, Alan Clarke, remade it as a feature film in 1979, with Murray as one of six from the original cast reprising their roles.View image in fullscreenPatrick Murray, left, with Ray Winstone in the feature film Scum, 1979, based on a BBC television play.Photograph: Album/AlamyHe then had small parts in the filmsQuadrophenia(1979) and Breaking Glass (1980), and appeared as a bellboy in Curse of the Pink Panther (1983).Fame in Only Fools and Horses brought him a string of guest appearances in the 1980s and 90s in TV shows such as Dempsey and Makepeace, Lovejoy, The Return of Shelley and The Upper Hand. He also took two roles in The Bill.But his life spiralled downhill after he became a Kent pub manager in 1998, drinking too much and eventually finding help from Alcoholics Anonymous. He later moved to Thailand, where he married his second wife, Anong, in 2016. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Britain and worked as a cab driver. Murray made a brief return to acting in 2019 as a cockney gangster, Frank Bridges, in the TV series Conditions, still to be screened.He was diagnosed with the lung disease COPD in 2018 and, three years later, lung cancer and a tumour on his liver. Although he was given the all-clear in 2022 following surgery and chemotherapy, the cancer returned shortly afterwards.In 1981, Murray married Shelley Wilkinson; the marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by Anong, their daughter, Josie, and the three sons of his first marriage, Lee, Ricky and Robert, as well as three sisters and two brothers.Patrick Noel Murray, actor, born 17 December 1956; died 1 October 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV comedyQuadropheniaLondonobituariesShareReuse this content"

No one leaves a happy home, a country where they are settled and living a good life. You’re talking about people who’ve got nothing or everything’s been taken away from them. Small boat crossing is a small percentage; most of the immigration into this country is completely legal.MarkThere’s an ethical dimension to tempting skilled people to a rich country, because we’re causing other countries to have shortages. A concern I’ve had for years is overpopulation of the UK, because of energy security, water, health service, education, housing, etc. And there are communities that live completely parallel lives and don’t come into contact with the rest of the population. I do think that is an issue – particularly when migrants are coming from countries where human rights or treatment of women are appalling.YusufI talked about my dad coming here. It’s not like we suddenly become British; people do what they would have done in their home country.

But I won’t vote Conservative or Labour; they’ve had their chance.YusufI said to Mark: think about who your bedfellows in Reform are. There are some really nasty people, you’re not one of them, your views are not their views. Farage and his deputy,Richard Tice, are very rich businesspeople who don’t really care about the country, but are trying to appeal to people’s worst fears and impulses to get elected.View image in fullscreenTakeawayMarkNow I’m retired, I don’t get the young person’s perspective as much as I did when I was a lecturer.

I am three months sober with the help of rehab and AA, but my drinking became heavyover the last two years (I was sober for the first six years of my son’s life).Towards the end, my drinking was 24/7 and my son has sadly seen meout of control and desperately unhappy. He developed a sense of responsibility, that he was the only person who could stop me drinking(by physically removing bottles), which I feel utterly ashamed about. I have said to him many times that the only person who can stop me drinking is me.Helived with his father fora few months (we divorced five years ago but he is supportive of my recovery) and moved back in with me when he started high school in September.The trust between us is slowly growing as he can see that I am not drinking and putting all my effort into getting better.My son is still hyper-vigilant and anxious about my safety. Thismeans he is terribly controlling of my actions –partlybecause of his anxiety about mydrinking, but also because he is autistic andanxious about anything unpredictable. I am working on confidence and boundaries; it would be easy to give in to his demands but this doesn’t feel right as a parent. It is hard as I also feel enormously guilty.I referred our family to Children’s Services while I was in rehab, and we are waiting for help for my sonfrom our local substance abuse support service. In the meantime, I feelreallyat sea about how to talk to him.I don’t want to make him upset, but I don’t want to ignore the past either.Howdo we move forward?Incredibly well done for realising you need help and getting it. You’ve asked me a very specific question: how to talk to your son and support him.I went to systemic psychotherapist Rebecca Harris, who is an addictions area manager in a London mental health trust, and has over twenty more than 20 years experience in this field. “Children need to feel safe,” she said. “Your son has gone through an unpredictable time when he couldn’t be sure you were able to keep him, or yourself, safe. He may feel worried about raising these issues with you now. Children tend to think things are their fault [the alternative, that it’s their parents’ fault, is too great a threat to their survival, so they turn the blame inwards]. Autism may exacerbate all of this.”People in active addiction often make apologies and promises they may not be able to keep. This makes it hard for loved ones to know what to believeHarris also said that “it’s not unusual for people in active addiction to make apologies and promises which they may not be able to keep. This means it can be hard for loved ones to know what to believe. As well as boundaries, it’s really important to be consistent andshowyour son that things are better, rather than just telling him.”Concentrate on him settling in at school and establish a good routine. Then introduce the idea that no subject is off the discussion table (if that is indeed the case). Mealtimes can be a good time to talk as can side-by-side activities such as walking or driving because there is minimal eye contact, which some people find too intense. Maybe there’s an activity you and your son like doing together? Don’t think “we must talk”, think about opportunities for talking and see if they happen. Harris also wondered about your son’s preferred method of communication. It might not be talking; it could be written, or it could be a mixture of both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s important for him to know that, and for you not to take it personally if that’s where he wants to go at times. It doesn’t mean you’ve failed if he does, this is a process and it won’t be linear.I’m pleased you’ve got ongoing support from addiction services. We weren’t sure that local substance abuse services would be able to help your son (they usually deal with adults, but might have someone who can support him). These groups may also be helpful: Al-Anon Family Groups (Alateen); National Association for Children of Alcoholics (Nacoa);National Autistic Society.Harris said, “You need to separate your needs and your son’s. Make sure you’re not making him feel better to make yourself feel better – to absolve yourself – because you can’t do that through your son. You can better focus on what he needs if you have good support yourself.”You’re doing really well. Keep going.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Almost a million people in the UK are too sick to work because of back and neck problems, according toofficial figures, while the charityVersus Arthritissays 5.8 million experience “severe” back pain each year.The causes of back problems are complex, and treatments oftenfail to bring relief, especially where the pain is chronic and debilitating.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Long-term back pain is unlikely to be cured by upgrading your mattress, and a doctor or physiotherapist should be your first port of call if pain is affecting your quality of life. Butstudiessuggest that switching to thebest mattressfor your body type and sleeping position can genuinely help. I’m lucky to not experience chronic pain, but in years oftesting mattresses, I’ve often suffered temporary backache after sleeping on a surface that doesn’t suit me. Switching to a more appropriate mattress has often brought real relief, along with a better night’s sleep.Here, I’ll help you choose the ideal mattress for your back, whether you already experience pain or want to avoid it. To support this, I’ve talked to experts, including an osteopath and sleep scientist, and scrutinised the often-used “orthopaedic” label.Are firm orthopaedic mattresses best for a bad back?View image in fullscreen‘Medium-firm mattresses consistently come out on top in back pain research.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianNot necessarily. Firmer doesn’t always mean better, and the term “orthopaedic mattress” is little more than marketing spin. Orthopaedic surgeons have fixed all manner of musculoskeletal maladies since the 18th century, but in the context of selling beds, the word “orthopaedic” has no medical authority.“The term was made up by mattress manufacturers,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “It was made to sound medical, because at the time, doctors were telling people a firm mattress was best for a bad back. More recent research has proved this to be wrong, though.”The notion that your back requires a bed only marginally softer than the kitchen floor has been discredited since at least 2003, whenthe Lancetreported that medium-firm mattresses had better outcomes for patients experiencing back pain. “Medium-firm mattresses consistently come out on top in research into back pain,” says osteopath and sports coach Ian Greaves ofSouthampton Physio. “Comfort matters as much as support, and medium-firm beds strike a better balance than firm or soft types. This helps to improve sleep as well as reduce pain.”Keep your spine in lineThe key to keeping your back healthy and pain-free is “spinal neutrality”, in the words ofmedical researchers. Also called spinal alignment, this refers to the way your spine relaxes in a straight-ish line when you’re lying on a mattress that’s neither too firm nor too soft. It’s not just about your backbone, either: your head, neck and knees should all fall into line, neither dipping down nor sticking up. Without this alignment, you could experience back, neck and shoulder pain.Your back muscles can’t fully relax on a mattress that’s too firm or too soft, and you’ll quickly feel the effects, says Shore. “If your spine isn’t aligned when you sleep, you’re engaging muscles at a time when they should be relaxing and recovering from the day. The aches you feel from the occasional night of poor support are your muscles holding you in that position when they should be resting.”In the long term, back pain can also result from your spine failing to rehydrate at night. “Throughout the day your spine compresses,” says Shore. “This is completely normal, and it’s caused by pressure squashing each disc between the vertebrae.” At night, these discs reabsorb fluid and decompress, she explains – but only if you’re lying comfortably. “If the spine is twisted due to lack of support, chances are discs are still being compressed.”You may not feel the effects of compressed discs for years, says Shore. “Over a night or two of your spine being curved into non-neutral positions, you may feel a few aches and pains, but over a prolonged period, this can turn into serious back pain that affects you during the day.”How to choose the best mattress for back painView image in fullscreenBed firmness isn’t a one-size-fits-all matter.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe surest route to spinal neutrality while you sleep is tochoose a mattressthat’s neither too firm nor too soft for you. Bed firmness isn’t a one-size-fits-all matter, so don’t just go for a mattress that’s labelled “orthopaedic”. Instead, find one with the ideal balance of cushioning and support for your body size and sleeping position.As a rule of thumb, the bigger you are, the firmer your mattress will need to be to offer enough support for your spine. Side sleepers need a bit more cushioning to accommodate their hips, knees and shoulders, while people who mostly sleep on their back or front need a little more firmness.“If you’re a petite person, with small hips and narrow shoulders, an extra-firm orthopaedic mattress is probably the last thing you need,” says Shore, who won the BritishSleepSociety’s Green Ribbon prize for her research into body size and mattress firmness. “Your body wouldn’t be heavy enough to let the surface contour to your shape, and that’ll alter your spinal alignment. Find the firmness that suits your shape rather than because it sounds medically right.”The only way to know for sure is to sleep on a mattress for a few months, which is why many mattress manufacturers now offer lengthy trial periods. But you can also get a good idea of what you need in a showroom, or indeed on your own bed, by lying down (ideally on your side) on a mattress and asking someone to take a photo of you from the back. You should be able to draw a relatively straight line down your backbone, starting at your head via the cervical vertebrae of your neck, all the way to your knees and ankles. If this imaginary line dips at your hips and shoulders, the mattress is too soft for you. If the line curves up at those points, it’s too firm. Both are recipes for back pain.I’m a small side sleeper, so medium-firm works well for me and my back. I found my sweet spot with the medium-firmOtty Original Hybrid, which offered just enough cushioning to let my spine relax. TheOrigin Hybrid Prois also described as medium-firm, but has different levels of support in different “zones”: firmer areas that give stronger support for your back, and softer areas to accommodate pressure points such as your hips and shoulders. This didn’t quite work for my diminutive body, which suffered lower back pain after a few nights on the mattress’s firm surface. The zoning system may, however, be ideal for you if you’re a more standard size than my 5ft frame. Its firm surface may also provide the extra support you need if you sleep on your back.Best for side sleepersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid, double£674.99 at OttyBest for back sleepersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOrigin Hybrid Pro, double£618 at OriginIt’s also worth mentioning that softer memory-foam mattresses do work well for some pain sufferers. The marshmallowy sensation of the all-foamTempur Pro Plus SmartCoolleft me craving more support, but some people love it for pain management. Its powerful pressure relief – essentially, the way it cradles you as though you’re floating in a cloud – can be gamechanging if you’ve struggled to get comfortable in bed after an injury.Best for pressure reliefView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianTempur Pro Plus SmartCool, double£2,099.99 at Bensons for Beds£2,399 at TempurDon’t forget about the surface your mattress is on. A sprung-slatted base has much more give than a divan base, and will make a mattress feel softer as a result. If you have a slatted bed and your mattress feels too soft for your back, try it on the floor to see if you find it more comfortable. If you do, it may be time to upgrade to a more solid bed base.Firmness isn’t everythingView image in fullscreenConsider breathability, motion isolation and edge support too.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianAbad back will keep you awake, and being awake too much will give you a bad back. The most excruciating backache I’ve ever experienced was at a music festival, after a couple of nights awake, clenched against the cold in my tent. The camp bed didn’t cause my back pain; the lack of sleep did.The “bidirectional” vicious circle of back pain and poor sleep has been studiedmany times. Results consistently suggest that anything you can do to sleep better – including choosing a good mattress – will also help prevent and soothe a sore back, not least by giving your muscles a proper chance to relax.Other mattress attributes such as breathability, motion isolation and edge support are also vital for sleep quality. If you overheat or experience night sweats, look for a pocket-sprung mattress that contains natural fibres, such as theMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000. If you like the feel of foam but worry that it might trap heat, consider a specially designed cooling mattress, such as thePanda Hybrid Bamboo. The Panda and its similarly heat-dissipatingmattress topperperformed brilliantly in my heat-retention tests, and the topper helped me sleep surprisingly well during summer’s heatwaves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Bouncy springs can amplify a partner’s fidgeting, while foam is great for absorbing it and letting you sleep in peace ifseparate bedsaren’t an option. The memory foam beneath the sleeping surface of theSimba Hybrid Proexcels at this.Alternatively, you could split your bed in two. “‘Zip and link’ beds have separate mattresses that can be linked together,” says Rachel Marshall, brand manager atBensons for Beds. “These can be ideal if you want to share your bed with your partner but you each have different mattress needs, as you can choose different firmness levels, too.”Sealy’s Redcliffe Backcare mattress, for instance, is available with one side firm and the other medium. Like most zip and link mattresses, it comes only in super-king size, so your bed and room will need to be suitably spacious.Best for motion isolationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSimba Hybrid Pro, double£1,199 at SimbaZip and linkView image in fullscreenSealy Redcliffe Backcare Zipand Link, super king£849.99 at Bensons for BedsGetting in and out of bed can be uncomfortable if you experience back pain, especially if the edges of your mattress aren’t supportive enough. A strong mattress perimeter, such as the reinforced edge of the Millbrook Wool and the Origin Hybrid Pro (both above), provides a stable frame that can help prevent putting strain on your back. Strong edges also support your spine consistently if you move around in your sleep, and help prevent the mattress from sagging.Don’t throw out your mattress (yet)If you’ve done the spinal alignment test on your own mattress and found it’s too firm for your poor back, don’t throw it out. Provided the mattress is in generally good condition and not lumpy, you can strap amattress topperon it to add a comfort layer that cushions your pressure points and lets your back muscles relax while you sleep.I found the Simba Hybrid Topper particularly good for this. Attached to a firm Sealy mattress, it added just enough cushioning to help my pressure points sink in and allow my spine to align.Best topperView image in fullscreenSimba Hybrid topper, double£349 at SimbaA mattress that’s too soft for an aligned spine, however, will need to go to the spare room or charity shop, because it’s doing your back no good at all.

Traditionally served on Sundays, it’s now on menus every day of the week, but it’s also worth saving for a special occasion.Prep10 minSoakOvernightCook2 hrRest10 min+Serves6200g dried kidney beans, soaked overnight (see step 1)1 garlic cloveSalt1 onion180g smoked bacon lardons, or thick-cut bacon rashers (optional)400g long-grain rice(see step 6)400ml coconut milk¼ tsp ground allspice2 fresh thyme sprigs1 scotch bonnet chilli2 tsp butter, or coconut oil (optional)1 A note on the peasIn Jamaica, red peas, otherwise known as kidney beans, are the default choice, because they help give the rice its characteristic colour and sweet, slightly earthy flavour. In the privacy of your own kitchen, however, you could really use any dried pulses you like: black beans, for example, work very well, as do pigeon (gungo) or black-eyed peas. If you mix varieties, cook them separately.2 Dried and soaked, or tinned?You can use tinned beans, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you find yourself in a carb-based emergency, because the bean cooking water seasons the entire dish. In such an emergency, start at step 5 and add the tinned beans, preferably with the liquid from the can to help with the flavour, at the same time as the rice.View image in fullscreen3 Cook the beansDrain the soaked beans and put them in a large saucepan with a litre of water. Peel and squash the garlic, and add to the pot with a teaspoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil, maintain that for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer until the beans are just tender but not mushy – depending on the age of your beans, this will take anything between one and two hours.View image in fullscreen4 Or use a pressure cookerAlternatively, cook the beans in a pressure cooker, adding water to cover by a couple of centimetres and a dash of oil, as well as the garlic and salt. Bring to pressure, cook for two minutes, then take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes. Release, drain and repeat, this time cooking them for seven minutes, then allow the pressure to release naturally (for these timings, I’m indebted to Catherine Phipps’ excellent bookModern Pressure Cooking).5 Prep the onion and optional baconMeanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion and dice the bacon, if using. Should you prefer to keep this meat-free, simply leave out the latter, though, if you do so, I’d be inclined to add a spoonful of soy sauce or a pinch of MSG at the end, to replicate those savoury flavours; I’d also urge you not to skip the extra butter or oil.View image in fullscreen6 Prep the riceOnce the beans are ready, add the onion and bacon, if using, to the bean pot and leave to cook for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the rice well in cold water, until the water runs clear. If you prefer, use long-grain brown rice, but increase the cooking time in line with the packet instructions. (More perfumed basmati or jasmine varieties will work here, too, but they’ll lose the fragrance.)View image in fullscreen7 Flavour the beans, then add the riceStir the coconut milk and allspice into the bean mix, then add the rice and push the thyme and whole chilli (prick it a couple of times with a fork first, if you like, so it imparts more heat) into the rice. Add the fat, if using – and you absolutely should, unless you’re serving this with something very rich. The liquid should at this point come about 3cm above the level of the rice.View image in fullscreen8 Cover and simmerSeason lightly, and remember that the beans and bacon are both salty. Bring to a simmer, then cover tightly, turn the heat right down and leave to cook undisturbed for 20 minutes (or according to packet instructions, if different). Take off the heat and leave to stand, still covered, for 10 minutes.9 Finishing touchesLift out and discard the chilli, garlic and thyme. Fluff up the rice with a fork, then season to taste. Rice and peas is delicious with grilled or roast meat, fish or plantains, and even on its own with a crunchy salad. Refrigerate or freeze any leftovers immediately. Thaw before reheating with a splash of water in a microwave or a hot pan.View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassBeans, pulses and legumesRiceCaribbean food and drinkSide dishesMain coursePorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can a well-loved Peckham restaurant really relocate to fancy-pants Marylebone and retain its homespun charm? And, what is a “Kudu kit kat”, and could it even remotely capture the joys of my red-wrappered, lifelong support system? The KitKat is, after all, a design classic, so tampering with it makes me uneasy.Within moments of being seated, however, another question arose: how many miles do you need to run to counteract the aftereffects of Kudu’s bread with curried butter, which comes melted, glossy and with gently fried curried leaves? Grab hunks of this warm bread and stuff them greedily into your mouth. It’s an eat-as-if-no-one’s watching kind of starter, which went down well in Peckham, but in Marylebone, the women wear white trouser suits and pale, unspongeable fabrics, so let’s hope there’s a good dry cleaner close by.View image in fullscreenMore than one passerby mouths appreciative things about my grilled peri peri tiger prawns – at Kudu, London W1.Kudu’s previous incarnation certainly planted a flag for South African cuisine, favouringbraaicookery, biltong scratchings and an extensive South African wine list. Here, in its posh new second life, expect more of that earthy, live-fire approach. A piece of confit trout off the braai was reallyverygood: crisp, well-seasoned skin, melting flakes and a host of sea veg and pickles. We ate it with a side of rich, crisp beef-fat fingerling potatoes. Meanwhile, the braai pork chop – a whopper – comes with “monkey gland” sauce and more pickles. Fear not: no monkeys were harmed during the making of this sauce, so please do not converge on W1 brandishing angry banners (it’s actually a sort of dark-brown, sharp but sweet chutney-ketchup hybrid with garlic and Worcestershire sauce).While the decor of this new space sets out its stall as South African, this is definitely not a themed restaurant. The lighting is campfire twinkly, and the vibe sexy safari chic. It’s soft and plush, with an abundance of mirrors and textured pink and peach surfaces. There are shimmering green tiles around the open braai, and tasteful murals of scampering antelopes. In fact, it may well be London’s prettiest restaurant of 2025 so far. Still, Kudu’s move will not please everyone, because in the process not only did Peckham lose the restaurant Kudu, but also three other ventures: Kudu Grill, Smokey Kudu and Curious Kudu were closed, too, or rather amalgamated into this bright, twinkly turbo-Kudu. Was this a risk? Absolutely.View image in fullscreenKudu’s ‘reallyverygood’ confit trout braai.Still, on the Sunday lunchtime of the third week of opening, Kudu Marylebone seems to have hit the ground running. Folk loiter by the door, sniffing around for a cancellation, and while we sit in our window seat nibbling on charred sugar snaps in a rich walnut sauce, more than one passer-by approaches the glass, peers inside and mouths appreciative things about the look of my braai king prawns with a peri peri sauce that was perhaps a bit too subtle after that curry butter. Kudu clearly has kerb appeal, even if I occasionally felt a bit like a baboon at Regent’s Park zoo.Lunch began with an instruction from our server that the bread was a must-order, or chef-patron Patrick Williams would be offended. It was a joke, obviously … or was it? We complied, and soon a pan of warm bread appeared with that aforementioned vat of curried butter; other options feature house-cured bacon and shrimp butter with almonds. Bread and butter is undoubtedly one of the loveliest mouthfuls on God’s great earth, and here I’ve found a new way to enjoy it. We ordered a round of smoked prawn crullers, which were itsy-bitsy, posh 1970s dinner-party tarts filled with prawns, miso and pickled shallots.View image in fullscreenDelicious, but nothing like a KitKat: that Kudu kit kat dessert.Considering this was a Sunday in late summer, the vibe was nothing short of buzzy: old Kudu customers turned up with children and grandparents, and copious rounds of Kalahari biltong were ordered alongside trays of Saffa Ritas (tequila, chilli,Supasawaand Cointreau). Having grown up sighing my way through British Methodist church-based Sundays, I always feel a bit uneasy when I see people enjoying their late weekend – in this instance with black bream withzhougbutter rotis and large glasses of cold Zwartland white – when they should be indoors watchingHarry Secombe’s Highway, seeking out a Viennetta and worrying about Monday.The Kudu kit kat, by the way, is a bowl of rich chocolate mousse with sweet kumquats and foamy marshmallows, toasted tableside with a chic set of hot irons, as if we were camping in the wilds of the Kruger national park. It was absolutely nothing like a KitKat, but I was wholly on board and happy to push my boundaries. Kudu is already a delight, and the best of luck with getting a table. Marylebone’s wildlife is circling, and they’re ready for dinner.Kudu7 Moxon Street, London W1, 020-3393 6330. Open all week, lunch noon-3pm (Sat 10am-3pm, Sun 11.30am-3pm), dinner 6-10pm (Sun 6-9pm).

Would a string of dates with French men bring back my joie de vivre?I was working 80-hour weeks and having no luck on the New York singles scene. A move to Europe opened my mind – and helped me find love in the most unexpected placeJuhea KimSun 5 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShare“Tu es où?” I texted, peeking out the balcony to see if he was near. I checked my lipstick in the mirror over the mantelpiece. Then fretted whether my kindergarten-level French was off-putting.“I’m coming,” he texted. And before I could wonder about inviting a strange man to my home for a first date in a foreign country, Thomas knocked. Soon after we exchangedla biseand he took off his layers of winter gear, I realised he was even more attractive than his Tinder photos, with messy blond hair and a glimpse of ultra-defined abs. While fetching wine as insouciantly as I could, inside my head I was screaming: “The plan is working!”I had hatched it in fall of 2018, burned out from nearly a decade of living in New York. I’d been working full-time as an editor and writing my novel at night and on weekends for three years. I pushed myself so hard that my schedule was written in my diary in 10-minute increments. On Friday evenings, I came home and lugged an Ikea bag of dirty clothes to the coin laundromat. After bringing it back up the five flights of stairs, I’d yet again open the manuscript file that I knew, statistically, may never get published. Meanwhile, my peers were moving up the ladder, getting married and buying fancy flats with basic appliances. At 31, I felt I had nothing to show for it.New York men – or at least the ones I dated – seemed to think that, if they were more than 6ft tall and in finance or law, they were masters of the universeI was also effectively celibate: not only because of busyness, but because my ex and I kept seeing each other once a week for dinner and Netflix. David was the first guy who talked to me the first night I went out after moving to New York, when I was 22. Although we broke up six years later, he re-infiltrated my life one friendly dinner at a time until we always found ourselves on the opposite ends of his couch, groaning companionably at Game of Thrones. As comforting as that ritual was, I didn’t want to be best friends with my ex while having no sex for the rest of my life.The few times I played around with Tinder only crushed my confidence further.Datinghad changed since I was last in the scene, in the dinosaur era when people actually talked to one another in bars. New York men – or at least the ones I dated – seemed to think that, if they were more than 6ft tall and in finance or law, they were masters of the universe. There was zero effort, let alone courtship and romance. I wasn’t the only one feeling offended, because my friends and I shared detailed notes, and it was as if all the singles in the city were in a competition to see who could care less. Something needed to change, drastically.One day, I was organising my bookshelves when an old art history textbook stopped me in my tracks. The cover of Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, 11th edition, Vol 1 features a closeup of a medieval illumination in gold and lapis lazuli. It brought back my days spent in the library, poring over the colour plates of reliquaries and writing about the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries in the Musée de Cluny; when a book presuming to explain “the beginning of art” and its evolution through human history felt meaningful and worthwhile. All those serious discussions and dreams my friends and I had about beauty and truth. My heart ached.I decided then that I would quit my job, move out of New York, park all my stuff at my parents’ house in Portland, Oregon, and live in France for three months. Of course, a veritable fleet of authors have absconded from the US to France over the decades – Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Henry James, Baldwin, Steinbeck, not to mention countless minor bards; perhaps following in their footsteps could help me become a “real writer”. I’d stay one month each in three different cities (Grenoble for the mountains, Nice for the sea, and Paris for Paris), relearn French and see all the art that I’d only studied in photographs. I would hike in the Alps and swim in the Mediterranean. And if this put me in the path of beautiful French men, so be it! Surely, there’d be no better cure to my burnout (and dry spell) than heading off on an adventure to a country that has a patent on kissing.These dreamy visions drew only a mild reaction from my friends. They say you aren’t a New Yorker until you’ve lived there for 10 years, and nearing the mark, my exhausted cohort had already been fleeing for better lifestyles in Budapest, Amsterdam, California. They did wish me a speedy recovery from NYC dating with sexy French men; they’d all dated one or two, and the consensus was that “Frenchies” in New York were “weirder” than those in their homeland but “hot” compared with many other options. I left such discussions out of the phone call with my parents. Long worried about my 80-hour weeks and frequent illnesses, they welcomed my decision to prioritise my mental and physical health. And that was what most excited me: I was proud that I could afford to take care of myself. To regain joie de vivre and figure out where my life was headed, professionally and personally, was the plan.That first night with Thomas went so according to plan that I thought I blew it – that he’d never want to see me again. But before our clothes came off, we’d spread out a map and discussed the trails, and he’d promised to take me on a hike. The next day, used to being disappointed by fickle American men, I messaged Thomas. Was he really going to show me his favourite trail?“Yes, don’t worry,” he texted back within seconds.Thomas was much more romantic than I’d expected. He held my hand, complimented my every outfit, cooked dinner for meHe was as good as his word. A few nights later, we drove to a trailhead in the Chartreuse mountains. After climbing up the snowy trail in the dark, the city of Grenoble lay shimmering beneath our feet. I tried my best to live up to the romance of the situation, but I couldn’t banter in French, let alone understand five sentences without interjecting, “Pardon?” I would have been driven mad by such an incompetent conversationalist back home, and it pained me that I couldn’t show him my true self. (As a professional athlete who was never academically inclined, Thomas almost took pride in speaking zero English.) So, as days passed, I tried to avoid getting too emotionally invested by hiking alone in the mountains. Once, I even struggled for hours through a trail buried under a foot of snow. I thought this was great: without signal, I could get lost and die, but at least I wouldn’t be able to check my phone to see if he’d texted.Despite my anxieties, Thomas was much more patient and romantic than I’d expected. He held my hand when we walked outside; he complimented my every outfit. Unlike the American men I’d dated, he wasn’t afraid of appearing to care or making a woman feel too cherished. He cooked dinner for me, a few nights before I was to leave for Nice. In the US, you never cook for someone you’re just casually seeing. I knew the rules were different in France, but I was nonetheless touched. As he was driving me home, I said to him in French:“I’m so happy we met. Because when I first came here, I was …”“Triste?” Thomas said. Yes, I’d been depressed, although I’d never admitted that even to myself.“I’m going to speak French fluently in a year. You’ll see, I’m coming back!” I continued to babble.“Don’t change anything. You’re perfect,” he said, taking my face in his hands.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon Webb/The GuardianHe promised to visit me in Paris, where I would spend my third month. He had friends there, he said, one of whom also “had an Asian girlfriend”. In that moment, all the times leery non-Asian men abruptly told me about their Asian wives, friends’ wives or exes flashed before my eyes as if I was about to die. They seemed to think that if I only knew another Asian woman had once upon a time desired them, I would suddenly see them as thrilling sexual possibilities. But a lifetime of experience had honed my ability to judge such gaffes, and sometimes these were honest mistakes. Thomas had not dated outside his culture before, and he’d never shown other signs of fetishising certain races. If I had a friend with a French boyfriend, I would probably mention that to Thomas if we were to all meet. (And my girlfriends and I had called Frenchmen “sexy” plenty of times, although tastefully behind their backs.) So I let it go – and even became thrilled that he was going to introduce me to his friends.The next morning, I woke up still dazed by the bittersweetness of liking someone I couldn’t have. But when I logged on to Tinder to save Thomas’s photos, I noticed that he’d just added a new picture to refresh his profile. I was more hurt than I imagined possible. Was I naive to think that he should have waited until I was at least out of town? When Thomas said he’d like to say goodbye one last time, I made an excuse about feeling unwell and left the next morning.In Nice, I brooded over Thomas while walking up and down the Baie des Anges, a dreamlike crescent holding a topaz piece of the Mediterranean. I realised I’d had my first crush in years – and that was something to celebrate, no matter what. Besides, I had to set aside any drama because I’d invited my parents to visit me. This was their first time in not only France, but Europe, and I was anxious to show them a culture I love – and for them to feel welcomed.There is a popular perception that the French are cold or unwelcoming to foreigners. Thus far, the French people I’d met had only been warm and genuine towards me. They humoured me with conversations (always in French) in shops, restaurants, monuments; if I seemed lost or lonely, they took me under their wing. They responded enthusiastically whenever I said I’m anaméricano-coréenne– which, as a bonus, also made me feel like a delicious coffee drink. Nevertheless, an entire lifetime of protecting my parents had taught me that a young bilingual Korean woman receives a very different treatment from her elderly parents who don’t speak fluent English. But my worry proved unnecessary. People were kind and patient wherever I took them. It was lovely to be able to share all the places in France I’d saved up as my highlights reel.I found myself feeling grateful that the French were so polite to foreigners; but after my parents left, there was an incident that made me rethink this. In my last few days in Nice, I was waiting in a queue to buy some socca (a delectable chickpea pancake) at an old flower market called Cours Saleya. The crowd had gathered loosely, and as they neared the griddle they narrowed and straightened into a line. I also tried to queue correctly and ceded my spot to an older woman near me. But to my amazement, she signalled that I should go in front of her. When I thanked her profusely, she said, “C’est normal.” This simple exchange was a revelation: as a naturalised citizen in the US and a visitor in France, I’d long lived with the assumption that things are just easier if I don’t take up as much space as “people who’d been here first”. But wasn’t it normal to take up space and relate to everyone as equal human beings, whether you’re a tourist, immigrant, or born citizen? This attitude of égalité was as deeply French as romance. And French people in general, with their decency and civility, were as important to restoring my faith in human connection as the men I dated.So, feeling more assured and grounded, I arrived in Paris for the last leg of my sabbatical, ready to date again. Gaëtan was a 32-year-old law professor who met me for cocktails at a speakeasy in Pigalle. He was the kind of man next to whom you’d be proud to be seen – tall, dark, handsome, well-dressed, lean and athletic.By now, my eye-watering efforts at French self-education had begun to pay off, because I got to know Gaëtan far better than Thomas. Immediate family? Not very close. Tight group of guy friends. Favourite author? Saint-Exupéry. Into social justice, which is why he went into banking law. Hadn’t been in a serious relationship in a year. Never stays in touch with his exes.I’d learned by then that romance wasn’t something French people reserve for their serious relationships. They understand that love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. And they play their parts wonderfully, although saying that makes them sound more disingenuous than they are. It’s that they truly enjoy not only the sentiment, but the sensation of love. So they jump in without weighing whether this person could become a long-term relationship, a lasting friendship, a useful professional connection. French women sometimes waved me over to their table just to keep me company; I didn’t become “real friends” with anyone, yet such moments brightened my near-constant solitude. Coming from New York, where interpersonal relationships had to have clear goals and fixed modules, this French attitude felt not just sensual, but liberating and humane.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This offered yet another stark contrast to the USAll this is to say that Gaëtan courted me as I hadn’t been in a long time. He took me to wine bars, authentic falafel joints and cocktail haunts in Le Marais, for sorbet in Parc Monceau heady with blooms. He listened to me as I talked about my dreams: my novel, journalism and a home of my own. This attentiveness was something I’d observed in other French people. They didn’t do that thing that is so common in the US, especially New York, where your interlocutor’s eyes look strange as you talk because they’re just thinking about what they’re going to say next. French people tended to really listen, and Gaëtan especially excelled at this.He even saw my being an artist as attractive, casting admiring glances at the manuscript pages strewn across my flat. In France, writers and intellectuals are held in the highest esteem; avid capitalists are frowned upon. This offered yet another stark contrast to the US. When the New York finance bachelors found out that I was a writer, they would say charming things such as, “So what are you, like afreelancer?” and “How much do you evenpayfor this apartment?”There was just once when Gaëtan lost a point for Team France, and that was when I invited him over for dinner. I asked him how he had enjoyed my pasta, and he went into a long discussion of how it could be made better. To the anglophone world, it is obvious that I was expecting, “Delicious, thank you!” and not a critical review of my one-pan effort. This is the one thing in which American men will beat the suave French men, 10 out of 10.View image in fullscreenJuhea Kim at the Château de Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris.Photograph: Courtesy of Juhea KimNear the end of my stay, I asked Gaëtan what was his favourite place in Paris. It was Château de Vincennes, a medieval fortress on the eastern outskirts; as a child, he used to go there and play at being a knight. He promised to take me that weekend. But when the appointed day arrived, he texted to say he was sick, he couldn’t make it. I’d already gone out in a dress I’d bought to wear just for him. Instead of returning home, I took the train to Vincennes and wandered around the ramparts alone. Was I again projecting my wish for intimacy on to someone who wasn’t feeling the same? How much of the closeness was lost, or imagined, in translation?But a few days later, Gaëtan made up for his absence by taking me to Le Très Particulier, a secret cocktail bar in an unspeakably stylish hotel on top of Montmartre. We made our way to the garden, where the Eiffel Tower came magically into view.“You could stay with me, next time you come to France,” he said.“Really?”“Really. When are you going to come back – in three years?”“No! Closer to a year,” I said, then added, “maybe even in six months.”We kissed.“But I thought you never keep in touch with your exes?” I asked.“You’re not really an ex.”Gaëtan was also as good as his word, texting me periodically as I settled down in Portland. The day I moved into my own condo (with washer, dryer, dishwasher – the holy trinity), I’d been wishing I could show him the place when he messaged me out of the blue. He approved of my pictures and said, “You’ve really done everything you said you’ll do!” I told him he was welcome to stay with me if he ever visited. He answered, “I will.”Then not very dramatically – quite naturally – he met someone new in Paris, and that was the end of that.A few months later, myrealex David came to visit me. Despite swearing beforehand that this did not mean we were getting back together, the first thing he did when he arrived was tell me he loved me. The beautiful French men could romance me to the moon and back, but couldn’t wait a year, six months, or even a day for me. David had waited four years. Dancing the choreography of desireà lafrançaisewas intoxicating while it lasted, but here was a man who didn’t need the music to stay with me. He wanted tobewith me.I feel sheepish revealing here that Reader, I married him. This gives the illusion of a happy ending to a still-developing story of us learning a lot about ourselves and each other. But that’s why this is called marriage and not romance. The fact that David took my hand and jumped feet first into this sea of unknown depth makes my heart ache as I type this. I suppose it was necessary for me to travel thousands of miles to discover that my biggest adventure was waiting for me, at home.Having said that, I think that the plan “worked”. I improved my French and finished my first novel. I saw art: a breathtaking Chagall exhibit at Caumont Centre d’Art in Aix-en-Provence, the stained-glass windows of Notre Dame before the fire, all the wings of the Louvre. And most importantly, I met people who reawakened my sense of joy and love.But many of the happiest moments happened when I was utterly alone: walking under a snowy ridge in the Alps, sunbathing in the Cape of Nice, or wandering the medieval streets in Annecy. Exploring Château de Vincennes alone, wearing a white broderie anglaise dress that made passersby wonder if I had just got married, I climbed to the top of the tower and asked someone to take a photo of me. It now hangs in my bedroom. Every time I look at it – my gaze off-camera, my smile at the cusp of both happiness and loneliness – I’m reminded of all those who stand just outside the frame, whose fleeting entries and exits have nonetheless formed the great peaks of my existence.City of Night Birds by Juhea Kim is out now in paperback (Oneworld), priced £9.99.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 5 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareSarah, 37I’ve never loved sex. Growing up, I felt broken because everyone put it on a pedestalThe only thing that Cameron and I have ever been at odds about is our sex life. When we met nine years ago we were in our late 20s, and sex was definitely something that he wanted more frequently than me. After about six months of dating we decided to try an open arrangement so that Cameron could pursue people who are more sexual than I am.There were feelings of jealousy at first, but our relationship was strengthened because we had such strong communication, and I grew to feel really secure in our bond. It’s been a huge blessing for us, because I’ve never loved sex. Growing up, I felt broken because everyone else put it on a pedestal, but I never really understood what was so great about it.When I stumbled across a book about asexuality on social media in 2021, it was like looking in a mirror. I was shocked, because at that time I considered myself a sexual person – I like to masturbate, and I’d had a fair amount of sex in my 20s. But I think I had a lot of that sex because I felt guilty – a hangover of being a teenager in a society that tells us you have to please your man.It’s not that I have a sexual desire, but there are other reasons to have sex, like wanting to be close to someoneWhat the book taught me was that asexuality is a broad spectrum. For example, I don’t have sexual desire, even for people who I find very aesthetically pleasing. I appreciate how they look, but I don’t want to have sex with them. But I do like having orgasms. To me, it’s fun and it’s a nice release – a way to clear out all the thoughts in my head.It was very freeing to tell Cameron that I am asexual. He accepts it. We do still have sex, because I feel intense intimacy and closeness to him when we do, and I am making the conscious decision when I want to connect with him in that way. It’s not that I have a sexual desire, but there are other reasons to have sex, like wanting to be close to someone. I see how much he enjoys it, and that gives me pleasure. In the same way that someone who is not asexual can decide to be celibate, I can decide to have sex for other reasons than being turned on.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

That started to really change when I met Sarah, because sex wasn’t the most important thing in our relationship.With Sarah, I began seeing more value in other parts of myself, and it de-prioritised sex. I don’t want to have sex with anyone else now either. If I ever feel like having sex, there are other ways I can handle it. Masturbation is one, but it can also be a long walk, thinking about what’s on my mind or watercolour painting.Sarah’s asexuality has just expanded the idea of what our relationship means. It challenges you to think in different ways.When Sarah discovered her asexuality, I began to realise that attraction is more about emotional connection. That can come through sex, but also through different forms that are equally worthy and satisfying. I had a specific idea of what asexuality was – if you didn’t have sex, you didn’t ever have sexual feelings. But it’s a spectrum, and it takes time to figure out where you stand on it.We’ve been together for nine years, and just because sex isn’t a priority doesn’t mean that romance isn’t. Making specific time for that is really essential for us. Sometimes we’ll get these adult Lego sets and do them a little bit every morning, which feels really intimate. Or we’ll have a date night and go out for a mocktail and a pizza. We cuddle and make plans for the future, which is a form of care. I get a lot of pleasure from cooking for other people, and it makes me really happy in a kind of afterglow of sex way.Sarah’s asexuality has just expanded the idea of what our relationship means. It’s like limiting the tools you have to work with – you have to be more creative with what you have. It challenges you to think in different ways. But it didn’t diminish the love that I had for her at all.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And they can be dangerousShane HickeySun 5 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 02.01 EDTShareEnergy bills are on the rise and winter is coming. The solution? How about a plug-in box which promises to save you money by making household appliances work more efficiently. Or maybe you can drive down your usage by putting in a “voltage regulator” that can cut your costs by almost a third.The reality is that, at best, these “energy-saving plugs” or “eco plugs” will do nothing apart from bill you for a useless piece of plastic. At worst, they are dangerous and won’t even pass basic electrical safety standards.This time of year, when the cost of energy is at the forefront of people’s mind, is when people are pushed with any number of scams linked to their bills. This could be a fake energy rebate text message, a message claiming you need toapply for a governmentpayout, or criminals knocking on the front door claiming to be from the regulator Ofgem and that they need to update your details.‘I can’t meet, I’m on an oil rig’: the signs it might be a romance fraudRead moreDevices that plug in to your sockets and claim to affect the flow of electricity could do much more physical damage, if you even get them in the post in the first place, says Siobhan Blagbrough, the financial crime manager at Ocean Finance.“These scams usually involve plug-in devices, magnetic meters, or ‘voltage regulators’ that claim to cut household bills by 30% or more. The marketing is slick, often coming with fake Trustpilot reviews or phoney ‘expert endorsements’, but the devices either do nothing or can actually be unsafe,” she says.“Some victims hand over hundreds for a gadget that never arrives. Others get a cheap, unsafe electrical item that can overheat or cause fires. In the worst cases, criminals use the purchase process to harvest card details for further fraud.”The plug-in devices are sold for less than £10 and often claim they will save you money by managing the electricity supply efficiently, therefore reducing your electricity bill.They are on sale widely online despite failing basic UK safety standards.The consumer group Which? reported a number of listings earlier this year, which were then removed. But almost identical devices emerged a few weeks later.View image in fullscreenScam victims are householders hoping to cut the cost of the electricity bills.Photograph: Jacob King/PA“If a device really could cut energy bills by hundreds of pounds, it would be sold by major retailers and recommended by trusted consumer groups. The fact that it’s being flogged on social media or through cold calls is the red flag,” says Blagbrough.What the scam looks likeThe devices are often labelled as “eco-plus” or “energy saving plugs” and are advertised and sold through social media or via cold calls. There may be fake endorsements attached to the adverts.Often, the sale is simply a scam and people will receive nothing after the payment goes through. Or the payment details may be used by the criminals selling them for other crimes.If the plastic devices do arrive, they often have poor-quality soldering, contain too much lead, and are potentially unsafe. A Which? investigation of some devices found the pins were often too short or snapped off easily.What to doBe wary of what you buy online, especially from ads on social media.If you see an ad which has a misleading claim or product, then report it to the platform it is being sold on and to your local trading standards office.“If you want to make your home more efficient, stick to proven measures like insulation, boiler tweaks, or smart thermostats” says Blagbrough.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchEnergy billsEnergy efficiencyConsumer affairsHousehold billsFamily financesCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Therapy is in critically short supply, with1.4 mental health workersfor every 100,000 people.Across Black communities, hairdressers have become a safe space, especially in communities with little or no access to mental health care – or quality healthcare in general.Bluemind Foundation, a nonprofit organisation working across Cameroon,Ivory Coastand Togo, has plugged into the hairdresser-client relationship through its Heal by Hair initiative. According to its founder, Marie-Alix de Putter, more than 400 hairdressers, including Tano, have been trained in the last two years to act as therapeutic first responders or “mental health ambassadors”, reaching more than 100,000 women. By 2030, de Putter hopes to reach more than 1,000 hairdressers in 20 countries.‘The trust is already there’It began with a love story that turned tragic. In 2012, while the de Putters were on a trip to her nativeCameroon, her husband was murdered. She became a widow while she was four months pregnant. The case remains unsolved.“I spent my first night as a widow with my hairdresser,” she said. “She was the one I trusted the most that night because you’re just surrounded by people and you don’t know who could have done this … so we had this relationship where every week she would come and do my hair [initially] at home and listen.”Inspired by her personal story, the foundation conducted a 2021 study across seven Francophone countries: 77 % of responders confessed to confiding in their hairdressers, and more than 90% of hairdressers said their clients had sought their counsel.“We just connected the trust that women are already giving to their hairdressers with the tools,” she said. The first training took place in April 2022.The programme is structured around a free, intensive three-day training with psychiatrists and mental health experts who teach the women about active listening, gender-based violence and signs of depression – as well as psychology theories. Afterwards, they are evaluated before receiving a certificate.“The training went very well … I got my diploma and this,” said another hairdresser, Thérèse Gueu, as she reached for a psychology textbook on a shelf in her salon in the working-class neighbourhood of Abobo.View image in fullscreenThérèse Gueu.Photograph: Fall Aicha/The GuardianOver six months, trainees are supported through peer groups and access to a psychological referral system. When a client shares deeper troubles, hairdressers refer their clients to professional psychologists, or in cases of domestic violence, to the police. Many still bristle at the thought of either, citing financial and societal costs of doing so in a conservative region where one in three people live in extreme poverty.Initially, funding for the programme came mostly from de Putter’s savings, but private donors and agencies like France’s Development Innovation Fund now chip in. Nevertheless, the resources remain small for the amount of work facing the foundation’s small team of 17 paid staff and about 100 volunteers.Their work has yielded stories of joy and healing: inTogo, one trainee hired someone who had been in a psychiatric hospital, offering social rehabilitation.“Often when you’ve been sick and you’ve been hospitalised, people say you’re crazy,” said de Putter. “So if you have a job and someone who accepts to train you, you get out of the taboo.”One hairdresser left her home because she was a victim of violence, but now helps people. In some communities, hairdressers say a few men have started reaching out for counsel too.Among the hairdressers, there is a general sense of fulfilment over their emergence as a form of emotional support in their communities. “[When] people come to explain their problems to me, it’s a pride for me too because I know that I am an ear for someone,” said Gueu. “I tell myself that we all need someone.”“For many of these women, it’s their first recognition as a leader in their community and a protector,” said de Putter. “These women are saying to us: ‘Before I was just doing hair, now I do healing.’”Explore more on these topicsAfricaMental healthHealthCameroonIvory CoastTogofeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it was that at the end of an autumn day I found myself with a not unpleasant question: where to head to soothe bones still aching for a last splash of summer sun. For Athens offers something that other European cities cannot: a coastline of more than 40 miles dotted with beaches many a Greek island would covet.Out of season, the shores of Attica still have a magnetic allure, as I discovered when swimming into a fading sun across thebay of Vouliagmeni. For those seeking rejuvenation in marine blue waters primed to turn orange pink as the sun sets, bathing off one of the Riviera’s public or private beaches does not disappoint.With sea salt still clinging to my skin, I sat atSardelaki,a tavern whose Mediterranean fare is as good as the spectacular view of the bay it sits on. In a nod to times past, the meze is served on large wooden trays.View image in fullscreenVouliagmeni beach, south of Athens.Photograph: Geopix/AlamyAthens is as celebrated for its hills as its coastline: natural elevations within view of the Acropolis that make it a treasure trove for amblers when temperatures are cooler. For those who want to escape a metropolis that sprawls across almost 200 square miles, these rocky outcrops – bearers of fabulous names such as the Hill of the Nymphs and the Hill of the Muses – are a must.In my view, this ancient capital is Europe’s most soulful and sublimeIn my view, this ancient capital is also Europe’s most soulful and sublime. If you reach the top of Mount Lycabettus, the city’s highest point, either by foot or on the funicular rail car, the reward is a spectacular vista of the entire Argo-Saronic Gulf and the islands beyond.If you want to stay centrally, the ancient Plaka district remains the best base. The old-schoolAdrianhotel has doubles looking on to the northern face of the Acropolis from about £120 B&B. In the same area,Zorbasis a favourite restaurant with locals and serves the most succulent lamb chops. With views of the Acropolis, Athens’ rooftop restaurants are wonderfully atmospheric and perfect for warm autumn evenings – for a real treat head toKuzinaor the Michelin‑starredMacris.Helena SmithPalermoView image in fullscreenA 16th-century sculpture at the fountain of Piazza Pretoria.Photograph: Paul Williams/AlamyThink Neapolitan margherita is the last word in pizza? Think again. In Palermo they prefersfincione, a soft, well-risen rectangle of dough topped with intense, onion-heavy tomato sauce and sprinkled withcaciocavallocheese and oregano. Savoury, filling and comforting, it’s sold in bakeries, kiosks and carts all over the city (Via Maqueda in the historic centre usually has several vendors).We try it at a kiosk on Piazza della Kalsa, near where we’re staying.Panineria Chiluzzooften has long queues, but they move quickly as young staff dish out slices ofsfincione, as well as arancini andpanelle(chickpea fritters). There are a few tables under the trees outside, but we eat as we walk into town along narrow Via Alloro. This is a pleasant stroll in October but wouldn’t always be. As heatwaves rolled over Europe this year, temperatures in Palermo topped 40C in the shade. At the end of July one sunbaked cornerhit a record 70Cat ground level.We wander the city and savour how its long history is written in its streetsNow, as temperatures creep to 24C by mid-afternoon, we can wander the city and savour how its long history is written in its streets. Passing baroque and art nouveau palaces, andCasa Stagnitta, the city’s oldest coffee roastery, we take in the Arab-Norman domes of the 12th-century church of San Cataldo; Piazza Pretoria, with its 16th-century fountain, installed under Spanish rule; and the impressive cathedral, built on the location of a ninth-century mosque.View image in fullscreenThe 12th-century Church of San Cataldo (foreground, left) in Palermo.Photograph: Sean Pavone/AlamyOn the way back we detour to Vucciria market, the origins of which also stretch back over 1,000 years. Some decry its touristification, but it is still noisy and brilliantly theatrical. Feeling brave, we stop for a traditionalpani câ meusa(spleen roll), which is surprisingly OK, with its slightly sweet “meat” set off by grated cheese. The stallholder is particularly proud of his grilled goat’s intestines but, I’m sorry, no amount of salt and lemon can make those a treat for me.We’re glad to head back to quieter La Kalsa, the former Arab quarter to the east, which was bombed in the second world war and languished for decades before being revitalised this century.Maison Butera(sea-view doubles from €161 B&B) is a four-room B&B with lots to see nearby. Up the street isPalazzo Butera,a 17th-century baroque pile restored and reopened in 2021 to house the Valsecchi art collection, which includes works by Gilbert & George and Andy Warhol.Next day we walk 10 minutes to Palermo’sBotanical Garden, with its record-breaking multi-trunk fig tree. Birds are singing their hearts out as the sun pours down. Soon we’ll be in London, the clocks will go back and winter will start. We relish a last week in the light.Liz BoulterViennaView image in fullscreenParks in Vienna are a colourful delight in autumn.Photograph: Rusm/Getty ImagesWhile lamenting the end of summer and hanging out at beach bars and bathing spots on the tributaries of the Danube, I’m now chasing a new hue. Vienna isa city of parks and manicured gardens, meadow sweeps and woodland belts, which swap their emerald halo for a rusty amber and ochre glow the Austrians callGoldener Herbst(golden autumn).I leave behind the grandiose architecture and cobblestones of the historic centre. South-west of it, Schloss Schönbrunn Park splays from the grand Habsburg summer residence, where the gilt isn’t reserved for the interior, and makes its way into corridors of towering bronzed hedgerows and arched tree terraces that lead to the butter-yellow palace.To the east, in the city’s Prater Park, I stroll beneath the chestnut trees of the Hauptallee, an avenue that’s almost three miles long and centuries-old. On the edge of the park, the retro-styledSuperbude Prater hotel(doubles from €78 B&B) is a perfectly placed retreat.View image in fullscreenSuperbude hotel, ViennaIn a city with hundreds of urban farms (thanks to a long-standing commitment to promoting green spaces and fostering community spirit), autumn brings a feast of fresh produce on menus.Pumpkin cream soup is the seasonal staple – best devoured in a wood-panelledBeisl(Viennese gastropub) such as the art-splashedAm Nordpol 3– and followed with a Wiener Schnitzel.Vienna is a city of parks and gardens that swap their emerald halo for a rusty amber and ochre glowUnbeknown to many, Vienna is the only European capital to grow wine within its city limits, with 700 hectares (1,723 acres) of vineyards.

The sun mellows, green leaves drain to golden, and a cuisine that’s all about comfort food really comes into its own. Even the Hungarian word for autumn –őszi– has a cosy, laid-back sound to it.That’s not to say it’s a place to hunker down. Few capitals are better suited to walking, and early autumn promises a Goldilocks sweet spot of temperatures, neither too hot nor too cold. It’s a joy to wander the cobbled streets of the Castle District without sidestepping tourists, to follow the Danube promenade without melting, and to meander among whisky-coloured trees on Margaret Island.Many of the five-star hotels – such as the wonderfully styled Kimpton BEM and the Dorothea Hotel, with its oasis of a courtyard restaurant – offer affordable shoulder-season deals. But if you don’t need heaps of facilities, tryGiselle Vintage Doubles(doubles from €87 room-only), an 18th-century royal mansion near Elizabeth Bridge brimming with yesteryear elegance that is surprisingly light on the wallet.View image in fullscreenHouse of Music in Budapest’s City Park offers a journey through the country’s musical heritage.Photograph: E Fesenko/AlamyFrom here, Budapest is your oyster.

In the 1960s, the UK prime minister tried to blame the “gnomes of Zurich” for the pathetic performance of the British pound, and more than 60 years on, some misguided Britons still think of Switzerland’s biggest city as a boring financial destination. They couldn’t be more wrong. Banking is still a major industry, but the city’s tidy, tree-lined streets are full of people having fun.I’ve been to Zurich more times than I can count, and like it more with each visit. For first timers, the big surprise is the vast and lovely Zürichsee (Lake Zurich), two miles wide, 25 miles long and crisscrossed all day by antique ferries. Wherever you are around town, you’re never far from water.When the trees turn golden brown, this compact metropolis looks especially prettyAnother nice surprise is the abundance of fine art. Zurich’s palatialKunsthausis one of Europe’s great art galleries (check out the sleek new extension by British starchitect David Chipperfield), but there are also loads of smaller commercial galleries, especially in Zurich West, a former industrial quarter that’s become the city’s new creative hub.Stay at25 Hours Zurich West(from 230 Swiss francs/£214 room-only), a funky bolthole in the beating heart of this rejuvenated district or the new coolMama Shelter(from £175 room-only), which opened in the lively Oerlikon area this summer with a garden terrace overlooking the city and a stylish bar and restaurant.View image in fullscreenThe interior of Cabaret Voltaire, where dadaism started.Photograph: Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH/AlamyZurich has always been a magnet for creatives and eccentrics. James Joyce wrote much of Ulysses here (his grave is in Zurich’s Fluntern cemetery) and his favourite haunt, the chicCafé Odeon,is still going strong. The place that sums up Zurich’s rebellious streak isCabaret Voltaire, the anarchic nightclub where dadaism, the multifaceted modern art movement, was born. The building is still a gallery and performance space, as well as a museum.When the trees turn golden brown, this compact metropolis looks especially pretty. The best views are from the summit of Uetliberg, on the leafy edge of town. The Uetlibergbahn, Zurich’s mountain railway (which reopens on 5 October after a major refurbishment) takes you within a short walk of the summit.TheZurich film festivalis the one of the autumn highlights, but the most atmospheric spectacle is on the water. From 30 Oct-13 Nov, Zurich’s fleet of pleasure boats hosts the 70thExpovina Weinschiffe, the city’s annual wine fair. Anyone can buy a ticket (from £28) to go onboard and sample a huge range of wines from dozens of different countries (Switzerland’s crisp light whites are seriously underrated). If you’d rather drink beer, head toBierwerk Züri, a fashionable modern brewery with a youthful clientele.New restaurants are opening all the time, but my go-tos have both been around for ages and never seem to change. For traditional Swiss cuisine, you can’t beatAlpenrose, a homely historic hideaway a short tram ride from the city centre. For veggie cuisine,Haus Hiltlis a must. The decor is fairly modern and the menu is contemporary, but it was actually founded back in 1898, making it (by some accounts) the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the world.William CookLyonView image in fullscreenA spectacular view of Lyon.Photograph: Sander van der Werf/ShutterstockTraboules, Lyon’s secret passages, pass through houses and courtyards, joining one street to another, transporting curious walkers from the Renaissance to the modern via a stone staircase and gothic arcade.

It’s now part of theInstitut Lumière, which houses cinemas as well as the museum, and is the hub of the annualFestival Lumière. Films and cinematic events take place from 11-19 Oct, with almost 450 showings across the city, including two remastered 1920s silent movies by Victor Sjöström – Le Vent (The Wind)and La Charrette Fantôme (The Phantom Carriage) – accompanied by the National Orchestra of Lyon.Just before the start of winter, Lyon’sFête des Lumières(lights not the brothers) runs from 5-8 Dec. The city’s heritage buildings are illuminated, and light installations are set up in the squares and on the riverbank. I watch from Place Bellecour and then wander down to the water where locals place lanterns in their windows to celebrate solidarity and brace themselves for the cold.I stay at theFourvière Hôtel(doubles from €139 room-only), a former convent near the city’s Roman ruins, which has a heated indoor pool, restaurant and great views over the city.Jon BryantAccommodation prices correct at time of going to press.

Mum was still looking around when I offered to take the shopping back to the car, which was stuffed into a little red trolley. It was like a Mary Poppins bag – quite a small thing, but it was surprising how much you could load it up. Or so we thought.With the trolley heaving under the weight of an already full load of groceries, my mum rested a box of honeydew melons on top. She warned me to be careful getting it back to the car.All was going well as I weaved my way through the crowds of people, and out of the market. But as I was crossing the chaotically busy main intersection into the market, the trolley got stuck on the traffic island in the middle of the road, and the box of melons fell to the ground. They went flying, spectacularly tumbling out towards pedestrians and waiting cars.The kindness of strangers: a woman I’d never met heard we had flu and dropped a big pot of soup at our doorstepRead moreAs the little walking man changed from green to red, I was stunned, mouth agape, trying to process how I was going to collect the melons shooting in six different directions.Out of nowhere, a group of three or four older women came to my rescue. White hair, head scarves and one with a walking stick – they looked like they had stepped out of the same babushka doll. They weren’t deterred by the cars inching their way towards us. Utterly fearless, they just held up their hands to stop the traffic, in both directions. They collected all the melons for me, not missing a single one, as I fixed the box to hold them.I thanked them and they didn’t say a word, just smiled and waved me goodbye. I didn’t eat the melons – I was never a real fan of honeydew – but I tell this story all the time because I love it so much.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Or if you’d rather stay in, sip mulled wine as you take in a fantastic season of TVRachel DixonSun 5 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 05.11 EDTShareThe days are growing shorter, the weather is getting worse, summer holidays are a distant memory and Christmas is still ages away. There is no denying that October can be a depressing time of year in the UK – and then the clocks go back, and November is even more dark and dismal. But it doesn’t have to be that way! Here are 20 reasons to be cheerful this autumn.2025 is a spectacular year for autumn colour.Thanks to the long, hot summer, with below-average rainfall in many areas,Forestry England has said: “Signs point to a particularly vivid display of reds, oranges and golds in the nation’s forests, lasting well into November, especially in northern regions.” It clarifies that this is partly down to changing weather patterns due to the climate crisis, which is obviously no cause for celebration, but that is not to say we can’t enjoy “one of the most flamboyant autumn displays in recent years”. Hotspots to visit includeWestonbirt, the national arboretum, in Gloucestershire;Bedgebury Pinetumin Kent;Grizedale Forestin Cumbria; andKielder Forestin Northumberland. In the Wye Valley and the Forest of Dean, there is aleaf-peeping drivewith 10 scenic viewpoints. Failing that, just head to your nearest park.View image in fullscreenGo nuts … beech trees are expected to produce a bumper crop this year.Photograph: 717Images by Paul Wood/Getty ImagesIt’s also a“mast year”.According to the Woodland Trust, there is a bumper crop of acorns and beech nuts (collectively known as mast) this autumn. The phenomenon happens every few years, usually after a warm, dry spring. It is good news for the jays, mice, squirrels and badgers that feast on the bounty, but also, as there is such a surplus, it means new trees will grow next year. Win-win.View image in fullscreenLocking antlers … deer fighting during the mating season, in Richmond Park, London.Photograph: Karl Hendon/Getty ImagesWildlife goes really wild.Some of the best autumn spectacles in the UK are seal pups being born, starling murmurations, salmon runs, deer rutting, bird migrations and red squirrels foraging before winter sets in.BBC Countryfile has a guideto the best times and places to witness these natural wonders.You can take fantastic photographs.Landscape photographers love autumnfor its vibrant colours, soft golden light, atmospheric weather – and the longer lie-in before sunrise. There are lots of workshops at this time of year, or simply grab your phone and go for a walk.It’s the best time to take up running.According toresearch by St Mary’s University, Twickenham, running in cooler temperatures places less stress on the body in terms of heart rate and sweat loss. No one wants to start a running regime in the depths of winter, but autumn’s milder days are more appealing. If you stick with it through the winter, there are lots of races to enter in spring, from 5ks to marathons.Star-gazing is sensational.The upside of the long, dark nights areall the celestial events. The Orionid meteor shower lights up the sky from now until 7 November, peaking on 22 October; the constellation of Orion is fully visible in November; Jupiter and Saturn are easier to spot; and supermoons will appear on 7 October, 5 November and 4 December. There are lots of star-gazing nights at observatories such asJodrell Bankin Cheshire, and several dark skies festivalsacross England and Walesandin Scotland.View image in fullscreenOut of the darkness … Liverpool’s River of Light festival.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesBut if the dark gets you down, there are lots of light festivals.Leicester’s Diwali celebrationsare thought to be the biggest outside India (Diwali is on 20 October, but festivities start on 6 October and continue until 30 November). Secular autumn light festivals are also an emerging trend: this year, there are new ones inWorcester(29 and 30 October) andRotherham(November to January), alongside established ones in cities includingLiverpool,Leeds,Blackpool,SheffieldandMiddlesbrough.View image in fullscreenOh my ears and whiskers … proof that pumpkins are not just for soups.Photograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty ImagesNot to mention Halloween …No, it’s not an American import – Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Don’t be a spoilsport: carve a pumpkin, watch thenew Frankenstein film(in UK cinemas from 17 October; on Netflix from 7 November), or go to a spooky event at anEnglish Heritage siteorNational Trust property.Bonfire Night is back with a bang.Some firework displays are returning for the first time since the pandemic, includingthe much-missed one in Blackheath, south-east London (1 November). Others continue centuries-old traditions, such as the flamingtar barrels of Ottery St Mary, Devon, and thefiery processions through Lewes, East Sussex (both on 5 November).View image in fullscreenAutumn’s answer to the barbecue … a chiminea will keep you warm in the garden.Photograph: MarkPiovesan/Getty Images/iStockphotoSpeaking of fire …You may have retired the barbecue for another year, but a chiminea is perfect on autumn evenings. If you don’t have a garden, ‘tis the season of scented candles (confession: I bought an “oak and fallen acorn” one the other day) and woodland walks to cosy pubs with roaring fires.Comfort food is back on the menu.Summer salads are all very well, but autumn’s soups, stews and puddings are much more satisfying. This has beena great year for apples and pumpkins– a good excuse to make apumpkin soupand atoffee apple pudding cake. Celebrate onapple day(officially 21 October, but events take place nationwide all month) or at a harvest festival (5 October, but again, events vary).View image in fullscreenWarming … pumpkin soup.Photograph: Cris Cantón/Getty ImagesIt’s mushroom season.If foraging for them, it’s always best to go with an expert – theWild Food UK sitelists courses. There is a weekendmushroom festival in Wareham, Dorset, for committed mycophiles (24-26 October). Failing that, pick up some ’shrooms at a farmers’ market or supermarket – many of them sell lion’s mane, hen of the woods and king oysters these days.Roséis out, red wine is in.Spritz season is over, and white wine and rosé just aren’t right on a cold night (having said that, M&S has just launched arosé mulled wine). But that makes room for red wine! The Guardian’s wine writer Hannah Crosbie recommendseasy-drinking, affordable Portuguese blendsfor autumn. Cider and perry, sloe gin and espresso martinis also suit the season. Alternatives to the ubiquitous pumpkin spice latte include the maple hazel latte (at Costa) and the salted caramel latte (Pret, Greggs).View image in fullscreenBerry colourful … rich, saturated shades are making a comeback.Photograph: David Newby/The GuardianColour is back in fashion.According to the Guardian’s Jess Cartner-Morley, stylish people have been wearing boring beige for the past couple of years. But this autumn, “rich, saturated shades” have made a welcome return. “Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious,” she says – and wearing them is bound to brighten up your day.View image in fullscreenA pop of colour … winter-flowering pansies will brighten up your garden.Photograph: Free art director/Getty Images/iStockphotoYou can still find cheer in the garden.You don’t have to “put your garden to bed” for the winter, leaving little to look at until the first snowdrops appear. Instead, opt for a blaze of colour. The RHS suggestseight tough, striking plantsfor autumn cheer, including cyclamens and winter pansies.It’s a great time for cinema.There are lots of big releases in November (this year’s include theWickedandKnives Outsequels), plus events including theBFI London film festival(8-19 October). November tends to have thehighest cinema admission figuresoutside school holidays (13.2m last year, behind August on 13.8m and December on 15.7m). Perhaps it’s partly because there is no shame in sitting in a dark room when it’s dark outside anyway.View image in fullscreenFree art … the annual Frieze sculpture exhibition in Regent’s Park, London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAnd for art …TheFrieze sculpture exhibitionin Regent’s Park, London, is an annual art highlight – and it’s free (until 2 November).Blockbuster exhibitionsthis year include theTurner prize in Bradford(until 22 February),Made in Ancient Egypt in Cambridge(until 12 April) andKerry James Marshall in London(until 18 January).And for TV.Celebrity Traitors, the return of Alan Partridge, the end of Stranger Things … sitting on the sofa under a blanket has never beenso tempting.View image in fullscreenTurkish delight … the relaxation area at City Baths in Newcastle.You can soak in a nice hot bath.If, like me, you haven’t got one, Britain’slast remaining Victorian Turkish bathsare great value and need support – find them in Newcastle, Harrogate, Northampton, Edinburgh and London. Alternatively, saunas have sprung up all over the country, fromfree and discounted community saunasin London to“wild” saunas in remote locations.But if you really hate autumn at home, at least holidays are a lot cheaper at this time of year.According to All Clear, a travel insurance company, flights and hotels are 20-40% cheaper in autumn and spring than in July and August, and car hire can be up to half price. The UK’s warmest destination, the Isles of Scilly, has anAutumn Tide festivalthis month (8-14 October). For affordable autumn sunshine in wider Europe,the Post Officesuggests the Canary Islands or Cyprus in October, and Malaga, Spain, or the Algarve, Portugal, in November.Explore more on these topicsAutumnWildlifeAstronomyHalloweenGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was staged in a boozy alleyway where beers and bobbling chestnuts abounded.The strong winds didn’t put many off and, by the time the competition began, the strip was heaving with punters ready to do one thing. “I’m here to crack some nuts,” said Navid Akram, who was playing conkers for the first time. Despite being a novice, the 32-year-old was confident about his chances. “I wanna show I am the conquering beast.”He was joined by Arno Bryant, 30, a conkers veteran who remembers “trying to find the most beautiful, largest conkers” for battle when he was a child. He had sourced half a dozen of them, which he decorated with goggly eyes in preparation for the tournament, but they were far from the best batch he had picked. “I went hunting yesterday for them but they’re quite beady. It’s been a fallow conker year,” he said.The competition comes after an uncharacteristically dramatic time for the sport. Last year, the conkers legend David Jakins, who is also known as King Conker, wasaccused of cheatingafter a steel chestnut was discovered in his pocket. The offending item was found after the 82-year-old was searched by organisers of the World Conker Championships after his victory at the competition.An investigation was launched but, in the end, he wascleared of any wrongdoing. While the World Conker Championships has strict rules, the Peckham upstart is far more liberal. In fact, cheating is encouraged. “We just enjoy people who take their hobbies too far, and this is a classic example of it. It’s innocent fun,” said Akram.View image in fullscreenThe crowd at the 2025 Peckham Conkers Championships braved the strong winds to crack some nuts.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianLike Akram, I never grew up playing conkers, unless having them lobbed at me in the playground (and dashing them back) counts as a guerilla offshoot. At thePeckhamgames, I was placed into a team of strangers, who kindly embraced me despite being a novice. The captain, Ella Rodgers, 33, showed me the ropes. I was asked to come up with my own name for our scorecard, which somewhat rhymed with conker. Honker, Conkerella and Donkey Konk were sadly taken, so I opted for Stonker.I had five minutes to face off against each member of the team, with the aim of cracking their conker and, if I ranked top of the preliminary battle, I would advance to the next stage. This would go on until two people in the entire competition remained. They would duel on stage until a winner was declared. The victor would walk away with the ultimate prize: a 24-carrot conker.My hopes were low and, at first, this was well founded. I got my chestnut hanging from a shoelace ready and, facing my first foe, I swung my conker at hers. It missed massively and nearly swung back round to knock me out. I had two more goes and on my final one, I had managed to graze hers. I was awarded a pity point. She went next and scored a hit two out of three times.I went again and, using a shorter amount of shoelace for my aim, I managed to hit her nut and cause some damage. From here on, I was on a roll. After a few more rounds I struck another crack but instead of falling loose our conkers had managed to get tangled. This triggered another phase of the game: the tussle. This is where the sign at the beginning began to make sense.We had to fight for the lace and whoever pulled hardest would be awarded a point. I made a good go of it but the burn on my palms made me give up. The wraps around other competitors’ arms finally made sense. At this point, many others around me had also found their stride but, along with cheers, more frantic tussles broke out and chestnuts were coming from all directions. Some eager participants even knocked into us, though this was followed by a profuse apology.View image in fullscreenTimothy  Nuts won the Peckham’s Conker Championships, after he defeated last year’s champion, Pietro the Pummeller.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianI am not cut out for this, I thought. I covered my mouth and later learned this was with good reason. Last year’s victor,Pietro the Pummeller, chipped a tooth in his final duel after getting tossed around in an on-stage tussle.After bowing out, I left it to the experts. The Pummeller, who had a two-year winning streak, was finally felled and Timothy Nuts was crowned this year’s victor.Explore more on these topicsSportPeckhamLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The idea of him as an IRA man seemed ludicrous. Gallagher was romantic and cerebral – he had wowed Attenborough by completing the Guardian’s cryptic crossword in three minutes.Yet he was charged with helping theIRAto launchmortars at Heathrow in 1994, attacks that inflicted no casualties but caused huge disruption. Attenborough mustered funds and support to proclaim her boyfriend’s innocence but Gallagher was convicted of conspiring to cause explosions and sentenced to 20 years in prison.View image in fullscreenMary Attenborough circa 1990.Photograph: Mary AttenboroughNow, almost three decades later, the two are still a couple and have co-written a book that confirms Gallagher was, in fact, guilty – that he was an IRA fixer who facilitated multiple operations, including the Heathrow attack.He had concealed the truth from Attenborough and confessed to her only after his conviction, leaving her stunned. “Other than a handful of people, I didn’t really tell anybody,” she said this week. “It wasn’t something I was that proud of because he had lied to me.”Attenborough and Gallagher have parted the veils on that deception, and their relationship, in a joint memoir,Unbroken: Secrets, Lies and Enduring Love.“There was certainly a hint that Mary somehow might have known or at least had a good idea of what I was up to and that just wasn’t the case at all,” said Gallagher. “I wanted to get that out there.”After Gallagher was released under the terms of the 1998Good Friday agreement, the couple moved to rural County Donegal and set up a web development business, which they still run.The book has now turned a spotlight on their past. Gallagher, 82, wanted to set the record straight about his guilt and that Attenborough had initially believed in his innocence.For her part, the former maths lecturer, who is 71, wanted to explain why she forgave the deception. “I know Michael isn’t a terrible person, he’s a very good person,” she said. “He just didn’t put me first, and I don’t know whether I see that as betrayal. He didn’t intend it.”They met in 1985 through groups that supported Britain’s striking coal miners and protested against South Africa’s apartheid. Attenborough, from Walsall, near Birmingham, had a doctorate in mathematical physics from Imperial College London. Gallagher, from Glasgow, was an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic.View image in fullscreenAttenborough and Gallagher celebrate his release from prison in 1998.Photograph: Mary Attenborough and Michael GallagherHe had Northern Irish roots and did occasional jobs for the IRA, sorting out accommodation, transport and documents for IRA members in England. Gallagher concealed his activities from Attenborough, who supported Irish unification but opposed IRA methods. “I’d made a commitment to the IRA and a commitment to Mary and I thought I was getting away with it – that I was able to do both,” he said.The mortars that landed on Heathrow in March 1994 were not armed to explode – they were symbolic attacks timed to coincide with parliament’s renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, said Gallagher.Security forces identified him as the suspect who visited a warehouse with traces of explosives, put him under surveillance and bugged the couple’s home for almost two years, culminating in the pre-dawn raid at their Earl’s Court home on 28 October 1996.Attenborough rallied support, and funds from family for bail, to avert a presumed Guildford Four-style miscarriage of justice.View image in fullscreenA burned out Nissan car, which had been used to launch the mortars.Photograph: PAFor 16 months – during her prison visits and the trial in February 1998 – Gallagher kept his secret. “There was no way I could tell her because had I told her then, she would have been obliged to tell my sister, her brother and anybody else: ‘Don’t bother looking for sureties for Michael because he’s guilty,’” he said. “It was really an awful time. She’d come and talk about all the people who were campaigning for my innocence, saying they were so sorry about me, ‘poor Michael’.”The possibility of escaping conviction, however, sustained his fiction until the jury decided against him. Days later, when Attenborough visited to tell him about plans for an appeal, he confided his guilt.View image in fullscreenThe memoir Unbroken.“At first, I didn’t even know whether to believe him,” she recalled. “I thought, well, which version of the truth should I accept here?” Distraught, she considered ending the relationship, but in subsequent visits she accepted Gallagher’s apologies and rationalised his clandestine activities. “Obviously I didn’t agree with this involvement with the IRA. But on the other hand, it wasn’t that big a role that he was playing.”Anti-terrorist police say fixers play crucial roles in facilitating murderous attacks but Attenborough said IRA members believed in a cause. “I think their tactics were wrong but I don’t regard them as terrible people.”The memoir alternates perspectives between the two narrators and cloaks Gallagher’s guilt until his conviction – a delayed reveal the authors said they modelled on Gillian Flynn’s novelGone Girl.During the writing, Gallagher disclosed another decades-old secret to his partner: when he speedily completed the crossword in her copy of the Guardian he had already done it earlier, in his own copy.Explore more on these topicsIRANorthern IrelandUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

Supporters of the scheme have said that Reform campaign was riddled with misinformation and led to a U-turn by the town’s council just six months after it had voted in favour. The charity behind the project, City of Sanctuary UK (CoS), said it was the first time that had happened in England.Reform – which has no elected councillors in the NorthSomersettown – repeatedly claimed online that becoming a council of sanctuary would lead to a surge in “illegal immigrants” and that joining the network would divert taxpayers money away from public services, claims strongly refuted by the charity and supporters of the scheme.The council of sanctuary award links up authorities in an attempt to improve support for asylum seekers and refugees settling into the area; it has no influence on the numbers placed in a town, that is a decision made centrally by the Home Office and its contractors. It costs a town council £150 a year for the three-year duration of the award.View image in fullscreenPeople enjoying the town’s extensive, sandy beach earlier this year.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PASince it was first proposed, heated protests have broken out in the normally peaceful town. Councillors who supported the scheme have received abusive correspondence.Caroline Reynolds, a Liberal Democrat councillor who first put forward the motion in March, said: “Reform were looking for something and I fell right into their hands without realising. I’m not saying that would have stopped me. That I would have done anything differently, but that’s just what happened.”Reynolds said the “misinformation” started as soon as the motion was published. “Reform said we would be inundated with illegal immigrants,” she said.Reform helped mobilise a large protest of about 200 people outside the town hall on the night the motion was put to a vote. Counter-protesters have alleged chants of “send them back home” were heard as well as comments about grooming gangs.Reynolds said the arguments she heard against the proposal became more intense and prejudicial. “It became about grooming gangs, being inundated with migrants, a little bit of Islamophobia,” she said.She added that she and colleagues in other parties received abusive emails. “The worst one I had was: ‘Wouldn’t it be a shame if in the future some time one of these illegals you think so much of carries out a crime against you or your family, as is happening all over the country,’” Reynolds said.Other councillors came under pressure from residents and started to speak out against the proposal. Ultimately, in late September, the authority decided to abandon the plans.Holly Law, who has lived in Weston-super-Mare for 15 years, spoke at the meeting in September in support of the proposal. “I wanted the council to take a stand and commit to ensuring that we’re as welcoming as possible. I’m embarrassed that there are hundreds of councils that have uncontroversially committed to being a city or council of sanctuary and I find it sad it was rejected,” Law said.“There were intelligent councillors bending to the misinformation shared,” she added.Tensions mounted throughout the summer. Avon and Somerset police are investigating a suspected hate crime at a cafe, which was vandalised and covered in racist stickers overnight in late August. No arrests have been made.Reform is polling well in the town. In themost recent YouGov MRP poll, the party was forecast to take the seat of the local Labour MP Dan Aldridge if an election had been held the day after the survey was conducted.The local branch of Reform increased its activity on social media as soon as the motion appeared in the council agenda. When the motion was voted through, the branch claimed on social media: “This means that the council must support illegal immigrants, possibly meaning future financial funding.”It claimed organisations were “pushing mass migration into towns like ours”.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided byFacebook.

The charity rebutted this, saying that while there were criteria to be met, media was not mentioned, although councils would be expected to “raise awareness” of their work in support of inclusion.“To have asylum seekers in the town is contrary to the wants and needs of the taxpayer majority of the town,” Hargreaves said, a point contested by supporters of the sanctuary proposal. “Why are they here? They’ve come from multiple safe countries. I just don’t think it should just be a given that local taxpayers should be burdened with their presence, I mean fiscally.”When allegations of misinformation were put to Hargreaves, he said: “But they [CoS] are not being honest in the way that they’re thinking. I mean, it is an explicitly leftwing charity with leftwing objectives to influence our local media and policymakers, because there is an influx of immigration via asylum seekers. And there will be more.”Most recent official figures suggest Weston-super-Mare is a town that historically has experienced below average levels of migration. In 2021, 10.4% of the population was born outside the UK, while 6.7% identified as “non UK”. The ethnic and religious make up of the town is uniform, with 95% of the population identifying as white. The numbers identifying as Asian, black, Muslim, Sikh or Jewish are far below the national average.But Hargreaves claimed that over the past five years the town of about 83,000 people had experienced a “heavy increase in immigration”, and that there were about 150 asylum seekers in Weston-super-Mare. The Guardian has not been able to verify this figure.“It’s all about trajectory, right?” Hargreaves said. “I don’t care about now. I care about five years’ time. And the things that they’re doing, the things that they’re prioritising, the landing pads that they’re making for themselves, point merely to a direction of an increase of immigration that people don’t want to increase.”Hargreaves claimed the public found it frustrating to see support for immigrants in the town when services were being stretched. He used broken toilets and reduced bin collections as examples. “If you weren’t seeing a coincidence of dropping of living standards and house prices being 10 times more than they were 10 days ago, people really wouldn’t care,” Hargreaves said.There are no hotels being used to house asylum seekers in Weston-super-Mare, although the local Reform branch has been accused of falsely claiming there are, focusing on one temporarily closed hotel in the town.View image in fullscreenThe Labour MP Daniel Aldridge said the Reform branch’s social media accounts were ‘full of attempts to divide our town’.Photograph: Laurie Noble/House of Commons/Laurie NobleAldridge, the town’s first everLabourMP, sayid Reform UK’s Weston-super-Mare’s social media accounts were “full of attempts to divide our town”, adding that he was concerned by the “blatant, shameless spreading and encouraging of misinformation”.“Their continued misinformation about our town feels increasingly damaging, like they want to trash our reputation,” he said.Aldridge said he had received reports of people arriving in the town for a short break being wrongly labelled as asylum seekers and in some cases harassed in the streets. “This behaviour needs to stop,” he said. “It doesn’t just spread fear and misinformation. It damages Weston’s reputation as a welcoming seaside town.”The row had caused many residents to feel “intimidated and vulnerable”, Aldridge continued. “I do not recognise the Weston some Reform UK activists try to portray.”But the MP fell short of backing the the scheme. “The truth is, Weston already acts like a town of sanctuary – we don’t need a stamp of approval to show that,” Aldridge said.There are 32 awarded councils, with a further 180 involved in the network. Maggie Filipova-Rivers, the local authority programme manager for CoS, said: “Councils are free to decide whether or not to seek the award, and we respect that. What we do feel is that some of the facts about what the award means have been misunderstood or lost in the debate.”Filipova-Rivers said the charity was realistic about the challenges in the current political climate but added: “The appetite for inclusivity and fairness is still very much alive. Our main concern is that the political noise around immigration risks distracting from the valuable, practical work councils are doing every day to support integration.”Reynolds remains optimistic. “I’m very hopeful,” she said. “Now, a lot of people have contacted me, people have stopped me in the street to say that this is not their town. It’s a loud minority.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumReform UKSomersetLocal governmentRefugeesLiberal DemocratsLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was not immediately clear if he was referencing astrike announced on Fridayby defense secretary Pete Hegseth.During his speech, Trump said the navy had supported the mission “to blow the cartel terrorists the hell out of the water.

The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.”The remaining trekkers would arrive in Qudang in stages under the guidance and assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported. Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, according to an earlier report by state-backed Jimu News.Jimu estimated that nearly 1,000 people had been trapped. The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. It was also unclear if trekkers near the north face of Everest – also in Tibet – had been affected or not.Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted by villagers after enduring an evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning.“Back in the village we had a meal and were finally warm,” Chen said.The north face of Everest, due to its easy access by paved road, regularly draws large numbers of tourists.

The enhanced tier covers countries and entities deemed a particular risk and requires extra disclosures. As a result, anyone doing undeclared work on behalf of Iran or Russia faces five years in prison.The Guardian reported in the spring that instead of targeting China as a whole, ministers were considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have been accused of interference in the west on the enhanced tier.Such entities include: China’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service; theChinese Communist party(CCP); the United Front Work Department, which is often referred to as the international arm of the CCP; and the People’s Liberation Army, which is China’s military.Watchdog cleared ex-Tory minister to work for offshoot of firm linked to China surveillanceRead moreThe government insists that countries’ designations in Firs are kept under review. The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.Ministers are under pressure concerning the consequences of their rapprochement with Beijing and are facing questions about the collapse of a trial of two Britons, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China.The trial of Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary aide to Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, and his friend Christopher Berry had been due to begin this month, but the case was suddenly dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service on 15 September. Cash and Berry denied the charges.The Sunday Times and the Telegraph reported that the government’s refusal to describe China as an “enemy” in witness evidence from a security official ledto the case being abandoned.Jonathan Powell, the prime minister’s national security adviser, is said to have chaired a meeting in Whitehall last month where he told officials the government’s evidence would stop well short of calling Beijing an enemy.Whitehall sources denied the claim that Powell was involved in restricting government evidence.The Sunday Times reported that Powell told the September meeting that additional evidence in the trial expected to be given by Matthew Collins, a deputy national security adviser, would have to be based on Labour’s new national security strategy published this year.That describes China as a “geo-strategic challenge” and not an enemy. Cash and Berry had been accused of allegedly breaching the 1911 Official Secrets Act, which says that a person is guilty of spying if they pass on information that is “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”.Government sources said while the meeting involving Powell had taken place, it had been mischaracterised. They said it would not be possible to insist that Collins cite 2025 government policy when the alleged offences had taken place previously, between 2021 and early 2023, when the Conservatives were in power.Collins had already given written evidence that had been cited by the CPS in its initial summary of the case in April 2024, at which point the accused were said to have acted in a way “prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK” by passing on information “directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state”.Government sources said that no evidence put forward by the state was withdrawn or changed and that no pressure of any kind was placed on the CPS. Collins’s evidence was considered important because it would help spell out the impact any alleged espionage would have had.Cash worked as an aide to Kearns, a backbencher, and was accused of passing on information to Berry. The CPS said he in turn wrote up 34 reports, at least some of which were about the British political system, for a Chinese individual assessed to be a member of the country’s intelligence services. The Guardian reported that Cai Qi, China’s fifth most senior official, was believed to be in receipt of this intelligence.Allies of Cash have indicated that while he did supply information to Berry, it was said to be public material on how parliament or UK politics works – or his personal analyses, such as who he thought would win the next election. Berry’s lawyers were expected to argue that he was working for a corporate client in China looking to expand in the UK.The CPS has said that the case had been “kept under continuous review” and that it was abandoned because the “evidential standard” was “no longer met”.On Sunday, officials pointed to a letter from Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, who had said in a letter to the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, that prosecutors had not been subject to “any disclosure or pressure” by politicians in deciding to drop the case ahead of trial.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, told broadcasters that there had been no “ministerial involvement” in the collapse of the case.Senior Tories have accused the government of collapsing the trial to avoid upsetting China, although the Conservativesalso declined to designate the country as a national security threatwhen they were in power.In the latest sign of warming relations with Beijing, the Guardian understands that a senior Foreign Office official met Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, over the summer to discuss the prospect of lifting the ban on the Chinese ambassador entering parliament in return forBeijing lifting its sanctions on UK parliamentarians.A string of high-level government figures have travelled to China on official visits since Labour came to power, including Peter Kyle, the business secretary,for trade talks last month, and Powell, the national security adviser, over the summer.Keir Starmer is widely expected to make a bilateral trip to China early in the new year, though the timing may depend on Donald Trump, who has said he intends to visit in early 2026.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismChinaEspionageAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Customers inside the restaurant continued eating.“Then it was like non-stop bang bang bang,” Aysegul said, adding she could smell the live rounds inside the restaurant.They called police who told her and her customers to shelter inside the restaurant, which they did until about 10pm. The restaurateur said she knew the alleged perpetrator, but not by name, and understood he had moved to the area recently.Traffic was flowing again on Georges River Road on Monday morning, although the northern side of the street was still blocked off. Several bullet holes were visible in a building and a bus stop. Shattered glass was strewn across the footpath.Specialist officers were examining an awning in front of the window from which the gunman allegedly opened fire. Officers were visible inside the apartment.Six people hospitalisedSix people were hospitalised. A man in his 50s self-presented to Canterbury hospital with gunshot wounds, including one to the neck. He was transported to Royal Prince Alfred hospital in a serious condition.A man and a woman, both in their 30s, went to Campsie police station with glass injuries and were taken to Canterbury hospital, authorities said.Two men were treated at the scene for glass injuries, with one subsequently transported to RPA and the other to another hospital.Paramedics treated 16 people at the scene for minor injuries. Some were injured by shattered glass as bullets hit their windows. Others were treated for shock.TheNew South Walespolice commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said police body-worn cameras showed how close officers had come to being hit as they took cover during the “serious and terrifying incident”.“You can hear numerous gunshots, and certainly impact, not too far from the camera,” Lanyon told Sydney radio 2GB on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson told the Greens they were horrified that some venues were able to operate when gambling harm was highest.Chris Minns accused of misrepresenting cashless gaming trial after labelling it ‘ineffective’Read moreWhile initially being told to wait until November for more information, the ACL pressed for as much detail as possible so it could rally support behind the bill in a public campaign later this month. It also flagged the involvement of churches and prayer groups.The ACL’s chief executive officer, Michelle Pearse, said the lobby group would not drop its criticism of the Greens on other policy differences, but would work constructively on gambling reform.“We support good bills wherever they come from and we applaud the Greens for addressing this important social issue,” Pearse said.“The fact that these exemptions have not been reviewed in 20 years is unacceptable when you think about the social cost. A number of reforms are needed. We also support a cashless gaming card and a complete ban on all gambling advertising.”Pearse said the ACL was alsowilling to work with the Greens in Victoria, which has criticised the state Labor government’s reforms as “insufficient”. She agreed the ACL’s willingness to work with the Greens highlighted a change of strategy.Faehrmann said the ACL’s approach reflected bipartisan concern about the stateLabor government’s record on poker machines.“The Greens and the Australian Christian Lobby don’t often see eye to eye on things,” Faehrmann said. “In fact, until now we’ve pretty much been polar opposites of any debate.“We can’t afford to play politics on this issue. Poker machines are designed to addict and exploit people and the longer [premier] Chris Minns refuses to act, the more lives will be destroyed. If it takes a so-called unholy alliance to change that, then so be it.”The Greens and the ACL have been bitter political rivals for two decades. Last year,the ACL referred to the Greens as a “hardcore Marxist party”. It has also accused the Greens of demonstrating a “hate for faith”, which it denies. Greens politicians have also accused the ACL ofspreading homophobia and hate speech, a charge the group denies.The state’s gaming minister, David Harris, has rejected claims the government has not acted on poker machines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fourteen per cent disagreed.‘Direct evidence of genocidal intent’: the UN commission of inquiry’s report on Israel’s actions in GazaRead moreThe survey of 1,500 voting-aged Australians suggests the public is broadly supportive of the government playing a more decisive role in bringing the bloody two-year war to an end.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe poll’s release coincides with a new offensive byIsraeli forces on Gaza Cityas the Palestinian militant group, Hamas,considers a peace and reconstruction planproposed by the US president, Donald Trump.It found that 57% of respondents agreed Australia should impose similar sanctions on Israel as those against Russia after its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Of those in favour of sanctions, 34% said they strongly agreed while 24% somewhat agreed.Those opposed – 21% – were more likely to be older and vote for the Coalition or One Nation. The poll included respondents of all voting intentions, genders, religions and education levels.In a related but separate question, 54% supported Australia sanctioning Israel’s government and military leaders in response to their actions in Gaza, while 22% were opposed.Of the Labor voters who responded to the question, 68% expressed support while 9% were against it. Coalition voters were split with 39% in support of sanctions against Israeli leaders while 40% opposed the move.Support for preventing trade between the Australian government and companies involved in the war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank was also broadly supported with 53% – and 33% strongly – in favour. About 19% said they were against halting trade.Both Labor and Greens supporters were overwhelmingly in favour of stronger sanctions action. Forty-one per cent of Coalition supporters said they agreed with banning trade between the Australian government and companies involved in Gaza and West Bank occupation, while 32% said they were opposed.Asked whether a genocide is occurring in Gaza after the release of theUN commission of inquiry’s report in September, 58% of respondents agreed while 16% disagreed.The vast majority of respondents who identified themselves as Labor and Greens supporters agreed a genocide was happening, while Coalition voters were more divided with 46% saying they agreed and 28% saying they did not.The president of APAN, Nasser Mashni, said the polling showed Australians wanted the federal government to play a more active role in the stopping the conflict.“People know that when there’s a genocide, the Australian government has an obligation to act. They also know that the media in Australia needs to be better at accurately reporting on the evidence that they see come straight from people and fellow journalists in Gaza,” Mashni said.“There’s strong support across the political spectrum in every demographic, overwhelmingly identifying Israel’s actions as genocide and calling for sanctions and for people to stand with Palestine.”Australia joined with the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Norway in June inplacing financial sanctions and travel banson two Israeli government ministers in response to serious human rights violations and abuses against Palestinians in the West Bank.The governmentrecognised Palestine as a sovereign and independent stateat the UN general assembly last month but has yet to bow to further domestic pressure in response toa report by the UN commission of inquiry, which found statements made by Israeli authorities, including Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are “direct evidence of genocidal intent”.This week will mark two years since the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, who killed approximately 1,200 people and kidnapped about 250.Israel’s offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble andso far killed 66,055 Palestinians, also mostly civilians. More than 160,000 are thought to have been injured.Guardian Australia approached the Israeli embassy and the Palestinian delegation in Australia for comment.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

A fourth death – an infant in SA – was found likely to have been unrelated.A separate outage on 28 September affected nine calls to the triple-zero network on one tower in the Illawarra region of NSW but Optus has confirmed the welfare of all who tried to call.Tougher laws were first flagged last year, in response to an earlier Optus outage in November 2023. The Albanese government then asked the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) for advice on amending emergency call service legislation.Optus named former NBN co-director and Deutsche Bank boss Kerry Schott to lead an independent review into the technical failures behind the outages. The ACMA has begun its own investigation into Optus’ compliance, with emergency call service regulations and other related rules.Wells has alreadymet the chief executive of Optus’s parent company Singtel, Yuen Kuan Moon, as well as the Optus chair, John Arthur, and Rue, over the outages.The opposition plans to target the government and Wells’ response to the outages in Senate estimates hearings this week.The shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said Labor should have acted more quickly to implement recommendations from a review of the 2023 outages.“I think Australians are starting to lack confidence in the triple-zero network firstly, which is disastrous,” she told Sky on Sunday.“They’re certainly lacking confidence in Optus because of this. This isn’t their first time and it’s resulted in deaths. Of course they’d be lacking confidence.”The industry minister, Tim Ayres, said Optus should have ensured triple-zero services were protected, defending the slow roll out of the new network guardian’s powers.“That is all of the architecture that the government has committed to delivering,” he said. “But in the end, this is Optus’ failure, and it’s a pretty devastating failure.”Explore more on these topicsOptusTelecommunications industryTelstraAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The centre-right Spolu coalition of the outgoing prime minister, Petr Fiala, came second on 23.4%.“I have promised to … show the president a solution that will be in line with Czech and European laws,” Babiš, a polarising figure whose previous premiership from 2017 to 2021 drew mass protests, said as the talks got under way on Sunday.Pavel said afterwards that he would not attempt to appoint a new government until November at the earliest, adding that he would insist on “a pro-western direction” for the country and “the preservation of all the institutions of a democratic state”.While he hailed the “historic result” as “the absolute peak” of his political career, Babiš has significant hurdles to clear to become prime minister, and to win and maintain support for the single-party minority government he has said he wants.Analysts have also said that even if he succeeds, Babiš is unlikely to join the populist, authoritarian prime ministers of Hungary and Slovakia, Viktor Orbán and Robert Fico respectively, as a fully fledged member of the EU’s awkward squad.Mainstream parties have ruled out entering any coalition with ANO, forcing Babiš to seek backing from two fringe – and potentially fractious – rightwing groups, Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) and Motorists, to win a parliamentary confidence vote.“We will lead talks with the SPD and the Motorists, and seek a single-party government led by ANO,” Babiš, the country’s seventh-richest man with a net worth estimated at $3.9bn (£2.9bn), said on Sunday.ANO campaigned on pledges of faster growth, higher wages and pensions, and lower taxes. It also promised to fight the EU’s migration pact and green deal, and to end the shells-for-Ukraine“Czech initiative”, instead backing Kyiv solely through the EU.The party shares some common ground with the far-right SPD, which is also opposed to EU climate and immigration policies, as is the smaller rightwing Motorists party.But the Moscow-friendly, anti-Nato SPD also campaigned on a “Czexit” promise to pull the Czech Republicout of the 27-member bloc, which Babiš has rejected out of hand. He has insisted repeatedly his party is “pro-European, and pro-Nato”.Both the Motorists and the SPD have said they are open to talks with ANO, but it is unclear how far either party is willing to support a minority ANO government rather than seek a binding coalition accord – or how long their support could last.Analysts noted that the SPD’s 7.8% vote share was significantly lower than the 13% it was forecast to win before the election, meaning its negotiating position in talks on any confidence-and-supply deal may not be as strong as previously imagined.Even assuming Babiš is able to present Pavel – who defeated the billionaire to become president in elections held in 2023 – with a multiparty agreement representing a 101-seat majority in parliament, his problems may not be over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also said he was taking legal advice on a possible conflict of interest concerning Babiš’s sprawling business interests.Babiš has promised to resolve the problem, but Pavel has the constitutional right to reject him as prime minister if he considers the solution inadequate. That is unlikely to happen, but may give the billionaire pause for thought about his proposed cabinet.European far-right leaders including Orbàn, who posted on social media that “truth has prevailed”, and France’s Marine Le Pen, who said “patriotic parties” were being “called to power … all over Europe”, rushed to congratulate Babiš.However, although ANO sits in the far-right Patriots for Europe group in the European parliament and Babiš has called himself an admirer of Orbàn, the bloc’s disruptor-in-chief, it is unclear how far he will align himself with the anti-EU camp.Analysts say Babiš’s politics are more pragmatic than ideological and that he is unlikely to pick a serious fight with Brussels as long as the Czech Republic needs EU funds and the billionaire’s businesses continue to benefit from being in the bloc.Czech institutions are also likely to constrain the billionaire at home, with radical shifts likely to be hindered by the senate, which can veto any proposed electoral law or constitutional change and must approve judges appointed to the constitutional court.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They were stopped by riot police using pepper spray and water cannon.“No one will escape responsibility. This includes political responsibility,” the Georgian news agency Interpress quoted the prime minister as saying.Officers detained at least five demonstrators, including two members of the United National Movement, the largest opposition party, and the opera singer turned activist Paata Burchuladze.View image in fullscreenPaata Burchuladze (left, in dark jacket), an opera singer and one of the rally’s organisers, marched with opposition supporters in Tbilisi and was detained by police.Photograph: Zurab Tsertsvadze/APLocal media cited the health ministry as saying 21 members of the security forces and six demonstrators had been injured in clashes in the centre of Tbilisi.The South Caucasus country has been in turmoil since Kobakhidze’s ruling Georgian Dream (GD) partyclaimed victoryin last year’s parliamentary election, which the pro-EU oppositionsays was stolen. Since then, Tbilisi’s talks on joining the bloc have been frozen.Kobakhidze said up to 7,000 people attended Saturday’s opposition rally but their “attempt to overthrow the constitutional order” had been thwarted despite what he said was EU backing.“Several people have already been arrested – first and foremost the organisers of the attempted overthrow,” he told reporters, saying the country’s main opposition force “will no longer be allowed to be active in Georgian politics”.View image in fullscreenIrakli Kobakhidze, seen here last week at a meeting of the European Political Community in Copenhagen, said Georgia’s main opposition force would ‘no longer be allowed to be active in Georgian politics’.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/EPAOpposition figures had called for a “peaceful revolution” against GD, which they accuse of being pro-Russian and authoritarian. The party has been in power since 2012.Thousands of protesters gathered in the heart of the capital, waving Georgian and EU flags, after months of Kremlin-style raids on independent media, restrictions on civil society and thedetention of dozens of opponentsand activists. The jailed reformist ex-presidentMikheil Saakashvilihad urged supporters to protest on election day for what he called the “last chance” to save Georgian democracy.Kobakhidze accused the EU’s ambassador to Georgia, Paweł Herczyński,of meddling. “You know that specific people from abroad have even expressed direct support for all this, for the announced attempt to overthrow the constitutional order,” he said, adding that Herczyński “bears special responsibility in this context”.“[Herczyński] should come out, distance himself and strictly condemn everything that is happening on the streets of Tbilisi,” said Kobakhidze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Large explosions were audible from the centre, a Unesco world heritage site.Victims included a 15-year-old girl, who died with three members of her family when their house was flattened in the village of Lapaivka in the Lviv region. Eight others were hurt in the same strike. One person died in the city of Zaporizhzhia when drones struck an apartment block.In avideo address, Zelenskyy said Russia had refused all offers to stop its all-out war. It was deliberately trying to destroy civilian infrastructure – in particular Ukraine’s gas and energy system – ahead of winter, he said.He added: “There is no worthy, strong reaction from the world to everything that is happening. To the constant increase in the scale and audacity of the strikes. That is why Putin is doing this: he is simply laughing at the west, at its silence and lack of strong action in response.”Ukraine’s president promised his country would respond “so Russia feels the answers”. He said the weapons used in Sunday’s attack – about 500 drones and more than 50 missiles – included components from western countries, including the US and UK. Stronger export controls were needed, he said.mapPoland’s air force said it scrambled jets and took preventive action on Sunday to secure its airspace, after an incursion last month by Russian decoy drones. There were numerousdrone sightings last week in EU countriesincluding Germany and Denmark.Part of Lviv was left without electricity, according to the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. Large fires broke out in several locations, including a civilian industrial park in the south of the city, he reported. Aschool, kindergarten and churchwere also damaged.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the overnight Russian bombing in Chernihiv, Ukraine.Photograph: State Emergency Service/EPAAs the acrid smell of smoke and fumes engulfed Lviv, the regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, urged residents to close their windows and avoid going out or to use gas masks or respirators.On Sunday morning, ash was still falling on the streets of Lviv, as exhausted residents ventured out and attended church services. The twisted metal remains of a Russian drone lay on a pavement outside a block of flats, cordoned off with red tape.Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had carried out a combined attack featuring cruse missiles, Iranian-designed Shaheds and Kinzhal ballistic missiles.Numerous regions were hit, including Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west of the country, as well as Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Zelenskyy called on Ukraine’s allies to help boost air defences and to impose a no-fly zone – something they have so far been reluctant to do.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallassaid Moscow was waging terror attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructureto mask its “failed summer offensive”. She said it would not stop “until it was forced to”, adding that the EU would support Kyiv for as long as it took.In recent days, Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, causing power blackouts in several areas, a tactic it has repeated in the run-up to winter for the past three years. Ukraine, meanwhile, continues to hit oil production facilities deep inside Russia with its own long-range drones.View image in fullscreenFive people were killed in the attacks across the country, and 14 were injured.Photograph: State Emergency Service/EPALviv was partway through the annualLviv BookForum, with writers and audiences gathered in the city for one of the largest book festivals in eastern Europe.Alongside Ukrainian writers, including poets Artur Dron and Julia Musakovska, there were international speakers including the British Forward prizewinning poet Fiona Benson, and, joining by video link, the Booker prize-winner Bernardine Evaristo, and the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeDrones (military)newsShareReuse this content"

It is extraordinary, as is the history of the family,” Thomas Bompard, the vice-president of Sotheby’sFrance, told the Guardian.“This painting is the Taylor Swift of surrealism,” Bompard said. “If you were to ask a group of schoolchildren to do a presentation on the surrealist movement this painting alone would be enough to define it. I call it the superstar of surrealism.”The Belgian-born Magritte worked as a designer in a wallpaper factory and created advertising posters until 1926, when he produced his first surrealist work. The following year, he had his first exhibition in Brussels but the critics were savage and a dismayed Magritte moved to Paris, where he failed to make his mark.He returnedBelgiumin 1930 and formed an advertising agency with his brother Paul.“Life for Magritte was very difficult at this time. The Great Depression that started in 1929 in the US hit France in the early 1930s. For two years, between 1930 and 1932, Magritte sold nothing and had no exhibitions,” Bompard said.“Nobody was buying paintings by surrealists. They were considered revolutionary troublemakers.”View image in fullscreenRené Magritte with his work The Barbarian (Le Barbare)Photograph: René Magritte/Latrobe Regional GallerySpaak’s husband, Claude, a celebrated Belgian playwright, knew Magritte and was a benefactor, commissioning portraits of his wife and children andarranging a monthly stipend for the artist and his family.In 1934, Suzanne Spaak’s sister Alice Lorge, known as Bunny, bought La Magie Noire to mark the birth of her first child with Emile Happe, a Belgian industrialist.“The Spaak family was to Belgium what the Mountbattens were to the UK; like royalty and they pulled Magritte out of difficulty,” Bompard said. “It was bought to mark the birth of a child but it was a rebirth for Magritte who was struggling to get himself back on his feet.”The model for the series was Magritte’s wife, Georgette Berger, who is portrayed in a classical manner resembling a marble statue resting her hand on a block of stone. Her upper body gradually blends into the sky behind her while her lower half retains its natural tone.Magritte went on to paint 10 similar portraits, most of which were given different names. In this work, the first of the series, Berger is portrayed with a dove on her right shoulder. One-third of the background shows a semi wood-panelled interior wall.View image in fullscreenResistance heroine Suzanne SpaakPhotograph: WikipediaSuzanne and Claude Spaak were living in Paris when war broke out in 1939. After the Nazi occupation of the French capital, she joined the resistance and was a member of the “Red Orchestra” intelligence unit. Spaak used her considerable fortune to save 163 Jewish children from deportation, hiding a number of them at her home before they could be moved to safety.In October 1943, the Nazis arrested Spaak along with 600 members of the Red Orchestra. On 12 August 1944, days before the liberation of Paris, the Gestapo executed her in her prison cell. She was 38 and has since been honoured by Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for her efforts to save Jewish people.Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on 15 August 1967 and is buried in Brussels.The painting, which has been displayed in the Magritte Museum in Brussels, has been rarely seen outside Belgium in more than nine decades.La Magie Noire will be exhibited at Sotheby’s Paris between 17 and 23 October before its sale on 24 October.Explore more on these topicsRené MagritteSecond world warFranceBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was convicted of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was unconscious.Dogan told the first trial last year that he thought it was just a game. “I’m not a rapist, that’s too heavy for me to bear,” he said. His lawyer declined to comment before the appeal trial.At first, 17 of the 51 convicted men said they would appeal against the verdict, but 16 gradually dropped out, leaving only one appeal.Dominique Pelicot, one of the worst sex offenders in modern French history, wassentenced to 20 years in prisonfor drugging his then wife and inviting dozens of men to rape her in her home in the south of France over a period of almost a decade of their marriage.Last year’s trial in Avignon heard that Dominique Pelicot had crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into Gisèle Pelicot’s mashed potato, coffee or ice-cream and invited dozens of men to rape her in thevillage of Mazanin south-east France, where the couple had retired. A total of 50 other men were found guilty.Now serving a prison sentence in solitary confinement, Dominique Pelicot will appear as a witness at the appeal court trial. He is expected to repeat what he said at the first trial: “I am a rapist and all the accused men in this room are rapists.”After Pelicot: how one woman’s courage has pushed France to a turning pointRead moreGisèle Pelicot,72, a former logistics manager, had insisted the first rape trial in 2024 be held in public to raise awareness of drug-induced rape and abuse. “It’s not for us to have shame, it’s for them,” she said in court.The case had a massive impact worldwide, with feminist groups on all continents backingGisèle Pelicotand world leaders issuing statements in her support.But campaigners and lawyers said the case was a glimpse of how widespread and commonplace rape and sexual violence remains.Last month, a 46-year-old man in Normandy was sentenced to 12 years in prison for raping his partner while she was asleep on several occasions in 2022. Like Dominique Pelicot, he first came to the attention of police for filming up a woman’s skirt in a supermarket. Like Dominique Pelicot, investigators then found videos of the rape of his partner on his electronic devices.The appeal trial in the Pelicot case takes place amid growing criticism of the French justice system’s treatment of rape. Several damning reports since the first trial last year have shown that the French system is continuing to fail rape complainants on a large scale.The European court of human rights this year condemned France for “failing to protect” the rights of three teenagers who reported rape.One teenagerwho accused more than a dozen firemen of abuse was found to have suffered “secondary victimisation and discriminatory treatment” by the French justice system, which failed to protect her dignity “by permitting the use of moralising and guilt-inducing statements, which propagated gender stereotypes”.In another case, that of an assistant hospital pharmacist who filed a rape complaint against her head of department, France was found to have violated the European convention on human rights.This month, the High Council for Equality, an advisory body attached to the French prime minister’s office, found ina reportthat despite a threefold increase in rape complaints in France since the worldwide #MeToo movement in 2016, the number of cases going to trial remained dangerously low, and the number of rape convictions amounted to only 3.3% of complaints.More than 130 feminist groups arecampaigning for sweeping reformof every level of the French justice system in dealing with rape, calling for major funding increases and better state support and prevention.Among these campaigners, Anne-Cécile Mailfert of the Fondation des Femmes said the Pelicot rape case last year “was a kind of electric shock, it allowed a lot of people to talk about rape and marital rape. However, there has not really been a political response. There is a great deal lacking in France, and serious dysfunction [in the justice system].”Separately, parliament is currently debating adding aconsent-based definitionof rape to the wording in French law.Marie-Charlotte Garin, a Green MP who backs rewording the law, said the Pelicot case had transformed French society’s understanding of consent and changing the law’s wording would help “a cultural change to move from a culture of rape to a culture of consent”.But Garin said wording was not enough to address persistent “failures” of the entire French state towards rape survivors. “We need a revolution in the system to improve how we deal with rape,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotFranceGisèle Pelicot rape trialRape and sexual assaultViolence against women and girlsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

SinceHamas’s partial acceptanceof his plan to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza on Friday, the US, Israel and Hamas have all said they believe aceasefire is within sight.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the Cairo talks were “the closest we’ve come to getting all the hostages released” in an interview with ABC on Sunday. He warned that talks could still falter over logistics, however, and that details of the hostage release needed to be worked out.Rubio said there were long-term challenges in implementing the deal, in particular the creation of a technocratic governing body to overseeGazain place of Hamas. He emphasised that the current priority was the hostages’ release and ensuring Israeli troops withdrew to an agreed upon line in Gaza.Trump’s plan would mean Hamas releasing all hostages within 72 hours, surrendering ruling power to a transnational authority headed by the US president, and laying down its arms. In return, Israel would gradually withdraw its troops from Gaza and return more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deal would release a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, parts of which are in famine, as well as reconstruction funds.On Saturday night, Trump shared a map of Gaza that delineated the initial withdrawal line of Israeli troops in Gaza, which ranged from 1.2 miles (2km) to 4 miles deep within the territory. He said if Hamas agreed to the withdrawal line, a ceasefire would begin immediately.Israeli forces are meant to completely withdraw to a buffer zone at the edge of Gaza under the terms of the plan, although the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that regardless of any deal, troops would remain in most of Gaza.Optimism about a potential ceasefire has grown across the world, with western and Arab leaders urging Hamas and Israel to come to a deal. On Sunday, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, called Netanyahu and expressed support for the Trump plan, describing it as “the best chance for peace”, according to a readout.Israeli officials have also said they hope to announce an end to the war in the coming days.A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse the group was “very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions”.Trump threatened Hamas with “complete obliteration” if it did not reach a deal on Gaza in an interview with CNN. He also said Netanyahu was onboard for ending the bombing of Gaza.Despite Trump’s request that Israel stop its assault and despite orders for the military to only conduct “defensive operations”, it has continued bombing the Palestinian territory. At least eight people were killed in separate strikes on Gaza City, while four other people were shot dead while seeking aid in the south of the strip.“While certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there’s no ceasefire in place at this point in time,” said Bedrosian.At least 67,139 people have been killed and about 170,000 injured by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza ministry of health, which said roughly half of those were women and children. Israel launched the campaign in retaliation after an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and involved 251 others being taken hostage.The UN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world’s leading association of genocide scholars have concluded thatIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the accusation and says it has only acted in self-defence.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaEgyptUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The remaining two-thirds of the seats will be selected through province-based electoral colleges, with seats distributed by population.There has been no direct popular vote as the interim authorities said the displacement of citizens and the loss of documents during the war years would make such a step impossible at this stage.During a speech at the National Library in Damascus, Sharaa said: “There are many pending laws that need to be voted on so that we move forward with the process of building and prosperity. BuildingSyriais a collective mission, and all Syrians must contribute to it.”The interim authorities dissolved Syria’s rubber-stamp legislature after taking power.The new 210-member body, the People’s Assembly, will be tasked with passing a new elections law and constitution. According to the organising committee, more than 1,500 candidates – just 14% of them women – are running for the assembly, which will have a renewable 30-month mandate while preparing for future polls.Under the rules, candidates must not be “supporters of the former regime” and must not promote secession or partition.Those standing include Syrian-American Henry Hamra, the first Jewish candidate since the 1940s.Elections were postponed indefinitely in Druze-majority Sweida province and in areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces due to tensions between the local authorities and Damascus.Critics argue the electoral college system could favour well-connected candidates, giving the interim government an unfair advantage while excluding some ethnic and religious minorities. But for others, the election was a sign of progress.When approached by election officials to join the electoral college, Lina Daaboul, a doctor in Damascus, said she initially refused, fearing the responsibility and the “ugly image” of past assemblies. But after learning she would only be part of the voting body, she agreed, calling it “a national duty”.On election day, Daaboul said: “This is the first time I’ve ever voted in my life. I’m happy, and I don’t mind standing in line for a long time.”Lara Eezouki, a member of the national elections committee in Damascus, noted that the new assembly includes all sects and groups and said it was “the first time in Syria’s history that the ballot box truly rules – when the results are not prearranged”.Ibrahim Halabi, a former soldier under Assad’s rule who defected after mass anti-government protests were met by a brutal crackdown and ensuing civil war in 2011, said: “This is the first time in our lives we’ve participated in a democratic electoral process without outside pressure.”Sharaa’s Islamist forces leda coalition that ousted Assad in December.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

Demonstrators took turns shaking the hand of the US president, or rather, a woman wearing a papier-mache Trump mask, while another woman stood silently holding a sign reading “we love Trump.”For nearly two years, Israelis have gathered in front of the ministry of defence and demanded the government bring home their loved ones. Now, asIsraeland Hamas seem to be on the cusp of a deal that could end the war and bring the hostages home, many Israelis are thanking Trump, not the Israeli government, for the potential peace.“This is the first day that I can feel happy in two years. And it’s because of Trump,” said Shabbat Moshe, a 71-year-old who works in the film industry and has four sons fighting in Gaza.Moshe joined thousands of others waving Israeli flags and wearing yellow ribbons that symbolise the hostages held byHamasin Gaza.View image in fullscreenA pro-Trump banner on the ground at Hostage Square on Saturday.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianDespite it being a commemoration of the nearly second anniversary of the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 people hostage, the mood was festive. The night before,Hamas had partially accepted Trump’s planto end the war in Gaza and to release the remaining 48 hostages it holds, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.“I’m cautiously optimistic. I’m not going overboard yet, I want to wait for the first hostages to come out before I say something is really happening here. But I’m more optimistic than I’ve been in a long time,” said Dani, a software engineer at the rally who declined to give his last name.Though previous ceasefire deals had collapsed, Dani thought that Trump’s personal involvement in the ceasefire negotiations meant that this round of talks was more likely to succeed. “This time it looks like all the parties are being dragged kicking and screaming to the table. And Trump is the one who is dragging them,” he said.The majority of Israelis – 66% according to a recentpollby the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) – think the war in Gaza has gone on too long.Dani, like many other Israelis and attenders at the rally, felt that Israel had long since achieved its goals in Gaza. The reason that it was still in Gaza, he said, was to ensure the political survival of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and his rightwing allies in the ruling coalition.“If Netanyahu has a way to sabotage the deal to keep the hardliners in line, he’ll try. But I think he doesn’t have a choice. I think, no I hope, that he’s a nonentity at this point,” Dani said.It is the hostages that drive the anti-war protests in Israel more than anything else. The safety of Palestinians in Gaza is low on the list for most people in Israel calling for the end of the war.According to the IDI poll, returning the hostages is the top reason given by respondents who want the war in Gaza to end. Only 5.9% of respondents say they want the war to end to stop harming the people of Gaza.This comes despite the mounting death toll in Gaza, where Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza ministry of health, which says about half of those casualties were women and children.A UN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world’s leading association of genocide studies also have concluded thatIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies this claim, saying its has acted only in self-defence.Protesters at the rally went one step further, with one demonstrator saying their fight in Gaza was being fought for the “benefit of the rest of the western world”.“The Europeans will understand very quickly what we’re dealing with. They opened the border to Muslims and now the local people will suffer,” said Tamara Poizner, a 53-year-old chief financial officer of a services company.“We would like the hostages back, I don’t care about the details. Hamas is still dangerous, their basic belief is that they want us dead and they want our land. This belief cannot die, you can kill thousands of people but not the idea,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Israeli and Hamas negotiators are preparing for talks in Cairo on Monday, but US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are facing roadblocks, including the process of prisoner exchanges, that could delay prospects for a immediate ceasefire.How likely is it that Trump’s Gaza plan will work?Read moreTrump told the network in a text exchange with host Jake Tapper “We will find out. Only time will tell!!!”, adding that he expects clarity “soon” on whether Hamas is genuinely committed to peace.In aseparate interviewon ABC New’s This Week, Rubio said third-party peace negotiations are “the closest we’ve come to getting all of the hostages released”.But he warned that the administration’s 20-point peace plan – to which Israel and Hamas have agreed subject to a several sticking points, including the disarming of Hamas – was likely subject to “a lot of pitfalls along the way. There’s some work to be done here.”Rubio said he “would encourage everyone” to think about the plan in two phases – one in which Hamas has accepted is the president’s framework for release, the hostages are released and Israel pulls back.But the logistics of that, he warned, are uncertain, including the process of exchange and who picks them up. “We want to see that happen very quickly,” he said. “The hostage piece has to happen very, very fast.”“I do have hope that they’ll be released. And I think there’s chances,” he added.Under the US plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages – about 20 of them believed to be alive – within three days. In return, Israel would halt its assault and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction.Israel continues Gaza bombardment as Trump plan negotiators arrive in CairoRead more“Hamas is very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions,” a Palestinian source told AFP on Sunday.But they warned that “the occupation must not obstruct the implementation of President Trump’s plan. If the occupation has genuine intentions to reach an agreement, Hamas is ready.”In his comments on US talk shows on Sunday, Rubio said the second phase of the US plan will involve discussions over what happens after Israel pulls back and how a new governance structure for Gaza would be created.“That’s the part that I think is going to be a little tougher to work through, but that’s what’s going to provide permanency to the end of the conflict,” he told ABC.He also told NBC’s Meet the Press that “everyone has agreed, including Israel, that eventually, at some point here as this process plays out, Gaza will be governed by a Palestinian technocratic group that’s not Hamas, that are not terrorists, with the help and the assistance and the guidance of an international consortium like the board of peace”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMarco RubioUS politicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Alcohol-related deathsare at an all-time high.“The epidemic of alcohol and drug use is getting worse. The government says we’re drinking less, but I don’t see that,” said Dr Niall Campbell, a psychiatrist specialising in addiction at the Priory group of clinics which commissioned the survey from Censuswide. The group has seen a 40% rise since 2019 in the number of people seeking help for addiction, including more women than men.The survey found:10% worry that they drink too much and 5% that they use drugs too often.26% worry that a partner, family member or friend drinks too much.16% are concerned about a loved one’s use of illegal drugs.Families that earn more than £50,000 a year are three times more likely to contain someone with an addiction problem.Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive ofAlcohol Change UK, said: “Sadly these findings are not a surprise and mirror our own studies on the widespread nature of alcohol harm across the drinking spectrum.“It also offers a stark reminder of the ripple effect of alcohol harm beyond individuals on those around them. With more than 10 million people in the UK exceeding the ‘low risk’ guidelines of 14 units a week – and these stats highlighting that over a quarter of us are worried about a loved one’s relationship with alcohol – it’s fair to estimate there are millions out there struggling with a family member or friend’s drinking, many of which will sit outside the realm of addiction.”In addition, one in seven respondents (15%) said addiction had affected multiple generations of their family. Campbell suggested that genetics might help to explain that, and some people may be copying the behaviour of one or both of their parents.The Priory, which treats private and NHS-funded patients at its UK clinics, is launching a campaign called Break the Chain to highlight how common intergenerational addiction is.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it was rebuilding NHS drug and alcohol treatment services in England after years of neglect. “This government inherited a situation where patients had been let down by years of under-investment into addiction services,” they said.“We have provided an additional £310m in 2025-26 to improve drug and alcohol treatment services and recovery support in England, on top of the public health grant. Our plan for change will shift healthcare towards prevention, including through early intervention, to support people to live longer, healthier lives across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholismDrugsHealthAlcoholNHSPrivate healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

He then compared that with his return drive through the parallel road, Bury New Road, where the Jewish community were “out in the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear”.Neville, who has built a vast property empire in Manchester since retiring from football in 2011, said he took down a union flag being displayed on one of his building sites.“Funnily enough on one of my development sites last week there was a union jack flag put up and I took it down instantly,” he said.“Some people might be watching this and thinking: ‘Gary you’re not really patriotic.’ I’ve played for my country 85 times, I love my country, I love Manchester and I loveEngland.”Neville, 50, said that in the years he has been building in the city, he had never seen union flags at the current rate and questioned why this was the case.“The union jack flag used in a negative fashion is not right and I’m a proud supporter of England, of Great Britain, of our country and will champion it anywhere in the world as one of the greatest places to live,” he said.“But I think we need to check ourselves, check ourselves and start to think about bringing ourselves back to a neutral point because we’re being pulled right and left and we don’t need to be pulled right and left at all.”The Sky Sports commentator has frequently voiced his opinions on political and social issues,including that people should “detest” the poor working conditionsfor migrant workers in Qatar and NHS staff in the UK, and criticising Boris Johnson for“fuelling” racism and hatredwhen he was prime minister.In his LinkedIn video, Neville commented on the diversity of football, saying that he played with people from across the UK and from around the world. “We were a beautiful team, united as one,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives.“Through our ‘plan for change’, we are putting more money back into working people’s pockets and making a simple dream a simple reality.”The government did not outline how it might prevent sellers passing any freshly inflated costs back on to first time buyers through higher house prices.The consultation process will cover the whole of the UK – even though the process of buying a home differs significantly depending on which nation the property is located in.For example, in England and Wales, there is no legal requirement to obtain a survey of a property before you buy it – although many buyers choose to commission one. In Scotland, however, the seller must provide a“home report” before they can put their property on the market– unless the property is a new-build home.The consultation process will also examine providing an option for buyers and sellers to sign binding contracts “to stop people walking away from agreements after buyers painstakingly spend months in negotiations”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A property purchase is legally binding in England once contracts are exchanged, which can take more than six weeks.

Peacehaven has always been a place of kindness, respect and mutual support, and we will continue to embody those values. We ask everyone to reject division and respond to hate with unity and compassion.”Sussex police said on Sunday evening: “This is not being treated as a terror-related incident at this time.”They have released images of two people they wish to identify in relation to the investigation. The photos show two masked individuals, with one wearing a distinctive black jacket with a Pre London logo in white on the chest, and the other wearing bright red gloves.View image in fullscreenCCTV footage issued by Sussex police of two people they wish to identify in connection with a suspected arson attack at a mosque in Peacehaven.Photograph: Sussex police/PAAppeals have been made by the police for anyone with information or footage captured on CCTV, dashcam, doorbell or mobile phone to contact the police.Det Supt Karrie Bohanna said: “We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result.”The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said the attack had followed what it described as “a disturbing pattern of violence and intimidation”, adding that an imam was stabbed last week in Hounslow, west London, and mosques had faced bomb threats and coordinated hate campaigns.Wajid Akhter, the MCB secretary-general, said: “These incidents do not occur in a vacuum. This comes as media and political figures escalate collective blame and deliberate misrepresentation of Muslim communities, their causes and their faith.”The incident was condemned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which said: “Every faith community has the right to worship free from fear.

Jewish community leaders, police and Keir Starmerhad called on Palestine Action protestersto refrain from demonstrating after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.Mahmood will also look at all anti-protest laws, with the possibility that powers to ban some demonstrations outright could be strengthened.Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer and former shadow attorney general, warned that the government should pause before passing draconian powers that could end up in the hands of a Nigel Farage-led government.“Street protest that isn’t a bit of a nuisance isn’t usually effective. But any government seeking to further restrict it should think about new powers in Farragist hands,” she said.Two Labour MPs also expressed concern at the move. One told the Guardian: “However distasteful the protests in favour of Palestine Action have been, we must not fall into the trap of making rushed laws which can be used in future to stop justifiable protests.”If a protest such as Saturday’s in support of Palestine Action takes place at the same site on several occasions, and causes repeated disorder, the police will get the power to instruct organisers to hold the event elsewhere, limit numbers and to set time limits,Home Officesources said.The changes will amend sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act of 1986, under which anyone breaching conditions set by police faces up to six months in jail, an unlimited fine, or both.Speaking on Sunday to Sky News, Mahmood said she believed there was “a gap in the law” that required action, and she aimed to act at speed.“What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption, that is to say the frequency of particular protests in particular places, is in and of itself, a reason for the police to be able to restrict and place conditions,” she said.View image in fullscreenShabana Mahmood, centre, who visited the scene of the Manchester synagogue attack on Thursday, said on Sunday that repeated large-scale demonstrations over Gaza had caused ‘considerable fear’ for the Jewish community.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesSpeaking later to BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mahmood denied this was about banning protest: “This is not about a ban. This is about restrictions and conditions that would enable the police to maybe put further time restrictions or move those protests to other places.“What I’m allowing is for the police to be able to take cumulative disruption into account, and it is important.”The Liberal Democrats warned that the plans for further protest restrictions would lead to a greater waste of police time while letting off those inciting violence.Max Wilkinson, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “The Conservatives made a total mess of protest laws. I fear Labour seem to be following them down the same path, instead of properly reforming these powers to focus on the real criminals and hate preachers.”The plans could be challenged in the courts because they mirror failed moves by the former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman to curb protests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May 2024,the high court agreed with Libertythat Braverman’s legislation had been unlawful.Home Office sources pointed out that Liberty won the 2023 case because ministers tried to change the definition of “serious public disorder”, lowering it to cover any crime “more than minor” through a statutory instrument.Officials believe the measures this time will be more robust because they are not trying to lower the threshold and are planning to use primary legislation.Tom Southerden, a director at Amnesty International UK, said the government’s proposal was “ludicrous” and may be a “cynical” attempt to look tough.Akiko Hart, Liberty’s director, said: “The police already have immense powers to restrict protests – handing them even more would undermine our rights further while failing to keep people safe from violence like the horrific and heartbreaking antisemitic attack in Manchester.”Defend Our Juries said there would be mass civil disobedience defying the ban from 18 to 28 November, in the lead up to and throughout the judicial review.In a letter to chief constables on Sunday, Mahmood warned that “the country faces a period of heightened tensions and division” and thanked police for their response to Thursday’s attack.“I have confirmed the government will bring forward legislation to increase the powers available to you to tackle the repeated disruptive protests we have seen, and continue to provide the reassurance to communities that they need.“And I will review more widely the full suite of public order legislation, to ensure that it keeps pace with the continued changes in the scale, nature and frequency of protests,” she wrote.The planned new powers follow protest-related measures in the crime and policing bill going through parliament, which would ban the possession of face coverings or fireworks or flares at protests, and criminalise the climbing of certain war memorials.Explore more on these topicsProtestPoliceUK civil libertiesLondonShabana MahmoodIsrael-Gaza warHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

A CBS poll found just 28% of Democratic voters and 23% ofRepublicansconsider their party’s positions worth shutting down the government.In his comments to NBC’s Meet the Press, Johnson said his body had done its work in passing a measure to keep the government financed but now it was up to the Senate “to turn the lights back on so that everyone can do their work”. He accusedDemocratsof failing to engage “in a serious negotiation”.“They’re doing this to get political cover because Chuck Schumer is afraid that he won’t win his next re-election bid in the Senate because he’s going to be challenged by a Marxist in New York, because that’s the new popular thing out there,” he said, referring toAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Bronx representative who may be looking to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat next year.Mike Johnson hasn’t sworn in this new Democrat. Is it because she wants to release the Epstein files?Read moreBut Johnson’s counterpart, minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, told the same show JD Vance lied last week when heclaimedDemocrats were themselves being dishonest claiming they are not trying to give healthcare benefits to undocumented immigrants.“Republicans are lying because they’re losing in the court of public opinion,” Jeffries said, and added his party was “standing up for the healthcare of hard-working American taxpayers, of working-class Americans, of middle-class Americans”.Jeffries also hit back at comments byDonald Trumpin a social media post on Thursday in which he called Democrats the party of “the party of hate, evil, and Satan” alongside pictures of party figures, including Ocasio-Cortez, Schumer, speaker emeritus Nancy Pelosi, and former president and first lady Joe and Jill Biden.Asked if he could still negotiate with Trump, Jeffries said the president’s behavior “is outrageous, it’s unhinged, it’s unreasonable, and it speaks for itself. The American people deserve better than lies, than attacks, than deepfake videos and the president spending all of his time on the golf course.”Leaders of the political leadership have not had formal talks for almost a week as both seek to gain a political edge ahead of renewed discussions.Jeffries said that since that meeting last Monday, “Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent” and the Democratic party leadership “will continue to make clear, leader Schumer and myself, that we will sit down any time, any place, with anyone to address this issue with the seriousness that it deserves”.The battle for high political ground continued on Sunday with Johnson claiming that the potential for temporary government job suspensions, known as furloughs, hardening intopermanent job layoffs“is a regrettable situation that the president does not want”.White House national economic council director Kevin Hassett increased pressure on Democrats, saying the Trump administration will start mass layoffs of federal workers if Trump decides negotiations with Democrats are “absolutely going nowhere”.Hassett told CNN’s State of the Union that Trump and Vought “are lining things up and getting ready to act if they have to, but hoping that they don’t”. But he predicted it is possible that Democrats could back down.“I think that everybody is still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it’s just common sense to avoid layoffs like that,” Hassett said.But some fear Democrats have walked into a trap. Johnson said on Sunday that Trump had asked the Democratic leadership to keep the government open.“In a situation like this, where the Senate Democrats have decided to turn the keys to the kingdom over to the White House, they have to make tough decisions,” he said, pointing toRuss Vought, the director of the office of management and budget.Vought, Johnson said, “has to now look at all of the federal government, recognizing that the funding streams have been turned off and determine what are essential programs, policies, and personnel. That’s not a job that he relishes. But he’s being required to do it by Chuck Schumer.”The spirit of mutual recrimination continued with Schumer telling CBS Johnson “doesn’t want to discuss the real issue, the healthcare crisis facing the American people. So he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention.”Democrats are embracing the risky politics of a government shutdown to rein in president, activists sayRead moreBut in an interview set to broadcast on Monday, Johnson told MSNBC he considers the issue of expiring healthcare subsidies – that Democrats place central to their negotiating position – as one that can be addressed later.“We have effectively three months to negotiate in the White House and in the hall of Congress, that’s like an eternity,” Johnson said. “We need folks in good faith to come around the table and have that discussion. And we can’t do it when the government is shut down,” he added.Adam Schiff, a California senator also speaking to Meet the Press, was asked if his party delegates in the Senate would stay united after three Democratic senatorsbroke away to vote with Republicans. Schiff said he was confident that “all Democrats understand that millions and millions of their constituents are about to be priced out of their healthcare”.“We need a president who can act like an adult, who can come to the table and negotiate an end to their self-imposed healthcare crisis,” Schiff said. “Right now we don’t see that. We see Trump out on the golf course, we see the speaker telling his House colleagues not to even come to session, that there’s no work for the federal government to do, apparently.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Mike JohnsonDemocratsUS CongressUS federal government shutdownsHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is my second time hosting and my fourth time being here,” he said as he took the stage. “I’m doing theSuper Bowlhalf-time show. I’m very happy and I think everyone is happy about it.”Saturday Night Live: Bad Bunny is game but the season opener is mostly toothlessRead moreThe line was followed by a quick montage of Fox news contributors, each saying one word that was clipped together to say, “He should be the next President.”During the opening, the artist included some words in Spanish that he devoted to “all the Latinos and Latinas in the entire world and here in the United States”.“More than being an accomplishment of mine, it’s an accomplishment for everybody, demonstrating that our mark and our contribution to this country will never be able to be removed or erased by anybody,” he said in Spanish. Afterwards, he said in English, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”The announcement thatBad Bunnywould headline the Super Bowl half-time show sparked a wave of conservative outrage including from Noem.Trump’s homeland security secretary said on a rightwing podcast on Friday that only Americans should attend next year’sSuper Bowland warned thatIceagents “will be all over” the event. She also said the NFL will “not be able to sleep at night” over its decision to chooseBad Bunnyas the half-time performer.Bad Bunny was born and raised in Puerto Rico, a US territory, and is an American citizen.Bad Bunny has said that fears that his fans would be subjected to immigration raids prompted him to exclude the US from his forthcoming worldtour. The musician just wrapped a three-month concert series in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which drew in an estimated 600,000attendees.“My residence was beautiful, everyone loved it,” he said during his monologue, acknowledging the success of the recent tour.In other sketches during the 51st season opener, Colin Jost stepped in as Pete Hegseth. “You will now be yelled at by a former Fox News host,” a colleague announced as Jost entered, before the sketch turned to an angry tirade on the US military.“Our military will now have the same rules as any good frat party: No fat chicks. And if you’re a fat dude, goddam it, you better be funny as hell,” Jost said, a clear reference to Hegeth’s recent call out against diversity and fat shaming of troops as he directed generals to fall in line orquit.Trump, played by James Austin Johnson, also made a brief appearance, not as the sketch’s target but as its self-appointed monitor. “I’m just here keeping my eye on SNL, making sure they don’t say anything too mean about me.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationBad BunnyUS politicsSuper BowlUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The move came just weeks after national guard troops were sent toWashington, where the president federalized the city’s police force in what he described as a “crackdown” on crime, a pattern now extending to a string of other US cities. “We’re going to be doing Chicago probably next,” Trump had said at the time.Noem defended the administration’s course of action, insisting on Fox that residents supported the government intervention. “They understand that where we have gone we have made it much more free,” she said. “People are much safer, we have got a thousand criminals that are off the streets ofChicago, just because we’ve been there.”Appearing on CNN’sState of the Union with Jake Tapper on Sunday, the DemocraticIllinoisgovernor, JB Pritzker, accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. “They are the ones who are making it a war zone,” he said.“They need to get out of Chicago. If they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they are going to do, they need to get the heck out.”Border patrol agents on Saturday shot and injured a woman while firing at someone who tried to run them over. The woman who was shot was a US citizen and was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, noting that the woman was accused in a US Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin last week of doxing agents.Pritzker also condemned the deployment in a post onXon Saturday, writing: “The Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.” Pritzker called the decision “absolutely outrageous and un-American,” and added that it had been made “against our will”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationKristi NoemUS politicsChicagoIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

Especially online.As a government shutdown loomed in the US last week, the presidentposted an AI videowhich depicted Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black House minority leader, wearing a sombrero and exaggerated moustache, with mariachi music playing in the background.Hispanic groupscriticizedTrump’s posts as “racist”, “dangerous” and “reprehensible”, but Trump doubled down, posting a new video which showed himself wearing a sombrero and playing the guitar behind a rendering of Jeffries.It wasn’t the only situation where Trump’s behavior has seemed unusual. Last weekend Trumpreposted to Truth Socialan AI-generated fake video which promoted “med bed hospitals”. Trump has reposted AI content before, but the difference was that this video showed an AI version of himself speaking.“Every American will soon receive their own med bed card,” the AI rendering of Trump, apparently seated in the Oval Office, said. “With it, you’ll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world.”Setting aside the fact that the idea of “med beds” is a rightwing conspiracy theory – one version of the theory posits that the government and/or a group of wealthy Americans have access to medical bed-like devices that can cure almost every illness, but are withholding the technology – Trump’s post prompted a number of questions.Did Trump, 79, believe that the video really showed him announcing med bed hospitals? Does the president think he gave a speech about med beds at the White House? Does he believe that his government is about to send “med bed cards” to every US citizen?The post was ultimately deleted, but it remains baffling, and the White House’s response did little to allay the confusion.“I think the president saw the video and posted it, and then took it down,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary,saidwhen asked about the video on Wednesday.“And he has the right to do that. It’s his social media. He’s incredibly transparent, as you all know. You hear from him directly on social media. He likes to share memes, he likes to share videos, he likes to repost things that he sees other people post on social media as well and I think it’s quite refreshing that we have a president who is so open and honest.”Leavitt’s words did little to explain Trump’s thinking as to why he might have posted the fake video. But, in truth, it was only the most recent example of increasingly odd behavior from Trump, who has – like his predecessor Joe Biden – beensubject to questionsover his mental acuity in recent months.Ina recent speech at the White Housewhere Trump claimed –against most existing evidence– that Tylenol could contribute to autism if women take it during pregnancy, Trump confusingly spoke of “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby”.Announcing that 13 grants would be awarded to investigate autism, Trump added: “They have to move quickly. They, they – when the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let’s do it now. I was just saying to Bobby [health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr] and the group, let’s do it now. Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”A week earlier, during a press conference with British prime minister Keir Starmer, TrumpconfusedAlbania with Armenia when discussing a peace deal struck between Armenia and Azerbaijan – a mistake Trump also made duringan appearance on Fox News.Back in the social media world, on Sunday Trumpwrote on Truth Socialthat he had “been briefed” on a shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan which killed four people. “The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do,” Trump wrote.He did indeed post again. But it was not an update on the still unfolding tragedy in Michigan. Instead, three hours later, he shared a video which showed an array of gold fixtures and fittings.“Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House. Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, ‘freak out’ when they see the quality and beauty. Best Oval Office ever, in terms of success and look!!! President DJT,”he wrote.He did not comment again that day on the Michigan shooting, although he did complain about the newNFL kickoff rule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”Trump continued: “I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.“We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”In the same speech, Trump claimed that cities including San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles are “very unsafe places and we’re going to straighten them out one by one”. The president then casually mentioned that he had told Pete Hegseth, the newly-annointed secretary of war, that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military”.The address prompted immediate concern, including from former military members. Barry McCaffrey, a retired general,told MSNBCthat Trump’s performance was “one of the most bizarre, unsettling events I’ve ever encountered”.“The president sounded incoherent, exhausted, rabidly partisan, at times stupid, meandering, couldn’t hold a thought together,” McCaffrey said.Trump’s speech was enough for Madeleine Dean, a Democratic congresswoman from Pennsylvania, to confront the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, in Washington on Wednesday, although Johnson appeared unconcerned.“The president is unhinged. He is unwell,”Dean told Johnson, in an encounter filmed by journalists.“Well a lot of folks on your side are too,” Johnson responded.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In the decades since, maple, oak and other hardwood trees have taken over, returning to nature a region previously better known for extraction.Home to important waterways, the easternhellbender salamander– an amphibianproposed for listingas an endangered species – hundreds of miles of trails and a host of other outdoor recreational activities, the Wayne national forest draws a quarter million visitors every year.“People use the national forest for fishing, hunting, whether they’re trail runners or cyclists or ATV or horseback riders [and] for camping,” says Molly Jo Stanley of theOhioEnvironmental Council who lives several miles from its borders.All the while, underneath the forest floor, gob piles – a layer of coal waste material about a foot deep – is kept in place by the roots of millions of trees and plants.But now, with theTrump administrationtargeting 100m acres of forest across the country for logging, this critical wilderness area – Ohio’s sole national forest – could be wiped out.View image in fullscreenA man rides his ATV along a trail that runs through the Wayne national forest near Ironton, Ohio, in 2004.Photograph: Howie Mccormick/APTrump’s executive order was followed by amemo in Aprilfrom the secretary for agriculture, Brooke Rollins, that established an “emergency declaration situation” that specifically identified the Wayne national forest as a site for lumber production. The memo also outlined the government’s intention to remove protections previously established by the National Environmental Policy Act.The US Forest Service managesalmost 300,000 sq milesof 154 national forests around the country, of which about one-fourth is suitable for timber management. Tracts of trees are regularly sold to private and other lumber companies often following a bidding process. Staff shortages and a lack of interest from lumber buyers in recent years have resulted in the Forest Service missing its sales targets by around 10% on average over the past decade.Butmore than 80%of the Wayne national forest is classified as suitable for logging, drawing concern from locals.“This executive order is a sweeping set of rules that does not address the nuances of the forests across the country. [It] stated that it was to prevent forest fires. In Ohio, clear-cutting forests is not the way to prevent forest fires,” says Stanley.“While timbering is not inherently a bad thing, large-scale timbering has a lot of impact on our ecosystems. The roads that have to be built to access the timber cost the taxpayer more money than the revenue generated from these timbering projects.”Unlike the huge forests and wilderness areas of the American west, federal forests where the public can forage and enjoy nature are relatively uncommon in the industrial Midwest.On top of that, the large-scale removal of trees could fuel major leaching of pollutants that have remained in the soil from the mining days but which, without live tree roots keeping it in place, could flow into waterways, poisoning drinking water for local communities.Tens of millions of people depend on drinking water that originates upstream in national forests, say observers. The Ohio River, which has a greater discharge rate than the Colombia and Yukon Rivers, is just miles from one unit of the Wayne national forest.Other major threats resulting from clearcutting logging are increased fire risks and landslides, say experts.“Over and over, we’ve seen in Appalachia and across the country when you log areas, you potentially increase the danger of wildfires because you increase the roads thatlead to 90% of wildfires[that occur] within a half-mile. Opening up big areas allows for more wind, leaves behind a lot of slash and tinder – logging companies only take the big trees,” says Will Harlan, a senior scientist at the Center of Biological Diversity, who has experienced firsthand the destruction of forests around Asheville, North Carolina, fromlast year’s devastating Hurricane Helene.“We saw here that thelandslides after Hurricane Helenein the Pisgah and Nantahala national forests, many of those occurred where there were logging projects and logging roads.”Building and maintaining roads and culverts in forests hascost taxpayers billions of dollarsover the decades.But advocates of harvesting lumber on public lands say it brings significant economic benefits to rural areas of the country that often find themselves with few other resources or opportunities for employment. In 2020, the Forest Service sold $183m worth of lumber from national forests, fueling tens of thousands of direct and indirect jobs.Themost recent saleof Wayne national forest lumber was for over 300,000 cubic feet of hardwood and eastern white pine that took place in August. Logging in Ohio is worth over $1.1bn a year, with much of that concentrated in seven southeastern counties including Athens county.Questions sent by the Guardian to the US Forest Service and the Ohio forestry association querying whether logging could imperil drinking water sources for residents were not responded to.In Athens county, where thepoverty rateis 11% above the national level and which ranks as theonly county in Ohiofacing persistent poverty over a period of decades, access to jobs isamong the lowest in the state.In August, theclosure of a paper millthat used low-grade locally sourced hardwood lumber and employed 800 people in Chillicothe, a town of 22,000 people two counties west of Athens, has sent the region into a tailspin. The mill had provided a ready processing site for local lumber since it was founded in 1847.All the while, conservationists question the need to log areas such as national forests especially as the USexported $3.5bn worth of lumberin 2021.“Ninety-eight per cent of forests in Ohio are privately-owned. Do we really need to be logging in the 2% that belongs to everyone?” asks Harlan.At the same time, Appalachia is set to be among the hardest-hit regions from long-term climate change due to topographical, funding and other challenges.“In Appalachia, we’ve been seeinghistoric flooding events,” says Stanley.“Without these intact forests, large-scale logging will absolutely impact and increase the potential for major flooding events. Intact forests are the best control that we have against that.”Explore more on these topicsOhioTrees and forestsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you,terrifying.In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us:enshittification. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It isn’t just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?Here’s the natural history of enshittification:1First, platforms are good to their users.2Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.3Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. TakeAmazon, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan forAmazon, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?Stage1: good tousersAmazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hardnotto shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook, Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.Stage2: abusing users, good to businessesAmazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threatssimply because they were large. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.It was under this theory thatJimmy Carterstarted to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. ThenRonald Reagancame along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reaganstarted under Carter, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including)Joe Biden.The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.Stage3: a giant pile of shitAmazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, tocream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.Same withFulfilment by Amazon, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.Top results in a product search aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to be top of the listHere’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to theUS Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than$50bn every yearcharging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “Amazon’s pricing paradox”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there,andthe merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page isbad. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.The internet is not the most important issue facing us. But it is where fights against genocide, inequality and racism will be wagedThis is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If theydocheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Whywouldthe company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.Aconfession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawnedOccupyandBlack Lives Matterhas become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.Audre Lordewas far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buyingRead moreYou won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers andwarehouse workers. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.Martin Luther King Jronce said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important.This is an edited extract from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow, published by Verso at £22 on 14 October.

Amazon consistently offers customers the lowest prices across the widest selection of products and was recognised in 2024 by independent research firm Profitero as the lowest-priced UK retailer for the fifth year running.

Don’t insult them by paying them lessA boomerang hire comes with much less risk because you know what you’re getting. And you’re proposing to low-ball?Gene MarksSun 5 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 10.02 EDTShareSay you’re running a business and you bump into a favored former employee and find out she’s interested in coming back to work for you. Is your first thought: “What a great opportunity to pay her less?” And if so, what is wrong with you?Boomerang hires – those workers who work for a company, leave the company, then come back to the company – can be extremely valuable. What’s curious is how many of my clients don’t seem to realize this.Quartzrecently reportedthat boomerang hires were being offered significantly lower compensation from their former employers than they had earned when they worked there previously.“Creative professionals including writers, designers, PR staff, and marketing executives – even some public-sector staff – describe a pattern of former employers reaching out with familiar work, only at sharply reduced rates,” they wrote.Why? Some employers are citing AI as the problem as if AI – with its massive hallucination rates, inaccuracies and errors – can be relied upon as a replacement for workers.The New York Timesrecently reportedthat “of the 80% of companies using generative AI, just as many say they’ve seen no significant bottom-line impact, with as many as 42% of companies reporting they abandoned most of their AI pilot projects by the end of 2024, up sharply from 17% a year earlier”.Another report from MITfound that about 95% of AI pilot programs “fail to deliver measurable profit-and-loss impact”.The age of AI actually replacing workers is still a long way off and, if anything, a boomerang hire that knows the job has the potential to leverage AI to be even more productive than before.Lower compensation can also be tied to budget issues, because, as one recruitment expert told Quartz: “Leaders feel pressure to show savings fast, so they reopen a familiar seat at a discount instead of rescoping the work.”These employers are making a big mistake.People leave their jobs for all sorts of reasons, both personal and professional. Younger employees in particular are more used to hopping around from company to company more so than their older counterparts. And given the lack of corporate loyalty, who can blame them? Changing jobs – and then changing back – is just a fact of these times. It’s not a negative. It’s a reality of today’s workplace.Which is why a boomerang hire is much more valuable to an employer than any other hire. They’ve seen your business, worked with your people, and they actually want to come back! Other employees see this and think to themselves that your company must be doing something right if this good person left and then wanted to return.Another advantage: if an employee has been away for a while, they have likely worked at other, similar companies. As a business owner, you should be mining that person for information. This is valuable knowledge.A boomerang hire comes with much less risk because you know what you’re getting. You don’t need references, background checks or testing: it’s all happened before. Without lifting a finger, you’re already saving money when you hire this person.So now you’re proposing to pay them less?Employees are not auto parts, cans of beans or construction materials where negotiating the lowest cost is encouraged. They are people. Offering to pay them less than what they were paid before – despite all the benefits an employer gets by hiring them back – is insulting, degrading and embarrassing and will do nothing more than create resentment. This is not the way to treat people. And it’s no way to run a growing business that relies on great talent as its core asset.If you’re not convinced, then consider the legal ramifications. According to the Quartz report a number of states have “retaliation” provisions included in their labor laws. An employment law attorney said in the article that it’s a risk for employers not to consider these rules.“The real issue isn’t the lower offer itself,” he explained. “It’s what employers say during these conversations. I’ve seen companies admit they’re ‘testing the waters or assume someone will work for less because they’re desperate. Those statements become smoking guns.”The labor market is still tight and the competition for good talent is high. If you’re an employer that has the chance to hire a former worker – regardless of who initiates the conversation – that’s reliable and productive then don’t be dumb by insulting that worker with a lower pay offer. You’re not doing the math correctly.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Broncos batted down Jalen Hurts’ last-gasp pass on the final play of the game to send the Super Bowl champions to just their second loss in their last 22 games. The Broncos (3-2) caught a huge break in their rally when the Eagles had a late fourth-down conversion called back on an illegal shift penalty whistled against running back Saquon Barkley.Houston Texans 44–10 Baltimore RavensCJ Stroud threw for 244 yards and four touchdowns, and Houston (2-3) strolled to a 44-10 win over a depleted Baltimore team, matching both the most lopsided road win in Texans’ history and the most lopsided home loss in Ravens’ history. Baltimore (1-4) were without two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, and that was far from their only problem. Defensive standouts Kyle Hamilton, Roquan Smith and Marlon Humphrey all missed the game, and the Ravens already were weakened on that side of the ball because of a neck problem that ended Nnamdi Madubuike’s season. Baltimore were also without All-Pro fullback Patrick Ricard and tackle Ronnie Stanley.Washington Commanders 27–10 Los Angeles ChargersJacory Croskey-Merritt scored two touchdowns, and the Washington Commanders (3-2) rallied from a 10-point deficit after forcing a big fumble in the second quarter to score 27 straight points and beat the Los Angeles Chargers (3-2). Washington’s Jayden Daniels was 15 of 26 for 231 yards and a touchdown after missing two games with an injured left knee. The Chargers were one of the least penalized teams in the first three weeks of the season, when they were 3-0. But they were done in by sloppy play last week, with 15 penalties for 107 yards in a 21-18 loss at the New York Giants. Back home at SoFi Stadium, it happened again. They had 10 penalties for 85 yards and three turnovers in Washington territory.Las Vegas Raiders 6–40 Indianapolis ColtsJonathan Taylor ran for three touchdowns and a two-point conversion, and Daniel Jones threw two touchdown passes as the Indianapolis Colts routed the Las Vegas Raiders. The 34-point margin was Indy’s largest since 2013. Jones finished 20 of 29 for 212 yards and moved to 4-1 as a starter this year, surpassing his combined victory total over the past two seasons with the New York Giants. Taylor rushed 17 times for 66 yards and caught three passes for 20 yards. The Colts converted a blocked punt, two interceptions and a turnover on downs into TDs. Las Vegas fell to 4-1.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 38–35 Seattle SeahawksLavonte David intercepted Sam Darnold with 58 seconds left and Chase McLaughlin kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4-1) a thrilling win over the Seattle Seahawks (3-2). Baker Mayfield tied it for the Bucs with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard with 1:08 left, and the Seahawks took over with the chance to drive for the winning score. But David’s pick on a deflected ball negated the need for any further heroics by Mayfield. He threw for 379 yards and two touchdowns, and Darnold threw for 341 yards and four TDs.Detroit Lions 37–24 Cincinnati BengalsDavid Montgomery ran for a touchdown and threw for one on a trick play in his hometown and the Detroit Lions (4-1) rolled to their fourth straight win, this time over the reeling Cincinnati Bengals (2-3). Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes for the Lions. Montgomery, a seven-year veteran, had passing and rushing scores in a game for the second time. He played quarterback at Cincinnati Mt Healthy High School and had more than 20 friends and relatives at the game. The Bengals have dropped three straight by a combined total of 113-37 since star quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a toe injury during a win over Jacksonville.Dallas Cowboys 37-22 New York JetsDak Prescott threw four touchdown passes, leading the Dallas Cowboys to an easy victory over the New York Jets. Dallas scored on two 90-yard drives in the second quarter, despite missing four starters on the offensive line. Javonte Williams ran for 135 yards and a touchdown and also caught a TD pass. The Cowboys, now 2-2-1, bounced back from a 40-40 tie against Green Bay last week. The Jets remain winless at 0-5 in Aaron Glenn’s first season as head coach.Tennessee Titans 22–21 Arizona CardinalsCam Ward throws for a career-high 265 yards, leading the Tennessee Titans to an improbable victory over the Arizona Cardinals. The Titans snap a 10-game losing streak with a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback. The Cardinals led 21-6 in the fourth quarter but made crucial mistakes. Emari Demercado dropped the ball before crossing the goalline, resulting in a fumble. The Titans capitalized, scoring a touchdown. Later, Dadrion Taylor-Demerson intercepted a pass but fumbled, allowing the Titans to score again. Joey Slye’s 29-yard field goal sealed the win. Calvin Ridley had five catches for 131 yards.Minnesota Vikings 21–17 Cleveland BrownsVikings receiver Jordan Addison caught a 12-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz with 25 seconds left to give Minnesota victory over the Cleveland Browns at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 10-play, 80-yard drive gave the Vikings (3-2) a much-needed win on their historic international road trip, which started with a 24-21 loss to the Steelers in Dublin last week. It also spoiled Dillon Gabriel’s firstNFLstart, as the Browns rookie put his team (1-4) in position to win by throwing two touchdown passes. Fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins rushed for 110 yards on 23 carries. Wentz shook off a shoulder injury that briefly sent him to the locker room and led two scoring drives in the second half.Miami Dolphins 24-27 Carolina PanthersBryce Young threw for two touchdowns and Rico Dowdle ran for 206 yards and a touchdown as the Carolina Panthers rallied past the Miami Dolphins in Charlotte. Young’s short pass to rookie tight end Mitchell Evans with 1:59 to play gave the Panthers (2-3) the lead for good as they matched the largest comeback to win a game in franchise history by overcoming a 17-point hole. Young had a horrific first quarter, but he ended up 19-for-30 passing for 198 yards with an interception. Dowdle, filling in for injured Chuba Hubbard, did his work on the ground on 23 carries, coming up four yards shy of matching the single-game franchise rushing record. Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa completed 27 of 36 throws for 256 yards with three touchdowns and Jaylen Waddle gained 110 receiving yards on six catches and scored a touchdown, but the Dolphins (1-4) dropped to 0-3 in road games.New York Giants 14–26 New Orleans SaintsSpencer Rattler passed for an 87-yard touchdown to Rashid Shaheed, safety Jordan Howden returned a fumble 86 yards for a score, and New Orleans defeated the turnover-prone New York Giants for the Saints’ first victory under rookie coach Kellen Moore. Rattler earned his first victory in 11 career starts, passing for 225 yards without a turnover. Giants rookie QB Jaxson Dart, who won his first career start last week, passed for 202 yards and two touchdowns, but also turned the ball over three times. New York turned the ball over five times in all, none more costly than when Bryan Bresee stripped running back Cam Skattebo, leading to Howden’s TD. Both teams are 1-4.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The driver said he believed “this guy is trying to kill me” and used pepper spray to protect himself. When the spray did not stop Sanchez advancing on him, the man said he stabbed the former quarterback “two or three times”. Sanchez then allegedly threw the man against a dumpster before “a look of shock” came across his face and he “took off”. Detectives have reviewed video footage of the incident. Witnesses said Sanchez and the driver filmed each other with the cellphones during the incident.“Mr Sanchez is seen running after [the man] and the video shows Mr Sanchez grabbing and throwing [the man] towards the wall of the Westin, hotel,” police wrote in the affidavit. “Mr Sanchez is then seen throwing [the man] to the ground on the west side of the alley.”The Indianapolis Star reportedthe confrontation started after Sanchez and the driver argued over a parking spot. Sanchez is alleged to have told the man, who was picking up frying oil from the hotel, that the manager said he did not want the oil picked up. Sanchez is then said to have attempted to enter the man’s truck.Ex-NFL player and Fox Sports star Mark Sanchez arrested after being stabbedRead moreThe incident left Sanchez with stab wounds to his torso while the driver suffered cuts to his face. Sanchez was treated in hospital for his injuries, which were not life-threatening, before he was arrested on Saturday. He is due to appear at a hearing on Tuesday morning.According to the affidavit, Sanchez told police “all he could remember was grabbing for a window.” He did not remember who stabbed him or where the incident occurred.“This incident should never have happened,” Marion county prosecutor Ryan Mears said in a statement on Sunday. “What began as a disagreement between a 38-year-old former professional athlete and a 69-year-old man should not have escalated into violence or left anyone seriously injured. As with any case, we will follow the facts and the law wherever they lead.”Sanchez was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts’ game with the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday afternoon as part of his Fox Sports duties. Another former NFL quarterback, Brady Quinn, replaced Sanchez in the booth for Sunday’s game. Fox acknowledged the incident briefly on Sunday’s pregame show,with host Curt Menefee saying: “we are all still trying to wrap our heads around it … our thoughts and prayers are with Mark, his family and all those involved”.Sanchez joined Fox in 2021 and also contributes to FS1 studio programming.Before his broadcasting career, Sanchez played 10 seasons in the NFL with several teams, including theNew York Jets, who took him with the fifth overall pick of the 2009 draft. He later played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He retired in July 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Off the field, Sanchez married his wife, Perry, in 2023. The couple shares three children.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsIndianapolisUS sportsFoxShareReuse this content"

Young, who tied a career playoff high in total points, fell just short of the league record of 22 points for any postseason quarter. Reigning MVP A’ja Wilson was typically brilliant as she recorded a double-double with 28 points and 14 rebounds.After a 3-of-13 performance from the field in Game 1, which Young attributed to fatigue, the All-Star guard promised coach Becky Hammon that she’d have her legs back for Game 2.“[Young] is a player that never wants to come out of the game,” Hammon said. “So, when she tells me she doesn’t have any legs and she pulls herself out basically, I know she’s hurting and doesn’t have anything left in the tank. Yesterday, I asked her how she felt and she said ‘Good, I’ll have my legs tomorrow,’ and that was pretty much it. I believed her.”While there are certainly more forward-facing stars in the league, Young has quietly become perhaps the most consistent guard in an era of women’s basketball where backcourt positions are being played at the highest level in league history.“It’s a joy (playing with Young),” Wilson said. “Take the numbers away, I’m just so proud of her. Honestly, like she’s a perfectionist, and when you see someone that works so hard every single day and then you get to see the hard work paying off, it’s a beautiful thing to witness.“I’m so grateful just to be her teammate, to come to work with her every single day. I’m a pain in the ass sometimes when she’s not doing her job, because I know that it’s there. I know that Jackie Young’s there. So I try every single day to bring it out of her. To be able to witness it and live it has been a lot of fun.”Kahleah Copper led the Mercury with 23 points, Satou Sabally scored 22 and Alyssa Thomas had 10 while coping with foul trouble much of the game.As had been the case in Game 1 when they began with a 10-2 lead, the Mercury came out strong, scoring the first seven points. Phoenix wound up with 27 points in the first quarter, but then the Aces held the Mercury to a combined 24 points over the following two periods. By that point, the Aces had taken charge, leading 76-51 going into the fourth and eventually going up by as much as 22 points.Any team facing Aces coach Becky Hammon in a Game 2 in Las Vegas is asking for trouble. She ran her record to 9-0 with this victory, the average margin being more than 17 points.Game 3 is Wednesday in Phoenix, where the Aces hope to put a stranglehold on the series as they chase their third title in four years. The Mercury have the tall task of needing to win four of five games to capture their fourth championship, which would tie theWNBArecord.“We’re excited to go play in our home arena,” Phoenix head coach Nate Tibbetts said. “Vegas did what they’re supposed to do. I think we played a really good Game 1, and they came out and were ready today.”Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesPhoenix MercuryBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair finished third and fourth as Norris narrowed the gap on his title rival to 22 points with six meetings remaining.Piastri was furious at the time, decrying it as unfair that the team would not intervene to have Norris return the place because he believed he had barged him out of the way. However, the stewards took no action.“I misjudged a little bit how close I was to Max, but that is racing and I would have ended up ahead of Oscar anyway. I was on the inside and the last thing I want to do is to make contact with my teammate,” said Norris. “With the [championship] position I am in, I cannot afford to do that compared to him. The FIA thought it was fine and the team did so too.”Piastri said he would reserve judgment until the team held a debriefing. “I need to look more at the replays and in more detail and come to my conclusion then,” he said. “It is the first lap, tensions are high and we are encouraged to share our views on what happened. I did that and we will discuss it moving forward.”The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, also maintained the team would take under consideration their approach to managing their drivers. “We have to put everything in perspective. It’s the comments from a driver in a Formula One car, there’s the heat of the moment. The information that is available is just his point of view.

He then compared that with his return drive through the parallel road, Bury New Road, where the Jewish community were “out in the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear”.Neville, who has built a vast property empire in Manchester since retiring from football in 2011, said he took down a union flag being displayed on one of his building sites.“Funnily enough on one of my development sites last week there was a union jack flag put up and I took it down instantly,” he said.“Some people might be watching this and thinking: ‘Gary you’re not really patriotic.’ I’ve played for my country 85 times, I love my country, I love Manchester and I loveEngland.”Neville, 50, said that in the years he has been building in the city, he had never seen union flags at the current rate and questioned why this was the case.“The union jack flag used in a negative fashion is not right and I’m a proud supporter of England, of Great Britain, of our country and will champion it anywhere in the world as one of the greatest places to live,” he said.“But I think we need to check ourselves, check ourselves and start to think about bringing ourselves back to a neutral point because we’re being pulled right and left and we don’t need to be pulled right and left at all.”The Sky Sports commentator has frequently voiced his opinions on political and social issues,including that people should “detest” the poor working conditionsfor migrant workers in Qatar and NHS staff in the UK, and criticising Boris Johnson for“fuelling” racism and hatredwhen he was prime minister.In his LinkedIn video, Neville commented on the diversity of football, saying that he played with people from across the UK and from around the world. “We were a beautiful team, united as one,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It extended the manager’s winless run to seven games since he succeeded Nuno Espírito Santo last month. Yet Postecoglou, who unusually started with a back five, detected signs of progress as he prepared for vital talks with directors to discuss the future. “Yes, it’s a lost cause,” he said, sarcastically. “I see it as an exciting opportunity. You have to be up for the fight and the struggle. I’d be silly to be sitting here at the age of 60 if I lacked self-belief or fight. Even in the schoolyard I picked fights with people that beat me up.”Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães adds to Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest crisisRead moreWarming to his theme, Postecoglou gently mocked the pantomime of Premier League football that almost demands that at least one manager is always deemed under pressure. “I get that it’s part of the fanfare of the Premier League that it needs one manager to be in the spotlight. If people want to assess me three and a half weeks into the job, there’s nothing I can say or do that will change that.“But what I have seen and felt in this period is that we are heading in the direction I want us to. The results will come. In the meantime it is a struggle and a fight and there is nothing wrong with that. We don’t have things handed to us on a plate in life, we have to fight. I have fought for things all my life. Why does everyone want everything neatly packaged? The attitude today seems to be that as soon as something goes wrong, you change it.”Amid much hilarity, he suggested that one reporter might have been “a lost cause at some point but your parents didn’t give up on you”.Postecoglou then reiterated that he had walked into the City Ground with his eyes wide open and always understood that his attempt to alter Forest’s playing style would not be straightforward. “I knew this was a big challenge,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with that. I don’t know why people think challenges are a burden, I love a challenge. The alternative is sitting at home watching games and I don’t want to do that. If you guys have a lot fun around it I don’t care. I couldn’t care less.”Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouNottingham ForestNewcastle UnitedAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

TheManchester Cityof autumn 2025 are a work in progress, low on previous star quality but still full of possibilities. The presence of Erling Haaland, in devastating form, is a cast-iron guarantee they will be sticking around for a while yet.In the ninth minute Haaland scored his ninthPremier Leaguegoal of the season, notching for the ninth game in succession. Played in by Josko Gvardiol, Haaland’s unmatchable power and speed completed the job, bustling through Sepp van den Berg and Nathan Collins to clatter past Caoimhín Kelleher. At 25, as a young father, handed a leadership role by his manager, Haaland is thriving under added responsibility.Guardiola hails ‘incredible’ Haaland and Donnarumma after City’s win at BrentfordRead more“I have never felt better than I do now,” he said. “It is about preparation, getting ready for the games. You can be physically ready but you need to be mentally ready. With a kid it makes me even better because I disconnect more than ever – I don’t think about football at all.”City fans singing for Kevin De Bruyne reminded Haaland is no longer supported by proven winners, much of the star system that once surrounded him now passed into club legend. The new City are full of promise, but where their Premier League peers have bought finished products, to currently mixed results, the Etihad project turns towards potential. Three points ground out atBrentfordsaw first-half dominance followed by a far more tentative second half. Brentford fought back determinedly but suffered for a lack of quality when opportunities arose.Keith Andrews was denied in his quest to beat Manchester United and Manchester City in consecutive games, the last manager to do so being Tottenham’s Gerry Francis in 1996. In City’s 2022-23 treble-winning season, only Thomas Frank’s Brentford’s did a league double over them. Matching those historic feats proved beyond reach with Haaland around. “I am not sure how many centre-forwards in world football score that goal,” Andrews said.The Irishman’s technical area vigil was anguished, the key moments never quite coming off, despite endeavours that made life uncomfortable for City until the closing moments. By the conclusion, Guardiola was a more frantic presence on the touchline. This City team do not yet kill off opponents as was habitual in the imperial phase of the recent past. The skill level remains elite but prey is not battered into submission.“Many things I like,” Guardiola said. “I know there are things we can do better but they made a fantastic first half, one of the best in many months.”Collins, Brentford’s captain, said: “They were getting too close to our box, in and around it. In the second half we were a bit more aggressive on the press, got higher up, pressed them higher.”View image in fullscreenHaaland holds off the Brentford defence to fire home Manchester City’s winning goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCity assumed grip from the first whistle, Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade feeding off meagre scraps. Bees fans’ greatest thrills in the first half came when Gianluigi Donnarumma was asked to play the ball but the goalkeeper made no mistakes, to audible disappointment.For City, Jérémy Doku, in fine form, was a notable omission, the latest victim of a Guardiola tombola team selection in his continuing search for a formula. Rodri in midfield after playing in Monaco was supposed to be a mark of progress in recovery from his knee injury, only for him to depart with a hamstring injury, rubbing his right haunch in disappointment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Foden was central to City’s first-half control, only to fade when the going got tougher.An instinctive save from Kelleher denied Tijjani Reijnders’ volley; City should have been further ahead at half-time than 1-0. That only Haaland has scored more than a single Premier League goal suggests someone else needs to step up soon.The second half arrived with Andrews and Brentford appearing well ahead of City. Michael Kayode’s early surge down the right flank brought fresh impetus. A golden chance was missed – and saved – when Gvardiol’s missed header set up Igor Thiago for a one-on-one. An onrushing Donnarumma prevailed. Kayode’s header wide soon after suggested City’s failure to kill the game might have consequences. “The second half was our half,” said Andrews.Haaland was now being asked to defend Kayode’s long throws, as a second-row lock forward in a lineout formation protecting Donnarumma. Haaland said: “It reminded me of Stoke City with Rory Delap 15 years ago. They are huge and do throw-ins from the middle so of course it is not easy but it is about preparing for what is going to come.”Stoppage time featured Haaland and Guardiola directing their team’s play together, manager and star player in tandem as victory was seen out. They will need each other for the challenges ahead.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Many struggled badly.Amanda Anisimova surges to China Open final after outclassing Coco GauffRead moreBeing scheduled in the night session offered little solace for Sinner, the world No 2, who was dragged into a third set by a tenacious Griekspoor. By the third set, Sinner had physically deteriorated, visibly cramping and limping badly before he had no choice but to retire.“This is definitely not the way you want to win,” said Griekspoor. “Brutal conditions here in Shanghai all week already. I thought we were still a little bit lucky to play in the evening without sun, but two hours, 36 minutes on the clock, middle of the third set. Sorry for him, I wish him a speedy recovery.”Carlos Alcaraz, the world No 1, withdrew from Shanghai before the tournament because of the ankle injury he suffered at the beginning of his title run in Tokyo late last month, meaning Sinner’s retirement presents a great opportunity for the rest of the field, including Novak Djokovic, who edged into the round of 16 with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win over ­Yannick Hanfmann of Germany.Elsewhere, Amanda Anisimova continued to put together an incredible breakthrough season as she ­followed up her success at the grand slam tournaments by clinching the biggest title of her career with a 6-0, 2-6, 6-2 win over Linda Noskova in Beijing.View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova celebrates winning in Beijing.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersAnisimova has now won two WTA 1000 titles, at the China Open and Qatar Open, alongside reaching two grand slam finals, at Wimbledon and the US Open this year.

Furious fans had surrounded the Rangers team bus in Falkirk.Rangers fans angry at Russell Martin blockade team bus after Falkirk drawRead moreThe Rangers board had been reluctant to part with Martin, who was only hired in June, despite vociferous protests from supporters. However, there was an understanding the 39-year-old’s position became untenable. Rangers have won only one of their top-flight games to date, which has been combined withdismal performances in Europe. Overall, Martin won only five of 17 competitive matches with a passive, muddled brand of football that earned him few friends.“While all transition periods require some time, results have not met the club’s expectations,” said a Rangers statement on Sunday night. “Assistant head coach, Matt Gill, and first-team coach, Mike Williamson, will also be departing. Russell and his staff have worked exceptionally hard throughout their time at the club. We thank them for their efforts and wish them well for the future.”Gerrard won the title with Rangers in 2020-21, their only championship since 2011. His performance in Glasgow before then, coupled with struggles at Aston Villa, raises questions about his managerial capabilities. Yet he is held in high esteem by the very group of supporters Rangers desperately need back on side. The reappointment of the Liverpool icon, who last managed in Saudi Arabia, would prove hugely popular. Gerrard will also be aware of what few options he has to be a manager in significant leagues.View image in fullscreenRangers fans made their feelings seen and heard during their side’s draw at Falkirk.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockMartin’s exit will intensify scrutiny on Kevin Thelwell, the Rangers sporting director. He had been hugely supportive of the manager while publicly revealing a net spend of £20m in the summer window. Martin had signed a three-year contract.Martin, who had previously been in charge of MK Dons and Swansea, managed Southampton to promotion to the Premier League in 2024 after being appointed the previous summer.

It’s an honour and a pleasure to be part of Premier League history. I say thank you to the club and the players and the staff I had. We did it quicker and faster. Now let’s go to 250 games more.”On Rodri’s hamstring issue, the latest setback after a cruciate knee injury last season, Guardiola said: “I would love to have Rodri every three days but after one year it happens all the time, it is so demanding.

Minutes later, Milan had their golden opportunity when Lloyd Kelly bundled over Giménez in the box but Pulisic blazed his penalty over the bar.Second-half goals from André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Rasmus Højlund helpedNapolibattle back to earn a 2-1 home win overGenoa.Napoli’s perfect start to the league campaign was ended by a 2-1 loss at Milan last weekend, and Antonio Conte’s side risked a second successive defeat before a spirited fightback.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, 15 minutes from time, Anguissa’s shot was parried away by the keeper and this time Højlund was there to capitalise with a low strike from the edge of the six-yard box.Romafell behind early but came away with a 2-1 win atFiorentina, to leave the hosts waiting for their first league win of the season.Gian Piero Gasperini’s Roma had conceded just one goal in their five league outings but it was Fiorentina who were in front in the 14th minute when a ball over the top by Hans Nicolussi Caviglia found Moise Kean. Kean twisted and turned his way towards the area before rifling a shot from outside the box into the far top corner to net his first goal of the season.The lead lasted all of eight minutes before Artem Dovbyk’s backheeled flick from inside the box ended with Matías Soulé’s first-time cannoned shot from the edge of the area which left Fiorentina keeper David de Gea with no chance.Roma took the lead on the half-hour mark from a corner. Bryan Cristante lost his marker and powered a bullet header from outside the six-yard box.Kean had another chance before the break but this time his effort smashed off the upright and in the second half Fiorentina substitute Roberto Piccoli saw his strike from distance bounce off the crossbar.In Ligue 1 on Sunday night,Paris Saint-Germainwere held 1-1 atLille.

There is talent in their squad, and desire. You can see it in every tackle, every gut-busting run and in the frustrated body language when a pass doesn’t quite come off. That energy is matched on the sideline. Rehanne Skinner was animated throughout her side’s 2-0 defeat – “hold the line”, “come closer”, “talk to her” and “Fion can’t get out” were among the many commands from the technical area, with those behind the dugout treated to the thoughts of the manager while the action was under way. Skinner is in it, she is engaged, the players are engaged, so what is not working?Five games in and they have no points, have conceded 16 goals and scored twice. They can score though, five different goal scorers in a 5-1 defeat of Charlton in the League Cup on 24 September a brief respite from defeat before Chelsea scored three in 15 minutes last weekend to put them firmly back in their place. Against the Blues the Hammers weren’t bad throughout though – that 15-minute calamitous spell was an outlier and, while many feared a complete second-half collapse, they regrouped, thrived with their backs against the wall, and only conceded one more to the champions.WSL clockwatch: Spurs edge Brighton, London City Lionesses beat Liverpool and more – as it happenedRead moreConsistency across a whole game has been a regular problem. The first five minutes and second half against Chelsea were periods to be proud of, as was the opening 45 against Arsenal and closing 45 against Brighton.Against Villathe story was familiar, the visiting team dominating possession in Dagenham but the Hammers having chances too, nine shots to Villa’s 11. They were in it in the first half, challenging, playing well enough to be able to take something from the game, the difference though was that West Ham had only a single shot on target, as opposed to Villa’s four.West Ham are not being let down by their style, grit or managerial decisions, they are being let down by players not being clinical when they get in good positions. It is that decision-making in the final third that needs work, the five goals scored against Women’s Super League 2 side Charlton perhaps points to the issue: when they have time on the ball they make the right moves, when they are being pressed and harried by top-flight opposition it’s almost like they struggle to think quickly enough.View image in fullscreenKirsty Hanson (right) celebrates after scoring Villa’s first against West Ham.Photograph: Alexander Canillas/SPP/Shutterstock“I don’t think we were clinical enough in the final third and we just lacked that cutting edge where the final ball was sometimes a bit over hit, not quite with the right quality and then just being prepared to take on shots a little bit earlier,” said Skinner. “Based on the players, when I’m watching them individually, I just feel like they’re all a little bit hesitant compared to where we were previously. The desire to run at people and be quite assertive was really, really strong and we just need to get that fight back where we’re a little bit more ruthless in and around the box, where we are a bit braver to go 1v1 and where what will be will be but we’re committing players and we’re trying to create opportunities. That’s something that we’ve just sort of taken our foot off the gas a little bit on and we’re looking for passes as opposed to being a little bit more direct and being a bit more confident in our own ability.”On Sunday afternoon that was costly again. Moments after Viviane Asseyi glanced a header wide, they were punished at the other end, Kirsty Hanson collecting her short corner back from Lynn Wilms before lashing the ball into the far corner.

The summer recruit Tandberg had already scored in wins over Everton and Leicester this season and grabbed another decisive goal for Spurs when she finished off a smart cross by Jessica Naz after 26 minutes. It proved enough to ensure Tottenham continued their fine start under Martin Ho, with the north London club now on 12 points and up to four wins – only one short of their overall tally in the 2024-25 campaign.Noémie Mouchon's 81st-minute strike rescued a late point forLeicesterat home toEverton. Ornella Vignola finished off a quick counter-attack for the Toffees after 51 minutes at the King Power Stadium to open the scoring. The visitors pushed for a second but were hit late on when Mouchon scored to ensure the spoils were shared.PA MediaPhotograph: Liam Asman/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is work to be done for sure, confidence must improve, and the players must bear some responsibility for that, but this is a team that is struggling from a lack of love and care from the club as a whole and Skinner is a victim of that rather than the architect of the team’s struggles.This summer, nine players departed and only four came in. The quality of those coming in this time round was arguably higher overall, but a tight budget has meant that, season on season, West Ham have lost their best players to better teams. Before questions are asked about Skinner’s tenure, she deserves a chance to show what she can do unhindered and that means the club upping its game – and the same could be said for several WSL sides.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWest Ham United WomenAston Villa WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Channelled the right way andCrystal Palacewill become a better team, claimed a manager with much to be positive about. But that pain, laced with disbelief at losing their 19-game unbeaten run against Everton, will sting for some time yet.Glasner has worked wonders at Palace but improving his club’s miserable record againstEvertonproved a step too far. The visitors should have been celebrating a first win at Everton since 2014 but a lack of ruthlessness, a rare defensive lapse and a stirring finish from David Moyes’s side combined to shatter that aspiration. Jack Grealish’s somewhat fortunate 93rd-minute winner, his first Everton goal, secured an unlikely victory for the hosts after Iliman Ndiaye’s penalty had cancelled out Daniel Muñoz’s opener. Palace’s disbelieving players sank to their knees and rubbed their heads after seeing their proud unbeaten sequence vanish on the banks of the River Mersey. As well they might.Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães adds to Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest crisisRead more“It hurts,” the Palace manager said. “For 60-70 minutes I saw a ­fantastic performance from our team but we didn’t decide the game when we could have done. I am a terrible loser and maybe in the international break I can reflect on this great run but it is not my feeling at the minute.“I told my players they can be really proud of the next chapter they wrote in the Crystal Palace history book after winning two trophies. The longest unbeaten run in over 120 years is a huge achievement but on the other side it feels like it should be at least 20 now. Maybe we need to feel this pain again. We don’t want it but we need it to make the next step forward.”Palace were hugely impressive in the first half, Everton a distant second best until the interval introductions of Carlos Alcaraz and Beto began to turn the tide. Even then Jean-Philippe Mateta should have put the game beyond the hosts.“I thought Crystal Palace might have a hangover from Thursday night,” said Moyes of his opponents’ European debut. “But they should have been out of sight. They should have been 3-0 up but we stuck at it and eventually got a bit of fortune.”Palace set the tone for a dominant first-half display from the start with long throws from Chris Richards and Adam Wharton’s incisive distribution causing Everton endless ­problems. Jordan Pickford, making his 300thPremier Leagueappearance for Everton, was tested twice in the opening two minutes, by Yéremy Pino and Tyrick Mitchell. England’s ­undisputed No 1 goalkeeper made more impressive stops to keep out Marc Guéhi from close range and a first-time strike from Mateta.It was a question of when, not if, the visitors would take the lead and they did so with a goal that showcased Palace’s individual quality and the collective intelligence of a team that know precisely what their manager wants. The impressive Pino held up play well despite the close attentions of two Everton players to release Ismaïla Sarr. The Senegal international rolled a perfectly weighted pass into the overlapping Muñoz who, with Pickford rushing across goal, converted his second goal in two games with ease. “We’re gonna win the league,” sang the jubilant Palace hordes.Palace’s first-half superiority tried the patience of the home support almost as much as Everton’s performance. Moyes’s team were slow and sloppy, with the summer signings ­Thierno Barry and Tyler Dibling toiling badly. Both were unceremoniously hooked after 45 minutes. It was the third time in four games that Moyes has switched his two main strikers at half-time. The changes paid off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That said, Mateta squandered two clear openings before the home side could gather momentum, chipping Pickford when through on goal only for Jake O’Brien to head clear and somehow slicing wide of an exposed goal after Sarr’s shot deflected into his path. His second miss proved a key moment.Everton were handed a route back into the game when Maxence Lacroix misread Vitalii Mykolenko’s pass towards Beto and collided with Tim Iroegbunam as the substitute advanced on his blind side. It was a clear penalty and Ndiaye coolly sent Henderson the wrong way from the spot. Suddenly, having been in almost total control, Palace were on the back foot.In stoppage time Alcaraz released the goalscorer on the right. Ndiaye floated a beautiful cross into the ­six-yard box that Beto, in the words of his manager, “should have buried”. Henderson somehow saved at ­point-blank range but was beaten when Grealish read Muñoz’s attempted clearance and diverted the ball into the roof of the net. The roof of Hill Dickinson Stadium almost came off. Palace’s luck was out and their proud unbeaten run was history.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Vítor Pereira, the Wolves head coach, had been dismissed just before the Premier League’s bottom side went ahead in the first half, when Marshall Munetsi’s volley rebounded off the bar, the goalkeeper and in.Grealish grabs late winner as Everton end Crystal Palace’s unbeaten runRead moreFabian Hürzeler’s side deserved a point for their second-half dominance but Wolves, after conceding in stoppage time todraw at Tottenham, had looked as if they were going to hang on for the first top-flight victory of the season. Strand Larsen looked Wolves’ best bet for a second goal and the home team were less able to get out from their low block with the slighter Jhon Arias leading the line.As if trying to recover from another winless start was not a big enough peak to climb, letting in late levellers is turning hills into mountains. Wolves somehow recovered from a terrible start to last season, when they gained one point from eight games, to avoid relegation on the back of a near miraculous run of six successive league wins either side of Easter, Pereira having replaced Gary O’Neil in December. Asking them to do the same again without the goals and talent of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Aït-Nouri would be remarkable.So playing to their strengths looks like a prerequisite. Again they displayed heart, determination and improved cohesion for large spells and can at least claim a three-match unbeaten run, including the Carabao Cup. But Strand Larsen’s goals and hold-up play are also a big part of their armoury. He was not looking sulky when, 14 minutes from time, Luís Miguel, Pereira’s assistant manager, replaced him with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde; he was incredulous.After Van Hecke had thudded home his second Brighton goal and the final whistle was accompanied by boos from Wolves fans fed up with their talent being continuously diminished, Strand Larsen flicked aside offers of handshakes from the coaching staff. He went on to the pitch to acknowledge his teammates and applaud the fans, but his frustration at the tactical decision was palpable.“When you don’t get the three points, you talk about the substitutions,” Luís Miguel said. “He has been coming back from injury and he’s still not 100%. It was a decision from Vítor and the technical staff.”View image in fullscreenBrighton’s goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen after he scores an own goal against Wolves.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe game had exploded into life in the middle of the first half. Pereira was furious at Jarred Gillett’s decision not to award a free-kick when João Gomes was jostled by Carlos Baleba and then, after the referee cautioned Baleba for a clearer foul on Hugo Bueno, the red card was shown to the Wolves head coach for booting a spare ball off a cone at the officials’ dugout. Luís Miguel relayed his colleague’s apology.The fire had been lit. When a long free-kick from Danny Welbeck was headed out only as far as Munetsi to the right of the penalty spot, he dispatched a veritable hammer of a shot goalwards. Although Verbruggen managed to tip the ball against the bar, it rebounded down and over the line off the goalkeeper’s glove.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sam Johnstone saved superbly from Georginio Rutter but Wolves so nearly put the game to bed when Strand Larsen shot against a post.Brighton, with their deeply impressive record at Molineux – they had won their four previous games here – and a good start to the season to boot, took charge in the second half.Wolves felt the ball had already gone behind for a goal-kick when Jackson Tchatchoua nudged it on. From Yankuba Minteh’s short corner, Maxim De Cuyper crossed and, after Stefanos Tzimas got a slight flick-on, Van Hecke headed powerfully home to earn a point.“It was a good performance but not a great performance,” Hürzeler said. “The most important thing is to show resilience and character and JP is a great role model for that.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He mentored dozens of future stars at clubs including Hampton Court, Fontainebleau, France, and Prested Hall in Essex. Prior to his coaching career, Ivan was a brilliant junior player winning a string of national age group titles.Real tennis is the forerunner of lawn tennis; it was played from medieval times and enjoyed by Henry VIII. The game is little changed today, with players hitting solid, hand-stitched balls with asymmetric wooden rackets over a drooping net and off the walls of the court.Born in Melbourne, Australia, Ivan was the eldest son of British parents, Lesley (nee Lee) and Chris Ronaldson, real tennis professionals and later world champions. They returned to the UK in 1979, and, after a period living in Troon, Scotland, became the professionals at the RoyalTennisCourt, Hampton Court.After Papplewick prep school in Ascot, Berkshire, Ivan boarded at Canford school in Dorset, where his uncle Steve was the school’s head real tennis professional. He helped his nephew develop the powerful, strategic game that became the youngster’s hallmark: Ivan won the British under-12s three times, the under-14s twice and the under-16s twice.As a teenager, Ivan also helped his parents run the club, sweeping the court, booking lessons and social games, and imbibing their philosophy that this was a vocation, not just a job. With the court usually booked for 16 hours a day, Ivan became accustomed to dealing with people from all backgrounds: on-site security staff, captains of industry, the generals’ widows in the grace-and-favour apartments, and the young Prince Edward, who played regularly at Hampton and met his future wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones, at a real tennis event in 1993.After school, Ivan spent a year from 1992 studying economics and business accounting at Reading University, before opting for a real tennis career. He spent two years as a trainee professional player at Holyport club in Berkshire (1993-95) before becoming a teaching pro at Fontainebleau (1995-98) and Hampton Court (1998-2002).During four years building up the new Prested Hall club (2002-05), he talent-spotted several gifted youngsters, including the future women’s world champion Claire Fahey. He enjoyed similar success in the US at the Prince’s Court (2005-22) then the Westwood Country Club, both in Virginia. In 2019 he coached the US junior side to their first Van Alen Cup victory over their British counterparts for 25 years.A larger-than-life character with a razor-sharp brain and gift for friendship, Ivan invariably extracted the maximum fun from every situation. He relished chess matches and playing devil’s advocate in political debate with friends and family.In 2005 he married Elf Woodall, a US government employee. She survives him, as do their two children, Liliana and Bruce, his parents, and two brothers, Ben and Luke.Explore more on these topicsTennisOther livesHampton Court PalaceUS sportsobituariesShareReuse this content"

This is my second time hosting and my fourth time being here,” he said as he took the stage. “I’m doing theSuper Bowlhalf-time show. I’m very happy and I think everyone is happy about it.”Saturday Night Live: Bad Bunny is game but the season opener is mostly toothlessRead moreThe line was followed by a quick montage of Fox news contributors, each saying one word that was clipped together to say, “He should be the next President.”During the opening, the artist included some words in Spanish that he devoted to “all the Latinos and Latinas in the entire world and here in the United States”.“More than being an accomplishment of mine, it’s an accomplishment for everybody, demonstrating that our mark and our contribution to this country will never be able to be removed or erased by anybody,” he said in Spanish. Afterwards, he said in English, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”The announcement thatBad Bunnywould headline the Super Bowl half-time show sparked a wave of conservative outrage including from Noem.Trump’s homeland security secretary said on a rightwing podcast on Friday that only Americans should attend next year’sSuper Bowland warned thatIceagents “will be all over” the event. She also said the NFL will “not be able to sleep at night” over its decision to chooseBad Bunnyas the half-time performer.Bad Bunny was born and raised in Puerto Rico, a US territory, and is an American citizen.Bad Bunny has said that fears that his fans would be subjected to immigration raids prompted him to exclude the US from his forthcoming worldtour. The musician just wrapped a three-month concert series in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which drew in an estimated 600,000attendees.“My residence was beautiful, everyone loved it,” he said during his monologue, acknowledging the success of the recent tour.In other sketches during the 51st season opener, Colin Jost stepped in as Pete Hegseth. “You will now be yelled at by a former Fox News host,” a colleague announced as Jost entered, before the sketch turned to an angry tirade on the US military.“Our military will now have the same rules as any good frat party: No fat chicks. And if you’re a fat dude, goddam it, you better be funny as hell,” Jost said, a clear reference to Hegeth’s recent call out against diversity and fat shaming of troops as he directed generals to fall in line orquit.Trump, played by James Austin Johnson, also made a brief appearance, not as the sketch’s target but as its self-appointed monitor. “I’m just here keeping my eye on SNL, making sure they don’t say anything too mean about me.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationBad BunnyUS politicsSuper BowlUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The author and activist behind the term ‘enshittification’ explains what’s gone wrong with the internet – and what we can do about itCory DoctorowSun 5 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you,terrifying.In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us:enshittification. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It isn’t just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?Here’s the natural history of enshittification:1First, platforms are good to their users.2Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.3Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. TakeAmazon, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan forAmazon, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?Stage1: good tousersAmazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hardnotto shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook, Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.Stage2: abusing users, good to businessesAmazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threatssimply because they were large. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.It was under this theory thatJimmy Carterstarted to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. ThenRonald Reagancame along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reaganstarted under Carter, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including)Joe Biden.The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.Stage3: a giant pile of shitAmazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, tocream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.Same withFulfilment by Amazon, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.Top results in a product search aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to be top of the listHere’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to theUS Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than$50bn every yearcharging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “Amazon’s pricing paradox”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there,andthe merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page isbad. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.The internet is not the most important issue facing us. But it is where fights against genocide, inequality and racism will be wagedThis is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If theydocheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Whywouldthe company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.Aconfession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawnedOccupyandBlack Lives Matterhas become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.Audre Lordewas far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buyingRead moreYou won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers andwarehouse workers. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.Martin Luther King Jronce said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important.This is an edited extract from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow, published by Verso at £22 on 14 October.

By comparison, four out of 10 businesses have faced a breach or attack – roughly the same proportion as primary schools.Toby Lewis, the global head of threat analysis at the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, says the UK education sector is not necessarily being targeted deliberately. “They are just getting caught up in the dragnet of cybercrime attacks that are out there,” he says, adding that there is an “element of randomness and opportunism” in the targeting of cybercrime victims.The BBC reported last week that Kido, the nursery business targeted by a hacking group calling itself Radiant, was targeted after an “initial access broker” sold access to Kido’s systems to Radiant, a common scenario in cybercrime circles.The government data, from its annual cyber security breaches survey, is based on a survey of nearly 300 secondary and primary schools in the UK as well as more than 30 higher education institutions, including universities. It defines a cyber-attack as an “attempt” to breach a target’s IT systems, which includes sending “phishing” emails that attempt to trick the recipient into handing over sensitive information such as a password.A phishing email was the most common form of attack for universities and schools.Ransomware attackshave become a well-known form of cybercrime in the UK. Attackers typically encrypt a target’s IT systems and steal data – then demand a payment in bitcoin for decrypting the systems and destroying or returning the data.West Lothian council’s education network was hit by a ransomware attack this year that resulted in data being taken from some schools, while universities hit by cyber attacks in recent years include Newcastle University, the University of Manchester and the University of Wolverhampton.Lewis adds that state schools might be more vulnerable to attacks because of pressure on funding and a lack of specialist expertise, while universities are vulnerable because they have thousands of young students who might not be cyber security-literate, as well as having computer networks that are designed to foster academic cooperation.Universities appear to be popular targets. Further and higher education institutions are affected most regularly, with three out of 10 reporting a breach or attack on a weekly basis, according to the government. Despite of, or perhaps because of, the number of attacks the education sector is more aware of government initiatives on preventing cybercrime than businesses and charities.Pepe Di’lasio, the general secretary of the UK association of school and college leaders, said ransomware attacks were a “major risk” to the sector and a “great deal of work” was going on to protect systems and data.James Bowen, assistant general secretary at the national association of head teachers, said additional government funding to help school leaders spot and respond to cyber threats would “certainly be welcome”.The Department for Education said its support for schools included a dedicated team for responding to cyber incidents and working closely with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre to offer free training for school staff. “We take the cybersecurity of our schools seriously, understanding the significant disruption attacks can cause, and there is a range of support on offer for schools,” said its spokesperson.Kido’s hackers have deleted the data they took from the company, including profiles of children, following a backlash against the hack.Government data, however, shows that the wider education sector remains a target. Ministers are preparing to ban schools, the NHS and local councils from makingransomware paymentsunder government proposals to tackle hackers, which might help dissuade assailants. In the meantime, the attacks continue.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternetSecondary schoolsHigher educationUniversitiesSchoolsHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

The slogan, coined by the utopian social reformer Robert Owen, dates from 1817 (hisNew Lanark millworkers still did 10.5-hour days, though). Even then, it wasn’t unprecedented: apparently, a16th-century Spanish ordinancelimited New World construction workers to eight-hour days.So what would Owen or Philip II of Spain think of “996”? That’s working 9am to 9pm, six days a week – 72 hours of grind. Originating in the Chinese tech industry, 996 wasdescribed as a “blessing” by the e-commerce behemoth Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma. Chinese workers disagreed, mobilising against it online, andlaunching – and winning – court cases against employers.Now 996 is back (although it probably never went away; in 2022, the FT reporteddiscontent among UK TikTok employeesat expectations of 12-hour days). In Silicon Valley, “grinding ‘996’ is the way to get ahead”, according to theNew York Times.Wiredfound job listings explicitly stating absurdly long hours are expected (and applicants shouldn’t apply unless “excited” by that) and recruiters being instructed that a willingness to work 72-hour weeks was non-negotiable. TheSan Francisco Standardproclaimed: “Grindcore culture is back and grindier than ever”, with one founder summarising the vibe as: “No drinking, no drugs, 996, lift heavy, run far, marry early, track sleep, eat steak and eggs.” Another posted on X: “We routinely are at the office through the weekend and do some of our best work late into the night.” Sign me up!I don’t get it. Hadn’t we all fallen out of love with hustle culture? We’ve witnessed the overwhelming success offour-day week initiativeswith almostall trial participants electing to continue. We’ve looked at other countries and realised more enlightened approaches to reconciling family, community, life and work don’t necessarily come at a productivity cost, and make for happier, healthier citizens. The average working week in the Netherlands is32.1 hours, but theOECD’s economic surveysays it has been “outperforming peers” economically; it ranks fifth in the newestWorld Happiness Report(the US is 24th).I keep reading, too, about the new work-agnosticism,especially among the young. Respondents toDeloitte’s 2024 Gen-Z and Millennial surveyranked work-life balance as the most important factor in choosing an employer (and “the most admired trait among their peers”).Randstad’s workmonitor 2025surveyed 26,000 people in 35 countries and also concluded work-life balance was the top motivator, coming ahead of pay for the first time.So what fresh, fire emoji,locked-inhell is this? I have two theories. Maybe it’s the last gasp of a dying philosophy; the “extinction burst”, if you will, of grindcore? Alternatively,research published this yearindicates what we all suspected: overwork makes your brain go funny. “Overworked individuals exhibited significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation,” the researchers concluded, and looking at some of Silicon Valley’s prominent alumni, that tracks. Surely only people with “structural brain changes … in regions linked to cognition and emotion” – as the study puts it – could think this work culture is healthy or productive?Tech bros love novelty, so maybe we can convince their addled brains that their inhumane working practices are old hat with audacious alternatives. But what? My own work equation (equal parts scrolling, blank staring, hen husbandry and hot drinks) is too complex – and unsuccessful – to catch on. I’m tempted to suggest 0/0/0, but that requires a tireless 24/7/365 commitment to overthrowing capitalism. The majority of people I asked actually dream of working three-day weeks (not far offthe economist John Maynard Keynes’ quixotic 15 hours), but I’m not sure that’s buzzy enough. How about a 1:12 ratio of Teams meetings to tea breaks? Or one day in the office, six days screaming into the void (make SIV the new WFH)? An hour’s work, an hour questioning your life choices, then a lifetime hiding in the woods? I reckon with a catchy name and a rumour itmakes you immortal, any of these could be Silicon Valley’s next big thing.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s howThomas GeogheganStates opposed to Trump can create a compact – a new prototype for American government – even if it’s perceived as political theaterSun 5 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareTrump is all about political theatre, or circus, and it often seems that even in resisting him, as decent citizens must do, we become part of the circus too. We are like the extras who splutter while he thrills the base by violating some heretofore inviolate human norm. So the show goes on. But why not put on our own show, our own form of political theatre, that leaves Trump out – or at least has a different focus?We could consider the kind of political theatre that Americans created from 1768 to 1776 to resist Britain’s growing crackdown. Instead of employing their creaky legislative bodies, they opted for new forms of resistance,non-importation committees, even a first continental congress with no apparent legitimacy or precedent.However weak, those acts of political theater led to formal independence. After the war, American leaders held a convention – nominally to amend the Articles of Confederation with a unanimous vote by every state. Instead, the framers worked in secret, replaced the articles altogether, and changed the process for amending the new constitution to a three quarters vote.The Trump presidency is a colossal setback to that constitution and its norms, but it is also an opportunity to change those norms for the better. Like the founders, we should create a limited, invitation-only body – an embryonic constitutional convention – that the anti-Trump blue states exclusively set up for themselves, limit to themselves, and control.The constitution already provides some authority for doing so.These selected states are meeting to propose an interstate compact by and between themselves, in the spirit if not the letter of the compacts that theconstitution’s article I, section 10, clause 3describes, and for them to submit formally to Congress to adopt as federal law. Of course this will never happen in this case, as Congress, in its current broken form, is incapable of anything like a new constitution, embryonic or not.But the point is to put forward a prototype for a new type of American government, for a post-Trump country, that carries forward part of the existing institutional framework that is worth preserving, alongside radical change in response to Trump.So for example, let us say that New York, California, Massachusetts and Illinois declare a national emergency. The governors invite a select number of similar-minded anti-Trump states to send delegates selected either by the people or the legislature. The delegates’ job would be to draw up an inter-state compact, a declaration of rights of citizens and obligations of the participating governments. The compact would divide the funding of those obligations between the states and the federal government, if it were somehow adopted by Congress. It would create mandates that the federal government would fund – just for those states and any other that thereafter decide to join the compact.That compact might begin with a preamble in which We the People of these several states recognize not just our rights but our obligations to treat each other with dignity. The preamble would recognize our obligations to ensure all have adequate food, social security, access to healthcare, and meaningful work for protection in a time of technological change. It should be explicit about the dangers of AI and a warming planet. It should insist on the federal role in medical research and scientifically based public health to ensure that we live better and longer lives.And then there should follow a specific list of abuses by the Trump administration, acts of cruelty, that should be punished and redressed, and abuses by the supreme court, such as Citizens United, that should be voided by states adopting the compact.At the outset, the states should also invite DC and Puerto Rico to participate as states on the same footing and sign on to the compact.Then comes the hardest part – money. The compact would set out the specific programs that the state should fund and those that the federal government should fund – at least for the states that enter the compact. The document would not only be a constitution for the ages, but a budget document for the next fiscal year. It should include a restoration of funding for Medicaid, and reduction of premiums for other forms of healthcare.Finally, the compact should include a call to Texas, Florida, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, and every other non-signatory state to join as well, even if they were not originally invited.Whatever may be said against such a compact, it would push Trump off stage and show a certain norm-breaking nerve from a status-quo left. It would give the blue states credit for their own little smashing of the pottery. All the better if the other states do not show. In the early American acts of resistance, only some colonies showed up, and the constitution took effect despite some states staying out altogether. In creating a new constitutional prototype, we may think more clearly, or at least draw it up more freely, if other states were not around.The colonists in the period from 1768 to 1776, and the Framers in 1787, acted outside the law, with no clear process as to how the documents should be adopted or amended. It is time for We the People to declare abuses as serious as those set out by Thomas Jefferson and others in the Declaration of Independence. The idea of a compact may be dismissed as political theatre, but acts of political theater can turn into the real thing.What’s giving me hope nowMy hope is all the talent coming off the bench right now – all those who were once political bystanders and are now tracking Ice agents.

No dictator has ever pleaded for generals and admirals to applaud his remarks, followed by deafening silence.Donald Trumpis used to entering to the din of a mob jazzed up with YMCA. “I’ve never walked into a room so silent before,” Trump said when he addressed the country’s highest-ranking military leaders at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on Tuesday. “Don’t laugh. Don’t know if you’re allowed to do that.” He was trying to force some tittering, an old lounge act gag to rouse a dead audience. “You know what? Just have a good time.” The comedian who felt his routine was bombing before he even began sought to relax the room. Then Trump instinctively replaced the ingratiating gestures with threats. “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.”Trump’s syllogism perfectly encapsulated his psychology of victimhood and politics of retribution. If you do not bend the knee to him, he is personally wounded. Your failure to worship him must be punished. Your slight of his majesty condemns you to ruin.Trump cannot grasp that the silence of the commanders during his unprecedented address to them demonstrated their highest duty. Their discipline showed fidelity to uphold their oath to the constitution. By their stillness they presented themselves as models for the rest of the officer corps and the troops. They are not loyal to Trump or any cult of personality, but to his constitutional role. They were being used as a backdrop for a campaign-like rally, but they were resistant to serving as partisan players.Trump’s inability to understand their stolidity in the face of his provocations showed his incomprehension not only of the military but the presidency under the law. When he took offense at their stoney silence his rebuke disclosed that he saw them merely as his pawns. They were to his mind no different from his personal attorneys he had installed at the Department of Justice to do his bidding, including the suppression of theEpstein files.Trump had come on an urgent mission for them to carry out. He was there to tell the military chiefs they were to be his unquestioning agents for the greatest reversal of military strategy since the “war on terror” –a new war to be waged against his perceived political opponents at home in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the domestic deployment of theUS militaryas a police force.All the senior generals in all the world had been gathered for the unprecedented event at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on the order of secretary of defense,Pete Hegseth. They had no inkling for what momentous occasion they were being summoned. They dared not speculate that Hegseth brought them to be his captive audience for his self-referential vanity Ted talk attempting to rehabilitate his image and assert his authority. That would have seemed too stupid for words.When will US generals stand-up to Trump? | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreBut the commanders could have gotten more than a hint that they were being rounded up for the latest episode of It Can’t Happen Here, by reading Trump’s executive order of 22 September, Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization, an “organization” that does not exist. This was followed by aNational Security Presidential Memorandum No 7on 25 September citing themurder of Charlie Kirkand a series of disparate events as pretexts: “This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns … ”According to NSPM-7, a new “national strategy” would be implemented against an ideology of “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Jimmy Kimmel was not mentioned.These vapors were not a description of an ideology so much as a hodgepodge of Maga shibboleths. If there were any ideology expressed it was an inchoate fascism based on a repressive impulse that conjured up an all-purpose enemy called “Antifa”. Any sense of irony, of course, was completely missing. In fact,January 6was the last attempt to overthrow the US government, incited by Donald Trump. The leadership of Trump as a paragon of “traditional American views on family, religion, and morality” defies satire and only underscores the recurrent demand for the release of the Epstein files.The theatrical presentation at Quantico began with Hegseth darting back and forth on the stage. He was a motivational speaker as a drill sergeant with a book to hawk – and a warm-up act for the headliner. Observing him was like seeing the negative of a photograph. The darkest parts were reflections of his own grievances at the criticism and censure provoked by his past behavior.The former national guard major said he had been been “deemed an extremist”; he wasflaggedas a possible “insider threat” by fellow officers. (Hegseth has denied that he is an extremist). Despitenumerous accounts of his alcoholism, he told Megyn Kelly in an interview: “I never had a drinking problem,” but then reportedlypromised a senatorthat he would “not touch alcohol while I have this position”. Hegseth wasaccused of sexual assault in 2017, andsettled a lawsuitbrought by the woman who had accused him. (The settlement terms were confidential. Hegseth has said the allegations were false).As a Fox News host, Hegseth had been a prominent advocate for pardoning or granting clemency to service members accused or convicted of war crimes. Hegseth described them as “warriors” rather than “war criminals”. “If he committed premeditated murder, then I did as well ... Put us all in jail,” he said about one of them. Hegseth voiced support for members of his own unit in Iraq killing threeunarmed detaineeswho were told to run and then shot. Once Hegseth was confirmed, hepurged the top-rank judge advocate general. He’spushing a planto send many of the rest to work in immigration courts.Hegseth said that the military should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement”, his long-time complaint against rules designed to protect civilians and enforce military law against war crimes.Now, in his speech, Hegseth declared he was clearing away “the debris”. He encouraged loosening regulations aimed at preventing forbidden violence within the armed forces. He announced the “overhauling” of the inspector general and whistleblower complaint process, which would undermine legal protections and shield violent or reckless offenders from accountability. He would, he said, impose discriminatory measures of “gender-neutral” or “male level” physical standards for combat roles, stating: “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it.” (In 2023, more than 17% of the military force was composed of women, with thousands in combat roles.)Hegseth swaggered in front of the commanders, barking obscenities – “Fafo”, or Fuck Around and Find Out. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris. As I’ve said before and will say again, we are done with that shit.”The generals sat expressionless at his vulgarity that could be charged under the Uniform Military Code of Justice as a violation against indecent language that “neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline”.According to Pete, it was the flabby generals who needed to work out like Pete. “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It’s a bad look,” he said. “No more beardos.” That means you, Gen Grant.What do Trump and Hegseth’s inflammatory speeches to military generals signal? | Moira DoneganRead moreHegseth, at last, was seemingly getting his revenge for being tagged as an “insider threat”. He shouted: “No more side-tracking careers, no more walking on eggshells.” He accused the brass of harming the military by evaluating the mental stability of officers: “We’ve weeded out so-called toxic leaders under the guise of double-blind psychology assessments, promoting risk-averse, go-along-to-get-along conformists instead.” Then he plugged his book: “You might say we’re ending the war on warriors. I heard someone wrote a book about that.” The title of his book was The War on Warriors.Not once did Hegseth mention “Russia” or “Ukraine”. He made not the slightest reference to Russia’s huge missile attacks bombarding Ukraine, Russia’s drones over Romania, Estonia and Denmark, the tensions over US wavering within the western alliance, or utter anything that might be construed as a strategic thought.After his menacing speech, Hegseth made way forDonald Trump. Trump displayed his usual contempt for the military by baiting them with an array of partisan barbs to which they remained rigidly motionless. He slipped into a whirlpool of self-celebration followed by anxiety. There were bits about the “Gulf of America”, calling Joe “the autopen” and watching the 1950s TV series Victory At Sea, before Trump came to his worry of falling down stairs. “Every day, the guy is falling downstairs,” Trump said about Biden. “We can’t have it. I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs,like, I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly.” He could not contain his envy of Barack Obama. “So one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs. I’ve never seen it. Da-da, da-da, da-da, bop, bop, bop. He’d go down the stairs. Wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great. I don’t want to do it.”In the middle of his stream of consciousness, he dropped his new mission for the military against the “enemy from within”, with major American cities as the “training grounds … the ones that are run by the radical-left Democrats … And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.” Silence.The next day, 1 October, in Memphis, Hegseth appeared as a member of a posse with attorney generalPam Bondiand White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to speak before a rally of Ice agents and federal marshals in anticipation of the arrival of a contingent of national guard troops. Miller delivered his imitation of Patton. “The gangbangers that you deal with – they think they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are. They think they’re hardcore? We are so much more hardcore than they are.” Miller, not any mere general, gave the order. “You are unleashed.”You could tell Stephen Miller embodied the new “warrior ethos”. No beard. Shaved head, too. And lawless.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

My experience sums-up the draconian plight of non-citizens in the USSun 5 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 03.26 EDTShareWhen I arrived in the US four years ago to start my doctorate at Cornell University, I thought I’d be the last person to be hunted down by the immigration authorities. As far as I could tell, “the special relationship” meant that a British passport carried a sort of immunity akin to that enjoyed by diplomats; it was a mobility that allowed me to work, after all, as a journalist unscathed across west Africa’s restive Sahel belt for years.Things began to fall apart after I attended a pro-Palestine protest on campus in September last year. We had brought a job fair to a standstill – because it featured booths fromBoeingandL3Harris, companies that supplied Israel with the armaments it needed to carry out its genocidal campaign in Gaza. Although I was there for just five minutes, I was subsequently banned from campus, a punishment that felt like a kind of house arrest because my home was on the university’s Ithaca campus in upstate New York. While I could continue living there, I was barred from entering the university premises.In January, as Donald Trump steamrolled into office brandishing an arsenal of executive orderstargeting non-citizen student protesters, I left my home and went into hiding at the remote home of a professor, fearing the reach of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Three months later, I self-deported to Canada, then flew to Switzerland. I was prompted to flee after a friend, who had spent time with me in Ithaca, was detained at a Florida airport – on the other side of the country – and questioned about my whereabouts. I did not return to the UK as reports that pro-Palestine journalists had beenarrestedthere made me fearful.I hoped my arrival in Switzerland would mark the end of my ordeal. But two weeks in, two distressing emails reached my inbox. The first was from Cornell, informing me that the US government had effectively terminated my student visa status. The second came from Google, informing me that it had “received and responded to legal process” and handed my data to the Department of Homeland Security. These emails arrived 90 minutes apart.The quickfire emails confirmed my hunch that I had been under surveillance and that if I attempted to re-enter the US, I would likely be detained by Ice,like other student protesters. But the secrecy surrounding these procedures and the lack of due process to challenge them raised more questions than they answered.Was there any correspondence between Cornell and US government agencies prior to my visa being terminated? (I asked the university this, among other questions, and have not heard back.) What did the most powerful government in the world want with my Google data?Why did the US authorities go after me? Had they woven a yarn of suspicion based on my years working as a journalist covering the US-led “war on terror”? Was I targeted because I was Black and Muslim?I may never get the full answers, but aninvestigation by Amnesty Internationalsheds new light on the alarming ways that the US government has deployed shadowy AI tech to mass-monitor, surveil and assess non-US citizen students and immigrants.Amnesty saysthat Babel X, software made by Virginia-based Babel Street, allegedly scours social media for “terrorism”-related content and tries to predict the likely intent behind the posts. The software uses “persistent search” to constantly monitor new information once an initial query has been made. It is possible that my reportage – on everything from Guantánamo to drone strikes in the Sahel and the role the British secret services played in the Libyan civil war – was flagged. Amnesty International says that probabilistic technologies have a wide margin of error, “can often be discriminatory and biased, and could lead to falsely framing pro-Palestine content as antisemitic”. Babel Street did not respond to Amnesty’s requests for comment for their investigation.View image in fullscreenA federal agent threatens to Taser protesters outside a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, 13 June 2025.Photograph: Andrés Kudacki/Getty ImagesThen there is Palantir’s ImmigrationOS, which creates an electronic case file to centralise all information related to an immigrant investigation, allowing authorities to link multiple investigations to draw connections between cases. Using ImmigrationOS, Ice can also track self-deportations and it was rolled out in April, the same month I left. It may help explain why the US took action to bar my re-entry into the country when it did. (Palantir told Amnesty that it does not specifically target student protesters, nor are their products powering rights-violating immigration enforcements.)This all exists in the pre-crime space that has expanded exponentially since the launch of the US-led “war on terror” – catch (or kill) now, ask questions later. To this day, I have never been accused or prosecuted for any crime, or for exhibiting antisemitic behaviour. As has been made clear by a recentcomplaintby the University of Chicago Law Clinic, submitted on behalf of me and eight other non-citizen protesters to eight UN special rapporteurs, I’ve merely exercised my first amendment free speech rights to oppose the slaughter of innocent people. It is the US government that has actedunlawfullyand immorally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re seeing this play out in Gaza, where Israel’s “algorithmic warfare” has reduced the territory to a wasteland of corpses and rubble, leaving Palestinians with nowhere to go and nothing to eat. The investigation further shows that the US is mobilising tech to strip asylum seekers and migrants of their basic human rights, consigning them to arbitrary detention before they have a chance to defend themselves or ask for safety.While I am far from regretting my actions, I now live in a month-to-month limbo of precarious living arrangements and nagging doubts about whether I can finish my degree before my funding is cut. I have been forced to jump through hoops to access life-saving medical treatment. I was perhaps naive to think that as a British national with aLondon accent, at an Ivy League university, I was above these horrors. But just before I left the US, Joe, my African American barber, reminded me that: “You’re just Black.” My Blackness made my status in the US conditional. And because I am also Muslim and write about these identities does not help matters. It is no surprise that in a country with a legacy of racial slavery and post-9/11 Islamophobia, I would get flagged.With this technology in the hands of an administration that has little regard for constitutional safeguards, we should all beware.

This was a key plank in his isolationist “America first” platform. Yet within months of his inauguration, US forces werebombing Yemenand Iran. Looking south, Trump threatened to seize the Panama canal. Now, the Pentagon is gearing up for attacks on “terrorist” drug cartels deep inside Colombia and Mexico. Of most immediate concern is a possible renewed White House effort to forcibly imposeregime change on Venezuela.Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s hard-left authoritarian president, believes this effort is already under way. He says the US iswaging “undeclared war”on his country after several deadly strikeson Venezuelan vesselsin international waters – Trump shared a video of thelatest attack, which killed four people, on his social media last Friday. The president also notified Congress last week that the US is engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels. He claims, without providing evidence, that the targeted boats were carrying US-bound illegal narcotics – and that Maduro is responsible. He has placed a $50m bounty on Maduro’s head.Latin American governments are fretfully watching a big US militarybuildup around Venezuela, including warships, F-35 fighter jets, an attack submarine and 2,200 marines. Such powerful assets are not much use in drug interdiction. But they could be used offensively, or to support special forces raids and airstrikes. On Thursday, Venezuelaaccused the USof an “illegal incursion” by at least five F-35s. Maduro says he is readyinga state of emergencyto “protect our people … if Venezuela [is] attacked by the American empire”.What is Trump up to? Drug smuggling is a serious problem – but killing people on a whim on the high seas, whilecommon and difficult to prosecute, is still illegal. And anyway, the UN says, most of the cocaine entering the US comes from Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, and is mostly not trafficked through Venezuela. Draft-dodger Trump likes to act the tough commander-in-chief. He is nowtrying to deportVenezuelan migrants, many of whom originally fled to the US to escape sanctions he himself imposed. Some analysts suggest he covets Venezuela’s abundant oil, gas and mineral resources.It’s true that Trump and John Bolton, his then national security adviser,hoped to replace Maduro in 2019in what Caracas claimed was a regime change plot. It’s also true that Maduro’s 2024 re-election victory was widelycondemned as fraudulent. Given a free choice, Venezuelans would almost certainly sack him. And clashing ideologies are a factor, too. Maduro, unworthy heir to Hugo Chávez’sBolivarian revolution, is an affront to Trump’s imperial idea of a US-dominated western hemisphere, where the1823 Monroe doctrinerules again and neoliberal, free-market capitalism operates without restraint.Yet given his hapless blunderingon other key foreign issues, the most likely explanation for Trump’s behaviour is that, typically, he hasn’t got a clue what he’s doing – in Venezuela or Latin America as whole. There’s no plan. He throws his weight about, makes impetuous misjudgments, stokes fear of foreigners and bases policy on whether he “likes” other leaders. In 2019, with Maduro on the ropes, Trump blinked. Today, full-scale military intervention in Venezuela remains unlikely. More probable is an intensified pressure campaign of destabilisation, sanctions, maritime strikes, and air and commando raids.Far from weakening and isolating the regime, Trump may achieve the exact opposite. Maduro is already using the crisis to assume dictatorial “special powers” and rally public opinion behind patriotic calls for national solidarity. Trump’s bullying of other left-leaning Latin American countriessuch as Colombia– and presumptuous cheerleading for rightwing populistsin Argentinaand El Salvador – is spurringa regional backlash, too. Most governments abhor the thought of a return to the bad old days of Yanqui meddling in Washington’s “back yard”.Trump’s attempt to use punitive tariffs and sanctions tostrong-arm Brazilinto pardoning its disgraced former hard-right president Jair Bolsonaro backfired spectacularly last month. Huge crowdstook to the streetsof Brazilian cities to defend what they rightly saw as an assault on Brazilian sovereignty and rule of law. The popularity of Bolsonaro’s successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, soared. “We are not, and never again will we be, anyone’s colony,” he declared. Lula told Trump, in effect, to get lost. Then, when they met at the UN general assembly, Trump backed offand played nice. Keir Starmer,please note.The perception of a great leap backwards in US-Latin America relations grows ineluctably. “His administration views Latin America primarily as a security threat, associating it with drug trafficking, organised crime and incoming migration,” Irene Mia of the International Institute for Strategic Studieswarned earlier this year. “The US approach has become essentially negative, prioritising unilateral action and dominance rather than partnership,” she said, adding: “The region is being treated less as an equal partner and more as a sphere of influence to be controlled in line with US strategic interests.”Trump’s hawkish advisers are part of the problem: notably Stephen Miller, White Housedeputy chief of staff, and Marco Rubio, a former Republican senator for Florida who is secretary of state and national security adviser. For Rubio, a longtime critic of leftwing rulers in Cuba and Nicaragua, Madurois unfinished business. Defending the boat attacks, he declared: “Interdiction doesn’t work. What will stop them is when you blow them up … And it’ll happen again.” Coming from the top US diplomat, this is quite a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They weave human lives into forms that invite understanding, reminding us that migration is part of Australia’s shared storySun 5 Oct 2025 18.37 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 19.57 EDTShareTime and time again, the story of the Arab migrant appears in the media in narrow and damaging ways: victims in their homelands, shootings in the suburbs, demonstrations in the streets, arrests linked to terrorism or crime. These images have become shorthand for “Arabness” in Australia.What is rarely seen is the complexity of who we are. Occasionally, a “success story” surfaces, but it is framed as an exception rather than part of a broader, vibrant community. For most Australians, Arab voices remain invisible. The everyday lives of Arab Australians, growing up between languages, caring for family, excelling in business, academia or the arts, barely register in public imagination.Poetry forged in war: Palestinian exile and social media sensation Plestia Alaqad leaves Sydney audience in tearsRead moreThis silence has consequences. When only stories of crime circulate, prejudice flourishes. Arab Australians face accusations of extremism, scrutiny for political views, and hostility when speaking about Palestine, Lebanon, Syria or Sudan, even when their concerns are humanitarian. Silence may feel safer, but it comes at a cost: erasing histories and disconnecting younger generations from their families’ heritage.For a country such as Lebanon, marked by long-term conflicts including civil war and multiple Israeli invasions, it is hard for the average Australian to grasp the complexities behind such bloody and seemingly endless crises. It is even harder to reckon with the multiple displacements endured by Palestinian refugees: born in camps outside Palestine, children of parents and grandparents forced out, raising children who may never see the land of their ancestors.For such complexity, essays, novels, poems and plays can do what headlines cannot: they weave human lives into forms that invite understanding.In recent years, Arab Australians have refused silence. Writers, poets, journalists and performers are reclaiming narratives once reduced to stereotype. Loubna Haikal’s Seducing Mr McLean portrays Arab Australian life with humour and insight. Randa Abdel-Fattah, through fiction and the anthology Arab, Australian, Other, reclaims “Arab” as identity rather than accusation. Abbas El-Zein’s Bullet, Paper, Rock reflects on war, exile and belonging. Alongside them, Amal Awad, Michael Mohammed Ahmad, Jumaana Abdu, Sara M Saleh, Sarah Ayoub, Yumna Kassab, Daniel Nour, and George Haddad, among others, produce novels, essays and poetry that assert presence and creativity.The stories of Arabs in Australia are not just Arab stories, they are Australian storiesCommunity projects like the BankstownPoetrySlam nurture emerging poets exploring identity and social justice. Theatre makers such as James Elazzi and the Arab Theatre Studio interrogate migration, belonging and intergenerational memory. Arab women, in particular, use these platforms to push against stereotypes, asserting themselves as thinkers, professionals, survivors and creators. Their voices insist on being heard, not as marginal commentary but as essential contributions to Australian culture.This growing body of work is a reminder that people do not abandon their homelands lightly. Migration is rarely adventure; it is necessity. Those who leave carry profound loss but also fierce determination to begin again. These threads – loss, resilience, courage – run through Arab Australian storytelling. They affirm identity shaped not only by hardship, but also by the cultures, languages and memories carried across borders.Australian authors group give every federal politician five books to encourage nuance in Middle East debateRead moreCultural work is more than representation; it is reclamation. Storytelling counters racism, insists on visibility and resists political silencing. It allows Arab Australians to speak about Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, or Sudan as people bound by history and humanity. Literature cannot end wars, but it can reveal the lives within them.Refaat Alareer’s poem If I Must Die, written weeks before he was killed in Gaza, survives as witness, cutting through denial and preserving truth.The impact extends beyond Arab communities. Memoirs, poems and plays about growing up Arab in Australia resonate with migrants from Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and other backgrounds who recognise familiar struggles of belonging. Literature dismantles “othering”, nurtures empathy and opens dialogue, reminding us that migration is part of the nation’s shared story.What is needed now is recognition. Publishers must embrace Arab Australian work. Schools and universities should include it in curricula. Media must move beyond cliches. And readers must be willing to listen.The stories of Arabs in Australia are not just Arab stories, they are Australian stories. Through storytelling, Arab Australians are writing themselves into the national narrative, until “Arab Australian” is no longer a label of suspicion but another thread in the rich tapestry of this country.Oula Ghannoum, Nouha Francis and Mariam Maatooq are part of theDon’t Ask the Trees Collective, a group of Arab Australian writers, together with Loubna Haikal, Mary Hanoun Khilla, Sivine Tabbouch, Hend Saab, Kilda Eid and Camilia NaimExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionArab and Middle East unrestPoetryAustralian bookscommentShareReuse this content"

That should serve her well in the battles aheadThe Rev Martine Oborne is the chair of Women and the Church (Watch) and vicar of St Michael’s church in Chiswick, LondonSun 5 Oct 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 14.33 EDTSharePeople all over the country will have rejoiced on Friday at the news of the first ever female archbishop of Canterbury. After literally centuries of women seeking to serve as leaders in the church, a woman will now hold the most senior position in the Church of England. And the news was welcomed not simply becauseSarah Mullallyis a woman, but because she is a wise, intelligent, courageous and compassionate leader.Of course, some people are unhappy – either because of her sex or because of her support for the blessings of same-sex relationships. And some raise concerns about a serious safeguarding case five years ago thatwas not handled wellon her watch by the diocese of London safeguarding team.Nonetheless, Bishop Sarah – while quite diminutive in stature – has broad shoulders, which she will need. She has survived seven years as bishop of London, which covers one of the most polarised parts of the country when it comes to female priests and bishops.One in five churchesin London have passed resolutions to limit women from being vicars or from consecrating the bread and wine. She has been on the receiving end of misogynistic behaviour: in February of this year at General Synod, the church’s national assembly, she broke down in tears as she brought to mind the many “micro-aggressions” she has been subjected to. I would hazard a guess that some of those incidents were not micro at all.As archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop Sarah will preside over a church that is open to women being priests and bishops but, at the same time, has seven serving bishops who welcome her as their new archbishop but would not personally receive communion from her (the bishops of Blackburn, Chichester, Beverley, Fulham, Oswestry, Richborough and Lewes); and one bishop (the bishop of Ebbsfleet)who does not believewomen should be in authority over men in the church. Furthermore, there arestill nearly 600 churches, according to Women and the Church, that continue to limit women, where she might not be able to preside over the bread and wine or preach.In her global role as head of the Anglican communion – the 85 million people in more than 165 countries who call themselves Anglicans – Bishop Sarah will also face challenges because of her sex. Although most provinces in the Anglican communion do now accept female priests and bishops, some do not. Her position on same-sex relations – she is supportive of allowing clergy to bless same-sex relationships, if they agree to do this – is also criticised by some. Significant and powerful factions of the Church of England and Anglican communion resist this. Gafcon (the Global Anglican Future Conference), a network of conservative churches, has already announced that it receives the news of Bishop Sarah’s appointment “with sorrow”.So how will this all play out?By the time Bishop Sarah is “enthroned” as archbishop in March next year, she will only have six years before she will be expected to retire at age 70. There is nonetheless a lot she can achieve in that time. To do that, I believe, she will need to demonstrate leadership that takes the church in a clear direction. In the past, the rallying cry has been unity and our leaders have gone round in circles to agree with everyone – despite there being proper processes for making difficult decisions through prayerful debates and votes at General Synod.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The temptation will be to ask for more alternative episcopal oversight on other issues, such as same-sex blessings. But this direction will lead to further division and more people being unable to give or receive the bread and wine together (something that is at the very heart of what it means to be a church). Having the courage to follow due process, take decisions and not always make complicated and expensive provision for those who don’t win the vote will bring not only clarity, but ultimately greater unity too.Recently, I was in a Church of England school teaching a sixth-form class and one young woman said that a boy she knew had told her that the Bible says women need to be under the authority of men. I would have liked to have been able to tell her that this is not what the Church of England believes, full stop. But I could not – as churches are allowed to teach this. In a world with so many problems, so much hatred, misogyny and racism, it would be good for the Church of England to have an authentic voice at its top that calls out the systems of male privilege that drive violence and abuse against women and addresses the institutional misogyny that is currently being ignored. Hopefully, the appointment of our first female archbishop of Canterbury will be a big step towards this.The Rev Martine Oborne is the chair of Women and the Church (Watch) and vicar of St Michael’s church in Chiswick, LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Splashy, lurid pink ads told me that systemic and societal barriers would fall in the face of my self-confidence.Researchershave since debunked the notion that an individual can fix their lives through positive thinking. Will Storr, in his book Selfie,unpacks how theneoliberal mythof the level playing field underpins much of the self-improvement movement.Yet there is a part of me that still believes that if I work hard and glue together a sturdy vision board, I should be able to achieve my wildest dreams: the only thing standing between me and my destiny is me. How do I find a point of equilibrium, a balance between believing that I am capable of anything but am not responsible for every failure?My generation agonises over how to act and what to say. We have to learn to go with the flow | Bertin HuynhRead moreThe answer, according to Saint Augustine, a North African Catholic bishop and philosopher from the fourth century CE, is humility. Augustine wrote that humility was the foundation of all other virtues, and that for someone seeking God “the first part is humility; the second, humility; the third, humility”(Letters 118:22).For a lapsed Catholic like me, the word “humility” may trigger a range of negative emotions. I grew up in an era of the church when caring about your looks constituted the sin of vanity; sexual desire was unacceptable outside of procreation; and just thinking about masturbation was a punishable offence.I don’t think that this was Saint Augustine’s intention, but for many years, I conflated “humility” with shame.Being humble, according to psychiatrist Ravi Chandra, is not about self-loathing. Someone who is healthily humble is proud of their abilities and achievements while acknowledging that there is always more to learn. Chandra defineseight kinds of humility: cultural humility; intergenerational humility; intellectual humility; humility of knowledge; humility of skill; humility of wisdom; humility of awe; and humility in the face of suffering.Psychological researchhas also identified a range of benefits arising from intellectual humility, including greater resilience, tolerance and relatedness.In my work as a pastoral care practitioner in aged care, I now think about humility as the act of being present to the other. Humility is an act of re-grounding: coming back, breath by breath, to the carpet beneath my shoes and the person sitting in front of me.There are some residents who tell me the same five anecdotes from their lives, over and over again, every time I see them. Instead of watching the clock, I try to listen. I try to stay curious. What can I learn from this person and the stories that have stayed with them when so much else has gone?I try to live with the Taoist attitude that theological scholar Huston Smith described as “creative quietude”.Taoist philosophers encourage humans to quiet the ego and live aligned to the flow of creation.This might be especially relevant as humans seek to repair the damage our species has done to the natural world. In her bookFathoms: The World in the Whale,Rebecca Giggs explains that being humble allows us to re-connect with “the animalinside,the creature that quakes at what twitches beyond the campfire light”. Taking a position of humility, of not-knowing, allows us to remember our species is a part of a larger whole.There is a barrenness and hopelessness that comes with believing you can do anything: success – whether this means getting rich, losing weight, or winning the presidential race – becomes the only acceptable option. Humility allows for grace and failure. I am humble, rooted in the earth, which means I have everything I need to grow.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW Premier’s literary multicultural award.

One of them was 11-year-old Karenna Gore. Back home, Karenna’s mother was shocked to hearPrincesing, on the album’s fifth track Darling Nikki: “I knew a girl named Nikki / I guess you could say she was a sex fiend / I met her in a hotel lobby/ masturbating with a magazine.”“I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Karenna’s mother, Tipper Gore. “The vulgar lyrics embarrassed both of us. At first, I was stunned – then I got mad!”Parents getting upset by their offspring’s musical enthusiasms is nothing new, but Tipper was no ordinary Tennessee mum– she was married to rising Democrat politician Senator Al Gore. Determined to do something, Tipper reached across the Democrat-Republican divide to Susan Baker, wife of James Baker, the treasury secretary under Ronald Reagan. They brought in two more women and co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). As all four women had husbands with strong connections to government, the US media dubbed the committee “the Washington wives”.View image in fullscreenLyrical flow … Tipper Gore and Susan Baker giving evidence at the Senate hearing in September 1985.Photograph: James Colburn/Globe Photos/ZUMA/AlamyThe PMRC organised a US Senate hearing for September 1985, its aim to increase parental controls over recorded music. Even before hearings began the PMRC had remarkable momentum: funding came from Beach Boys vocalist Mike Love and Joseph Coors, owner of Coors beer, both active Reagan supporters, and the committee gained considerable media coverage, earning support from the likes of Jerry Falwell, US televangelist and co-founder of the Moral Majority. The campaign arrived at a favourable time. While video nasties served as folk devils in the UK, in the US Ronald Reagan’s emphasis on “family values” had empowered the religious right: with the surging popularity of MTV, the music video channel, musicians were now drawing increasing ire from Christian organisations.“Initially, I didn’t pay much attention to the PMRC,” says Blackie Lawless, leader of Wasp, one of the bands targeted by the organisation. “Then it went on to have a huge impact, took on a life of its own.”The US had experienced occasional outbreaks of music-related moral panics before. The mid-1950s saw Elvis Presley damned by segregationists for making “jungle music”, while John Lennon’s 1966 observation “The Beatles are more popular than Jesus” led to bonfires of Beatles records. But there had never been a concerted government attempt to censor music. As the Senate hearings got under way it became clear censorship was now on the agenda.View image in fullscreenRock in a hard place … Frank Zappa, left, and Twisted Sister’s Dee Snider hold up papers relating to the 1985 PMRC senate hearing at Capitol Hill.Photograph: Mark Weiss/Getty ImagesFor the hearings the PMRC compiled a list of 15 contemporary songs – the “Filthy Fifteen” – that they determined had “objectionable” qualities: sex, violence, references to drugs or alcohol, occult themes and bad language. Prince was linked to three of them, as an artist, writer and producer. The list also included Mary Jane Girls, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, all listed for singing very coy, pro-female sexuality songs. Heavy metal bands (then the biggest selling genre in US music) dominated: AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Mötley Crüe, veterans of attacks by evangelical organisations, were included, along with newbies Def Leppard,Judas Priest, Twisted Sister and Wasp, who suddenly found politicians and religious fundamentalists calling for their music and videos to be removed from radio and MTV.“I had been following all of this building up on the news so I wasn’t completely surprised,” says Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford, “although being called ‘enemy of the people’ was a stretch.”In the Senate hearings the PMRC requested the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) develop a form of music rating akin to that used by the Motion Picture Association for film classifications. Their agenda included calling for printed warnings on album covers, requiring record shops to put albums with explicit covers under the counter, pressuring television stations not to broadcast explicit videos and, more ominously, reassessing “the contracts of musicians who performed violently or sexually in concert”.Putting Parental Advisory stickers on albums surely backfired as they became the ones kids wanted to buyAlice CooperIt wasn’t just the musicians on the Filthy Fifteen list who expressed opprobrium at the PMRC’s campaign – veteran rockers Frank Zappa andAlice Cooper, both of whom had courted outrage early in their careers, protested about what they saw as the PMRC serving as a cover for encroaching censorship.Cooper was a a veteran of censorship battles in the UK. In the summer of 1972 his eponymous group’s song School’s Out topped the charts in the UK, prompting calls for its banning. “I sent Mary Whitehouse flowers and Leo Abse a box of cigars,” Cooper chuckles at the outraged response from, respectively, the conservative activist and the Welsh Labour MP at the time.The PMRC campaign 12 years later was less of a laughing matter: for Cooper a sinister example of government overreach. “It was like they were saying to kids: ‘You can’t see something or hear something because you’re not smart enough to deal with it,’” he says. “If something is really violent or horrible it should be a talk between the parents and their kids, not the government and the kids.”View image in fullscreenSigns of the times … Protesters outside the Senate hearing in Washington, September 1985.Photograph: Mark Weiss/Getty ImagesAs the Senate hearings got under way, Zappa travelled to Washington DC. There he was joined by pop-folk singer John Denver – who, like Zappa, happily appeared as a witness despite not featuring on the Filthy Fifteen list – and Twisted Sister’s vocalist Dee Snider, who did appear on the list. The trio testified during the hearings as to why music censorship was a bad idea. Zappa, dressed conservatively in suit and tie, provided the enduring image of the hearings as he sparred with the PMRC and their supporters, saying that “the PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children [and] infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children”.Denver, meanwhile, noted how his song Rocky Mountain High had been misinterpreted by those who deemed it a paean to taking drugs (when it was a celebration of Colorado’s natural beauty) while Snider asserted the PMRC misconstrued the lyric to Twisted Sister’s Under the Blade – it wasn’t about sadomasochism (as Gore claimed), but surgery.Judas Priest’s Halford wasn’t at the hearings, but says that the PMRC misinterpreted his lyrics, too. The committee claimed the song Eat Me Alive was about the forced performance of oral sex at gunpoint. Today Halford says it was in fact about gay S&M sex, although in 1985 he said nothing. The Brum rock god didn’t come out until 1998.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Not subtle but not obscene, either. “Originally I was going to attend the Senate hearings and testify,” he says, “but EMI – our record label – requested that we didn’t go. They didn’t think it was a good idea. Frank, John and Dee all did a really good job in speaking on artists’ behalf, not that it made much difference.”The trio may have spoken eloquently but US record labels caved before the hearings ended: the RIAA agreed to put Parental Advisory stickers on any album containing “controversial” content. This led to certain retailers – including Walmart (then the US’s largest record retailer) – refusing to stock albums carrying the stickers. “At the time the hard right cornered Walmart so they had no choice,” says Halford. “I would imagine that sales took a hit for every label.”Lawless, meanwhile, claims that the PMRC Senate hearings endangered not only his career but his life. “In the US there was an element of society who thought: ‘The world would be better off without these people,’ and we began getting death threats. I was twice shot at – not in concert, thankfully, although once while we were playing someone threw a heavy glass jar and it hit me right on the top of my head and split my scalp open.”Musicians replied to the PMRC in song: Judas Priest’s Parental Guidance and Alice Cooper’s Freedom both damned the organisation, while on Wasp’s Live … In the Raw album Lawless dedicates the song Harder, Faster to the Washington wives: “They can suck me, suck me, eat me raw!”View image in fullscreenFreak out … Frank Zappa giving evidence at the Senate hearing in September 1985.Photograph: James Colburn/Globe Photos/ZUMA/AlamyThe Senate hearings broadened discussion around censorship in the US while inspiring lawsuits against “offensive” musicians. San Franciscan punk band Dead Kennedys became embroiled in a court case not for their songs, but due to an insert of HR Giger’s artwork Penis Landscape inside the cover of 1985’s Frankenchrist album: a parent offended by their teenage daughter’s purchase of the album sued the band. On 7 March 1990, Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra debated Tipper Gore on the Oprah Winfrey show, with Biafra asserting Gore’s defence of being “a liberal Democrat” was undermined by her PMRC cheerleading, noting how the committee had fuelled the Christian right.Both Cooper and Lawless argue that that Tipper’s motivation behind the PMRC was to help build support for her husband’s 1987 campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination (Al Gore would lose the race, but later become Bill Clinton’s vice-president, before losing to George Bush in contentious fashion in the 2000 presidential election). “Just as McCarthy used the red scare to gain more power, this was a campaign to build a political base through suggesting musicians were bringing sexual perversion and the occult into children’s bedrooms,” says Lawless.Rap would soon overtake rock as the US’s most popular youth music and gangsta rap’s rhymes would attract even greater outrage. In 1989, NWA and 2 Live Crew generated huge controversy – the former for rhymes that, among other things, celebrated shooting LAPD officers, the latter over the explicit sexual content on their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be. After a federal judge ruled the album to be obscene – an unprecedented verdict for a US music recording – Bible belt states began prosecuting stores that sold the album, and that hosted their performances. The US court of appeals would ultimately overturn the obscenity ruling, but by then the controversy had helped both outfits sell millions of albums – though the myriad legal battles would fracture both groups.“I found the whole thing patronising and stupid,” says Cooper. “And putting Parental Advisory stickers on albums surely backfired as they became the ones kids wanted to buy.”Despite the PMRC officially disbanding in the mid 1990s, its legacy can be seen in the Parental Advisory stickers that continue to be employed on many US albums. In the internet age where seemingly anything, no matter how offensive, is just a click away, the committee’s attempts to censor popular music now seems archaic. Still, there are echoes of their crusade today in the attempts to censor comedians such as Jimmy Kimmel over his comments on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.“We are in dangerous times around the world,” says Halford. “I’ve lived long enough to witness history repeat itself.”Alice Cooper’s album The Revengeof Alice Cooperis out now on earMUSIC.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalCensorshipAlice CooperJudas PriestPrincefeaturesShareReuse this content"

One, called October 8, focused on the “emergence of antisemitism on college campuses, on social media and on the streets” after Hamas forces killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians. The film, executive-produced by Debra Messing, was widely released by Briarcliff Entertainment, a maverick distribution studio that has also handled Trump biopicThe Apprenticeand Jamal Khashoggi documentaryThe Dissident; Messing promoted the film on mainstream programs such asMSNBC’s Morning Joe. It ultimatelygrossedmore than $1.3m domestically, a high total for a political documentary.The other film,The Encampments, faced a tougher road. A documentary on campus protests against Israel’s retaliatory destruction ofGaza, focusing in part on activistMahmoud Khalil– by thendetainedby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for his activism – got no celebrity morning show promotion. Its specialty release at New York’s Angelika theater led tothreats of violence, an incident of vandalism in the theater’s lobby and social media censorship of its ads. That it was released at all – and made $80,000 in its opening weekend, asignificant win for the specialty box office– is due to Watermelon Pictures, an upstart, Palestinian American-led film-financing and -distribution company founded by brothers Hamza and Badie Ali to help films with Palestinian perspectives reach audiences they otherwise would not, in a market that has otherwise ignored or deprioritized them.‘A chilling effect’: is Hollywood too scared to touch hot-button documentaries?Read moreThe two documentaries evince the different landscapes for Israeli and Palestinian narratives in the US – one concentrated and often backed by more mainstream institutions, the other fractured and more ad hoc, yet growing. The two-year anniversary of the 7 October attacks throws the contrast into sharper relief – this weekend marks the limited release of The Road Between Us, Barry Avrich’s documentary following retired Israeli general Noam Tibon’s efforts to save his son’s family from Hamas forces on 7 October. A gripping Taken-like tale of survival, trauma and mourning that does not mention Israel’s subsequent killing of at least 66,000 Palestinians in retaliation, The Road Between Us receivedsupportfrom celebrities like Messing and Amy Schumer, andwonthe People’s Choice Award for best documentary at the Toronto film festival. US distribution rights were quicklysnapped upby Forston Consulting.It’s difficult to get any hot-button, politically challenging film financed,let alone releasedin the US, especially under the second Trump administration. But films featuring Palestinian perspectives, or films challenging the narrative of a government that has turned the horrors of 7 October into aweapon of warjustifying an internationally recognized genocide in Gaza, have found it especially challenging, sometimes impossible, to reach audiences. “I’ve never made a film about Palestine that’s ever been distributed,” said Amber Fares, the director of Coexistence, My Ass!, a documentary about Israeli comedian Noam Shuster-Eliassi confronting her upbringing as “the literal poster child for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process” in the wake of the near-complete destruction of Gaza.With an acclaimed festival run, Fares, who is Lebanese Canadian, had hopes for a distribution deal for Coexistence, My Ass! “We thought that there could be a chance that Coexistence could break through just based on Noam and what she stands for (–) it’s such a unique way of looking at the issue,” Fares said. But deals never worked out; the team ultimately opted for a self-release strategy starting later this month, handled by the same company that arrangedNo Other Land’s self-release earlier this year. That film, a searing documentary by an Israeli-Palestinian collective about generational efforts to resist occupation in a small West Bank community, won a bittersweet Oscar for best documentary; weeks later, Israeli settlersseverely beatco-director Hamdan Ballal, who was thenarrestedby soldiers allegedlymocking the award. It’s still not available for streaming in the US but made more than $2.5m at the US box office (making it the highest grossing of the year’s Oscar-nominated docs).‘We need to do something’: the company releasing Palestinian films no one else willRead moreAll That’s Left of You, a sweeping epic on three generations of a Palestinian family displaced in 1948, also sought distribution out of a strong festival run, but ran into concern from distributors over the “subject matter”. “We had high hopes that one mainstream distributor would come through,” said Palestinian American director Cherien Dabis. One conversation with an unnamed company ended, according to Dabis, with a pass, citing too many films on their slate. “That’s exactly what they told another Palestinian film that more recently premiered at a festival. It all feels like political cowardice,” she said.The reality, according to Watermelon co-founder Hamza Ali, is that “there are not a lot of distributors that are going to support Palestinian films”. Major streaming companies have steered clear. But Paramount recentlyacquiredthe global streaming rights to Red Alert, a four-part scripted series produced in part by the Israel Entertainment Fund, which depicts the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel that, per the logline, “turned southern Israel into a war zone, testing humanity and forging heroism through chaos”. Paramount CEO and chair David Ellison touted the series as evidence of the company’s “continued commitment to storytelling through artistic excellence and accuracy”. And HBO Maxacquiredthe US rights for One Day in October, a scripted series based on first-hand accounts of the attack that will debut on its second anniversary.Meanwhile, “I don’t think a single Palestinian film has ever gotten mainstream distribution in the US”, said Dabis, who has since formed her own distribution company, Visibility Films, in wake of the roadblocks. “No one’s really been willing to take a risk on proving that these films could be seen widely.”“It’s unfortunate that we haven’t had that same support,” said Hamza Ali. “Not a single film of ours has been picked up by a mainstream streamer.” Still, “the industry is definitely shifting”, he said, pointing to the recentpledgesigned by more than 3,900 prominent entertainment figures to not work with Israeli film institutions “implicated in genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians, adding: “But it seems, unfortunately, like the streamers are not following suit.” (Liev Schreiber, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Messing were among the celebrities who signed arebukecalling the pledge a “document of misinformation”; several cited Israel’s Oscarsubmissionof The Sea, a film about a Palestinian boy who tries to visit the beach for the first time but is denied entry at a checkpoint. Notably, Israel’s version of the Oscars isfacing government defundingafter The Sea won the top prize.)View image in fullscreenA still from The Voice of Hind Rajab.A new wave of Palestinian-led, challenging films is finally beginning to crest even without major corporate backing – Watermelon signed on with Dabis’s Visibility Films to co-distribute All That’s Left of You, Jordan’s official submission to the Oscars, which will begin its limited theatrical release in January; Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem joined as executive producers. Watermelon also represents Palestine’s official Oscar submission, generational epic Palestine 36, and is executive producer on Kaouther Ben Hania’sThe Voice of Hind Rajab, which drew rave reviews and a major award at Venice; that film, which reconstructs the killing of a five-year-old girl in Gaza with her real voice, will be distributed in Europe by The Party Film Sales, and has yet to find US distribution.Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, Sepideh Farsi’s essay-film on thekillingof Palestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, along with six of her family members, by an IDF airstrike in Gaza this April, willopenin New York in November, with an expansion to follow.With both opportunities and opposition, the hope is to demonstrate, as The Encampments and No Other Land have before, that there is a market for films that challenge the long-standing narrative of Palestinian violence or erasure. “There’s this quandary where no one has proven that there’s an audience for these films,” said Dabis. “But that’s simply because no one has taken a chance on these films. So how can you know if there’s an audience or not an audience? And how could there not be an audience right now when we’re watching a livestreamed genocide?”“I absolutely know there’s an audience,” said Fares, referring to both Coexistence, My Ass!, as well asPalestine36, All That’s Left of You, The Voice of Hind Rajab and No Other Land. “I don’t know if there’s been another time when there’s just been so much interest, and also gatekeeping, where people have to seek these films out.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair and makeup: Celine Nonon at Arlington Artists. Archive image: courtesy of Anthea TurnerBorn in 1960 in Stoke-on-Trent, Anthea Turner began her broadcasting career as a runner for BBC Radio Stoke before moving into children’s television, presentingBlue Peterfrom 1992 to 1994. She went on to front primetime shows including GMTV, The National Lottery Live and Wish You Were Here ... ? More recently, she has appeared on reality series from Celebrity Big Brother to Dancing on Ice, and continues to work across TV, radio and publishing. She is teaming up with Corgi to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Thunderbirds.During Christmas1992,there was a high demand for Tracy Island, the Thunderbirds’ secret headquarters playset. The manufacturers hadn’t ordered enough, so Blue Peter came to the rescue, declaring: “Don’t worry! You can make one at home instead!”When I made one on TV, however, the DIY instructions ended up being so sought-after that our little offices became snowed under with letters. That’s what’s behind me – Royal Mail bags full of stamped addressed envelopes from children wanting to know how to make it. There were probably parents all over the country scratching their heads, thinking: “Why did we think we could help our child craft this intricate thing?” Tracy Island was not for the faint-hearted. I practised so many times to get it right for the live show. There were 8 million viewers – I couldn’t mess it up.These were such fun and innocent times. Everything was slower in the 90s, but there was more unity and the viewers were so engaged. I was 32 when I got the job and glad to be a little older, as it meant I could deal with the pressure of recording two shows a day. They were looking for someone who could hit the ground running, and by this point I had done Saturday morning television and Top of the Pops, so I was ready to jump in with both feet.I could have seen myself following a PR path. Because when it comes down to it, I’m just hustlingDespite how much I enjoyed being part of the team, I spent my Blue Peter era scared to death that I was going to get found out. I was dyslexic, and remember filling in the forms for a Blue Peter medical and thinking: “Oh shit, they’re going to give my job to someone else because I can’t spell.” I ended up getting away with it, but it made me more studious; I had to learn every trick to cover it up. Each morning I would go through my script and learn my and my co-host’s lines by heart, even though there was an Autocue. Nobody knew how to deal with dyslexia back then, but instead of becoming a weakness, it made me even more diligent and creative.I left the show in1994because I was offered a presenting spot onGMTV. In my heart, I wished I could have stayed at Blue Peter for a few more years because I was so happy, but opportunities like that were rare. Transitioning out of children’s television can be tough, so I had to take the leap. The Blue Peter producer Biddy Baxter was a legend but, I had assumed, not my No 1 fan, as she didn’t initially want me for the show. However, when I told her I was leaving, she tore a strip off me, saying: “I cannot believe what you’re doing!” Biddy had various opinions about GMTV, none of which were glowing. I left with mixed feelings, but the Blue Peter team remain a family. There are WhatsApp groups. I did Celebrity SAS in 2020 and remember arriving at this small airport and feeling scared. I looked around and saw the former Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton and immediately felt safe again.There was a part of my life after Blue Peter where I was in the newspapers a lot. How did I cope with the intrusion? Celebrity didn’t all happen overnight. The media’s focus on me was a slow burn; it wasn’t like one day I woke up and was famous. After a while, you get used to the attention, and it wasn’t an issue. But it did mean that when something went wrong – personal stuff like break-ups – stories did end up in the Daily Mail. I don’t feel bitter about it. Being a public figure can be full of joy. If I’m out and about and need help from someone, I always get a warm response from strangers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Getting older isn’t an issue – but a bit of vanity, wanting to fit into some nice clothes, that doesn’t hurt anybody. That said, the elixir of youth is not in a pot of face cream. (Even though I do sell a line of face cream.) Instead, it is in your attitude. I’m trekking Kilimanjaro soon – I guess I thought I needed a challenge. I like to shove myself out of my comfort zone and do something that’s good for my health. Especially now I’ve got more air miles behind me than in front of me. I’m in sniper’s alley! Of course, there are the odd days where I stand in front of the mirror and hold my chin up a little and go: “Oh gosh, that bit doesn’t look quite as good as it used to.” You can turn yourself inside out with that fear of ageing, and I don’t want it to consume me.It’s also harder to get your voice out there these days, because there are so many people scrambling to get people’s attention online. I have fully embraced social media and I love Instagram. I know it gets a bad rap, and some areas of the internet are dark and nasty. But thankfully I’m not involved in those circles, and instead my tribe is positive and enlightening. I might not have millions of people following me, but the right people do.I’m a Gemini, so there are lotsof jobs I think I could have done. As a child I had wanted to be a ballet dancer. I did a few shows, and was intermediate. For many years, I chastised myself, thinking: “I did all that training, and I never actually pursued it properly.” But that core of dance and the discipline ballet requires has been instrumental to almost every job I’ve had. When I did [the winter sports reality show] The Jump, me and Kimberly Wyatt both treated it like a dance competition.The other option for me was PR. Before I got Blue Peter, work wasn’t flowing in, and a friend and I set up a company called Parker Turner PR. I could have seen myself following that path. Because when it comes down to it, I’m just hustling. Whether I am presenting a current affairs show or telling people how to make Tracy Island, I’m selling. But in a nice way, of course.I’ve never been so busy representing my generation. Whether it’s lifestyle or travel, I’m out there. This year I’ve modelled for clothing brands, and have been reporting from St Lucia and Tanzania. Most days I look at my diary and think: “Wow, this is a good life, isn’t it?” For a dyslexic from Stoke, I’ve made a little go a long way.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFlashbackPhotographyBlue PeterGMTVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is extraordinary, as is the history of the family,” Thomas Bompard, the vice-president of Sotheby’sFrance, told the Guardian.“This painting is the Taylor Swift of surrealism,” Bompard said. “If you were to ask a group of schoolchildren to do a presentation on the surrealist movement this painting alone would be enough to define it. I call it the superstar of surrealism.”The Belgian-born Magritte worked as a designer in a wallpaper factory and created advertising posters until 1926, when he produced his first surrealist work. The following year, he had his first exhibition in Brussels but the critics were savage and a dismayed Magritte moved to Paris, where he failed to make his mark.He returnedBelgiumin 1930 and formed an advertising agency with his brother Paul.“Life for Magritte was very difficult at this time. The Great Depression that started in 1929 in the US hit France in the early 1930s. For two years, between 1930 and 1932, Magritte sold nothing and had no exhibitions,” Bompard said.“Nobody was buying paintings by surrealists. They were considered revolutionary troublemakers.”View image in fullscreenRené Magritte with his work The Barbarian (Le Barbare)Photograph: René Magritte/Latrobe Regional GallerySpaak’s husband, Claude, a celebrated Belgian playwright, knew Magritte and was a benefactor, commissioning portraits of his wife and children andarranging a monthly stipend for the artist and his family.In 1934, Suzanne Spaak’s sister Alice Lorge, known as Bunny, bought La Magie Noire to mark the birth of her first child with Emile Happe, a Belgian industrialist.“The Spaak family was to Belgium what the Mountbattens were to the UK; like royalty and they pulled Magritte out of difficulty,” Bompard said. “It was bought to mark the birth of a child but it was a rebirth for Magritte who was struggling to get himself back on his feet.”The model for the series was Magritte’s wife, Georgette Berger, who is portrayed in a classical manner resembling a marble statue resting her hand on a block of stone. Her upper body gradually blends into the sky behind her while her lower half retains its natural tone.Magritte went on to paint 10 similar portraits, most of which were given different names. In this work, the first of the series, Berger is portrayed with a dove on her right shoulder. One-third of the background shows a semi wood-panelled interior wall.View image in fullscreenResistance heroine Suzanne SpaakPhotograph: WikipediaSuzanne and Claude Spaak were living in Paris when war broke out in 1939. After the Nazi occupation of the French capital, she joined the resistance and was a member of the “Red Orchestra” intelligence unit. Spaak used her considerable fortune to save 163 Jewish children from deportation, hiding a number of them at her home before they could be moved to safety.In October 1943, the Nazis arrested Spaak along with 600 members of the Red Orchestra. On 12 August 1944, days before the liberation of Paris, the Gestapo executed her in her prison cell. She was 38 and has since been honoured by Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for her efforts to save Jewish people.Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on 15 August 1967 and is buried in Brussels.The painting, which has been displayed in the Magritte Museum in Brussels, has been rarely seen outside Belgium in more than nine decades.La Magie Noire will be exhibited at Sotheby’s Paris between 17 and 23 October before its sale on 24 October.Explore more on these topicsRené MagritteSecond world warFranceBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now there are 50 versions worldwideTara ConlanSun 5 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 5 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt began as a small Channel 4 show that the narrator, Dave Lamb, thought “would be snuck out in the daytime and no one would ever see it”.ButCome Dine With Mehas become a worldwide hit, marking 20 years since launch with a spin-off featuring teenagers and launching its 50th version – a French-speaking edition in north Africa.Over the past two decades, contestants on the dinner party competition serve up dishes ranging from sausage trifle to grasshopper cheesecake in their efforts to impress.View image in fullscreenThe contestants rate each other based on their enjoyment of the evening, including their cooking.Photograph: Channel 4Worldwide there have been more than 20,000 episodes broadcast and more than 60,000 courses served. And during that time the show has charted society’s change in social, culinary and interior design tastes.“It’s been a kind of historical snapshot,” said its editor, Henry Hainault.Lamb said that in the UK, contestants have become, “more sophisticated in their approach”. Mike Beale, the managing director of ITV Studios Creative Network, which owns the production company Multistory Media, said they have moved from basic dishes such as spaghetti bolognese to more complicated meals with the advent of more cookery shows.One of the reasons for its popularity, Hainault said, is families can watch it together, but also because “it’s one of very few shows that celebrates people in their own homes …[plus] fundamentally people are interested in people”.View image in fullscreenClips from the show have become immortalised on social media for their comedy value; for example, Kev and his whisk.Photograph: Channel 4“It’s five people that wouldn’t necessarily be having dinner together, that’s how the show started and it still works today.”Lamb likes that it shows different people can get on: “It’s a really diverse representation of the people of Britain … not only does it travel around the country, but you get a lot of different types of people within it and they sit very naturally alongside each other. It’s really reassuring that that Britishness is so multicultural and so tolerant … it feels like it can do a job unifying us a bit at the moment.”View image in fullscreenAmong the more adventurous dishes to feature on the show was the sausage trifle.Photograph: Channel 4The UK show has created not only memorable moments – a pet snake once defecated on a table, one contestant did a rap in Thai and another was caught cheating using food from a restaurant – but also long-lasting friendships (some groups still meet once a month), romantic relationships and even a baby.View image in fullscreenAnother unforgettable moment was delivered by series seven’s Pete, who was put out that his fellow contestant Jane, won, uttering the line: ‘What a sad little life, Jane.’Photograph: No  creditAnd it has also brought people with opposing viewpoints around the same table. Beale recounts that the Israeli version features Arabic and Hebrew contestants: “It does bring people together … from different backgrounds who wouldn’t necessarily get on.”The most successful dish overall is tiramisu, but one of the least successful, Hainault recalled, was a UK contestant’s prosecco cheesecake. “One thing you could say about the British one, I think it’s probably low down the list in terms of the standard of cooking,” he said.Beale said that, in France, the cooking is taken “very seriously”. Other culinary differences across the world include the eastern European series featuring a “lot of potatoes” and the Mexican version numerous bean-based dishes.A nation’s culture also creates variations. Beale said: “It’s interesting how each territory localises [the show] or culturally adopts it.” He said that Germany likes trying new twists, basing the show in a castle one week, while in Turkey the most important thing is the entertainment the contestants put on to impress their fellow diners.View image in fullscreenContestants are judged on the quality of their entertainment as well as their cooking. Take series 45’s Jamie’s silent disco, for example.Photograph: Channel 4The series has always been popular with students and from November, Channel 4 will air a teen spin-off. Hainault said he had admiration for the youngsters, as for “most of them, it’s the first time they’ve ever cooked for other people. And in some cases, the first time they’ve ever been around to other people’s houses to have a meal and of their own age.” Interestingly one couple had not even eaten soup before, “because it looked too liquidy”.Globally, the series has adapted before, with celebrity versions and a couples’ spin-off – which enabled the format to travel to the Middle East, where previously it had not been aired due to the mixing of men and women.View image in fullscreenThe show’s editor, Henry Hainault, says comedy comes from the difference between people’s view of themselves and how they actually come across.Photograph: Channel 4One of the universal truths that crosses borders, said Hainault, is “fundamentally, there is a vast chasm between people’s opinions of themselves and the person they actually present to the world. And the gap between who people think they are and who other people think they are is where a lot of the comedy happens.”Lamb also said his voiceover had “become a little kinder over the years”, although he always makes sure “I shouldn’t say anything I wouldn’t be prepared to say if I was sat around the table with the people who are on it.”Explore more on these topicsCome Dine With MeReality TVFood TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about dreams of Oxford, the deaths of friends and how tragedy has shaped the person she has becomeSun 5 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareBatool Abu Akleen was having lunch in the seaside apartment that has become the latest refuge for her family of seven, when a missile struck a nearby cafe. It was the last day of June, an ordinary Monday in Gaza City. “I was holding a falafel wrap and looking out of the window, and the window shook,” she says. Within an instant, dozens of men, women and children were dead, in an atrocity that wasreported around the world. “It doesn’t feel real sometimes,” she adds, with the nonchalance of someone numbed by living with horror.But this impression is misleading. At just 20 years old, Abu Akleen is becoming one of Gaza’s most vivid and unstinting witnesses, whose debut poetry collection has already won accolades from the novelist Anne Michaels, the playwright Caryl Churchill and the poet Hasib Hourani, among others. She has thrown her whole being into finding a language for the unspeakable, one capable of articulating its surrealism and absurdity as well as its daily tragedies.In her poems, missiles are fired from Apache helicopters, fleetingly referencing both the US’s role and its history of annihilation; an ice-cream vendor sells frozen corpses to dogs; a woman wanders the streets, carrying the dying city in her arms and trying to buy a secondhand ceasefire (she can’t, because the price keeps going up). The collection itself is titled 48Kg. This, Abu Akleen explains, is because it consists of 48 poems, each representing a kilogram of her own weight. “I consider my poems to be part of my flesh, so I collected my body, in case I was smashed and there was no one there to bury me.”We are talking via videocall to a workhub near her home. Abu Akleen is elegantly dressed in chequered black and white, twiddling rings on two fingers that testify both to the fashion sense of someone barely out of her teens and to yet another catastrophe. One of her close friends, the photojournalist Fatma Hassouna, was killed in a strike this spring, a month before the Cannes film festival premiere of a documentary about her life,Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk. Fatma loved rings, says Abu Akleen. The two were chatting about them, and sunsets, the night before she died. “Now I wonder whether I should remember her by wearing my rings or taking them off.”Abu Akleen is the oldest of five children born into a professional family in Gaza City. Her father is a lawyer and her mother worked as a site engineer. She started writing aged 10 “and it just clicked”, she says. Before long, a teacher was telling her parents that their daughter had an exceptional talent that must be nurtured. Her mother has ever since been her first reader and editor.At 15 she won an international poetry competition and individual poems started to be published in journals and anthologies. When she wasn’t writing, she painted. She was also a “nerd”, who excelled at English, and now speaks it fluently enough to be able to translate her own work, although she has never ventured beyond Gaza. “I used to have big dreams and one of them was to go to Oxford,” she says. To egg herself on she stuck a notice to her desk that read: “Oxford is waiting for you.”Before the genocide, I used to complain about my life. Then I found myself just running and trying to surviveShe settled for a degree in English literature and translation at the Islamic University of Gaza, and was about to start her second year when Hamas launched its 7 October attack on Israel. “Before the genocide,” she says, “I was a spoilt girl who used always to complain about my life. Then suddenly I found myself just running and trying to survive.” This theme, of the privileges of peace taken for granted, is present in her poems: “A busker used to fill our street with boredom,” begins one, which ends, begging, “may boredom return to our streets”. Another remembers the “casual hospital death” of her grandfather, who had dementia, which she lamented “in poems as casual as your death”.There was nothing casual about the murder of her grandmother, in a missile strike on her uncle’s home. “Why haven’t you taught me to sew?” a granddaughter asks in a poem, so she could stitch her grandmother’s face back together and kiss it one more time. Dismemberment is a constant motif in the collection, with severed limbs crying out to each other across the cratered streets.Abu Akleen’s family decided to join the hordes fleeing Gaza City after a neighbour was hit by two missiles in the street outside their home as he walked from one building to another. “We heard the screams of a woman and no one dared to look out of the window to see what had happened; there was no phone signal, no ambulance. Mum said: ‘Right, we’re going to leave.’ But where? We had nowhere to go.”For several months, her father stayed in north Gaza to protect their home from looters, while the rest of the family moved to a refugee camp in the south. “There was no gas cooker, so we did everything on a wood fire,” she recalls. “Unfortunately my mother’s eyes were allergic to the smoke so I used to bake the bread. I was always angry and burning my fingers.” A poem inspired by that time depicts a woman melting all her fingers one by one. “Middle Finger I raise between the eyes / of the bomb that hasn’t yet reached me / Ring Finger I lend to the woman / who lost her hand & her husband / Little Finger will make my peace / with all the food I hated to eat.”After composing the poems in Arabic, she rewrote all but a few in English. The two versions are presented side by side. “They’re not translations, they’re recreations, with some words changed,” she says. “The Arabic ones are heavier for me. They carry more pain. The English ones have more confidence: it’s another version of me – the more recent one.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m less timid now.”Though their old home was destroyed, the family decided during the short-lived ceasefire in January this year to return to Gaza City, renting the apartment in which they now live, with a view of the sea. Below their window, Abu Akleen can see the tents of those who are not so lucky. “I live & a thousand martyrs fall / I eat & my father starves / I write & shelling shatters my neighbour’s hand,” she writes in a poem called Sin, which negotiates her survivor’s guilt. It is laid out in two columns which can be read horizontally or vertically, making concrete the gap between the living, writing, eating poet and the victims on the other side of the ampersand.Armed with her new assertiveness, Abu Akleen has continued to study online, has started teaching young children, and has even begun to travel a bit on her own in Gaza, which – with the broken logic of a destroyed society – was considered far too dangerous in the good old days. Also, she says, surprisingly, “I learned to be rude, which is good. It means you can use bad words with bad people; you don’t have to be that polite person all the time. It helped me so much with being the person that I am today.”As a child she had to be cajoled into reading. Still, she says, “I read the world more than I read books.” In the imagery of her own poetry, the horrors she has witnessed have put an old head on young shoulders. “This is what happens when death is chasing after you,” she says. “You run so fast through life to live as much as you can, because you know you don’t have the luxury of being young and making mistakes.”48Kg by Batool Abu Akleen, translated in collaboration with Graham Liddell, Wiam El-Tamami, Cristina Viti and Yasmin Zaher, is published by Tenement.Explore more on these topicsPoetryGazaPalestineinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Director Ramon Ayres employs a similarly striking blend of sound, visual effects and physicality in Uprooted, but the story does not quite cohere, despite some individually superlative scenes.Rewind review – ingenious portrait of oppression and dissent in Latin AmericaRead moreThe drama is once again set in Latin America, and this time depicts the advent of western imperialism and its ruinous effects on ecology, indigenous life and the climate. Deviser-performers Eyglo Belafonte, Josephine Tremelling, Louise Wilcox and Vanessa Guevara Flores give spirited performances, and there is an overarching eco-feminist message that connects gendered violence to the rape and exploitation of the land.Musical compositions by Alex Paton, who sits on a raised platform on one side of the stage, certainly carry great levels of drama. Marco Curcio’s magnificent sound design adds ambience, embroidering bird-sounds with the babble of streams, the sound of chainsaws and earth-rattling rumbles. Tremelling’s lighting design is wondrous too, using miniature models of houses lit up from the inside to depict displacement, and shadow-play from within a recycling bin, as well as imaginatively using of wind-machine and muslin to depict rippling water and, at one point, a thunderous landslide.View image in fullscreenMartian-like occupiers … Louise Wilcox and Ephemeral Ensemble.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut despite this stagecraft and immersive atmosphere, there is little specificity to the story and minimal character building. Characters fight against the colonial destruction of their land and are angry, but they are almost as faceless as the occupiers, who wear martian-like metal facemasks.Uprooted touches on more issues that it can possibly do justice to within its hour-long duration, from female activism against colonialism and climate disaster to child labour, economic disruption to local communities, violence against women and more.It is frustrating that the script seems so generic in its messages and didactic in its delivery. Indigenous people fought and resisted western occupiers, we hear, and one defender of the land is still killed every other day. A quiz delivers more facts and figures. Strident statements are made about the centrality of the earth, progress versus plunder, and hopelessness being a luxury we cannot afford in the fight against environmental catastrophe. But they sound generalising and familiar. Where Rewind led with specificity to evoke intense emotion, this is a disjointed screed that leaves you impressed yet oddly unmoved.AtNew Diorama theatre, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreEnvironmental activismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Head to Jane Upton’s panoramic and boundlessly imaginative, Bruntwood prize-shortlisted play. It zips through scenes from M’s life after the birth of her first child – an old school flame tells her he “expected more” from her; she bickers with her husband about not wanting sex anymore – but (the) Woman is much more than an ordered presentation of ideas. M (a gut-punching Lizzy Watts) is a writer, and what we’re watching is her attempt to create a play that captures motherhood with all its messy, unvarnished edges.Angharad Jones’s production weaves M’s writing process into the action. The title of each scene is typed, deleted and rewritten across the back wall of the stage. There are glitches and line repetitions, as M’s artistic vision struggles into shape. In a boardroom scene, she meets two commissioners who agree she can write a play about motherhood – so long as it involves crime, a possessed baby and a few musical numbers.It is metatheatre at its finest, with the play feeling as if it’s being written live. “Wait, am I in the play right now?” asks M’s friend, gazing out at the audience in recognition of the blurred line between performance and reality. Structurally, the play is an unpredictable explosion – just as motherhood is too.View image in fullscreenIntimate revelations … Watts and Jamie-Rose Monk.Photograph: Charlie FlintUpton blends uproarious humour with intimate revelations. On a special care maternity ward, M confesses she feels disconnected from her tiny newborn, covered in wires and fighting for his life. Elsewhere she compares herself to other parents, who serve their toddlers plates of steamed vegetables, and didn’t commute to London for meetings during pregnancy.It’s a play that feels like a roar from a place of isolation. Although we never see M’s children, their presence engulfs her life. While she watches other people’s careers soar, she can’t help but fear she is missing out on opportunities. Each scene chips away at the myth that motherhood is supposed to come naturally and that mothers don’t ache for the people they were before. “I’m not the sort of woman who should be in a play,” M says. But Upton more than proves that hers are the kinds of complex, wonderfully considered stories that demand a place on stage.(the) Woman is at thePark theatre, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Set during the doldrums of the Trojan war, seven years in, it speaks of conflict as well as of Troilus and Cressida’s star-crossed love. But is this a history play highlighting the hopelessness of war, or a send-up of Homer’s heroic masculinity with a romance thrown in?No doubt Hamlet’s pontificating Polonius would have a hyphenated answer to the mixing of genres (is this what he meant by a “tragical-historical-pastoral?”). Director Owen Horsleyhas an answer too: this is satire – if not war-farce – in which the “heroes” of classical antiquity are roundly ridiculous. A giant, Pythonesque foot sits on the stage (great design by Ryan Dawson Laight), to set the tone.Horsley’s direction brings clarity to a dense play – the cast-list is trimmed (there is no Priam, Aeneas, Calchas or Andromache, among others) while long, sabre-rattling speeches are hemmed in or made buffoonish. The warring men flex their muscles, showboat in gold armour like Marvel superheroes, and bask in our applause on circular daises placed in the pit. It is clear, through the satire, that their war is driven by vanity and power. Several gender inversions (Ulysses, Thersites, Pandarus) are used effectively for the same end.View image in fullscreenLucy McCormick as Helen of Troy.Photograph: Helen MurrayAchilles (David Cave) is a slob, refusing to fight in the war as his pretty-boy lover Patroclus (Tadeo Martinez) hangs by. Ajax (Ibraheem Toure) is a convincing meat-head, manipulated to encourage Achilles back to the battlefield. Ulysses (Jodie McNee) is a strategist pulling all their strings.Much of it is amusing and inventive: Cassandra (also McNee) is dressed as an activist, and delivers her urgent predictions through a megaphone. Romantic fixer Pandarus (Samantha Spiro) is a beautician and bawd, dropping crass nudge-winks after Troilus (Kasper Hilton-Hille, ardent, earnest) and Cressida (Charlotte O’Leary, headstrong yet pragmatic) spend the night together. The shambolic fool, Thersites (Lucy McCormick), is inventively reincarnated as a prancing, twitching goth in gold shorts and bra.It bursts with ideas and invention, perhaps too much so. There are so many ideas and comic inversions that they create complication that verges on chaos. And even at its trotting pace and with its streamlined script, it still feel too long, with a tone that strays into the wacky. The cast double up in what seems like significant pairings, but it is unclear why McCormick plays Thersites and Helen of Troy in the same twitching manner – is it a clownish send-up of the central love that sparks the Trojan war?View image in fullscreenKasper Hilton-Hille and Charlotte O’Leary as Troilus and Cressida, with Samantha Spiro as Pandarus.Photograph: Helen MurrayThe dark turn in Troilus and Cressida’s love story is made graphic as Greek soldiers grope Cressida after she is traded to the Greeks by her own father. But it does not quite carry the chilling echoes it should, butting awkwardly against the comedy.Yet Cressida is still a force in her depiction here: a survivor who understands war is about power, and is determined to come out of it alive. Her disappearance, after she is traded, gives this play its inherent unresolved and unsatisfying end. War simply rumbles on, as do these lustful men. Pandarus tries, heroically, to bring the last few laughs here. It is a heroic attempt at comedy all round.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, until 26 OctoberExplore more on these topicsShakespeare's GlobeTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Having been rediscovered by the TikTok generation, early hitNaiveis powering towards a billion streams, recent album Never/Know returned the band to the Top 10, and they’re now playing the biggest shows of their career. In Manchester tonight, 18,000 mostly teens and early twentysomethings hurl plastic glasses in the air or climb on each other’s shoulders, generating an atmosphere of joyous celebration before the band have played a note.It would take a truly disastrous performance to lose in this environment, but instead, thousands of voices turn hits such as Eddie’s Gun or She Moves In Her Own Way into epic, euphoric singalongs, while even the slighter tracks have a new robustness. The Kooks’ were never as feted as the Strokes or the Libertines, but haven’t been hampered by boredom or health issues, and play as if they’re still loving every minute. It’s the day after theManchester synagogue attack, and frontman Luke Pritchard sets off a wave of cheering when he talks of “throwing a bubble around the arena and it’s all peace and love”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Izzy Clayton/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.Although most of the 26-song setlist is trademark indie/60s beat pop/rock’n’roll, there are various curveballs, including what Pritchard not inappropriately calls “the disco section”. Then one young lad holding up a sign asking to play Seaside finds himself being hauled on stage to accompany the singer on acoustic guitar. Pritchard shifts to piano for 2014’s See Me Now, about his father, who died when he was three. The 40-year old explains that they’re performing the song again because he’s a father now himself, and asks the audience to help if he “chokes up”. When the crowd light up the arena with their phones, it’s unusually raw and touching.‘We even did it as reggae’: the Kooks on how they made NaiveRead moreVoices and guitars swell loudest for Ooh La and a triumphant Naive.

So it was that at the end of an autumn day I found myself with a not unpleasant question: where to head to soothe bones still aching for a last splash of summer sun. For Athens offers something that other European cities cannot: a coastline of more than 40 miles dotted with beaches many a Greek island would covet.Out of season, the shores of Attica still have a magnetic allure, as I discovered when swimming into a fading sun across thebay of Vouliagmeni. For those seeking rejuvenation in marine blue waters primed to turn orange pink as the sun sets, bathing off one of the Riviera’s public or private beaches does not disappoint.With sea salt still clinging to my skin, I sat atSardelaki,a tavern whose Mediterranean fare is as good as the spectacular view of the bay it sits on. In a nod to times past, the meze is served on large wooden trays.View image in fullscreenVouliagmeni beach, south of Athens.Photograph: Geopix/AlamyAthens is as celebrated for its hills as its coastline: natural elevations within view of the Acropolis that make it a treasure trove for amblers when temperatures are cooler. For those who want to escape a metropolis that sprawls across almost 200 square miles, these rocky outcrops – bearers of fabulous names such as the Hill of the Nymphs and the Hill of the Muses – are a must.In my view, this ancient capital is Europe’s most soulful and sublimeIn my view, this ancient capital is also Europe’s most soulful and sublime. If you reach the top of Mount Lycabettus, the city’s highest point, either by foot or on the funicular rail car, the reward is a spectacular vista of the entire Argo-Saronic Gulf and the islands beyond.If you want to stay centrally, the ancient Plaka district remains the best base. The old-schoolAdrianhotel has doubles looking on to the northern face of the Acropolis from about £120 B&B. In the same area,Zorbasis a favourite restaurant with locals and serves the most succulent lamb chops. With views of the Acropolis, Athens’ rooftop restaurants are wonderfully atmospheric and perfect for warm autumn evenings – for a real treat head toKuzinaor the Michelin‑starredMacris.Helena SmithPalermoView image in fullscreenA 16th-century sculpture at the fountain of Piazza Pretoria.Photograph: Paul Williams/AlamyThink Neapolitan margherita is the last word in pizza? Think again. In Palermo they prefersfincione, a soft, well-risen rectangle of dough topped with intense, onion-heavy tomato sauce and sprinkled withcaciocavallocheese and oregano. Savoury, filling and comforting, it’s sold in bakeries, kiosks and carts all over the city (Via Maqueda in the historic centre usually has several vendors).We try it at a kiosk on Piazza della Kalsa, near where we’re staying.Panineria Chiluzzooften has long queues, but they move quickly as young staff dish out slices ofsfincione, as well as arancini andpanelle(chickpea fritters). There are a few tables under the trees outside, but we eat as we walk into town along narrow Via Alloro. This is a pleasant stroll in October but wouldn’t always be. As heatwaves rolled over Europe this year, temperatures in Palermo topped 40C in the shade. At the end of July one sunbaked cornerhit a record 70Cat ground level.We wander the city and savour how its long history is written in its streetsNow, as temperatures creep to 24C by mid-afternoon, we can wander the city and savour how its long history is written in its streets. Passing baroque and art nouveau palaces, andCasa Stagnitta, the city’s oldest coffee roastery, we take in the Arab-Norman domes of the 12th-century church of San Cataldo; Piazza Pretoria, with its 16th-century fountain, installed under Spanish rule; and the impressive cathedral, built on the location of a ninth-century mosque.View image in fullscreenThe 12th-century Church of San Cataldo (foreground, left) in Palermo.Photograph: Sean Pavone/AlamyOn the way back we detour to Vucciria market, the origins of which also stretch back over 1,000 years. Some decry its touristification, but it is still noisy and brilliantly theatrical. Feeling brave, we stop for a traditionalpani câ meusa(spleen roll), which is surprisingly OK, with its slightly sweet “meat” set off by grated cheese. The stallholder is particularly proud of his grilled goat’s intestines but, I’m sorry, no amount of salt and lemon can make those a treat for me.We’re glad to head back to quieter La Kalsa, the former Arab quarter to the east, which was bombed in the second world war and languished for decades before being revitalised this century.Maison Butera(sea-view doubles from €161 B&B) is a four-room B&B with lots to see nearby. Up the street isPalazzo Butera,a 17th-century baroque pile restored and reopened in 2021 to house the Valsecchi art collection, which includes works by Gilbert & George and Andy Warhol.Next day we walk 10 minutes to Palermo’sBotanical Garden, with its record-breaking multi-trunk fig tree. Birds are singing their hearts out as the sun pours down. Soon we’ll be in London, the clocks will go back and winter will start. We relish a last week in the light.Liz BoulterViennaView image in fullscreenParks in Vienna are a colourful delight in autumn.Photograph: Rusm/Getty ImagesWhile lamenting the end of summer and hanging out at beach bars and bathing spots on the tributaries of the Danube, I’m now chasing a new hue. Vienna isa city of parks and manicured gardens, meadow sweeps and woodland belts, which swap their emerald halo for a rusty amber and ochre glow the Austrians callGoldener Herbst(golden autumn).I leave behind the grandiose architecture and cobblestones of the historic centre. South-west of it, Schloss Schönbrunn Park splays from the grand Habsburg summer residence, where the gilt isn’t reserved for the interior, and makes its way into corridors of towering bronzed hedgerows and arched tree terraces that lead to the butter-yellow palace.To the east, in the city’s Prater Park, I stroll beneath the chestnut trees of the Hauptallee, an avenue that’s almost three miles long and centuries-old. On the edge of the park, the retro-styledSuperbude Prater hotel(doubles from €78 B&B) is a perfectly placed retreat.View image in fullscreenSuperbude hotel, ViennaIn a city with hundreds of urban farms (thanks to a long-standing commitment to promoting green spaces and fostering community spirit), autumn brings a feast of fresh produce on menus.Pumpkin cream soup is the seasonal staple – best devoured in a wood-panelledBeisl(Viennese gastropub) such as the art-splashedAm Nordpol 3– and followed with a Wiener Schnitzel.Vienna is a city of parks and gardens that swap their emerald halo for a rusty amber and ochre glowUnbeknown to many, Vienna is the only European capital to grow wine within its city limits, with 700 hectares (1,723 acres) of vineyards. There are 14 designated city hiking trails, known as Stadtwanderwege. Track 1 leads you through the vintner lands of Nussdorf. Settle in a hillsideHeuriger(wine tavern) such asWieninger am Nussberg, sipping a citrussygrüner veltlinerwith aBrettljause(a platter of cold cuts and cheese), while soaking up the sublime city vista.The days are getting shorter, but now is the perfect time to wander among Vienna’s stately palaces, museums and historic abodes – a cultural crop in gilded gallery wings, mirroring nature’s showcase outside.Becki EnrightBudapestView image in fullscreenAutumn at Fisherman’s Bastion in Budapest’s Castle District.Photograph: Noppasin Wongchum/AlamyAfter the heat and crowds of high summer, autumn brings a less intense atmosphere to Budapest, and it’s the season I most love to visit the city. The sun mellows, green leaves drain to golden, and a cuisine that’s all about comfort food really comes into its own. Even the Hungarian word for autumn –őszi– has a cosy, laid-back sound to it.That’s not to say it’s a place to hunker down. Few capitals are better suited to walking, and early autumn promises a Goldilocks sweet spot of temperatures, neither too hot nor too cold. It’s a joy to wander the cobbled streets of the Castle District without sidestepping tourists, to follow the Danube promenade without melting, and to meander among whisky-coloured trees on Margaret Island.Many of the five-star hotels – such as the wonderfully styled Kimpton BEM and the Dorothea Hotel, with its oasis of a courtyard restaurant – offer affordable shoulder-season deals. But if you don’t need heaps of facilities, tryGiselle Vintage Doubles(doubles from €87 room-only), an 18th-century royal mansion near Elizabeth Bridge brimming with yesteryear elegance that is surprisingly light on the wallet.View image in fullscreenHouse of Music in Budapest’s City Park offers a journey through the country’s musical heritage.Photograph: E Fesenko/AlamyFrom here, Budapest is your oyster. I always head to theCentral Market Hall, a soaring masterpiece of 19th-century industrial architecture with stalls selling Hungarian products such as rich, sweettokajiwine and lace tablecloths. The must-visitHouse of Music Hungaryin City Park (itself lovely for an autumn stroll) leads visitors on an absorbing journey through the country’s musical heritage.

In the 1960s, the UK prime minister tried to blame the “gnomes of Zurich” for the pathetic performance of the British pound, and more than 60 years on, some misguided Britons still think of Switzerland’s biggest city as a boring financial destination. They couldn’t be more wrong. Banking is still a major industry, but the city’s tidy, tree-lined streets are full of people having fun.I’ve been to Zurich more times than I can count, and like it more with each visit. For first timers, the big surprise is the vast and lovely Zürichsee (Lake Zurich), two miles wide, 25 miles long and crisscrossed all day by antique ferries. Wherever you are around town, you’re never far from water.When the trees turn golden brown, this compact metropolis looks especially prettyAnother nice surprise is the abundance of fine art. Zurich’s palatialKunsthausis one of Europe’s great art galleries (check out the sleek new extension by British starchitect David Chipperfield), but there are also loads of smaller commercial galleries, especially in Zurich West, a former industrial quarter that’s become the city’s new creative hub.Stay at25 Hours Zurich West(from 230 Swiss francs/£214 room-only), a funky bolthole in the beating heart of this rejuvenated district or the new coolMama Shelter(from £175 room-only), which opened in the lively Oerlikon area this summer with a garden terrace overlooking the city and a stylish bar and restaurant.View image in fullscreenThe interior of Cabaret Voltaire, where dadaism started.Photograph: Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH/AlamyZurich has always been a magnet for creatives and eccentrics. James Joyce wrote much of Ulysses here (his grave is in Zurich’s Fluntern cemetery) and his favourite haunt, the chicCafé Odeon,is still going strong. The place that sums up Zurich’s rebellious streak isCabaret Voltaire, the anarchic nightclub where dadaism, the multifaceted modern art movement, was born. The building is still a gallery and performance space, as well as a museum.When the trees turn golden brown, this compact metropolis looks especially pretty. The best views are from the summit of Uetliberg, on the leafy edge of town. The Uetlibergbahn, Zurich’s mountain railway (which reopens on 5 October after a major refurbishment) takes you within a short walk of the summit.TheZurich film festivalis the one of the autumn highlights, but the most atmospheric spectacle is on the water. From 30 Oct-13 Nov, Zurich’s fleet of pleasure boats hosts the 70thExpovina Weinschiffe, the city’s annual wine fair. Anyone can buy a ticket (from £28) to go onboard and sample a huge range of wines from dozens of different countries (Switzerland’s crisp light whites are seriously underrated). If you’d rather drink beer, head toBierwerk Züri, a fashionable modern brewery with a youthful clientele.New restaurants are opening all the time, but my go-tos have both been around for ages and never seem to change. For traditional Swiss cuisine, you can’t beatAlpenrose, a homely historic hideaway a short tram ride from the city centre. For veggie cuisine,Haus Hiltlis a must. The decor is fairly modern and the menu is contemporary, but it was actually founded back in 1898, making it (by some accounts) the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the world.William CookLyonView image in fullscreenA spectacular view of Lyon.Photograph: Sander van der Werf/ShutterstockTraboules, Lyon’s secret passages, pass through houses and courtyards, joining one street to another, transporting curious walkers from the Renaissance to the modern via a stone staircase and gothic arcade.

It’s now part of theInstitut Lumière, which houses cinemas as well as the museum, and is the hub of the annualFestival Lumière. Films and cinematic events take place from 11-19 Oct, with almost 450 showings across the city, including two remastered 1920s silent movies by Victor Sjöström – Le Vent (The Wind)and La Charrette Fantôme (The Phantom Carriage) – accompanied by the National Orchestra of Lyon.Just before the start of winter, Lyon’sFête des Lumières(lights not the brothers) runs from 5-8 Dec. The city’s heritage buildings are illuminated, and light installations are set up in the squares and on the riverbank. I watch from Place Bellecour and then wander down to the water where locals place lanterns in their windows to celebrate solidarity and brace themselves for the cold.I stay at theFourvière Hôtel(doubles from €139 room-only), a former convent near the city’s Roman ruins, which has a heated indoor pool, restaurant and great views over the city.Jon BryantAccommodation prices correct at time of going to press.

Traditionally served on Sundays, it’s now on menus every day of the week, but it’s also worth saving for a special occasion.Prep10 minSoakOvernightCook2 hrRest10 min+Serves6200g dried kidney beans, soaked overnight (see step 1)1 garlic cloveSalt1 onion180g smoked bacon lardons, or thick-cut bacon rashers (optional)400g long-grain rice(see step 6)400ml coconut milk¼ tsp ground allspice2 fresh thyme sprigs1 scotch bonnet chilli2 tsp butter, or coconut oil (optional)1 A note on the peasIn Jamaica, red peas, otherwise known as kidney beans, are the default choice, because they help give the rice its characteristic colour and sweet, slightly earthy flavour. In the privacy of your own kitchen, however, you could really use any dried pulses you like: black beans, for example, work very well, as do pigeon (gungo) or black-eyed peas. If you mix varieties, cook them separately.2 Dried and soaked, or tinned?You can use tinned beans, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you find yourself in a carb-based emergency, because the bean cooking water seasons the entire dish. In such an emergency, start at step 5 and add the tinned beans, preferably with the liquid from the can to help with the flavour, at the same time as the rice.View image in fullscreen3 Cook the beansDrain the soaked beans and put them in a large saucepan with a litre of water. Peel and squash the garlic, and add to the pot with a teaspoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil, maintain that for 10 minutes, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer until the beans are just tender but not mushy – depending on the age of your beans, this will take anything between one and two hours.View image in fullscreen4 Or use a pressure cookerAlternatively, cook the beans in a pressure cooker, adding water to cover by a couple of centimetres and a dash of oil, as well as the garlic and salt. Bring to pressure, cook for two minutes, then take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes. Release, drain and repeat, this time cooking them for seven minutes, then allow the pressure to release naturally (for these timings, I’m indebted to Catherine Phipps’ excellent bookModern Pressure Cooking).5 Prep the onion and optional baconMeanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion and dice the bacon, if using. Should you prefer to keep this meat-free, simply leave out the latter, though, if you do so, I’d be inclined to add a spoonful of soy sauce or a pinch of MSG at the end, to replicate those savoury flavours; I’d also urge you not to skip the extra butter or oil.View image in fullscreen6 Prep the riceOnce the beans are ready, add the onion and bacon, if using, to the bean pot and leave to cook for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the rice well in cold water, until the water runs clear. If you prefer, use long-grain brown rice, but increase the cooking time in line with the packet instructions. (More perfumed basmati or jasmine varieties will work here, too, but they’ll lose the fragrance.)View image in fullscreen7 Flavour the beans, then add the riceStir the coconut milk and allspice into the bean mix, then add the rice and push the thyme and whole chilli (prick it a couple of times with a fork first, if you like, so it imparts more heat) into the rice. Add the fat, if using – and you absolutely should, unless you’re serving this with something very rich. The liquid should at this point come about 3cm above the level of the rice.View image in fullscreen8 Cover and simmerSeason lightly, and remember that the beans and bacon are both salty. Bring to a simmer, then cover tightly, turn the heat right down and leave to cook undisturbed for 20 minutes (or according to packet instructions, if different). Take off the heat and leave to stand, still covered, for 10 minutes.9 Finishing touchesLift out and discard the chilli, garlic and thyme. Fluff up the rice with a fork, then season to taste. Rice and peas is delicious with grilled or roast meat, fish or plantains, and even on its own with a crunchy salad. Refrigerate or freeze any leftovers immediately. Thaw before reheating with a splash of water in a microwave or a hot pan.View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassBeans, pulses and legumesRiceCaribbean food and drinkSide dishesMain coursePorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can a well-loved Peckham restaurant really relocate to fancy-pants Marylebone and retain its homespun charm? And, what is a “Kudu kit kat”, and could it even remotely capture the joys of my red-wrappered, lifelong support system? The KitKat is, after all, a design classic, so tampering with it makes me uneasy.Within moments of being seated, however, another question arose: how many miles do you need to run to counteract the aftereffects of Kudu’s bread with curried butter, which comes melted, glossy and with gently fried curried leaves? Grab hunks of this warm bread and stuff them greedily into your mouth. It’s an eat-as-if-no-one’s watching kind of starter, which went down well in Peckham, but in Marylebone, the women wear white trouser suits and pale, unspongeable fabrics, so let’s hope there’s a good dry cleaner close by.View image in fullscreenMore than one passerby mouths appreciative things about my grilled peri peri tiger prawns – at Kudu, London W1.Kudu’s previous incarnation certainly planted a flag for South African cuisine, favouringbraaicookery, biltong scratchings and an extensive South African wine list. Here, in its posh new second life, expect more of that earthy, live-fire approach. A piece of confit trout off the braai was reallyverygood: crisp, well-seasoned skin, melting flakes and a host of sea veg and pickles. We ate it with a side of rich, crisp beef-fat fingerling potatoes. Meanwhile, the braai pork chop – a whopper – comes with “monkey gland” sauce and more pickles. Fear not: no monkeys were harmed during the making of this sauce, so please do not converge on W1 brandishing angry banners (it’s actually a sort of dark-brown, sharp but sweet chutney-ketchup hybrid with garlic and Worcestershire sauce).While the decor of this new space sets out its stall as South African, this is definitely not a themed restaurant. The lighting is campfire twinkly, and the vibe sexy safari chic. It’s soft and plush, with an abundance of mirrors and textured pink and peach surfaces. There are shimmering green tiles around the open braai, and tasteful murals of scampering antelopes. In fact, it may well be London’s prettiest restaurant of 2025 so far. Still, Kudu’s move will not please everyone, because in the process not only did Peckham lose the restaurant Kudu, but also three other ventures: Kudu Grill, Smokey Kudu and Curious Kudu were closed, too, or rather amalgamated into this bright, twinkly turbo-Kudu. Was this a risk? Absolutely.View image in fullscreenKudu’s ‘reallyverygood’ confit trout braai.Still, on the Sunday lunchtime of the third week of opening, Kudu Marylebone seems to have hit the ground running. Folk loiter by the door, sniffing around for a cancellation, and while we sit in our window seat nibbling on charred sugar snaps in a rich walnut sauce, more than one passer-by approaches the glass, peers inside and mouths appreciative things about the look of my braai king prawns with a peri peri sauce that was perhaps a bit too subtle after that curry butter. Kudu clearly has kerb appeal, even if I occasionally felt a bit like a baboon at Regent’s Park zoo.Lunch began with an instruction from our server that the bread was a must-order, or chef-patron Patrick Williams would be offended. It was a joke, obviously … or was it? We complied, and soon a pan of warm bread appeared with that aforementioned vat of curried butter; other options feature house-cured bacon and shrimp butter with almonds. Bread and butter is undoubtedly one of the loveliest mouthfuls on God’s great earth, and here I’ve found a new way to enjoy it. We ordered a round of smoked prawn crullers, which were itsy-bitsy, posh 1970s dinner-party tarts filled with prawns, miso and pickled shallots.View image in fullscreenDelicious, but nothing like a KitKat: that Kudu kit kat dessert.Considering this was a Sunday in late summer, the vibe was nothing short of buzzy: old Kudu customers turned up with children and grandparents, and copious rounds of Kalahari biltong were ordered alongside trays of Saffa Ritas (tequila, chilli,Supasawaand Cointreau). Having grown up sighing my way through British Methodist church-based Sundays, I always feel a bit uneasy when I see people enjoying their late weekend – in this instance with black bream withzhougbutter rotis and large glasses of cold Zwartland white – when they should be indoors watchingHarry Secombe’s Highway, seeking out a Viennetta and worrying about Monday.The Kudu kit kat, by the way, is a bowl of rich chocolate mousse with sweet kumquats and foamy marshmallows, toasted tableside with a chic set of hot irons, as if we were camping in the wilds of the Kruger national park. It was absolutely nothing like a KitKat, but I was wholly on board and happy to push my boundaries. Kudu is already a delight, and the best of luck with getting a table. Marylebone’s wildlife is circling, and they’re ready for dinner.Kudu7 Moxon Street, London W1, 020-3393 6330. Open all week, lunch noon-3pm (Sat 10am-3pm, Sun 11.30am-3pm), dinner 6-10pm (Sun 6-9pm).
