But the documents also reveal how many powerful men confided in himMon 17 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 16.36 ESTShareBefore he died,Jeffrey Epsteinmade it clear that Donald Trump “knew about the girls”.Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s longstanding child sex-trafficking operation. But in newly released emails thatmembers of Congress disclosed to the mediaamid the end of this fall’s government shutdown, the dead child sex trafficker and financier can be seen corresponding on many occasions aboutDonald Trump, his former close friend and associate, throughout the last few years of his life, as Trump’s rise to prominence in national politics beginning in 2015 drew renewed attention to his relationship with Epstein.When Landon Thomas Jr, then a reporter at the New York Times, wrote to Epstein in 2015 asking about his relationship with Trump, Epstein (who in the documents has a habit of not using punctuation or capitalization in his emails), said, “have them ask my houseman about donald almost walking through the door leaving his nose print on the glass as young women were swimming in the pool he was so focused he walked straight into the door.” If it hadn’t happened in the backdrop to so much sexual exploitation and violence, the scene described byJeffrey Epsteinwould sound like something out of a screwball comedy. In another exchange with Thomas, Epstein asks, “would you like to see photos of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen?”Throughout the emails, Epstein depicts Trump as someone he knew intimately, someone whose mind and habits he can provide insight into for others. “You see , i know how dirty donald is,”Epstein wrote in a 2018 emailto former Obama White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler.Republicans in the House released a vast trove of about 23,000 pages of documents from the Epstein estate on Wednesday just hours after Democrats released selected emails from Epstein referencing Trump. In one of theemails released by Democrats, a 2019 message that Epstein wrote to the journalist Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote of Trump, “of course he knew about the girls.”In another missive, a 2011 exchange between Epstein and his girlfriend and procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein writes, “i want you to realize that the dog that hasn’t barked is trump.” Referring to a victim whose name was redacted, he said that the girl had “spent hours at my house with him”. Epstein’s meaning is not explicit, but his emails suggest he was worried Trump would disclose whatever he knew about Epstein’s conduct to authorities or the public.In a troubling exchange from December 2015, the night of a Republican primary debate at which Trump was expected to appear, Wolff and Epstein strategized together as to what Trump might be told to say if he was asked about his relationship with the sex trafficker. “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you – either on air or in scrum afterwards,”Wolff wrote to Epstein. “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?” Epstein asked. Evidently comfortable with providing strategic advice to a source he knew to be a sex criminal – Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitingprostitution years earlier; the victim was 14 years old– Wolff issued a response that appeared to suggest that Epstein preserve the possibility of using the information to his benefit. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to your house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,” Wolff says. “You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.” (Wolfftold CNNhe didn’t “quite remember the context” of the exchange.)The documents also reveal the stunning breadth of Epstein’s connections among the nation’s eliteThe archive that has been released to the public is vast, and undoubtedly what will be most interesting to most readers is the question of what Trump knew about Epstein’s sexually abusive conduct towards teenage girls. But the notion that Trump might have known about Epstein’s conduct has already been the subject of widespread speculation, following the unearthing ofcomments Trump madeabout how Epstein liked “beautiful women” who were “on the younger side” and the leak of abirthday card he reportedly gave Epstein, which featured a crude drawing of a nude female figure and an odd poem that referenced “enigmas” that “never age” and a “wonderful secret”. (The White House has deniedthe card is authentic.)But the documents also reveal the stunning breadth of Epstein’s connections among the nation’s elite, including long after his initial 2008 sex crimes conviction, and the extent to which other men in positions of great power considered him a confidant or voice of reason. In the fall of 2017, shortly after the emergence of the #MeToo movement, Larry Summers, the economist who resigned as the president of Harvard University over statements he made suggesting that women were less intelligent than men,wrote to Epsteinto complain that if you “hit on a few women 10 years ago” you “can’t work at a network or think tank”. Epstein also wrotemultiple emailsto the billionaire venture capitalist and rightwing mega-donor Peter Thiel, including one with the subject line:“that was fun, see you in 3 weeks.”In another email, Epsteinoffered to introduce Thiel to Woody Allen.There is no evidence that these men participated in Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual sexual abuse of girl children. But their interactions with him suggest a kind of blithe tolerance of his presence in their midst, a seeming comfort in exchanging intimate – and sometimes lewd – exchanges with a man they must have known to have sexually exploited a child. Many of the emails to and from Epstein are marked by a tone of haughty knowingness, a kind of worldly, smug cynicism I’ve encountered before in people who think that they are smarter than everyone else. Maybe in the haughty world of billionaires and private jets, it is considered provincial to think that adults should not have sex with children. Maybe to them, morality is for the little people.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

How to get back into reading for funIn a world full of distractions, it can be difficult to form a habit that needs attention. Experts advise on getting out of the rutMadeleine AggelerMon 17 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.28 ESTShareMost of us read all day – texts, emails, menus, utility bills, social media captions and news stories. But fewer people are reading for fun.According to a 2022reportfrom the National Endowment for the Arts, 48.5% of US adults said they had read at least one book that year, down from 52.7% five years earlier, and 54.6% 10 years earlier. In the UK, a 2024 report found that half of UK adultsdo not regularly readfor pleasure.“The world is increasingly distracting,” says Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association. “It can be really difficult to get into a reading habit.”Are you in a reading rut? We asked experts how to get out of it.How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something newRead moreWhat are the benefits of reading?There are numerous benefits to a regular reading practice, experts say. It might even make you a better person.Studies have found that reading fiction specifically can make peoplemore empathetic, strengthen theirsocial-cognitive abilitiesand increasepsychological richness.Craig Getting, co-host of the book podcast Overdue, says reading fiction helps him experiment with the perspectives of other people and groups. “It helps me have a more open-minded view of the world and be a little bit more grounded in how I meet new people or think about the people I interact with,” Getting says.Even if fiction isn’t your cup of tea, regular reading has been shown toreduce stress levelsandprotect cognitive functionin later life.“I always say that [reading] is really good for helping you rest and slow down,” says Morgan Menzies, a literary curator andsocial media influencer. Menzies says it’s an effective way for her to unwind before bed. “Some nights I get a few pages in. Other times it’s one or two pages and I’m out,” she laughs.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Why do people stop reading?If reading for fun is so great, why do so many people fall out of the habit?Distraction:Distraction is a big reason, says Getting’s Overdue podcast co-host, Andrew Cunningham: “There’s a lot of entertainment out there competing for your mind and your eyeballs – TV, social media, news, podcasts.” Plus, while reading is all-absorbing, many of these other options are “a lot easier to do while you’re doing something else”, he says.Helmick agrees about the lure of multitasking. “I know folks who read short articles or short blogposts while waiting in line at the grocery store or bingeing a TV show, so you’re not fully engaged.”By contrast, reading books requires a degree of “intentional focus”, Helmick says. A novel demands a greater commitment of time and energy than, say, a TikTok about someone’s morning routine.Changing circumstances:Menzies says people also tend to break their reading routine during times of change, such as graduating college, entering the workforce, starting a family or moving. “There are other things taking time from you, so maybe you can’t center reading as much as you once did,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My own reading ruts have come when I try to force myself to read books I think will make me seem serious and intellectual, rather than what I actually enjoy (detective stories and gossipy memoirs).“If you’re excited to read great canonized fiction, then awesome,” says Cunningham. “But if you’re excited to read an enemies-to-lovers romance or a book where people ride dragons, that’s what you should read.”How can you get back into a reading routine?Figure out what you enjoy:Helmick recommends going to a library and checking out various kinds of books. “Read the first chapter, and see which one or two grab you,” they say.Don’t force it:If you’re not enjoying a volume, put it down and move on to the next. “I am a huge advocate for not finishing a book,” says Menzies. “If you don’t like a book, no one’s judging you. You’re not failing.”Keep it short and sweet:Cunningham suggests people start with shorter books. “Don’t have Infinite Jest be the first book you pick up if you haven’t read anything in a few years,” he says. He suggests searching Goodreads, Barnes and Noble or the Booker Library’slist of short books.Short story collections can also be a good way to dip your toe back into reading, says Getting. “You get a full narrative experience out of 10 or 15 pages,” he says.Make it social:Experts recommend sharing books with friends, or joining a book club. Menzies attends an audiobook walking club where everyone walks together, listening to their own audiobooks. “Throughout our walk, we stop and chat about our books and what’s exciting us,” she says.The medium doesn’t matter:Don’t get hung up on the format. Whether you read physical books, use an e-reader or listen to audiobooks, it’s all valuable, experts say. “If that’s what gets you reading, that’s what gets you reading,” says Getting.Do it daily:Once you’ve found your favorite genres and reading method, carve out a little bit of time for it each day. “Read 10 minutes before bed for about 20 days,” says Helmick. “By the end, you’ll have created a habit.”Make it fun:Finally, make sure you’re having a good time. “Reading is something that should bring you joy,” says Menzies. “There’s a lot you can gain from it.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was giggling away, saying, “You English guys are crazy!”’Interviews byMichael HoganMon 17 Nov 2025 10.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.02 ESTShareTrevor Robinson, art directorMy creative partner Al Young and I had been on the dole for 18 months when we landed our dream jobs at Howell Henry ad agency. We had to prove ourselves fast. Tango’s brief was basically to get talked about. They told us: “We want Coca-Cola to be afraid of this little British brand.” The campaign was based around the hit of real fruit. We decided to escalate that concept, making the hit a physical thing.Most ads were cause and effect – consume the product and something pleasant happens. We flipped that, so something unpleasant happens in a farcical way. It was almost anti-advertising. I loved Charlie Chaplin kicking people up the bum, then running off. A boot up the backside was deemed too aggressive but we figured we’d get away with a Morecambe and Wise-style slap. We shot tests with a camcorder but the slap didn’t look big enough. We ended up putting our arms straight out to the sides, pause, then “whack!”.When the ad got pulled, we redid it with a kiss instead of a slapAt first, it was just a big guy. Al said: “Let’s make him orange, so he’s more a manifestation of the drink.” He became this shirtless orange genie. We auditioned loads of actors. Peter Geeves, who got the job, was a proper thespian. He had this funny way of running with his tummy thrust forward and head back, which clinched it. When the ad got pulled by the agency, we got him to redo it with a kiss instead of a slap and Peter told us: “I can’t get parts any more. Everybody just sees me as this fat orange bloke.”Gil Scott-Herondid the closing voiceover. I was terrified – asking one of my heroes to say, “You know when you’ve been Tango’d” at the end of our silly ad. But Gil was giggling away, saying, “You English guys are crazy!”After filming, we were bouncing around like excited toddlers. Whenever we showed the ad to people, it got a reaction of: “What the hell was that?” We knew it was going to be either loved or hated and, if the latter, we’d probably be back on the dole. An industry figure called it “oik advertising”. We were working-class kids trying to make a noise.I knew it was a winner when I fell asleep on the tube one night and woke up to hear these guys mimicking the ad. I wanted to shout: “I did that!” I was in a cinema when it came on and the whole audience roared with laughter. It was the best feeling. Then we started hearing about copycat slappings, which we hadn’t seen coming, and doctors complained about patients having perforated eardrums from being Tango’d. We were gutted but our bosses were cool. They said: “It’s out there now. Everybody’s talking about it.” To an extent, our job was done, which enabled us to do all the sequels.It boosted Tango sales by 35%. They changed the branding to a black can off the back of the commercials. It’s amazing how far it spread, taking on a life of its own. You’d see fans dressed as the Tango man at football matches, painted orange with their tops off, which was quite disturbing. People still come up and tell me they got a perforated eardrum because of me. The slogan resonates to this day. I’ve seen headlines about Donald Trump’s tan, saying: “He’s been Tango’d.”Hugh Dennis, voice actorI was doing voices for Spitting Image when my agent called about a new Tango ad. They needed two sports-style pundits to describe this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it surreal moment. Ex-footballer Ray Wilkins – a lovely bloke, sadly no longer with us – was laid-back and laconic, so they wanted someone excitable as contrast. I came up with this extreme geordie commentator. A cross between Sid Waddell off the darts and Eddie Waring from rugby league. I think they had actually tried Sid Waddell himself but he wasn’t Sid Waddell-ish enough.I absolutely loved doing it – they were groundbreaking ads. The slap caused problems in school playgrounds. I thought: “Oh my god, I’m partly responsible for all these ear injuries.” But there’s always a dangerous playground craze. It was clackers in my day.An orange fella in a nappy going up to someone and slapping them around the face? You wouldn’t get away with it nowThe campaign ran for four years in the 90s, then was brought back in the 00s. Every six months, I’d go to a studio, chat about football with Ray, then launch into this ludicrous voice: “Wey-aye, Tony, I think we’ve got another one here!” It was huge fun but kind of exhausting. There were a limited number of takes I could do because it stretched my voice. I couldn’t do anything else for two hours afterwards because I’d screamed myself hoarse.Knowing the adverts were popular made it all the more enjoyable. People were waiting for the next one, which rarely happens. Oddly enough, I had also seen this from the other side. After university, I worked for Unilever and became brand manager of Lynx deodorant. So I could view it from a marketing perspective, going: “I wish I’d thought of this.”Because the campaign ran for ages, it brought in regular money. I didn’t buy a private island but I did OK. It was very much of its time. An orange fella in a giant nappy going up to someone in the street and slapping them around the face? You wouldn’t get away with it now – but it’s lovely to be part of such a cult classic. Most people don’t realise it was me. I’m currently inThe Importance of Being Earnestin the West End with quite a young cast. When I mentioned doing the Tango voiceover, they went: “Wait, what? That was you? A middle-aged man who’s playing a vicar in Earnest?” But they absolutely all remember it.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was time to get serious. No more Mr Nice Guy stuff whendealing with illegal immigrants. Not that there was anything like a legal immigrant as far as she was concerned. The only good migrant was a deported migrant. She laced up her Dr Martens. It was Kicking A Door In o’clock. Starting with her own.Shabana Mahmood had been dozing in bed whenShabana Mahmoodhad burst into her room and pulled back the duvet. Shabana forced her eyes open, trying to make sense of this unexpected intrusion. She reached for her phone. Where was her security detail? Surely this must be a mistake.“Right,” said Shabana. “Get yourself dressed in this orange jump-suit. And don’t mess about. You’re due at the processing centre within the hour. You’ll be on a plane home by the end of the day. If you can call where you’re going home.”“But I am home,” said Shabana. “I was born here.”The Guardian view on Labour’s asylum plans: ministers cannot out-Farage the far right and should stop trying | EditorialRead more“What’s that got to do with anything? That was then, this is now. People like you have been taking advantage of the system for years. So there are going to be some changes round here. I know we said the deportations wouldn’t be retrospective and we’d make you wait 20 years before you became British but that was because we were being too soft. We’re now going to increase that to 50 years. With surprise assessments every few weeks. And you’ve just missed your 5am one. Which means you are in breach of your visa regulations.”“I need to call Keir Starmer,” Shabana sobbed. “He will vouch for me. There must have been some mistake.”“No mistake,” Shabana snarled. “And don’t go bleating to Keir. He’s the one who signed off on all this.“Can’t you just give me a few more days? Why don’t you go and deport David Lammy first? I can give you his address.”“Nice try. But we’ve beaten you to it. There’s an ICE squad already on its way round to the justice secretary. This government is committed to fairness and equality. There will be no special cases or exemptions.”“I am British,” Shabana cried, becoming ever more desperate. “I’ve got a British passport. I’ll get it for you.”Shabana laughed. “I think you’ll find that you had a British passport. Oh, look. It expired at midnight last night. How sad. We can’t have you hanging around here when the country your parents emigrated from is perfectly safe. The thing is, we’ve decided you’ve overstayed your welcome. So off you go.”“This can’t be right. I couldn’t be more British if I tried. I’ve integrated so well I’ve even become home secretary. I’m a Labour politician whom Reform are happy to call one of their own. I have a couple of Union Jacks to drape myself in when I appear on GB News.

So pack up your things. On second thoughts, don’t bother. Because we’re going to take all your possessions anyway. Everything from your phone, your jewellery to your house. Just so no one comes over here with the idea that they can come over here, contribute and make a life for themselves.”Shabana was a broken woman. Crying as Shabana bundled her into the back of a van. Shabana smiled. She loved the smell of napalm in the morning. What better start to the day could there be than to deport herself?Over in Downing Street, Keir Starmer was deep in conversation with Rachel Reeves. “We are finally delivering on the things we promised to deliver on,” he said with his customary clarity and insight.“I love it when you talk dirty,” Rachel replied.“We need to see these mass deportations as a business opportunity,” he said. “So I’m setting up a new department of looting with Darren Jones as secretary of state. Dazza’s job will be to collect as many assets off immigrants as possible. Homes here, homes abroad – not forgetting the ones that have been bombed to smithereens – TVs, everything. Even gold teeth. That should be more than enough to cover any black holes in your forthcoming budget. Who needs tax rises?”“You think of everything.”Fresh from deporting herself, Shabana appeared in the commons late on Monday afternoon to give an update on her asylum and deportation policy. The system was broken, she said. There were dark forces at work. Somehow she made this sound as if she thought this was a good thing. You could almost sense the regretLabour had abandoned the Rwanda scheme. We would always offer sanctuary to people who needed it. That was the kind of country Britain was.But the difference would be that we would now make sure we kicked them out as soon as possible. She was sick of us being seen as a soft touch. You just couldn’t trust refugees these days. Most of them initiated their own persecution and risked death to get here just because they wanted to stay in an asylum hotel in Essex where they could be abused by locals. That for them was living the dream. Well, there would be no more of that. The signs were going up. Britain was full. No blacks, no dogs, no Irish. Shabana gave her word. Reinterpret Articles 2 and 8 of the European convention on human rights and nobody need ever see a foreigner again.We had expected Chris Philp to reply for the Conservatives. But Kemi Badenoch clearly doesn’t trust him to generate the right levels of hatred, so she chose to take his place. As so often, her speech dripped with condescension. She congratulated Mahmood for taking baby steps in the right direction. Being unpleasant to immigrants takes a lot of time and hard work.The Conservatives would work with the home secretary’s therapist to help her channel her inner prejudice more effectively. Because the measures Shabana was proposing just didn’t go far enough. Nothing short of firing squads on the beach, followed by repatriation of the bodies would be enough. Extermination not integration. What do we want? Mass extinction. When do we want it? Now.There were few Tories in the commons for the statement – most can’t see the point of getting out of bed these days, let alone coming to work – but the Labour benches were packed. Some made loud noises of support. Most looked genuinely queasy. This was not what they had joined the party for. What had happened to compassion? They were doubtful the policy would even work as suggested. Mahmood was resolute. The deportations could easily be extended to her own backbenchers.

Thesymptoms of Sadare similar to regular depression, with low moods and lethargy, and can be equally debilitating. Over the years I’ve experienced the full Sad spectrum, from moments of excessive tiredness and carb cravings (yes, those are official Sad symptoms), to a low point of breaking down crying on the kitchen floor after school because it was so cold, dark and bleak.I’ve always struggled to enjoy the cosiness of early winter when Sad feels like a curse waiting to pounce, like an inevitable winter bug that lasts all season. But maybe it didn’t have to be this way? Sick of losing months of my life to the gloom every winter, one year I decided to do a deep dive into the science of Sad and even spoke to a serious-faced Finnish scientist about it for a feature I was writing. His advice? Sit yourself down in front of a light box emitting 10,000 lux, for up to an hour, at least five times a week. Eight out of 10 people will have good results with this, the Finn explained, and you should start a couple of weeks before the symptoms usually kick in. And do it in the morning.View image in fullscreenThe stock advice for Sad is to ‘get light’.Photograph: courtesy of Jessica FursethAt first it seemed too simple – the stock advice for Sad is to “get light”, but I’d tried Sad lamps and lunchtime walks before, with little success. But I didn’t realise the timing is so crucial: you have to get that light into your eyeballs soon after waking – before 10am – because the whole point is to help your circadian rhythm. The darkness sets people with Sad adrift because our bodies can’t keep track of the time, and the body clock affects so much, from hormones, hunger, digestion and immune function to alertness, memory and sleep.I was desperate, so I decided to follow the instructions to the letter. I bought new bulbs for my 10-year-old Sad lamps and rigged them up on either side of myself in a window seat that gets the morning sun, or at least an overcast approximation. Last winter I sat myself down there first thing every morning to read a book in the blinding light, coffee in hand.I was honestly shocked how well it worked. I still had the occasional gloomy day, but thanks to my new light routine, I mostly felt like myself. Instead of sinking into tiredness as the afternoons grew shorter, I was ready to take on the day. I could skip the occasional morning without any ill effects, but I soon felt myself drawn to the light because I knew it would brighten me up, especially on a rainy day.As winter progressed I realised the light went far beyond just giving me energy to get through the day – I also had the energy to have fun. Instead of preferring a blanket on the sofa most January nights, I found myself keen to go out for dinners and dancing on the weekends. Best of all, I was able to appreciate how beautiful winter can be, when you’re awake enough to notice.Now winter is almost here again, I’m back in front of the bright window, and I’m no longer afraid of the dark.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its premise: what would the legend of Oz look like, told from the perspective of someone other than that cute but dozy blow-in, Dorothy? The wicked witch, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), is entirely green, and has therefore been ostracised since childhood. Glinda (Ariana Grande), the good witch, is everybody’s princess but, after a time, the two become best friends. I’ll skirt over how the Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow come about, suffice to say that, in the film at least, their backstories make perfect and resonant sense (except for the Lion, but never mind). The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) is not a good guy – but is he a bad guy? The morals swirl, in an expertly handled way.The first film left us at the point of discovery that Oz, far from being a magic paradise, was actually built on foundations of discrimination, oppression, enslavement and mendacity – or, if you like things simple, fascism. The fact that the slave-caste is the animal kingdom rather than a human out-group doesn’t make this opulent fantasia feel any less pointedly topical. “Any timeless story feels timely,” director Jon M Chu says, “because it’s about the human condition. When people become too powerful, what happens to the powerless? That cycle, unfortunately, challenges us every few generations, and maybe this is our moment. We’re the adults in the room now.”I got to do the most American job of all – I’m proof the American dream is realYes, definitely – adults whose hearts lift at the sight of pink and green; who would follow Ariana Grande off a cliff in a synchronised, Busby Berkeley formation; who still break into Defying Gravity whenever they happen to pass Erivo’s secondary school in Streatham, London. The first film was enchanting, the second (calledWicked: For Good) is surprisingly moving. They weigh in, between them, at over five hours. “I just knew it had enough meat in it,” Chu says, nonchalantly.View image in fullscreen‘She wasn’t the pop star’ … Grande as Glinda with Jonathan Bailey as Prince Fiyero.Photograph: Universal Studios/PAI went in swinging to this conversation with Chu. It was the Corinthia hotel in London’s Whitehall, on Remembrance Sunday, pomp and pageantry everywhere outside, Chu exuding an air of calm mischief inside. I’ve never seen anyone convey a more rebellious spirit encased in such neat tailoring. I wasn’t swinging at him personally – he’s immensely accomplished, best known for Crazy Rich Asians, though prior to Wicked, the film I couldn’t recommend highly enough would have been his adaptation for screen ofIn the Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the Hispanic community in New York.No, I was gunning for the stage version ofWicked, which was first performed in San Francisco in 2003 – that’s when Chu saw it, with his mum, before it ever got to Broadway. His parents “came to the United States with nothing except for the dream”. His mother was born in Taiwan, his father was born in China. “They started a restaurant, and it’s still there to this day, 55 years later. And I got to do the most American job of all, telling stories in movies, and not just movies, movie musicals. I am proof that the dream is real.” He was still a student and his professors at USC School of Cinematic Arts were telling him: “Don’t write a movie musical, the form is dead.”I’d been making movies for 10 years and it felt great. I didn’t have to answer to anybody. Then I had childrenThe thing is, the films are so superior to the stage musical that I can’t even see how they were inspired by it. It’d be like going to Zippos Circus and getting inspired to makeThe Greatest Showman. The orchestration is better, the dialogue is wittier, the pace and the plotting and the characters andeverythingis just a different order of magnitude. “It’s a different thing,” Chu says, diplomatically. “Glinda comes in, and she’s winking at the audience, whose perspective is, ‘Prove to me I should believe in this stuff.’ It’s a very different perspective than in a movie, where the green girl drops into this crazy world, thinking, ‘Where the hell did I just land?’ And she’s us.”Erivo and Grande seem like the obvious choices for the leads, maybe because they’ve had such a public passion for one another – an undisclosed number of matching tattoos, for instance – or maybe because they both have such striking voices. Their vocals were not pre-recorded for either film, which is particularly impressive given how much time they spend flying. When casting the roles, Chu says cheerfully: “We could have got any singers we wanted, really.” Grande and Erivo had something different, “the connective tissue to a truth”.View image in fullscreen‘The camera loves their energy’ … on set with Erivo and Grande.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHe’d originally thought Erivo wouldn’t be interested because she was too edgy, and Grande wouldn’t be right because she was too global. “But when she came in, she wasn’t the pop star Ari, she was Glinda. She was from another planet. I called her in four or five times, I kept thinking, I call bullshit, let’s see her again. And it was just undeniable. Something about the way she sang it, because she’s been through many tragedies recently, I felt she was singing about me.” (This isn’t showbiz hyperbole: Grande has had an appalling run of life events, including theaccidental overdose of her ex, Mac Miller, in 2018, and the Manchester Arena bombing the previous year).“Same with Cynthia,” Chu continues. “I felt like she was singing about me, dreaming about being a director in my dorm room. We were waiting for these two women.” It was quite lucky how much they loved each other, right? “I thought, even if they hate each other, the camera loves their energy.”From the start of the first movie, there’s this green-phobia as everyday racism, Elphaba sullen and oppressed, Glinda perky with white body supremacy. All that is quite familiar, Disney-ish territory (think Zombies, Descendants); everyone gets to know one another and, after that, they’re nice. But there’s a seam of segregation and oppression that defines the second film, and which has been an ongoing theme of Chu’s film-making. Before he had kids – his first (of five), Willow, with his wife, graphic designer Kristin Hodge, was born in 2017 – “I’d been making movies for 10 years, and it felt great. I didn’t have to answer to anybody. And then I had children, and I want them to live in a world where they’re proud of who they are. So I had to go chase Crazy Rich Asians and In the Heights.”In a deceptively fun way – Crazy Rich Asians was the highest grossing romcom of the 2010s – both films tell a complicated, uncliched story about multiculturalism. “Melting pot is way more difficult than a word,” Chu says. “Melting is not fun. I got to be born in a melting pot, and feel the swirl and actually not even realise that I was melting until much later in my life. And maybe it’s not melting at all. Maybe it’s a soup in which we’re all still our own selves, in the same bowl. Not becoming one thing, but at the same time, knowing that coming together is part of the dream.”View image in fullscreen‘I had to chase this story’ … Chu’s hit 2018 comedy Crazy Rich Asians.Photograph: Sanja Bucko/PR Company HandoutYou can very much imagine Chu pitching this epic for the first time, and see exactly why it got green-lit, right at the start of Covid. “Everything was changing around us. Our childhood stories, the possibilities of our childhood, no longer felt like they were guaranteed. Everything was resetting. We felt like strangers in our own homes.”Another sense in whichWicked: For Goodlands at a precisely relevant moment, is that we talk about and experience AI so much, we can’t tell what’s real. “Generative AI was not used on this movie,” Chu says, with some pride. “If you see the camera shake, if you see a dancer and they’re not quite on time, that’s because humans made this. The string that plays just a little bit off-tempo, the wrinkle in her nose, that’s because it’s human-made. The world is part of the message.”Chu considers himself “on the frontlines, telling one of the biggest stories” in the face of “political upheaval, social upheaval, cultural identity crises all around us”. And if you’re wondering how that stacks up, with a movie-musical about witches, all I can say is you should go and see it. It has a profound sense of purpose.“Movies are one of the few protected spaces,” he says. “You have to put your phone aside, you sit with friends and strangers, you pay attention for two hours and you see the world through someone else’s eyes. I don’t even spend that much time listening to my loved ones. I feel a grand responsibility – if people are giving me this time, coming into this bubble, I have to use it, to say, ‘Do you see what’s happening on the outside?’”Wicked: For Good is out on 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodWickedAriana GrandeCynthia ErivoJeff GoldblumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So we have got to pick it up and fix it,” he told the Daily Mirror.“We need to make sure there’s a consensus on this, that people have confidence in our asylum system, and the truth is that we need to stop people arriving who shouldn’t be here, and we need to return those who are found not to be genuine refugees.”At least 20 MPs have publicly expressed concern about the policies including the Folkestone MP and former human rights barrister, Tony Vaughan, the select committee chair Sarah Owen and 2024 intake MPs including Simon Opher, Abitsam Mohamed and Neil Duncan-Jordan.The chair of the housing and communities select committee, Florence Eshalomi, asked Mahmood in the Commons if she was certain there would not be “unintended consequences” from the policies.Speaking in the Commons, Mahmood rebuked MPs for suggesting she was using divisive language. She mentioned the crude racial slur she said was “regularly” used against her by people telling her to “go back home”.“I know through my own experience and the experience of my constituents just how divisive asylum has become in our country,” she said.A government source said there would be a “huge amount of engagement” with worried Labour MPs and stressed there would be no deportations of unaccompanied children.The Guardian view on Labour’s asylum plans: ministers cannot out-Farage the far right and should stop trying | EditorialRead more“The crisis at our borders is an existential issue for mainstream parties. If we don’t solve the crisis at our border, dark forces will follow,” they said. “Politics is about making arguments for things you think are right. That is what the home secretary is doing today.”But MPs said there were in particular widespread concerns about “morally bankrupt” moves to ramp up the deportation of families – which in practice would mean increased detention of children before removal.“I didn’t fight an election as a Labour MP to bundle distressed children on to deportation flights,” one MP said. Another MP in a Green-facing seat said they were facing an enormous backlash on social media. “It’s all terrible. Straight out of the far-right playbook. Lots of colleagues feel the same,” said a third.Opher said the government “should stop the boats because it’s dangerous, and we should stop the scapegoating of immigrants because it’s wrong and cruel … Measures that create bureaucracy and insecurity do not offer clarity or strengthen control – they cost money, waste time and weaken the system.”Owen, one of the key organisers against the government’s welfare cuts, said: “A strong immigration system doesn’t need to be a cruel one. It shouldn’t need saying – but refugees and asylum seekers are real people, fleeing war and persecution.”Duncan-Jordan said: “My taxi driver this morning told me that after 20 years living in this country he no longer felt welcome, despite paying his taxes and making a contribution to the local community.“British values extend beyond running a raffle or cutting the half-time orange. We are compassionate, tolerant and generous. Kicking out recognised asylum seekers doesn’t speak to any of our values. It hardens us as a nation and portrays Britain as a country like its weather – cold and uninviting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another MP said they saw it as an “opening offer … I’m sure that they will want to try and hear concerns because we know what happens when they don’t.”One MP in a marginal seat said they were particularly disturbed by the rhetoric that Britain is the “destination of choice” for refugees, which they said was straightforwardly untrue given the UK was the 14th most popular in the recent data.But another MP said they did not think it would mean immediate rebellions or resignations: “We want to read the proposals and then hear from other interested parties and get expert advice.“That is what happened with welfare and then the picture became clearer. No one doubts that there is a necessity to tackle illegal immigration but there are parts of this that do not strike me as an obvious deterrent and which will extend people’s suffering.”However, a significant number of MPs said they were convinced of the need to undertake “the unthinkable” when it came to the asylum system, given the threat of Reform and the even more draconian measures that could come under a Nigel Farage government.“People need to get real,” one minister said. “The public are moving a lot faster than colleagues on this because they recognise the stereotype of the deserving refugee has changed dramatically over the last decade because of the scale of people on the move.”Refugee status will be made temporary and reviewed every 30 months, the Home Office’s asylum policy document reads.The government also plans to weaken asylum seekers’ rights under article 8 of the ECHR, which provides for the “right to respect for family and private life”.The policy document said this was being used by illegal migrants to “stop” their removal. It proposes “strengthening” the public interest in interfering with article 8 and limiting it to “immediate family”.The UK will also lobby to “evolve” article 3 of the ECHR, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to counteract how it has “been expanded over time”, with it now being used to allow criminals to stay.A new appeals body would be formed in an attempt to accelerate removals, the Home Office’s blueprint states. This would be staffed by “professionally trained adjudicators” and its aim would be to “expand the capacity of the appeals system”.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Refugee Council, said: “What’s being forgotten here is that behind these proposals are men, women and children who have survived war, persecution and unimaginable loss, and who arrive in the UK with almost nothing.“These reforms sound tough, but they won’t fix the real problems in the asylum system. Instead, they risk creating more delays, more stress and more inhumane treatment for the very people the system is meant to protect.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodHome OfficeRefugeesKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Among the revelations in the documents was that Mountbatten-Windsor kept in touch with the late financier forlongerthan was previously known.“It seems like every time we find more evidence, Prince Andrew seems to be in the documents. And so I think if he is hoping that the story will just go away by ignoring us and being silent, he will be sorely disappointed as we continue to pursue this over the next year and beyond,” said Subramanyam, who has represented a northern Virginia district since the start of this year.He acknowledged that his options for compelling Mountbatten-Windsor’s testimony were limited. Republicans hold the majority in the House, and none signed the letter asking Mountbatten-Windsor to testify. Even if theDemocratsretake control of the chamber after next year’s midterm elections, Mountbatten-Windsor can’t be subpoenaed because he is a foreign national, Subramanyam said.Mountbatten-Windsor is not the focus of the oversight committee’s investigation, which grew out of the furor that erupted among Trump’s supporters in July, when the justice department announced that the Epstein case was closed. But Subramanyam said that Mountbatten-Windsor’s name keeps coming up, which means the pressure he is under to talk to the investigative panel is not going away.“Even if Andrew doesn’t voluntarily come forward, there may be others who are close to him who may come forward as well and provide us information,” he said, adding that those parties could be asked “formally” to testify to the oversight committee in the future.“I think the documents have given us a lot of information over the past six months, and we’re going to continue to press on with finding evidence and let the evidence do the talking. And so far, the evidence keeps talking about Andrew,” he said.The House is expected to on Tuesday vote on legislation to compel release of US government files related to Epstein. Trump had opposed the legislation, but Democrats along with four dissident Republicansgathered enough signatureson a petition that forced the vote, over the objections of speaker Mike Johnson, an ally of the president.On Sunday evening, Trumpreversed courseand called on the lower chamber to approve the bill. Subramanyam predicted it may pass with a “close to unanimous vote”, but its prospects in the Senate are unclear.The Democrat said he expected the president to “put a lot of pressure on” the Republican majority to scrap the legislation, which would require his signature to take effect.“The victims have been so strong and outspoken and courageous about this, and the general public is fed up with the Trump administration about this,” Subramanyam said.“And so I think the more public pressure there is, the more of a chance we could see this happen in the Senate.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinHouse of RepresentativesAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The party claims its measures would save £25bn a year in total – enough to cover the supposed shortfall faced by Rachel Reeves in next week’s budget.Other proposed cost savings would involve cutting overseas aid to a maximum of £1bn a year – a 90% reduction from the current level of 0.3% of national income – and almost tripling the NHS surcharge paid by non-UK residents.While Farage will present the package as prioritising the welfare of British nationals over non-citizens, the proposal to unilaterally junk elements of the post-Brexit deal with Brussels could affect the UK economy if it sparked reciprocal measures such as trade restrictions.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage claims his party’s policies would fix the country’s finances.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAccording to a Reform statement released on Monday night, all overseas nationals – including those with EU settled status – would lose the right to claim universal credit after a three-month notice period, which the party said would save £6bn a year.EU nationals – plus citizens from the European Economic Area and Switzerland – were able to apply for settled status under the terms of the Brexit deal, allowing access to public services and some benefits.While Reform has described this deal as “atrocious and one-sided”, ending elements of it without negotiation could see UK nationals in the EU also face action, and possible trade measures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party argues the current cost is “clearly too low”, and says overseas nationals used the NHS more on average.Other elements of the claimed £25bn in annual savings include £580m that would be recouped by deporting all foreign criminals.The plans were first reported in The Times – with Reform’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, telling the newspaper: “Labour has a choice. They can either go ahead and raise taxes on British citizens or they can enact our proposals which put British people first and ask foreign nationals to bear the brunt of the black hole, not British citizens.“Most British people would consider it outrageous to expect British people to pay higher taxes or see their services cut whilst their money is being spent this way.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage’s fantasy numbers don’t add up, and he’d leave British taxpayers footing a hefty bill.“Farage is happy to slap British shoppers with higher prices at the checkouts by risking a trade war with Europe. He’d betray working people and hammer British businesses who want to trade with the EU.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKNigel FarageLabourUniversal creditnewsShareReuse this content"

Sparman was put in the “red zone” category, meaning she was supposed to be searched for harmful items.Ward manager Meredith Kuleshnyk, who found Sparman, said lessons had been learned including more staff training around searches and a search room being made available.Although he acknowledged the staffing pressures the ward was under, Richmond determined that the absence of record-keeping was “a profoundly worrying state of affairs”. Despite evidence suggesting Rose Ward’s practices had changed, Richmond said he was not satisfied that a “robust recording system” was now in place.Jennifer MacLeod, the lawyer representing the family, cited statistics showing that in Rose Ward, in 2020, there were 70 instances of self-harm – indicating that staff intervened before suicide could be attempted.Kuleshnyk also told the inquest that she planned to discuss domestic abuse with Sparman after observing her interaction with Stephens.In a self-referral to Talk Wandsworth, a talking therapy service, Sparman stated that Stephens’ behaviour “has impacted on my sleep, my eating, my confidence, my emotional and mental wellbeing”.Shaun Case, Sparman’s half-brother, said she spoke of “anxiety, tightness in her chest when his [Stephens’] name came up on her phone”, and that she feared him turning up at her flat.MacLeod said: “The family’s position is that she perceived that as abuse, and all the medical professionals we have heard from perceived that as abuse.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Resale platforms will be allowed to charge fees on top of that price.These extras will also be limited, to ensure that they can’t be inflated artificially to offset profits forfeited owing to the legislation. The scale of the ceiling on service fees is yet to be determined.The ban will also govern social media sites, which resale platforms have claimed would offer unregulated and potentially fraudulent tickets if legislation squeezes online ticket exchanges out of the market.Anyone reselling a ticket will also be prohibited from offering more tickets than they could have procured under limits set by the original box office company.A licensing system for ticket resale companies, one of the options that the government review considered, will not be adopted. Resale platforms will be legally liable if sellers using their site do not comply with the law, which will be enforced by theCompetition and Markets Authority.Acts including Ed Sheeran and the Pixies have repeatedly lashed out at touts exploiting their fans, while this year’s Oasis reunion tourattracted legions of professional ticket “traders”.A Guardian investigation found hundreds of tickets being sold by professional “traders”, including three UK touts listing dozens of Oasis tickets for a combined £26,000.Overseas businesses have also targeted the lucrative UK market for live events. One Cyprus-based business advertised 1,596 tickets through StubHub alone for the Oasis tour.Paul McCartney joins music industry protest against AI with silent trackRead moreThe consumer group Which? published further details on Thursday of exorbitant prices charged by touts on such platforms in locations such as Dubai, Singapore and the US.Oasis tickets for Wembley Stadium shows were listed for £3,498.85 on StubHub and £4,442 on Viagogo, while aColdplayticket, also for Wembley, was £814.52 on StubHub. The most extreme example Which? found was a ticket for All Points East festival in London’s Victoria Park, headlined by Raye, listed for £114,666 on Viagogo.Such markups have beenestimated to cost consumers £145m a yearby the telecoms company and the venue sponsor Virgin O2. In some cases, campaigners and investigations by the Guardian have suggested, sellers may not even have the tickets they claim to.Instead, they have been accused of engaging in apractice known as “speculative selling”, where touts advertise tickets they don’t have, then bank the proceeds from a sale and hope to source a ticket more cheaply later on. This practice is fraudulent.Secondary ticketing companies have lobbied fiercely against the proposals, which they claim would lead to an increased illicit market and more fraud.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alcohol units: 0, cigarettes: 0, calories: 0, weight: 31 stone – and, according to the actor Sally Phillips, “no intention of losing any of it”.Phillips was in Leicester Square on Monday morning to unveil a life-size bronze of the comedy character, alongside Helen Fielding – who first cooked her up in a newspaper column 30 years ago, and whose novels have now been translated into more than 40 languages – andRenée Zellweger, star of the four Bridget Jones films (with a combined box office of $900m (£683m)).The statue joins the likes of Paddington, Harry Potter and Charlie Chaplin as part of Westminster council’s Scenes in the Square scheme to further cement the location’s credentials as a cinema hub. It is home to four multiplexes and the setting of most of London’s red-carpet premieres.A pink carpet was laid in honour of bronze Bridget, who had been planted in a bed of plastic fuchsia flowers and draped with a purple silk sheet that required considerable tugging when time came for the big reveal – an on-brand snag for a character famed for her bumbling news reports.View image in fullscreenBefore the reveal … Sally Phillips, Renée Zellweger and Helen Fielding.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images“It seems really cute,” was Zellweger’s verdict. “I mean, it’s really so weird, but it’s really cute.” Seeing herself immortalised in this way was “not something you expect to happen”, she said, especially while alive. Her ambitions when making the first film 24 years ago had been more modest: “I was just hoping I wouldn’t get fired.”That the statue clutches stationery rather than her traditional accoutrements of cigarette and chardonnay was “fine”, said Phillips. “She’s not very drunk in the fourth film. She works without wine because the fuck-ups are not just alcohol related.”But while the statue’s slimline figure also seemed inspired by the most recent film – in which a widowed Bridget no longer binges on vodka and ice-cream but juggles single motherhood and two new suitors – her wardrobe hails from an earlier age. “She’s Mad About the Boy-era weight with Bridget Jones’s Diary-era clothes,” said Phillips carefully. “Very, very strongly put,” nodded Fielding.Also not on display were Bridget’s famed “mummy knickers” to smooth her silhouette – unnecessary, said a representative from the 3D Eye studio responsible for the artwork, as “sculpting in clay probably works in a similar way to sculpting pants”.“Her stomach is as flat as a pancake,” said Fielding, impressed, although she did later concede there seemed to be “a little bit sort of hanging over” the beltline – an effect enhanced by the artistic decision to leave her three bottom buttons undone and the cardigan apparently parted to reveal a triangle of torso.View image in fullscreen‘No mummy knickers’ … Bridget Jones statue, Leicester Square, London.Photograph: Alan West/Hogan Media/ShutterstockMight fans be tempted to rub her tummy for luck? “How sweet is that,” said Zellweger of the idea. “I never imagined it. I love it so much! Maybe we should all go rub her belly?” And her feelings on the exposed midriff? “Well, it’s very real.”Also in attendance was Eric Fellner, co-chair of Working Title, the production company behind the movies. “Portraiture is difficult enough,” he said. “But doing it in 3D is even more challenging. They’ve got the attitude nicely, which is what’s most important.”Fielding said that while sculptures are not what she seeks out first on her travels – “that’s bars” – she did take some statue selfies with Jilly Cooper in September, when both novelists were at Chatsworth for an event hosted by Queen Camilla.“We walked around all the statues deciding whether we liked the naked men or the dogs best. Jilly liked the dogs and I preferred the men. But we liked both of them really.”Fielding said she hoped people might bring packets of chocolate and Silk Cut to lie at Bridget’s feet in pilgrimage, echoing the scene in her novel in which her heroine lays flowers at the gates to Kensington Palace after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.The popularity of her character, she said, was down to “the gap between how we all feel we’re expected to be and how we actually are. Bridget doesn’t have a superpower. She can’t fly like Mary Poppins. She can’t do wizardry. She’s certainly not a bear.View image in fullscreenSally Phillips unveils the statue.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images“But those very British qualities of kindness, support for your friends, of community, and the ability to laugh at all your imperfections – the perfection of imperfection – makes her relatable to people.”Her continued appeal, especially with people who weren’t born when she first appeared, Fielding credited to an escalating crisis of confidence among the young. “When I first wrote Bridget, we were just being hit by mass media Photoshopping magazines: really skinny 90s girls in adverts. But Gen Z have got it a hundred-thousand times worse because they’re not just seeing that at a distance. They’re seeing their friends filtered. There’s this massive culture of presenting a fake version of your life.“But they also feel guilty about worrying about their bodies because of body positivity. So imagine being Bridget and feeling bad about your bodyandfeeling bad about feeling bad.”At a literary festival in Magaluf recently, an influencer told Fielding that “Bridget helped her not feel weird and bad or guilty about herself. In Japan, these tiny beautiful women come up and say they identify with her. A lot of different people feel that she comforts them just by being human.”The fourth film in the series was released in February; its stars, Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor, as well as director Michael Morris, were also present at the unveiling, where Morris said he hoped a fifth film might follow.View image in fullscreen‘I think we know it’s not Nelson’s column’ … (from left) Leo Woodall, Renée Zellweger and Chiwetel Ejiofor at the unveiling of the Bridget Jones bronze.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy took £46m in the UK and remains the second highest-grossing film of the year, but went straight to streaming in the US – to Morris and Fellner’s disappointment. “It’s deemed that, in America, anything that isn’t a big cinematic event ends up on streaming,” said Fellner. “We disagree and think that good stories really work in a communal shared experience.”Fellner was keen to flag comparisons between Fielding and another female author whose most famous creation is immortalised in Leicester Square: JK Rowling.“Creativity from one individual can become this massive thing on a global scale,” he said. “Politicians like to look at industry as hard things but creativity is an industry in its own right, and you need to get more young people from all walks of life able to come up with ideas like Joanne [Rowling] and Helen. The more intellectual property that’s created the better it is for this country.”Fielding said she expected Keir Starmer would take a keen interest in the morning’s events, given that he is often taken to be the inspiration for dashing and morally unimpeachable human rights lawyer Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth). “I’m sure his attention will be focused on this matter,” she said, adding her hope that the prime minister would be reminded to “take the arts seriously and invest in it”.She also urged that funding overall be fairly distributed, rather than concentrated in the capital. “I’m from Leeds,” she said. “And all the humour in Bridget is based on northern comedy; on the joke of bringing fancy things down to earth. There’s so much creative talent and humour up north, but honestly, if I speak at the Yorkshire Children’s Charity or something, I’m shocked.”View image in fullscreenRenée Zellweger and Helen Fielding.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesBig knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreFielding likened present-day northern England to the environments she’d witnessed working for Comic Relief 40 years ago, “I feel like I’m back in east Africa in the 80s: kids with no shoes, families without food. The north-south divide in Britain is much bigger than in most westernised countries.”In Leicester Square, the crowds began to disperse, the pink carpet appeared a touch more muddy, and the sight of a small metal woman with a winsome face and uncertain buttoning began to feel like more of a fixture.“I think we know it’s not Nelson’s column,” said Fielding. “It may not be there in three centuries. But nevertheless it is quite a lovely thing that Bridget means something in this country.”Explore more on these topicsFilmBridget Jones' DiaryBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyBridget Jones: the Edge of ReasonHelen FieldingRenée ZellwegerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When she looked out from the window of her room, she saw the woods that she played in as a young girl and felt a sense of contentment.Now she and hundreds of other elderly residents are facing uncertainty after the Reform-ledLancashirecounty council announced it would consult on plans to close care homes in the area.Last monthit began a consultationon moving residents out of five local authority care homes and day centres into other premises. The consultation closes in mid-December and the cabinet will make a final decision on the closures in February.“We’ve been delighted with the home and with the room, we moved her there because her needs are just too great to have kept her in sheltered housing,” said Marjorie’s son, Phil. “We moved her six months ago and I can’t bear to tell her what’s happening because I think she’d be heartbroken to be moving again.”He said the council had already started a review of his mother’s care needs, which he believes “seems premature if the consultation stage is still in place, so it feels like the decision is all but made”.Dorothy Devereux, 92, has lived at Woodlands for 12 years. Before that, she worked as a nurse and carer. When the time came to be placed in a home, she was adamant it had to be Woodlands, as it was the only place she felt she could comfortably spend her final years.View image in fullscreenMarjorie Aspden, 95, with her son, Phil. He says she’d be heartbroken to hear the closure plans.For Dorothy’s children, Frances and Simon, the plans are unacceptable. They say a report being used to justify Woodland’s possible sale is years out of date and that there is not enough space for people to go into the remaining care homes in the area, with some possibly being relocated far distances away.“From everything we’ve seen so far – as little as it is – all that they’ve talked about is money,” said Simon. “They’ve not even considered the human cost. They haven’t thought about how this impacts our parents, where they will go, how happy they will be. Not only does it seem impossible, it’s cruel, especially from a party that claims to have respect for people who have contributed to society.”The siblings were only made aware of the plans from their mother and received no official notice from the council or the home.Frances Duxbury is among a handful of the 50 residents at Woodlands who are aware of the plans, with many others who have conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s not being able to fully understand the situation.Some of the loved ones of these residents were only made aware that their parents were under threat of being moved when they were added to a WhatsApp group to discuss it.The proposalhas been referred toas one of a series of decisions made by Reform councils to balance budgets, fuelled by the principles of their Trump-inspired Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge.View image in fullscreenCentenarian Ken Ormerod with his daughter Aileen Walmsley, a retired Woodlands care staff. She fears her father may not survive if he was made to move again.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianSome residents have complex mental and emotional needs, which have led to their children choosing not to tell them, so as to not shatter the sense of calm they have found at the home.Centenarian Ken Ormerod, who lives with anxiety, has been a resident at Woodlands for two years. His daughter, Aileen Walmsley, used to work there, while her daughter and granddaughter are employed at the home. She says her father wouldnot be able to survive if he was made to move again.“My dad’s been passed from pillar to post, he’s had such a hard life and he’s always been a bit of a hermit,” she said. “Since being here he’s come out of his shell, he’s smiling like he hasn’t for years. He always used to eat alone, now he eats in the canteen. He’s even got a small group of friends, I can’t imagine him losing that, I don’t think he could go on if he did.”Sarah Smith, the MP for Hyndburn where Woodlands is located, believes the additional cost of moving residents to private homes will lead to the council spending more money than it will save within 18 months.“This seems to me like an ideological position rather than a logical one, just to meet the standards of Doge, which I think has come to stand for the department of granny evictions,” said Smith.View image in fullscreen‘Ideological’: Woodlands care home. Sarah Smith, MP for Hyndburn where Woodlands is located believes the cost-cutting plans based on Doge principles in the US will cost the council more money.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“They keep talking about ‘cutting the fat’ but there isn’t fat in council budgets. So, when they talk about cutting fat, they really mean cutting frontline services, but they aren’t thinking about the actual impact it will have.”Graham Dalton, Lancashire county council’s cabinet member for adult social care, said the review was part of a “commitment to ensuring that the care we provide remains safe, high-quality, and sustainable for the years ahead” and that he and the council understood “how deeply valued these services are by those who use them and their families as well as staff and the wider community”.He said: “We know that for many, these homes are not just buildings, they are places of comfort, familiarity and connection.“The consultation we are running is a really important opportunity for people to share their views and help shape the future of adult social care in our county.“I would also like to make it clear that no decisions have been made about the future of any of these services. We are consulting to find out people’s views to help us make the best decision when the issue is considered by cabinet.”Explore more on these topicsSocial careLancashireEnglandReform UKLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Porn documentary makers often seem to use their commission to indulge their own murky fascinations, or at the very least fill the screen with naked women as an easier way to hook viewers than constructing a decent programme. Similarly, stuffing any programme with footage of the poster boys’ diatribes, generally aboutpussies (female, metonymically; males metaphorically), power and the need for men to wield one over the other is a titillating opportunity and an easy shortcut to engagement.Belfast broadcaster James Blake admirably avoids this trap in his hour-long filmMenof the Manosphere. It has snippets of the loudest, vilest voices, doing their loudest, vilest thing, telling young, disaffected, vulnerable men what they want to hear: that the problems in their lives are the fault of women, feminism, woke society, beta men and anyone who is not full of ambition, independent spirit and willing to subscribe to the influencer’s latest course on how to be a successful man. If you have spotted any inconsistencies here, you are probably a blue-pilled cuck and not the target market, so please move along.But Blake’s main focus is on the recipients of these proliferating messages, the recruited rather than the recruiters – although, as we shall see, the line between the two is blurry almost by design. Blake himself, who is only 32, drifted towards the brutal comforts offered by the manosphere a few years ago after the breakup of a five-year relationship that he had expected to end in marriage and a family. At one point in the programme, he scrolls back through the material he was looking at – and reposting to his followers – at the time and is mortified by what he finds. “It’s almost like a different person,” he says. “I was hurting, and this content gave it a voice.” His journey into the manosphere was relatively brief, then he came to his senses. For the young men he interviews, however, the journey started earlier and goes further.Sixteen-year-old Sam has been involved with the manosphere since he was 13. He is a paying subscriber to one influencer in particular (“He changed my life … He taught me how to grow up”), whose online success he hopes to emulate when he has learned enough. His own first TikTok video two years ago resulted in a huge amount of bullying at school. Since then he has taken further refuge online. “I don’t have any friends in real life any more,” he says.Like James, 22-year-old criminology graduate Shane found comfort in the “red pill” ideology after a breakup. Red-pilling means rejecting societal conventions – especially those around treating women with respect (“master manipulators” is a favourite refrain of red-pill promulgators) – and concentrating on yourself instead (especially your muscle mass and earning potential). “If you don’t get too invested [in women], you can avoid all the heartbreak and stuff,” says Shane. Couldn’t that be quite unfulfilling, wonders Blake, whose shared sex and closeness in age, class and experience to his subjects, as well as his evident sanguinity and compassion, elicits strikingly guileless and relatively elaborate answers from all of them. Shane says he is struggling with the fact he has feelings for his new girlfriend that are hard to reconcile with the recommendation to play the field because “nice guys get nowhere”.Jack, 27, has been a follower of the red-pill lifestyle since the pandemic. Men, he says, need to stop feeling sorry for themselves: “No one’s coming to save them.” He dreams of becoming an online guru and is paying £650 a month to learn how to go about it. In the meantime, he is on a “semen retention journey”. “If you can control your lust and your sex drive,” he explains, “you can control your mind. People don’t realise it, every time you masturbate, you’re releasing your masculine energy, your testosterone.” Blake plays an admirably straight bat with it all.A combination of confusion, contradiction and loneliness – when Sam finally meets some of his online friends in the flesh, his joy is heartbreaking – suffuses every interaction James has with these young men. It is clear that none of them are evil or anything close to it. But they are adrift in a world that is changing in ways it is easy for them to believe are not for the better, and vulnerable to predators. They may not be being groomed by more powerful men for sexual reasons, but there are plenty of other types of exploitation, many of which make them even more of a potential threat to others’ happiness and safety than they are to their own. Men of the Manosphere is a thoughtful, tender, terrifying hour.Men of the Manosphere aired on BBC Three and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a science fiction story, more or less, but also indicative of the sort of writer Rushdie would become: garrulous, playful, energetic. The tale of an immortal Indian who travels to a mysterious island, it’s messy but charming, and the sense of writing as performance is already here. (Rushdie’s first choice of career was acting, and he honed his skill in snappy lines when working in an advertising agency.) Not a great book, but one that shows a great writer finding his voice, and a fascinating beginning to a stellar career.View image in fullscreen9Quichotte (2019)Rushdie’s love for pop culture – he was inspired to write his first story, aged nine, after watching The Wizard of Oz – was never more evident than in this rompy rewrite of Don Quixote that references Back to the Future, Disney’s Pinocchio, Beavis and Butt-Head, Starsky & Hutch and more. The eponymous character is driven mad by watching too much TV – but his story is itself being written by a washed-up spy novelist. In its layers within layers it’s as hyperactive as Grimus,but a bit more controlled. And even if Rushdie in this book is half-charming raconteur, half pub-bore, the energy will keep you bouncing merrily along.View image in fullscreen8The Moor’s Last Sigh (1995)Rushdie’s first novel for adults after The Satanic Verses prompted the supreme leader of Iran to issue a fatwa against him in 1989 was a dam bursting open to release all the pent-up ideas, characters and jokes of the previous six years. It’s the story of “Moor” Zogoiby, the ousted heir to a crooked spice dynasty and the youngest of four siblings: “Ina, Minnie, Mynah, Moor”. You can infer references to Rushdie’s ordeal (“Here I stand. Couldn’t’ve done it differently”), but mostly this is supreme, nutritious entertainment. It was shortlisted for the Booker prize and, because of Rushdie’s security needs, this meant –according to that year’s winner, Pat Barker– “lots of men with bulging armpits standing round”.View image in fullscreen7Shame (1983)Coming soon after his great epic Midnight’s Children, Shame is overshadowed but one of Rushdie’s best. It’s shorter, tighter and somewhat darker than its predecessor. Set in “not quite Pakistan”, it delivers a satire of the country that is both over the top and deadly serious. Here, a diet of “honour” above all else leads to brutal killings, – “Shame is like everything else: live with it long enough and it becomes part of the furniture” – but there is typically glorious comedy too. Shame won a major prize in Iran for best translated novel of the year – so Rushdie had no inkling of the way the country’s leadership would respond to his next novel: The Satanic Verses.View image in fullscreen6Knife (2024)Rushdie’s second memoir is about his attempted murder on stage in New York in 2022. “So it’s you,” he recalls thinking as a man in black rushed towards him. “Here you are.” Knife offers a sometimes gruelling account of his recovery – his wife wouldn’t let him look in the mirror, in case realising how serious his injuries were sapped his spirit – but it’s also peppered with Rushdie’s usual humour. Losing four stone, he “no longer had to worry about being overweight”. It also displays a rare softness, with beautiful praise for his wife, his late friend Martin Amis and others. It’s a book where “hatred is answered, and finally overcome, by love”.View image in fullscreen5Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990)Rushdie was ready to give up writing after The Satanic Verses, but “the thing that saved me as a writer was having promised my son a book”. Haroun, then, is a story for children and adults that distils Rushdie’s greatest qualities – storytelling, comedy, imagination – into a fable about a storyteller doomed to silence. It’s a good entry point for those in what Rushdie calls his “page 15 club of readers” – people who can’t get through his sometimes dense prose. And it’s not hard to see his own experiences in the book: “Stories are fun,” says hero Haroun; “Stories make trouble,” insists the despotic dictator Khattam-Shud. With a joyous blend of wordplay, fantasy and “P2C2Es” (Processes too Complicated to Explain), Haroun is Rushdie’s lightest, brightest achievement.View image in fullscreen4Shalimar the Clown (2005)Rushdie’s best novel of the 21st century is about the murder of an American ambassador to India by a Kashmiri named Shalimar the Clown. It’s a book about “the crimes of the 14th century [being] avenged in the 20th” and the horrors of political violence: “It all made the new, senseless kind of sense.” Addressing Rushdie’s perennial theme of worlds in collision, it also becomes a page-turning thriller and a powerfully moving tragedy. Even Rushdie was overwhelmed, occasionally crying as he wrote. “What am I doing?” he asked himself. “This is somebody I’ve made up.” That, of course, is the power of great writing.View image in fullscreen3Joseph Anton (2012)Rushdie’s memoir of his time under the Ayatollah’s death threat gives a powerful report on the anguish he and his family felt. More surprisingly, it is a comic masterpiece. Rushdie, writing in the third person, drops names shamelessly, whether biting back at Roald Dahl, who had criticised Rushdie during the fatwa affair (Dahl was “a long, unpleasant man with huge strangler’s hands”); or revealing how not to tell Bernardo Bertolucci you hate his new film (“he put his hand on his heart and said, ‘Bernardo … I can’t talk about it’”); or sharing perhaps the greatest suffering during his time undercover: having Harold Pinter fax him his terrible poems.View image in fullscreen2The Satanic Verses (1988)The extra-literary reaction to this book has blotted out its brilliance as a novel. In helter-skelter style, The Satanic Verses opens with two actors, Gibreel and Saladin, falling through the air over England after their plane is blown up by Sikh terrorists. “What an entrance, yaar. I swear: splat.” But they survive, each undergoing a metamorphosis – Gibreel becomes an angel, Saladin grows devil’s horns – and this is just the first act of their troubles. Especially evergreen is the book’s take on the immigrant experience in Britain, and how the demonisation of others leads in only one direction. It is a model for the freedom for literature to say whatever it wants to, as loud as it can.View image in fullscreen1Midnight’s Children (1981)After Grimus took a “critical beating”, Rushdie knew he had to pull out all the stops with his second novel. His peers – Amis, Ian McEwan – were outpacing him. He created the story of Saleem Sinai, born on the moment of Indian independence from British rule, which makes a virtue of its eclectic style drawing on multiple cultures. It creates a flood of language teeming “fastfast” down the page and pulling the reader helplessly along. Midnight’s Children won not only theBooker prizein 1981 but also the Booker of Bookers in 1993, and the Best of the Booker in 2008. It is not only an incredible achievement on its own terms: it opened a door to the next generation of writers. It was, in the words of Anita Desai, “the voice of a new age”. It is a book with room for everything and everyone.To browse all titles by Salman Rushdie, visit theguardianbookshop.com.

What explains this generational divide?Mon 17 Nov 2025 11.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.15 ESTShareName:Communal tables.Appearance:Long, awkward and back in fashion.Communal dining is back? Oh no. The only acceptable place for refectory tables is the school canteen, and even then they’re pretty terrible. Who would voluntarily eat with strangers as an adult with free will?Gen Z, apparently. According toBusiness Insider, data from the restaurant reservations company Resy reveals “90% of gen Z diners say they enjoy communal tables, compared with just 60% of boomers”.I’ve never felt more out of touch.Before you start harrumphing about the youth of today,communal eating in patriotic “British Restaurants”was a big thing during the second world war, actually – there were about 2,500 of them, supported by Winston Churchill.I suppose it made sense when food was scarce, but why do it now?It’s an alien concept for you, I know, but communal tables can be fun! As Pablo Rivero, the CEO of Resy, explains: “They naturally turn dinner into a shared experience,” and “You never know who you’ll be seated next to; that’s the fun of it!”The “fun” ofhaving dinner interrupted by someone explaining loudly that their therapist says they’re “a highly sensitive empath” as they elbow you in the face reaching for the soy sauce? Or being squeezed next to aHyrox borechomping chicken breasts to fuel his“farmer’s carries”? Or a nano-influencer capturing you in the background of their reelas they massacrea salad?You have to remember that gen Z – the most online generation, who came of age during the pandemic, and many of whomentered an almost exclusively digital workplace– love a structured communal activity. It’s the same impulse behind the rise of young people’srunning clubs, group hikes and crafting nights: they’recraving offline social connection.I’d rather eat in one of thoseone-personramen boothsthey have in Tokyo.You might not fancy it, but lots of young people are lonely (47% of them, according to anOxfam surveypublished in June).In a 2023 US report, one-third of men aged between 18 and 23 reported they hadn’t seen anyone outside their household in the past week. Isn’t it a good thing they’re getting out and breaking bread with strangers?I suppose.Research showspeople who eat socially “more often feel happier and are more satisfied with life”.Talking to strangersis good for us, too: it gives us a greater sense of belonging. Plus the Resy data highlights an additional benefit: one in seven survey respondents said they’d landed a date at a communal dining experience. Given gen Z havegone off the apps, this gives them a shot at a spontaneous (ha ha) “meat-cute”.I hate that pun almost as much as I hate communal tables.My work here is done.Do say:“Gen Z think communal dining ate and left no crumbs.”Don’t say:“It’s all fun and games until someone drops a katsu prawn on your Y2K baggy jeans.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The star of Top Gun, Jerry Maguire and the Mission: Impossible series was given an honorary Academy Award at the annual Governors awards, which are designed to reward lifetime achievement.In a statement before the event, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) president Janet Yang cited “Cruise’s incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community has inspired us all”. Recalling hisefforts to shoot the seventh Mission: Impossible in 2020, Yang added that Cruise “helped to usher the industry through a challenging time during the Covid-19 pandemic”.Cruise, who was previously nominated for best actorOscarsfor Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire, and best supporting actor for Magnolia, described first falling in love with the medium, saying: “I remember that beam of light just cut across the room. I remember looking up and seeing the image just exploding on the screen, and suddenly the world was so much larger than the one that I knew. Entire cultures, lives, landscapes. It sparked a hunger, a hunger for adventure, a hunger for knowledge, a hunger to understand humanity, to create characters, to tell a story.”Cruise was introduced by Alejandro González Iñárritu, who isworking with the actoron an as yet untitled film due for release in 2026. Saying that “writing a four-minute speech to celebrate Tom Cruise’s 45-year career is what is known in this town as Mission: Impossible”, Iñárritu then described the actor’s work as “meticulously choreographed” but feeling “completely improvised, structured like a clockwork, but flowing like gas”. His onscreen intensity, Iñárritu said, was also present off screen: he once witnessed Cruise downing chilli peppers “like they were popcorn”, while “I, a proud Mexican, was crying with just one bite”.“This may be his first Oscar, but from what I have seen and experienced, it will not be the last,” Iñárritu added. Standing next to Cruise, he said, you “start to wonder if the rest of us belong to a completely different, rapidly decaying species”.View image in fullscreenCruise with Oscar-winning film director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who presented the award.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe Academy also paid tribute to Dolly Parton, awarding an honorary Oscar to “one of the few people that remains in this world that everyone loves”. Parton, who has recently hadhealth concernsthat forced the postponement of a Las Vegas residency, was not able to attend the event – but her friend Lily Tomlin was on hand to celebrate the humanitarian work that earned Parton the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian award.“The soul, the heart of Dolly, it is so good and so true,” Tomlin told an audience of A-listers at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Hollywood. “She has fake nails, fake hair – but she is the most authentic person I have ever known.”Parton – who has previously been nominated for two best song Oscars – launched the Dollywood Foundation in 1988 tosupport educationin her home county in Tennessee. Seven years later, she launched a book donation programme that eventually went international. She has also supported disaster relief efforts, including giving $1m last year to Hurricane Helene recovery, and has helped fund Covid vaccine research.“My mom and dad showed me that the more you give, the more blessings come your way,” Parton said in a prerecorded acceptance speech. “And I’ve been blessed more than I ever dreamed possible.” The award, she said, “makes me want to dream up new ways to help lift people up. And isn’t that what we’re supposed to be here for?” Her message was followed by a powerful rendition of Parton’s song Jolene by the singer Andra Day.The Governors awards are a reception and dinner that act as a kind of curtain-raiser for the Oscars, with many of its attendees among the hopefuls in this year’s race. The mood is typically relaxed and jovial; it probably helps that the ceremony isn’t televised, and is largely confined to entertainment industry insiders – and everyone already knows who will be going home with statuettes. (This year’s honorees were announced in June.) Each of the evening’s recipients received a standing ovation from their peers.Next to be honored was Wynn Thomas, a longtime production designer – in his words, the person who “takes the writer’s words and turns them into concrete images” – whose credits include Do the Right Thing, A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X and Hidden Figures.“Stepping into the world of Wynn Thomas is to find yourself in the hands of an imaginative artist, a meticulous and masterful film-maker, a trailblazer [who has] opened our eyes to new possibilities,” said Octavia Spencer in a speech introducing Thomas – who, she noted, was the first Black production designer to join the art directors guild. His films, she said, “portray a vibrant range of Black life, and that is by no means an accident”. Thomas “hasn’t just changed the way Black lives are shown in movies, he has changed the lives of Black artists in the entire industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the local gangs looked down on me and called me sissy. But that sissy grew up to work with some great directors.”Cynthia Erivo paid tribute to the actor, dancer, choreographer, director and producer Debbie Allen, who has a long list of credits that include Fame, Amistad, the sitcom A Different World, and choreographing many Academy Awards ceremonies. “To know Miss Debbie is to know that she refuses to let dreams fade,” Erivo said. She recounted how an initial rejection from the North Carolina School of the Arts ultimately led to Allen’s five-decade career on screen and behind the scenes.For her part, Allen reflected on the people who helped her along the way, including her parents, “who raised their children believing that we were citizens of the universe and that there were no boundaries, and that anything we could see, we could be”. She added: “Movies helped us see a lot of things. And we were faced with brick walls and glass ceilings and ‘White Only’ signs everywhere. But we grew up believing in ourselves.” The award, Allen said, would be a reminder “not of what I’ve done, but what I get, mean and have to do”.The final words of the night belonged to Cruise. Film, he said, reveals: “our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. No matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh, we feel together, we heal together, and that is the power of cinema. So making films is not what I do; it is who I am.”Explore more on these topicsTom CruiseOscarsAwards and prizesDolly PartonFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In response to a post on X which predicted that Shabana Mahmood would announce that refugees will be granted only a temporary stay in the UK and deported if their home countries are later deemed safe, he posted: “The Overton window has been obliterated, well done patriots.” Meanwhile, asylum seekers and refugees I have spoken to are panicked, trembling and crying at the prospect of having to be uprooted once again after feeling safe in the UK, often after experiencing years of risk and danger.Since last Thursday, journalists have been receiving an average of one Home Office press release every few hours, each one focusing on a different aspect of what Mahmood has described as “the most sweeping reformsto tackle illegal migration in modern times”. But a quick investigation below the surface of the eye-catching we-mean-business sloganising reveals a mix of recycling, hype and unachievable promises. According to the home secretary, support will end for those who “game the system”, while the days of a “soft-touch asylum system are over” because she is going to tear up refugees’ “golden ticket” to the UK. There is mounting disquiet about all this among Labour votersand MPs.Mahmood has also been keen to stress Labour’s success so far.Removals have increased, according to the Home Office, with11,231 asylum-related returnsin the year to November 2025. But many of these removals were to countries regarded as safe, such as Brazil and India, which have historically had very low asylum grant rates – not a sign that officials are bundling out of the country thousands of asylum seekers who arrived from conflict zones on small boats.And her plan to get tough on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo by refusing to grant visas to their nationals if they don’t play take back foreign national offenders is hardly the gamechanger she claims. Only a few thousand visas were granted last year to migrants from all three countries combined, according toHome Officedata.Granting or not granting such a relatively small number of visas, despite making a huge difference to the individuals involved, will make barely a dent in the overall immigration figures the Home Office is so desperate to reduce.Another threat is to reduce appeal rights on asylum and immigration claims to a “single route of appeal”, according to a Home Office press release. I asked if this means that further rights of appeal, such as to the upper tribunal of the immigration chamber, will be scrapped. No, officials said.The asylum accommodation announcement is eye-catchingly draconian. It willrevoke the rightto automatic financial support for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute. But not for the vast majority of the100,000 asylum seekers who are in receipt of it. It will apply only to 8,500 asylum seekers who came to the UK via a visa before lodging an asylum claim. The assistance will become “discretionary”, meaning it will be denied to those who can work or have assets. It is not knownhow many will actually have their support revoked, and how many will be too ill to work or unable to find a job.Excluding asylum seekers who have independent financial means, break the law or work illegally from asylum accommodation is not new, as thisHome Office guidancefrom March 2023 shows.As for the jewellery confiscation plan, the optics may appeal to anyone who believes that asylum seekers arriveon dinghies draped in bling. But it doesn’t apply to the majority of asylum seekers I have met, many of whom have sold their last worldly possessions to cross the Channel in the hope of reaching safety. Even in Denmark, where the policy was initiated,assets have been confiscated only 17 timesbetween 2016 and 2022. Many, such as the Green peer Jenny Jones, are “disgusted” by the idea.The decision to quadruple the amount of time before a refugee can settle permanently in the UK,from five years to 20, will have vast consequences. As one Syrian refugee told me after hearing the flurry of government announcements: “I feel like I’ve been scammed by the government who are clapping Reform UK and people who have racist and fascist views. I have become more scared of walking down the street in case I’m attacked by racists. I’m more vigilant now. I used to have nightmares about the things that happened to me in Syria. They hugely reduced after I got refugee status but now they have started again.”It’s unlikely that conditions will significantly improve in the main conflict zones where refugees are granted leave to remain comefrom – Eritrea, Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. People from these countries are likely to be left in a state of long-term limbo for a significant chunk of their productive lives, making it much harder to secure a job, find housing and put down roots. But they won’t actually be going anywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Butits own researchhas shown what the pull factors are–and benefits, nice houses and putting their feet up at taxpayers’ expense are not among them. There is no evidence that any of the deterrent measures introduced so far have done anything at all to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK. Small boat crossings continue to be high despite the launch of deterrents such as “one in, one out”.Thousandshave crossed the Channel since the policy was launched on 6 August.There is consensus that our immigration system needs to be firmly controlled, but as the Labour MPSarah Owen says, “a strong immigration system doesn’t need to be a cruel one”. Instead of enforcing these cruel and ineffective policies, the UK should work closely with other European countries and the relevant UN bodies such as the UN high commissioner for refugees to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are fairly distributed between safe countries, and that the precious right to seek sanctuary for those fleeing persecution is not eroded beyond recognition.The government may in time regret receiving a ringing endorsement from Tommy Robinson. It should regret too the damage it will cause, not only to the relatively small number of asylum seekers who come here – just over 100,000 last year – but also to UK society, which will only splinter further as the language and policies of hate and division become embedded.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Perhaps hard work and determination, aided by a degree of talent? No doubt these have played an important role. But how much do you think that factors outside your control – what we might think of as luck – have influenced your path in life, for good or ill?I believe that many of us – especially those who consider ourselves successful – underestimate the role that luck has played in our lives. And I’m not just talking about random life events, like winning the lottery, I’m thinking about luck in the broader sense of the circumstances into which each of us is born.It took me a while to realise that my journey through life has been eased by several tailwinds. I have had the incredible luck of being born in the UK, in a peaceful period of history. I was blessed with an able body and mind, and hada good upbringing, and an incredibly exclusive education. I had the freedom to take advantage of opportunities, to start my own business and pursue my ambitions. In that sense my early years were a heck of a lot easier than many people’s. And I was also extremely fortunate that my particular talents were highly valued and rewarded in the marketplace, which enabled me to become wealthy.How about you? Maybe you were born in a period when house prices were low, or when university education was free? You may not have had all of these things, but imagine for a second that you had none of them. Imagine that you came into this world facing barriers to your progress at every stage. Your parents unemployed, or needing care from you, or working ridiculous hours in insecure jobs. Your neighbourhood wracked by deprivation, despair, pollution and crime, with precious few opportunities to move up or out. Your plans to buy a house or start a business impossible because of lack of capital, or access to it. Would I have displayed the brilliance and the sheer grit needed to overcome those barriers? Probably not.In this country we like to think that we live in a meritocracy, where talent and hard work are rewarded by success and status, and opportunities are there for whoever is willing to work for them. Clearly this isn’t the case, when there is a recordwealth gapin Britain today, with a mere50 families owning more wealththan the poorest half of the population, while about a third of children live inpoverty, and disadvantaged children are19 monthsbehind their peers by the time they take their GCSEs. Still,38% of peoplethink that someone’s chance of success depends on their own merit rather than on factors beyond their control. They subscribe to themyth of meritocracy.The flip side of the idea that “you can make it if you try” is that if you haven’t made it, you haven’t tried hard enough. This thinking legitimises the status quo by suggesting that inequality is “fair”, allowing those who benefit from it most to frustrate attempts by governments to tackle socioeconomic inequality.All the while, increasing inequality ispoisoningour economy andundermining growth. And yet, while 85% of the British public areconcernedabout inequality, most politicians see tackling inequality either as a low priority or as too politically risky.Worse still, the meritocratic myth – that we all deserve our success or lack of it – allows socioeconomic inequality to spill over into an inequality of esteem, status and dignity. This breeds resentment and disengagement among those who are deemed by society to be second-class citizens, damaging social cohesion andundermining public faith in democratic politics.That is why dismantling the myth that we live in a meritocracy is one of the most urgent changes needed in public life today. We might not all agree on whether a truly meritocratic society is desirable, or even possible – but we should be able to come together around a recognition that we don’t live in one yet and then see if we might do something about it.Acknowledging the role that luck has played in our lives would be a great starting point, helping to smooth the path for our political leaders to take bolder action to tackle socioeconomic inequality. If more business leaders recognised how luck has helped them, it might also encourage them to act (for example by improving pay and conditions for low-paid or insecure workers).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All I’m asking is that my successful contemporaries recognise (if they don’t already) that they’ve benefited from some good luck along the way, whatever hard work has alsobeen involved.At theFairness Foundation, we want to bring together people who have achieved success in life, and who are willing to recognise publicly the role that luck has played in that. Our aim is to challenge the meritocratic myth, unpicking it from its centre outwards. We want to open up space for better conversations about what we need to do as a society to enable everyone to fulfil their ambitions in life, built on a recognition that giving a few people a helping hand isn’t going to cut it.

And once again, the drama at No 10 has absolutely nothing to do with usMon 17 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 08.30 ESTShareSorry, what just happened? Before we hurtle on to the next instalment of Labour government drama, let’s pause for a second to recap. So Keir Starmer’s allies briefed against Wes Streeting accusing him of plotting a leadership challenge, then Streeting denied the claims, and Starmer apologised for them, before belatedly claiming the briefinghad not comefrom Downing Street at all. Aclaim so implausible that agovernment source saidjournalists “must have all been tricked by several impostors posing as No 10 staff”.If this sounds farcical, vaguely embarrassing for all concerned and massively irrelevant to your life, you would be right. But in between the first chapter and the last (or perhaps the penultimate, given theaftershocks still reverberating through No 10), the episode acted as a masterclass in the patterns that define the stakes of British politics and characterise the stakeholders. It is also a portent of the future.First, crisis: a government and leader in a death spiral. Second, a high-drama episode centred on personnel, chiefs of staff and cabinet ministers. Third, the emergence of a leadership contender who starts to be described in salvationary terms. Fourth, back to the first. Sound familiar?Meanwhile, those involved are imbued by observers with a sense of cunning: once the briefings emerged, so did the game analysis. What’s the play? Is Morgan McSweeney, Downing Street’s chief of staff, the person rumoured to be behind it all, launching a preemptive move to flush out Starmer challengers? Is Starmer conspiring with him,or is he a hapless prince trapped in a high tower by his consiglieres? Is Streeting playing a blinder by keeping his cards close to his chest and cracking on with authoritative dismissal of the “nonsense” and the “toxic culture” in No 10? Here I must employ some restraint and not simply just type in capital letters: maybe there is no play? Have we learned nothing?Maybe this is simply a bunch of people motivated by paranoid office politics and, like all who work in high-pressure environments, act on impulse, based on age-old grudges? “Question is,” asked the Sunday Times Whitehall editor, “what intelligence, or, short of that, political analysis prompted the decision to flush out Streeting?” This is a good and normal question, but perhaps the obvious point, if no one can answer it, is that there is none? Perhaps an inner circle that has plotted and purged its way into power is simply under duress and defaulting to its safe space.You would think that the public descent of Dominic Cummings from the Mekon,master of the dark arts, to an addled angry poster ranting against “the NPC class” would have instilled some healthy scepticism regarding Downing Street svengalis. But here we are. And on that: no one is coming to save this government. Definitely not Streeting, who, like all whose fortunes start to rise as the polls start to tank, is little more than someone whose style and affectare more palatable than the incumbent’s. Which, when that incumbent is Starmer, isn’t hard. This is Rishi Sunak syndrome: a prime minister whose momentum was secured, as far as I can tell, by a single good speech which prompted the BBC to render him asSupermanin a hastilydeletedvideo. Streeting is in this honeymoon phase. His post-briefing performance has already beendescribedas a “masterclass” delivered with “great humour: streetwise: serious intent: and deadly”.We are now in phase three of proceedings, where a sort of defibrillator by way of describing someone into viability is powered up. Because let’s face it, can you cope with four more years of grim Labour decline amid the bewildering rise of Reform ghouls andchaotic leftwing partylaunches? The stabilisation of government, or at least the semblance of some sort of high action, provides a temporary reprieve and injects some possibility. The problem is that none of this has any connection whatsoever to the real world. Streeting, our new political behemoth, was voted back in on a dramatically slashed majority of just over 500 votes, and is leading an NHS reform process blasted as “chaotic and incoherent” by the Institute for Government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inspector Starmer is on the case | Marina HydeRead moreHe is the quintessential demonstration of the “wide but thin” 2024 Labour victory. If he (or anybody else, for that matter) were to become prime minister, the externally applied electric shock would not stop an eventual lapse into narcosis. Because the problem is this Labour government, in which Streeting is only a more compelling character with just as few ideas, competencies or materially defining projects. The tail of the briefing fiasco will be analyses that sharpen the difference between contenders and incumbents – Streeting’s new outspokenness onGazaandracism, for example – but these are all ultimately distinctions without a difference, as far as the direction of government is concerned.Or should I say lack of direction: a sort of general drift in which the party has made pragmatism the end, not the means. “Every day,” Streeting isreportedto have once told a shadow cabinet meeting, “we should drag a sacred cow of our party to the town market place and slaughter it until we are up to our knees in blood.” The electorate can see none of the material virtues of that under a government that presides over apersistentcost of living crisis andrisingfood prices,yet claims that it is “illegal immigration” that is “tearing our country apart”. Still, I’m sure that as people’s minds boggle at their grocery bill they can be comforted by the thought of an asylum seeker possibly beingstrippedof their valuables to pay for processing costs, and reassured by Streeting sounding like a really effective communicator on the Today programme because he “speaks plainly”andcan crack a Traitors joke.The government has entered its musical chairs era. The premise of this, we will be told is that the fish rots from the head down, and so the top must be replaced. The pattern will repeat, and each time it does events will stray further and further from the real world. This is a terminal symptom of failure. The moment a party turns on itself, when personalities replace politics, when sordid media briefings and grievances are litigated in public to poison an already dark public mood, it is a sure indication that the public have become bystanders to the endgame of a political drama that was always about power, not governance. It is the beginning of a final act that will go on for far too long, because, as with all patterns, history begins again every time. Reenactments of an end, never a new beginning.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 17 November 2025.

Why does the Met Office turn down my suggestions?Zoe Williams‘Wubbo’ has made it on to the list and so has ‘Dave’, but although I’ve tried a hundred times, including my kids’ names, I’ve had absolutely no luckMon 17 Nov 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.15 ESTShareThe UK’s most memorable stormoccurred in 1987, almost 30 years before storms got names, and will therefore always be known as “the one thatMichael Fish said definitely wouldn’t happen”. It was a devastating weather event, but if you were 14 and all the routes to school were blocked, yet the train to the cinema was unaccountably still running, and you went to see Hope and Glory – which, in a delicious twist of fate, was also about a kid who couldn’t go to school (although in his case because it had been destroyed in the blitz) – it was just about the best weather-related thing ever to happen. If I ever feel bad for Fish, who has a bunch of weather qualifications and yet saw his reputation defined by this one wrong call, it’s because I enjoyed that day so much that I feel I owe him.Ten years ago this month, the Met Office began naming storms with Abigail, which (who?) was unremarkable, unless you lived in the Outer Hebrides, where the schools closed and the power shut down, so nobody could even go to the cinema. That’s the thing about weather: it’s very unevenly distributed. There’s no way of getting those with the broadest shoulders to carry the heaviest weight. Storm Claudia, which has just passed, killed a woman in the Algarve and caused catastrophicflooding in south Wales, while everyone outside its path merely looked up, wondered whether it was named after Claudia Winkleman (it wasn’t – it was named by the Spanish meteorological agency), and went on with their day.There’s a purpose to the anthropomorphisations, though: it raises awareness, which means people can prepare, which ultimately saves lives, or so the weather people argue. We share our weather naming with Ireland and the Netherlands, while other European countries do their own but observe ours if it’s the same storm. Anyonecan suggest namesfor future storms. Some time between Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice, I told my son, who was then 14, that they were named alphabetically. “Dur,” he said. “Obviously they’re not alphabetical, because U does not come after D.” That’s when I realised that he didn’t know how to spell Eunice, or that Q, U, X, Y and Z were omitted from the name scheme, and he had a tendency towards incredibly strong opinions based on incomplete knowledge. I don’t know where he got that from. Those letters, incidentally, are left out because the World Meteorological Organization deems them too difficult to find names for, which is just rude.I’ve been suggesting names constantly. I must have done it a hundred times. It would just be so cool to be able to call your friend and say, hey, you know Storm Tim? It isnamed after you. I’ve never got one away. I’ve leaned heavily Irish to suck up toMet Éireann, Ireland’s national meteorological office. I’ve done Dutch versions of English names; I’ve suggested the names of all the kids, multiple times, and somehow “Wubbo” has made it on tothe 2025-26 rotation, while “Harper” has not. I grudgingly admire the fact that enough people went for “Dave”, rather than the posher, more weather-sounding David, that it will be our next winter storm, right after Chandra.The radical geographer Danny Dorling noted that Covid was a lot like a world war: if you were on the frontlines or you were bereaved, your experience of it was so different that, far from bringing the country together, these major disasters created invisible divisions at a vocabulary level, all of us using the same words to mean different things. Probably if your car is underwater, you’re not wild about the name Claudia. Probably when you’re affected in any real way by a storm, you would prefer them to be named after swearwords.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUK weatherOpinionMet OfficeExtreme weathercommentShareReuse this content"

But, with all their dark secrets, women’s handbags should remain shut ...Mon 17 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.07 ESTShareVogue aired a matter of public import last week, posing the question on all our lips: “Can Sarah Jessica Parker make the wide-open bag trend happen?” Pictures of the Fendi bag in question showed it shamelessly flaunting its purple sequinned lining for all the world to see. Apparently, it’s deliberate (the bag went down the catwalk like that, keep up) and part of a wider trend for gaping leather goods: “We saw similar styles at Loewe, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.”So, can she? Vogue says it’s “chic and insouciant”, while conceding it’s also “polarising”. But if anyone can make an unlikely trend happen, it’s SJP. She – or at least herCarrie Bradshaw alter ego– has already popularisedname necklaces,vast corsages,even vaster duvet coatsand “satin Maison Margiela Tabi Monster bow pumps” (Vogue again) for WFH – I’m wearing mine now, obvs. The JW Andersonpigeon handbagshe carried on And Just Like That sold out.Despite this, several entries to the “hell, no” column come to mind. First, this might work if your handbag contents are fit for public consumption – a Dries Van Noten lipstick and an esoteric Fitzcarraldo novel (the ones withchic blue minimalist covers), say – but most women’s aren’t. I’veinventoried my handbag here before, but I just glanced into its sordid depths and spotted such delights as a single foam earplug, four wooden forks, interdental brushes, nasal spray, plasters and an open sachet of Savoury Fibre Boost Seed Mix (I stand by this – it is invaluable both for human hunger pangs and attracting any discerning birds I might meet). Most handbags contain darker secrets than a confession booth.Second, I don’t know how things go in New York, where Parker lives, but in Old York, walking around with an open handbag would present a real danger, not of pickpockets, but of helpful people saying: “Excuse me love, your bag’s open.” I know this because my bag has a busted pocket, and it happens constantly, even though the only thing on show is more Savoury Fibre Boost Seed Mix. If only I could get my hands on a JW Anderson pigeon.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSarah Jessica ParkercommentShareReuse this content"

The insanity of a “deterrent” involving deportingfour peopleto Rwanda at a price of £700m is now giving way to ministers breaking more than 70 years of convention to offer not sanctuary but suspicion. If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what creates refugees, and how to respond to them.Parliament is gripped by fear that “asylum shopping” is widespread, that bearded men peruse policy documents before jumping into dinghies and heading for Great Yarmouth. Even those who recognise X is not a credible source from which to make asylum policy seem resigned to the idea that there are votes in treating all who ask for help as likely to abuse it. In response to a far-right challenge, this government is proposing to keep victims of torture or persecution in a perpetual limbo byonly offering them temporary sanctuary. If they wish to stay they will have to reapply for refugee status every two and a half years. Rather than being able to apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, they will have to wait 20.This is not just performatively cruel, it’s economically misjudged. There isscant evidencethat Denmark’s decision torefuse to grant longterm asylumto most has deterred anyone who would have chosen Denmark as a destination. It’s also clear that this policy would make refugees more costly to help – if you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or charity support. While in the UK migrants aremore likely to be in workthan UK natives, as of 2021 Denmark’s migrant and refugee employment rates were roughly20 percentage points lower– with all the resulting economic and social costs.Asylum accommodation costs in the UK have spiralled because ofdelays in processing– that is clearly unacceptable. So too would be spending money to reassess the same people expecting a different result. When we give someone protection from being persecuted in their home nation on the basis of their religion or sexuality, those who targeted them for these qualities rarely experience a change of heart. Civil wars are not short-term affairs, and in their aftermaths risk of harm is not eliminated at speed – our own travel advice tells younot to go to Syriabecause it is still exceptionally dangerous.In reality if this policy becomes law the UK will requireICE-style raidsto remove people – and their children. If a ceasefire is negotiated with Putin, will the nearly 250,000 Ukrainians who have come here over the past four years and counting be forced to “go home” or be deported without a second glance – regardless of the lives they may have built here now?That the number of people seeking refuge in the UKhas increasedin the past year reflects not a generosity of our system, but the chaos of our world. In the past 10 years multiple conflicts have driven people from their homes whether in Iran, Sudan, Eritrea or Afghanistan; autocrats rising to power have sought to imprison or murder their opponents and conscript young men. Creating a new hostile environment will do little to tackle these factors or the costs of managing asylum. Indeed, it is likely to increase them.It is time for common sense on asylum as well as compassion. Concerns about whether asylum seekers are “genuine” are best interrogated – and deportation enacted if required – when first deciding whether to accept someone into the country. If and when we give someone sanctuary, the progressive response should be to make integration easier and a priority – not leave them open to exploitation through uncertainty.It’s absolutely right to go after the gangmasters. We also need stronger joint approaches with other countries to safe routes, and to sharing data on those rejected. Collaboration could save thousands ofunaccompanied migrant childrennow in Europe from trafficking via family reunion. Ultimately, sharing responsibility for those in need of assistance, not shirking it, is the foundation for action. Because of reduced cooperation and data sharing, it’s clear leaving the EU has proven a far bigger problem for border control than the European convention on human rights.We must also disentangle immigration and asylum. Each requires more control over travel, not less, and recognising that people come to, and leave, the UK for different reasons. For example, it makes little sense to count students in the same category as refugees, when one group is mobile and the other vulnerable.The UK urgently needs a grownup conversation about the merits and quantities of different categories of visas and visitors, whether for marriage, humanitarian needs, care workers, high-value skills or research. That’s unlikely while our political discourse on all sides is steered by toxic tropes about foreigners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is disappointing to seeShabana Mahmoodsuccumb to that temptation. The home secretary’s flurry of proposals are designed to signal purpose, but constitute a wishlist of demands that her department can’t deliver. Currently, those fleeing persecution are given a five-year right to stay in the country and can apply for settled status after that. Ms Mahmood wants refugees to stay in the country initially only for a 30-month period, and then review their status to see whether they will be allowed to remain in the country for another 30 months. After two decades in Britain, they could apply to stay here permanently.Denmarkis held up as the model. A decade ago a centre-left government there was under pressure, with a surging populist right and immigration dominating voters’ concerns. Danish Social Democrats claimed that getting tough on refugees helped them win the election. However, the reality was messier. Copenhagen stripped Syrians of protection, yet could not remove them, leaving people stuck in “deportation centres”, unable to work or live normally. Theresultwas a permanently marginalised population in enforced limbo.The British government now proposes to repeat this error, only at vastly greater scale. Ms Mahmood’s Home Office aims to reassess tens of thousands of refugees every two and a half years. With around100,000 asylum claims annually– and many from countries that have a high grant rate – the system would soon need to conduct around70,000reviews each year. The Refugee Council says that the Home Office would need to review the status of1.4 million peopleby 2035 at a cost of £872m. Yet this is the same state that cannot currently process the 50,000 appeals already in the queue, where waits hover around a year andtribunal judgesare in short supply. Building a new bureaucracy to adjudicate applicants’ status is not bold politics, but magical thinking.Ms Mahmood indicates that she wants to change the European convention on human rights, not abandon it. It is the Conservatives and Reform UK that talk of going it alone. But meaningful change cannot be madeunilaterally. Any solo attempt would be self-defeating, risking Northern Ireland’speaceand undermining the post-Brexit deal with the EU.Labour could achieve something substantial that voters care about and close the asylum hotels. Not by2029, but by next year. TheRefugee Councilsays the maths is simple: 40% of hotel residents come from five countries – Sudan, Eritrea, Iran, Afghanistan and Syria – from where between 60% and 98% are granted asylum. A one-off scheme to give permission to stay for a limited period, subject to security checks, would empty hotels rapidly.Rishi Sunakdid just this 2023. There would be no need to engage with a damaging arms race with the far right, which would see Labour lose progressive support. It would, however, solve the single asylum-related issue that the public cares most about.In post-Brexit politics, it’s hard to see how oneout-Farages Nigel Farage. Yet that is what the Labour government is attempting to do. Copying Reform UK’s cruelty on asylum lets Mr Farage own the issue, outbid Labour and drive the debate rightward at no cost. Worse, Labour increases the salience of an issue that it cannot solve on its own – and gifts rightwingers the advantage, while setting itself up to look cruel and incompetent.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But old economic orthodoxies are not the answerMon 17 Nov 2025 13.47 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 15.27 ESTShareLast March, following angst-ridden months as Europe came to terms with Donald Trump’s return to the White House, financial markets in Paris, Milan and Berlin were gripped by asurgeof optimism. The cause was a historic deal brokered by Friedrich Merz, then Germany’s chancellor-elect, which loosened constitutional spending constraints in the EU’s powerhouse nation. Here at last, it was hoped, was the fiscal kickstart required to end a prolonged period of economic stagnation, and mitigate geopolitical headwinds blowing from the US and China.Six months into Mr Merz’s premiership, the angst is back and there are the first murmurings of rebellion. The chancellor’s plan included “whatever it takes” levels of defence spending, designed to prepare Germany for a changed era in which the US was no longer a dependable ally, and a huge €500bn investment in infrastructure and the green transition. But last week, the chancellor’s team of economic advisersdowngradedgrowth forecasts for 2026 to below 1%. And ahead of what would constitute a fourth year of near-flatlining, businessconfidencehas slumped.Lifting Germany’s “debt brake” was never going to be an instant panacea for longstanding problems. Patience will be required, for example, before the full impact of spending on the country’s ailing transport systems is felt. But across Europe, patience is a virtue that’s in short supply among voters, whofeelthat their living standards have been stagnating – or worse – since the crash of 2008. According to one recent survey, fewer than one in five Germanswishto see Mr Merz standing again at the next federal election.As the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party tops thepolls, such disillusionment is a problem not just for the chancellor and his centre-right-led coalition government, but for mainstream politics as a whole. Germany has found itself at the sharp end of a wider geopoliticalstorm: Russia’s war in Ukraine, aggressive Chinese competition and Mr Trump’s trade wars have all combined to undermine an export-led model that underpinned European prosperity. Mr Merz was right to recognise that the exceptional times required a bold and imaginative fiscal response. But as discontent grows, he is already under pressure from critics to rein in social spending in the hope of increasing the country’s competitiveness.For a chancellor who once served on the supervisory board of Black Rock and forged a political reputation as a fiscal hawk, that would be a kind of reversion to type. Mr Merz’s Social Democratic coalition partners would attempt to see off a threatenedrevoltby Christian Democrat MPs over a proposed pensions package. But the siren calls from familiar quarters on the right should be resisted more generally.For Germany – and for Europe as a whole – the imperatives of the age are to revive a battered and bruised social model, and to turbocharge investment as the global economy is shaped to suit a multipolar world. Falling back on the failed economic orthodoxies of a previous era would only be to further empower the far right, whichbeganits gradual ascent during the austerity years that followed the crash.Mr Merz has had a difficult first six months in office. But as the scale of the challenges facing Europe’s most important economy becomes ever clearer,Germanycannot afford to go back to the future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While the majority reported no particular bias on the BBC,the numbers seeing pro-Tory biaswere significantly higher than those seeing bias in favour of any other party in every year except one: in 1997, the year Labour won office, those seeing pro-Tory bias declined substantially, from 26% in 1996 to 6%; those seeing pro-Labour bias rose somewhat, from 6% to 8%.Of course, perceptions of bias don’t prove that programmes are biased – which is precisely why any serious claims of political bias will be accompanied by strong evidence. The question as to whether BBC coverage is biased has been addressed by rigorous and systematic content analyses. For example,a 2013 studyconducted at Cardiff Universityfound thatthe BBC tends to reproduce “a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world, not a left-wing, anti-business agenda”.Judgmental assertions of bias – however vehemently expressed – should not supplant careful analyses of evidence.Prof Peter AytonCentre for Decision Research, Leeds University Business SchoolWhen Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, asserted that the BBC is “100% fake news”, did she realise that the BBC reported that Trump was re-elected in 2024? So either he wasn’t or the 100% statement is false. The BBC should countersue Trump for up to $6bn for this calumny. Unlike Trump, the BBC has a good reputation to lose.Peter WilliamsStockport, Greater ManchesterThe BBC is now in the middle of a whirlpool of controversy. One way to dispel concerns, and go a long way to appeaseDonald Trump, would be to broadcast his January 6 speech in full. I’m sure viewers would be able to make their own minds up about how perfect a speech it actually was.Richard EvansWinchesterFirst, theBBCshould sack those immediately responsible for the conflation of the clips of Donald Trump’s speech. Second, it should offer a gold-plated baby rattle as full and final settlement – better make it a very robust rattle as it is likely to make many trips out of the presidential pram.David BellHarrow, LondonWould an invitation to President Trump to make a third state visit to the UK be sufficient for him to drop his case against the BBC?Sam WhiteLewes, East SussexIf the BBC doesn’t stand up to Donald Trump in court I will never pay my licence fee again.

That doesn’t mean we taxpayers won’t be hit elsewhere in the budget, though, including the possibility of stealth taxes through changes to thresholds.But there is another option – one that is fair, popular with the public and supported by a significant number of Labour MPs: a wealth tax. Introducing a 2% tax on assets above £10m would raise up to £25bn annually to invest in health, housing, education and infrastructure. Polling shows that the idea is consistently popular with the public, and the people most likely to pay the tax, millionaires, alsosupportthe idea.Taxpayers Against Povertycampaignsto reduce poverty and inequality through practical and fair economic policies. We believe that one of the clearest ways to do this is by modernising the tax system so that wealth is taxed more and income is taxed less.More than 50 MPs have now signed early day motion1725,which calls for the government to consider proposals for a fair wealth tax ahead of the budget. Privately, many more Labour MPs have been telling us that they support a wealth tax, but don’t feel able to add their name publicly, due to party diktats.The government seems intent on preventing open discussion of the merits of a fair wealth tax despite its popularity among the public and its own MPs. By doing so, it is missing an opportunity to genuinely reform the UK’s outdated tax system – reform that would see excessive wealth accumulated by the few, but created by us all, reinvested to reduce poverty and inequality, and boost economic growth.Tom BurgessChief executive, Taxpayers Against PovertyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Nobody would wish any child to be refused access and support for any number of occupations. But we surely have to ask, as successive governments have not, why a focus on this aspiration obscures the much more socially radical and equitable aim of making all occupations viable, rewarded and respected.Surely there is already sufficient cut-throat competition within the English class system without enshrining ideas which focus on diminishing the value of jobs and occupations to be “escaped” from.Our present politics, and its politicians, so obviously reflect an increasingly narrow experience of, and perspective about, the social world. This has dire implications.To further this by refusing to consider those very values which produce a sense of failure and exclusion in children who do not meet the demands of that worldview results in lessening both social equality and mutual social respect.Mary EvansPatrixbourne, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Now, with this hot-ticket Ashes series a few days from setting off in sun‑drenched Perth, the mix of fear and excitement among them has arguably never been greater.The difference being that rollercoasters tend to stay on the rails, whereas England tours of Australia often career off them. No one is quite certain which way this one will play out, other than a broad agreement thatPat CumminsandJosh Hazlewood missing the first Test(at least) presents Ben Stokes and his tourists a golden opportunity.Australia target Joe Root as the England batter to ‘take down’ on eve of AshesRead moreNot that many locals are tipping England. The former Australia spinner Steve O’Keefe is an outlier, fancying the hosts will get “dusted” by a 3-2 scoreline – an “unthinkable call”, as per one headline. According to Jim Maxwell, the ABC’s veteran commentator: “A lot of Aussies are getting sick of crap English teams turning up here.”If he is honest, Stokes will know deep down that his men should probably be defending the Ashes rather than the tougher challenge of trying to win them back. Not because ofthe biblical rain in Manchestertwo years ago – telling though it was – but the almost performatively loose way they began that drawn series.

As it is, with a recent record against their fellow “Big Three” nations that reads 15 Tests, five wins, eight defeats and zero series victories, the verdict here seems to be of a side that is lacking in substance and a bit too pleased with itself.View image in fullscreenEngland’s last Ashes campaign in 2021-22 under Joe Root was a bleak affair during the Covid pandemic.Photograph: Jason O’Brien/PAThis is the tour to change that perception; to compete in a manner that earns Australia’s respect. The combination of Perth’s bounce and a day-nighter in Brisbane makes for a tough start that could easily set England on a familiar course. But one thing that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that this is a different side by way of outlook and approach.The genesis of this came in the 4-0 defeat four years ago. A bleak trip, England were mentally dragged down by pandemic restrictions off the field and, with a Heath Robinson batting lineup and largely fast-medium attack, destroyed on it. Ashley Giles, director of England men’s cricket at the time,insisted that mass sackings would solve little, with the domestic game “setting up future leaders for failure”.But while yet to claim a defining series victory – away wins in Pakistan and New Zealand notwithstanding – Stokes and McCullum have largely undermined that prediction thus far. A win/loss rate of 25 to 14 since (shaved to 22:12 when Stokes has been on the park) represents a significant uptick from the final run of one win in 17 that led toChris Silverwood being ousted as head coachandJoe Root stepping down as captain.Mind guru Gilbert Enoka: ‘England are about to go to war, and I want to be in the trench with them’Read moreThat view on the county game’s shortcomings may be shared to a degree, attributes now trumping output in selection. But the broader diagnosis from Giles’s replacement, Key, differed. There was not, he believed, a shortfall in talent, rather a collective buildup of negativity that was stifling players. With an instinctive, aggressive new captain in Stokes, he wanted a head coach who would breathe weapons‑grade positivity through the squad. Hence, McCullum.The first year of the project was built chiefly on three elements: expanding the minds of England’s batters to discover the true limits of what was possible; backing them to do so with longer rope selection‑wise; and wringing the last drops of magic out of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson. Stokes, who had taken time out a year earlier for mental health reasons, also brought fresh thinking on the field.The gear shift was palpable, England racing along at a pioneering rate of 4.76 runs per over, reeling in four successive 250-plus run chases, and winning 10 of their first 12 under the new regime. The fast bowlers had less time to put their feet up, but a far broader canvas on which to paint 20 wickets, evidenced bya remarkable win in Rawalpindiin late 2022 – the start of a historic 3-0 sweep – on a pitch that was sleepier than Princess Aurora.There were signs, however, that it might have been going to their heads,a one-run defeat in New Zealandthat winter only the fourth time a side has lost after enforcing the follow-on. Until they kicked into gear midway through the Ashes the following summer, they were trying too hard to show how relaxed they were: preparing with a golf trip to Scotland,declaring on the opening day at Edgbastonandtossing away wickets at Lord’sdespiteNathan Lyon’s injury. Stokes eschewing overdue knee surgery the previous winter was another misstep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The debate over Bairstow or Ben Foakes was ended for good, both men dropped in favour of the emerging talent of Jamie Smith, while the bowling attack was deemed in need of a revamp.Ollie Robinson was viewed as too feckless – stellar numbers trumped by fitness problems – while Jack Leach made way for Shoaib Bashir. The most controversial call wastelling Anderson to retire. Not that the figures in his final year, 19 wickets at 43, or his age, about to turn 42, should have made it so. McCullum simply craved more pace and younger legs, while Bashir’s over-spin and bounce was deemed likelier to succeed in Australia (a belief that may be starting to wobble as the starting line approaches).Ashes 2025-26: player-by-player guide to England and Australia squadsRead moreResults since have been up and down: West Indies and Sri Lanka were dealt with comfortably at home, before a 2-1 defeat in Pakistan – their second series loss – and a 2-1 win in New Zealand. The 2-2 draw with India this year was the one that got away, getting to within 73 runs of knocking off 374 at the Oval, three wickets down, only for a collapse against a swinging older ball meant they lost by six.But there have been promising signs:the emergence of Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse, and Jofra Archer’s return after his injury ordeal. Ben Duckett has become the leading opener in Test cricket – or at least partner to Yashasvi Jaiswal in a fantasy World XI. Smith has looked to the manner born, while Root and Harry Brook have been otherworldly. The return of Stokes as a genuine all-rounder is arguably the biggest plus of all.As well as lampooning some of their more outlandish comments, or that needlesslypetulant end to the Old Trafford Testin July, critics point to their need for flat pitches. This has some merit, not least their difficulties on spinning tracks. As Duckett recently admitted, they are trying to become more nuanced. But it also ignores wins on spicy surfaces such asHeadingley in 2023orWellington last winter, whenBrook struck a spellbinding centuryon a greentop with 15 wickets falling on the first day.There are no guarantees in a harsh country like Australia but, for the first time since the win in 2010-11, England have arrived with a clearly defined identity, some genuine fast bowlers and optimism, not fatalism. Time, as Key would put it, to buckle up once more.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it in the stars?Ewan MurrayMon 17 Nov 2025 15.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 16.08 ESTShareWounding events in modern history mean Scotland can not be a football country that expects. It is, however, one on tenterhooks as the prospect of long‑awaitedWorld Cupqualification looms so large.On paper, the task is simple: beatDenmarkat Hampden Park on Tuesday and the Scots will take a place in next summer’s tournament. It is the significance of progress that matters far more than the fact the Danes are ranked 18 places higher in the world.Ireland’s big moment is what World Cup qualifying is all aboutRead moreScotland have not played in the World Cup since 1998. You must go back to 1989 for the last time they qualified for anything in front of a Hampden audience. This ranks as a game for the ages. Potentially.The testimony of Andy Robertson is fascinating in this context. The Liverpool full-back and Scotland captain knows a thing or two about marquee achievement. He has 89 caps. What would leading his country to a World Cup mean? “I don’t like thinking about it and that’s the honest answer,” he said. “I’m excited and looking forward to a one-game shootout for the World Cup. If it happens, I’ll tell you how I feel about it.”There is a danger Scotland could get swallowed up by a wave of emotion. Denmark, serial tournament participants, will surely be poised to take advantage in that circumstance.“The players have got a job to do,” said Scotland’s manager, Steve Clarke. “If they are not nervous or excited by the challenge ahead then they wouldn’t be at this level. They understand the magnitude of the game and what it means, but they just have to prepare for a game of football and make sure they are focused on how we want to play it. They have to be focused on what Denmark might do. That’s our job as a coaching staff, to give them an idea.“When they cross the white line, they have to go out and play. And if they go out and play like they can play, then I believe they are good enough to get the result we need.”There is a rising sense that fate has decided Scotland must win Group C. They have been – depending on your outlook – unconvincing or lucky in chunks of this campaign.Scotland scraped past Belaruslast month. Yet here they are, 90 minutes from glory.View image in fullscreenScotland’s head coach, Steve Clarke, says the players ‘understand the magnitude of the game’.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThe scenario owes everything to Denmark’s failure to beat Belarus on Saturday. Had Denmark prevailed in Copenhagen,Scotland’s defeat in Greecewould have consigned them to a playoff berth.“It is dangerous territory, I don’t believe in that,” Robertson said in respect of what might be written in the stars. “While not defending our performance what Saturday did show was that Belarus are a very good team.“We probably got the toughest pot-four team in the whole qualifiers. Belarus were no mugs, they were an extremely difficult team to play against and they showed that at Hampden and again away to the pot-one team.“There was huge frustration after that game in terms of the reaction from you guys, from the fans, from ourselves. Points are points and we managed to get three on the board. A lot has been said in this campaign, some negativity at times and maybe some justified, but we are sitting here with 10 points. We are one point behind first place and we know we are 90 minutes away from the World Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With his tenure expected to end whenever Scottish involvement in the World Cup does, the 62‑year‑old may go out on the ultimate high. “These players are already very, very high in the ranking of what we’ve done as a country,” he said. “When I took the job six and a half years ago, a lot of people were telling me not to touch it. That it was a poisoned chalice, that you can not do this.Troy Parrott’s on fire and England complete perfect campaign – Football WeeklyRead more“I looked at the group of players and I said I could see some quality there and I could see a group who I’d look forward to working with. I said that because I felt we could achieve good things. We have managed to do that and now we have another very, very good thing we can achieve together.”Despite the 3-2 defeat, Scotland’s attacking play in Athens was excellent in spells. Scott McTominay’s influential second half provides particular hope.Denmark arrived in Glasgow minus only the San Diego forward Anders Dreyer afterthe sickness bugthat disrupted their start to this international window. Rasmus Højlund, who was forced to sit out the Belarus tie, has returned to rude health and is expected to play. The visiting head coach, Brian Riemer, denied despondency from the 2-2 draw with Belarus may linger.“What happened in the first game, what happened in the second game and fifth game is completely irrelevant at this stage,” he said. “To sit in the changing room, not having secured the ticket for the World Cup because we were having a hangover from a Belarus game … I don’t think that’s possible with top professional footballers. I don’t think you see any teams go through a season, whether it’s club football or international football, without bumps.”Scotland have endured almost 30 years of them.Explore more on these topicsScotlandDenmarkWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Beating Dubois resulted in Usyk becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time, but he elected for his spell to be short-lived.The WBO later confirmed Wardley’s elevation to “full champion status”. Frank Warren, the 30-year-old’s promoter, wrote on X: “Britain has a new heavyweight world champion and a new star of the sport.“One of the most incredible stories I’ve seen in my 45 years as a promoter and I could not be prouder of Fabio Wardley. Some huge fights ahead for 2026 as he defends his WBO belt and creates a true legacy in the sport.”Wardley started his career in white-collar boxing before turning professional in 2017 and racking up 17 straight wins. After a split-decision draw against Frazer Clarke in March 2024,he beat Clarke in one roundseven months later and subsequently came from behind to stop Justis Huni and earn his shot at Parker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not feel incongruous for the head coach to talk about perfection – partly because he is constantly chasing it and also because, well, the results have been perfect.When Tuchel’s teamdefeated Albania 2-0 in Tiranaon Sunday, it meant they topped their group with eight wins out of eight and with eight clean sheets. Never before has a European nation gone through World Cup qualification, playing at least six ties, without conceding. Spain will emulate them if they beat Turkey at home and keep a clean sheet in their sixth and final qualifier on Tuesday night. The only thing is that Tuchel knows perfection is unattainable – particularly in international football.Troy Parrott’s on fire and England complete perfect campaign – Football WeeklyRead moreThere have been many lessons for the German as he has lived his managerial crash course at this level, having officially started the job – his first in charge of a national team – in January. But perhaps the one that has guided him, certainly this season, is that he must not obsess over every tiny detail being just right; his gameplan cannot be a complex and beautiful mosaic.Compromises must be made. Call them shortcuts; more attainable wins in the time available. They include smartness on set pieces, the nurturing of an all-for-one spirit, a ferocious desire to run and work. Tuchel’s assistant, Anthony Barry,made the point this monththat “in international football, you will never create a team that can play the way the Barcelona of old did or the recent Manchester City”. Tuchel has warmed strongly to the theme.“I have to accept and we have to accept as a staff that not everything can be perfect,” he says. “Because we have sometimes only one and a half training sessions to prepare matches. The players have to accept it, too. The level of detail cannot always be right.“But the commitment to accept mistakes, the commitment after ball losses … to put the head down, to just run, run it off, this has been outstanding through the last camps. I think you can feel it. This is what I talked about [at the start] and I hope that somehow we make it so that you watch this team and you feel like: ‘Wow. They really mean it.’”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel has praised England for their ‘commitment to accept mistakes’.Photograph: Francesco Scaccianoce/Uefa/Getty ImagesTuchel was asked whether one of the biggest problems withEnglandwas that people expected perfection. There is surely something in this. The game in Tirana was not perfect and, had it finished at about the 60th minute, there would doubtless have been a fair bit of moaning. It was 0-0 and England had failed to open up Albania. The dynamism was missing.The good news was that England found extra gears. They started to create chances. Tuchel’s substitutions were positive; they made an impact. England had signposted the breakthrough goal before Harry Kane scored it on a set piece. The captain would score again and, if all was well that ended well, England’s conviction in what they are doing under Tuchel coming to the fore, perhaps there was a lesson to be taken in the values of patience and perspective. “I am the first one [who wants perfection] and that does not exist,” Tuchel says. “It never exists, especially not in international camps. So the focus is on how we are with each other, how do players buy in, how is the commitment?”England’s progress through the autumn has been built on clarity, Tuchel streamlining things, trying to simplify them. His most eye‑catching move has beento define the formation with a 6, an 8 and a 10 in midfield, plus specialist wingers. And to tell every player where he sees them playing. No square pegs in round holes, which can be seen as a break from the past. The hierarchies in each position are part of the direction of travel.That is not to say Tuchel is inflexible, particularly during games. In Tirana he switched to 4-1-4-1 when he introduced Phil Foden, playing him as one of two central attacking midfielders with Jude Bellingham. At the start of the game, he had John Stones step into midfield from central defence and England built in a 3-2-4-1.Tuchel has pushed an identity to reflect the Premier League; he wants the players to feel reassured, liberated. That means athleticism, physicality, an aggressive tempo. The tweaks to combat the heat of North America next summer can be bolted on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tino Livramento will return to the reckoning when he recovers from injury.View image in fullscreenNico O’Reilly is one of several options at left-back, a position which poses a conundrum for England.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoWill it be Ezri Konsa or Marc Guéhi alongside Stones in central defence? Marcus Rashford or Anthony Gordon on the left wing? Then, there is the No 10 position and Bellingham,whose frustrated reaction to being substituted late on in Tiranawas the last thing Tuchel needed.It went against everything he has tried to instil.Bellingham had been restored to the starting XI and he was determined to impress; it was almost as if he was trying too hard during a performance that mixed the good and bad before finishing with the ugly. Bellingham is capable of game‑defining flashes and therein lies his magic. Does Tuchel want more than a spectacular‑moments player in a position critical to his counter-press?England have been here before. When they qualified for Euro 2016 under Roy Hodgson, they did so with 10 wins out of 10 – and everybody remembers how that tournament ended. The low quality of the opposition that Tuchel’s team have faced cannot be overlooked and he will be aware of the German saying about how a good horse only jumps as high as it has to.Tuchel and his coaching staff may prefer to look at it another way. The qualification campaign has allowed them to focus mainly on what they do, building on their terms, generating momentum and confidence. When the players were stretched and had to deliver against Serbia in Belgrade in September, they did,winning 5-0to locate an ignition point. Tuchel believes they will do so again.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.Anthony Joshua will ‘break internet over Jake Paul’s face’ as fight is confirmedRead morePaul is a brilliant hustler and, until now, he has chosen his opponents with deliberate care to avoid excessive danger. His most obviously successful stunt was toentice a 58-year-old Mike Tysoninto the ring last November. It turned out to be the biggest “fight” of 2024, but it was an inevitable charade as Tyson was a shell of the great he had once been. Years of self-abuse, allied to severe depression, a stomach ulcer, a bad knee and acute sciatica, meant Tyson shuffled around the ring and took the odd punch for an astronomical purse.Joshua is 36 and he has kept a notably low profile since his crushingdefeat by Daniel Dubois 14 months ago. His gaze had appeared fixed on a wildly lucrative showdown with Tyson Fury – who lost his past two fights against Oleksandr Usyk.Last Saturday, beforeConor Benn outboxed Chris Eubank Jr, Turki al-Sheikh, the chair of the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority and the man who controls world boxing at its highest level, told 60,000 people at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that he would put on two massive fights next year. He smiled knowingly when asked if the two-fight deal for Fury-Joshua had been sealed.Eddie Hearn, the promoter, had said Joshua was planning a tune-up against a journeyman in preparation for Fury. But the offer of a crazy amount of money to meet Paul has taken precedence and will serve as a gentle hit before the real business begins.View image in fullscreenJake Paul (right) beat the 58-year-old Mike Tyson last November.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images for Netflix © 2024Joshua, like Fury, is well past his prime, but he stays in terrific shape and has fought at the peak of the heavyweight division for the past 10 years. He also hits very hard and, should he wish to make some kind of statement about the gulf between genuine fighters and YouTube “disruptors”, he could really hurt Paul.The suspicion remains that this will turn out to be a more controlled arrangement with Joshua choosing to avoid causing much damage to the man who is going to make him tens of millions of dollars. That gut reaction is confirmed by the fact that their contest has been limited to eight rounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark my words, you’ll see a lot more fighters take these opportunities in the future. I’m about to break the internet over Jake Paul’s face.”Paul responded with his customary swagger: “This isn’t an AI simulation. This is Judgment Day. When I beatAnthony Joshua, every doubt disappears and no one can deny me the opportunity to fight for a world title. To all my haters, this is what you wanted.”That last line was a clear acknowledgment that if a proper fight breaks out it would be a shock if Joshua did not knock out Paul. After all, in his modest résumé of 13 professional “fights”, Paul has faced only one relatively competent contemporary boxer. But Tommy Fury is not really a boxer at all andhe still beat Paulin a cruiserweight bout in 2023.Paul has since stuck to his usual diet of mock fisticuffs and, as a heavyweight, he was meant to meet Gervonta Davis, a gifted, but troubled world lightweight champion, in a bizarre exhibition this month. But itwas cancelledafter a lawsuit, citing domestic abuse,was filed against Davisby his ex-girlfriend.

Lawrence played a major role in thewin against the All Blackson Satur­day, but limped off in the ­closing stages and could be forced to sit out the game at Twickenham. The 26-year-old centre will be assessed when England reconvene on Tuesday after an extra day off.England may also be without ­Freddie Steward, who was withdrawn midway through the first half against New Zealand with a head injury, as they prepare for 11th ­successive win and a clean sweep of their autumn fixtures.England to launch first Nations Championship campaign with visit to South AfricaRead moreLawrence was in fine form against the All Blacks, scoring England’s opening try before teeing up his ­centre partner, Fraser Dingwall, in the second half. He was seen ­hobbling in the closing stages and was replaced by ­Chandler ­Cunningham-South in the 79th minute with flanker Henry Pollock shifting to the backline.Lawrence missed the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia last ­summer with a long-term achilles injury but battled back to action ahead of schedule. While he was omitted from theside that defeated Australiaat the start of the month, he has impressed against Fiji and New Zealand.Against the Wallabies, Tommy Freeman, a winger by trade, started at outside-centre having explained at the start of the season that he sees his long-term position in midfield. He is out with a hamstring injury, however, and is not available to face Argentina.Elliot Daly is fit again and would come into contention for the No 13 jersey if Lawrence is unavailable to face the Pumas, who showed their class withthe win against Scotlandon Sunday, but he does not offer the same ball-carrying threat. Daly could also come in at full-back if Steward is ruled out while Max Ojomoh would be another centre option. Steve Borthwick could even roll the dice and start Ben Earl or Pollock in the backline.There is no doubting, however, that Borthwick, who is also without Ollie Chessum (foot injury) will be hoping Lawrence recovers in time. All the more so because his partnership with Dingwall blossomed against the All Blacks and gave rise to optimism he has finally unearthed a centre combination to take England into the next World Cup.Quick GuideScotland's Darge reveals 'quiet changing room' after slump against PumasShowRory Darge admitted he is perplexed at how Scotland allowed themselves to unravel so spectacularly inSunday’s dire defeat by Argentina.Scotland looked to be cruising to victory as they led 21-0 midway through the third quarter, but the Pumas hit back with five tries in the closing 24 minutes to claim a remarkable 33-24 win.The nature of the capitulation – met with booing from sections of the capacity Murrayfield crowd – has brought fresh focus on the position of the long-serving head coach, Gregor Townsend.“It was a quiet changing room afterwards,” said the vice-captain Darge. “21-0 up and it felt that way, we felt like we were on top. It was a massive momentum swing and we struggled to stem the flow. The guys on the pitch are the ones that have to do better. “Asked how a match could turn so dramatically, Darge said: “It’s not good enough. Watching it back, I’m sure there will be loads in there from 21-0 onwards that we can do so much better.”Darge felt Scotland picked up where they left off in the second half of their spirited 25-17 defeat by New Zealand the previous week as they bossed the Pumas for the first 50 minutes. However, the Glasgow back row acknowledged his side became flustered when the visitors started finding their way back into the game and admits that they need to remain far more clear-headed when faced with adversity.“We’re constantly looking at ways to get better and I think we had a massive carry-over from last week in what worked for us,” said Darge. “21-0 up, putting them under stress and on top from an attack point of view, from a defence point of view, set piece. Obviously, what we need to look at is how we keep our composure in that last 30 minutes when we’re so far ahead.“Maybe a bit of an understanding of what Test match rugby is like from us in those moments. You have to be ruthless, particularly against a team as good as Argentina. If you’re not, they can score tries. We just weren’t good enough in that last half hour.\"Attention now turns to their Autumn Nations Series game against Tonga on Sunday. “We need to watch the game back and let it hurt over the next wee while and during the reviews and then quickly the mindset will flip on to Tonga,” Darge said.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Dingwall, who produced his best performance in an England jersey, was full of praise for his midfield partner. “I just feel lucky I’m able to play alongside someone as talented as that,” he said. “He can do some unbelievable things, he can open a little bit of space for me as well which we saw. Centre partnerships always take a little bit of time to develop and you work out how you can complement each other.“Fortunately we’ve known each other for a long time, we played some age group stuff together. To build, this has been the first time we’ve had a bit of run together which has been nice. He’s a bit bigger than me and can do some of the power work and hopefully I can do some of the bits to put him in space as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England have managed to win four consecutive November Tests on one occasion – Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016 – but can repeat the trick with victory on Sunday.“It’s incredibly important,” said Dingwall. “We don’t want to be a team that peaks and has one brilliant performance or has a massive spike. If you want to truly be the team that we want to be, you’ve got to do it every single week. So I’ve got no questions about how the group is going to turn up with the same attitude to get better.“Review the game honestly, take the learnings, take the positives but once again it’s about attacking another week.

Lisa Benn, 34, claims she was harassed and unfairly lost her position as an international referee after raising a complaint.The Women’s Super League official had complained that she was manhandled on a pitch in 2023 by Steve Child, a Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) coach and former Premier League assistant referee.Rushden & Diamonds’ match abandoned after alleged sexist abuse towards refereeRead moreGiving evidence to a south London employment tribunal on Monday, she alleged Child also told her “your card has been marked”. A PGMO investigation found Child’s behaviour did not meet the threshold for disciplinary action.Benn alleges that the organisation’s chief refereeing officer, Howard Webb, and his wife, Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, who was then its head of women’s referees, said she would not be punished for coming forward. However, she wrote in her witness statement that, after her complaint, PGMO did not recommend her as highly as they had previously done. Benn claimed that this cost her a prestigious place on Fifa’s international referee list.A PGMO-organised tournament took place to train staff on VAR, which was not yet used in the women’s game, on 29 March 2023. The schedule was delayed by a serious injury and Benn said that Child adopted a leadership role but “was flustered, he was stressed, he was charging around all over the place”.Benn alleges that the coach grabbed her arm and “forcefully pushed” her on to the pitch. She accepted that Child said “something along the lines of ‘come on let’s go’” to speed up the start of the game, and said she responded by putting her palm up and telling him to “chill”.Jesse Crozier, for PGMO, put to her: “In saying ‘come on let’s go’, he would have put his arm behind you and ushered you on to the pitch at the same time.”Benn rejected the claim, saying: “That is definitely not what happened.”The “temperature was high” during the match and Child instructed a fourth official, Ruby Sykes, to tell Benn to “kill the game”, the tribunal heard. This prompted Benn to say “don’t tell me how to referee” and “fuck off”, which was directed at Child but spoken through a communications system to Sykes, the panel was told.Benn said: “I’ve never had somebody shout down the comms to tell me how to referee – I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level, this was an under-19s game.”She said: “He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play – he would never have done that to a male referee.”Crozier put to her: “You appear to take umbrage at the refereeing coach giving you coaching directions while you were refereeing.”Benn said: “It was a distraction because, as you mentioned, the game was difficult, the game was challenging – there was a lot going on in the game that required my attention.”Benn said she was also adjusting to “new VAR principles” that were unfamiliar to her. She became emotional as she later told the panel: “He made me feel inferior, as a referee and as a human being, and that’s not OK.”Asked if she had seen him act in that way to other referees, she said: “I have to female referees, yes. I haven’t to male referees.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The official said there was a “mass brawl” at the end of the game triggered by one player head-butting another.She said Child then grabbed her arm and told her “your card has been marked” and “you’re bloody-minded”. She added: “He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head.”Benn accepted that in response she “shouted ‘what is your problem?’ in his direction. “He didn’t turn around, he just walked off,” she said.Crozier put to her: “If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it.”She said there would have been video recordings of the event but she has not seen any. The barrister said that such an incident “would have been noticed, would it not?” She said: “No, I disagree.”The tribunal continues.Explore more on these topicsRefereesWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Liverpool’s defence held firm and the Reds levelled in the 33rd minute and held out until half-time. The Chelsea manager, Sonia Bompastor, introduced further attacking options in the second half, including Lauren James and Aggie Beever-Jones, but a solid defensive display from Liverpool ensured Chelsea were unable to find a winner as the hosts earned their second point of the season. Although the result did mean Chelsea set a record of 34 successive unbeaten WSL games, clearly all is not well with the defending champions. Last season they had 27 points after nine games and led the way, this campaign they have eight fewer and are three points behind Manchester City.Réshma RaoView image in fullscreenBeata Olsson scores Liverpool’s equaliser in the draw with Chelsea.Photograph: Nick Taylor/LiFC/Getty ImagesMiedema’s quality shines brightWith 79 minutes on the clock and Manchester City 3-0 up, Vivianne Miedema would have been forgiven for taking her foot off the gas. However, this is not the Dutch player’s mindset and she produced a quintessential moment of quality. Winning possession with a perfectly timed sliding challenge on Julia Zigiotti Olme, she got to her feet to unleash a cutting through ball for Bunny Shaw. It was a move that summed up the 29-year-old’s rich vein of form as she pulled the strings in behind the Jamaican forward. When Miedema signed for City, many wondered how she and Shaw could play in the same team but both are showing exactly what they can achieve together when fully fit. Miedema created the most chances (four) against Manchester United on Saturday while having opportunities of her own and was unlucky to have been denied a goal by the woodwork.Sophie DowneyCan Arsenal find a way out of their slump?There are concerns for Arsenal after back-to-back draws in the WSL and relinquishing a 2-0 leadagainst Bayern Munich on Wednesdayfor two defeats in three games in the Champions League, but the prominent issue in a frustrating 0-0 draw with north London rivals Tottenham was that they just did not look like scoring. Despite their dominance, particularly in the second half, they had no noteworthy chances. Renée Slegers’s side had 13 shots and four on target but the Spurs goalkeeper Lize Kop remained mostly untested. Slegers remarked on the struggle afterwards. “We create momentum, so I’m happy with that and we have a lot of situations in and around their box, but we need to capitalise when we have momentum,” she said. “The finishes aren’t so easy from those moments we get in the box, so that’s definitely something we want to look at.” A team creating chances but not converting has far fewer problems than a team that is failing to create big opportunities and Arsenal need a reversal of fortune in this area, sharpish, with Real Madrid up next.Suzanne WrackMatch report:Tottenham 0-0 ArsenalView image in fullscreenSpurs’ Matilda Vinberg during the goalless draw in Sunday’s north London derby.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersFoxes set unwanted record in Brighton defeatLeicester set an unwanted record during their trip to Brighton on Sunday. Going into the game at the Amex Stadium, the Foxes had gone 20 games on the road without a win, dating back to January last year. That total extended to 21 winless games after a 4-1 loss to the Seagulls – surpassing the previous record for the longest period without a WSL victory set by Yeovil Town between April 2017 and February 2019. “We’re still learning, we’re still developing,” said the Leicester manager, Rick Passmoor. “What you saw is real good progress within the first 25 minutes in terms of in possession, unlocking the defence, creating chances … It’s good to see how we play with our intention and purpose and then it’s the clinical finishing to ensure we can step forward because goals do change games, so it would’ve been a real plus.”Emillia Hawkinsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came with the control and ruthlessness they have lacked, built on keeping attacks alive, winning second balls and unsettling an Everton side stretched by injuries. Amber Tysiak set the tone, her superb sliding challenge to deny Ornella Vignola in the 18th minute underpinned a commanding display later capped by a towering header from Viviane Asseyi’s corner. Shekiera Martinez continued her prolific goalscoring form this year, with Skinner saying: “When she’s only focusing on scoring goals, she’s excellent. She causes goalkeepers and defenders a lot of problems.” Everton, without Kelly Gago, never settled. For West Ham, at last, lift-off.Mitul SamjiLionesses eye Champions League placesLondon City Lionesses piled the pressure on the WSL top five with a comfortable 3-1 win over Aston Villa. The promoted side endured a difficult start to life in the top division but have gradually been picking up some good results in recent weeks. Their latest win – courtesy of goals from Saki Kumagai and Isobel Goodwin – saw them move within one point of Arsenal and Tottenham after the two north London sides held each other to a goalless draw. With Manchester United and Chelsea also failing to win their respective games, London City now find themselves closing in on the league’s top dogs. Kumagai said: “I am so happy and a huge three points for us. It was maybe not the perfect game for us but [with] our mentality we could concentrate to the end of the game. We expect more and more and we want to compete for the Champions League.”EHPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women914242Chelsea Women911213Man Utd Women910174Arsenal Women910165Tottenham Hotspur Women9-1166London City Lionesses9-5157Brighton & Hove Albion Women93118Aston Villa Women8-1109Leicester Women9-11610Everton Women9-7511West Ham Women9-14412Liverpool FC Women8-92Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballManchester City WomenChelsea WomenManchester United WomenArsenal WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A grammar school. We had Spanish lessons, but I didn’t take Spanish. I thought: ‘What’s a hairy-arsed kid from theLiverpoolghetto going to need that for?’ And lo and behold …”It’s late in Bilbao, back in the country that changed him, and a glass of wine rests on the table in front of Sammy Lee, who is grinning again. It’s been an emotional evening and a long night: a lot of laughs, some tears too, talking life at Liverpool and the life that came next. “For me, it’s about coaching even more than playing,” the European champion and formerEnglandassistant says. “And that started here.”It also started with friendship, where the conversation keeps going. So take us toOsasuna. “Oh, please,” Lee says. It was 1986 and he had left Liverpool, the club he supported and represented for a decade, winning everything. He had also lost his way when Michael Robinson suggested joining him at the Pamplona-based club, 90 miles south-east of where he sits now, and no sooner had he met them than Lee knew. “You can tell with people, good people,” he says. “It smelled right, felt right. Everything about it.View image in fullscreenSammy Lee with Michael Robinson at Osasuna.Photograph: CA Osasuna“Michael would always have my back. He was very supportive when I wasn’t doing well. He facilitated me going to QPR but I didn’t adapt: it wasn’t QPR, it was me. When you leave Liverpool … I was in such a low place. Michael wasn’t just a colleague, a friend, he was family: loyal, loyal,loyal to the day’s end. Until 1986, my path was set; he charted a new path for me, came to the rescue. Going to Spain with Michael was the best thing that happened to me after joining Liverpool. Osasuna started the book.”Another chapter, at least. There are so many stories to tell and, boy, does he tell them well: with humour and humility, a warmth and joy all the greater for getting the chance to return. He is in northern Spain, where he played from 1987 to 1988, invited toAthletic Bilbao’sThinking Football film festivalto speak at the screening of Andy Wells’moving documentary Two Tribesabout Everton and Liverpool in the 1980s.It isn’t always easy: voice breaking, in Spanish, Lee tells the audience how proud he is of his city; he tells them that he sees a connection to here, something similar in the clubs and their cities, a shared sense of community and identity that reconnects him to his experiences playing for Osasuna. Every time he sayshere, it is soon apparent, he meanstheretoo. And, he explains looking back in a quiet corner of a hotel bar later, in Pamplona he found a new purpose.View image in fullscreenLee celebrates winning the First Division title with the Liverpool fans on the Kop in 1980.Photograph: Harry Ormesher/Popperfoto/Getty ImagesLee’s first game at Anfield was as a fan against Ajax in 1966; his final game as a player came 30 years later. He joined at 17 but wasn’t a regular for four years. Captain of England Under-21s, many of his international colleagues were playing first-team football but then, he says, “they were at clubs, not Liverpool” and Liverpool were “worth waiting for”. When he left, he was a legend, winner offive league titles and two European Cups. Seven years on, he was back as a coach. By then things were different at a club where he says “they didn’t have a kit man until Gérard Houllier came”, the gear washed once a week by the coaches and stinking. He was different too, another calling found.“As a player I didn’t really appreciate it all. I understood everything a lot more, the process, when I became a coach. You have a whole squad of players to think about and I like that. Nothing can ever replace playing but I prefer coaching and now appreciate all they did for us: people like Ronnie Moran, Joe Fagan.“It kills me when people say we weren’t coached. Yeah, Bob Paisley was the ‘grandad’ with the slippers and the [flat] cap, but an example: 1981 [European Cup] semi-final. We’re lining up, ready to meet Bayern [Munich] in the tunnel. And Bob goes: ‘Listen, we’re going to change one thing tonight: [Paul] Breitner. We’re going man-to-man.’ This hasn’t been talked about. ‘What the fuck are we going man-to-man for? And, even worse, it’s Sammy: we’re puttinghimon Breitner?!’ Fantastic man-management. If I’d been told the night before, I would have been shitting myself and there would have been a mutiny. But I never had time. I went out and he never got a kick … and neither did I. Howard Gayle comes on and runs them ragged.View image in fullscreenBayern Munich’s Paul Breitner under close attention from Lee during the European Cup semi-final second leg in 1981.Photograph: Harry Ormesher/Popperfoto/Getty Images“Bob would stand at Melwood, one leg cocked on the radiator, watch the two-lap warm-up and could tell if someone had an ailment. No kidding. He had a great backroom: Ronnie Moran, Roy Evans, Tom Saunders. I loved them. They were so astute; they coached, but lightly. Football is a simple game, made complicated by people like me: coaches trying to justify our existence. I know coaches who’ve said: ‘I made him …’ Ah-huh? Seriously? The managers I’ve worked with understood you can over-coach, stifle. In the end, it’s about the best players in the best positions.”And Liverpool had them. The list is long and Lee is keen not to leave anyone out but Graeme Souness stood above: “A leader, captain, mentor, who evensmeltbetter than us. You see him now and he could swim the channel every morning.”Leaving was hard, all Lee had ever wanted behind him, or so he feared. “When your sell-by date is there, Liverpool know,” he says. “I get that. In 1984 I played 67 games. That takes its toll and, if I’m honest, professionally I took my eye off the ball, let standards slip. You’ve won the European Cup twice … Until 1986 everything was smooth, local kid playing for Liverpool, but I lost focus. The writing was on the wall. They tell you, in different ways: Steve McMahon was Kenny [Dalglish]’s first signing and he was brilliant. I didn’t really want to leave but I had to. It’s hard to accept. I wanted to play.“I went to QPR with Jim Smith, but I wasn’t right. Michael told me about Osasuna. Pedro Zabalza was the coach, a lovely, lovely person, who wanted an English style, which goes down better in the north. It’s an honest club, modest but fantastic. Going abroad helps draw a line under that [low]. A different culture, football, different spotlight. It was wonderful. It enhanced me as a person.“Back home, we wait until we get injured or our career ends [to consider coaching], although it’s changing now. When I was here, at Osasuna, there were young lads studying their badges already. I was like: ‘What’s that all about?’ Later I became reserve team coach at Liverpool under Souness. After about four, five weeks, he says: ‘Now, listen …’ I thought I was getting sacked. ‘Oh, here we go.’ He said: ‘You should get your FA coaching qualifications.’ I shit myself. But you know what? Best thing that ever happened to me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of my best times were working with him.”View image in fullscreenLee with his Bolton boss Sam Allardyce during the FA Cup fifth-round replay with West Ham in 2006.Photograph: David Cannon/Getty ImagesThere were others. Southampton with Ronald Koeman, where he came across Virgil van Dijk, a defender who “led with a velvet glove”, he says. “Ronald and I spoke Spanish, and later I worked with Rafa Benítez. So much for not needing Spanish at school.” Was Koeman’s English not that good? “MyEnglish,” Lee replies. Then of course there was England, first with Peter Taylor and next with Sven-Göran Eriksson. Eriksson even suggested Lee could be his successor; the FA, he said, should promote from within.“Should be me?!” For a moment there’s silence, shock. “I didn’t know that,” Lee says. “Wow. That’s news to me. Honestly, that is humbling. I was with him at two World Cups. He was so warm, so warm. He was lovely. When we got knocked out in Baden-Baden I knocked on his door. I had tears in my eyes. I said: ‘I can’t thank you enough.’ The players loved him.“The debriefing is: we’ve been knocked out, we’re going home. But sometimes you have to respect the opposition. You lose to Brazil in 2002, Portugal in 2006. People think we should win it. I get that: we have aspirations, we’re England. But it’s not a gimme. Those guys couldn’t have given us more. Sometimes the expectation is a bit much, the critique aimed at players. We were knocked out by [great teams]. I don’t get being termed ‘failures’. I would never consider what England have done a failure. There is a big, big pressure put on our boys; we seem to bask in criticising them.”View image in fullscreenLee takes part in a training session with Wayne Rooney during the 2006 World Cup in Germany.Photograph: Andy Hooper/ShutterstockThe coach too. Did appreciation for Eriksson come too late, not until he fell ill? “What disappointed us,” Lee admits, “was that they didn’t talk about Sven’s prowess as a coach; they talked about [the stuff where] the tabloids got involved.”In Baden-Baden, he had seen it up close: the intrusion, the pressure, the relentless noise. He didn’t like it, that much is clear, but nor would he let it affect him, he says, and the idea that playing for England is more chore than honour, is dismissed. It must be hard not to be dragged down by it, though? At times, it must weigh upon you? “No,” he says, because in the end it’s about the game, the people. And there it is again: the enthusiasm that Souness saw in him, that Taylor and Eriksson did, that he found in Pamplona, that makes him such good company.“But,” Lee adds, “I wouldn’t compartmentalise it. You can’t enjoy the camaraderie and not the competing. I enjoy trying to get the best out of players and to my knowledge whenever I’ve been involved, they’ve always been very, very well prepared, very passionate. ‘It’s all about the craic’? No. It’s not a big laugh, a joke, a jolly: the joy comes from seeing these young guys work ever so hard to be the best versions of themselves. There were pressures of course. And I don’t like being beaten. I don’t like coming home from Japan early. I don’t like losing in Germany. But I loved it, mate. I loved it. And it started here.”Explore more on these topicsOsasunaLiverpoolEnglandAthletic BilbaofeaturesShareReuse this content"

In addition, they renewed a longstanding call for rich nations to do more financially to help poor countries deal with warming.“Hurricane Melissa changed the life of every Jamaican in less than 24 hours,” said Matthew Samuda, the country’s economic growth minister. The category 5 hurricane that hit three weeks ago caused almost $10bn (£7.6bn) in damage anddisplaced hundreds of thousands of people. He called it evidence of “the new phase of climate change”.Hurricane Melissa a ‘real-time case study’ of colonialism’s legaciesRead more“We did not create this crisis, but we refuse to stand as victims,” Samuda said. “We call on the global community, especially major emitters, to honour their commitments and safeguard the 1.5C [above preindustrial levels] threshold for Jamaica. This is survival. It’s about our people and their right to a safe and prosperous future.”Armando Rodríguez Batista, Cuba’s environment and science minister, said his country was flooded by Melissa. “Tomorrow it will be too late to do what we had to do a long time ago,” he said.View image in fullscreenArmando Rodríguez Batista, Cuba’s minister of science, technology and environment, speaks at Cop30.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APOther nations reiterated the life-or-death nature of stepping up the fight to cut emissions, calling it “a moral duty” and saying climate damage was their day-to-day reality.“Our very existence is at stake,” Mauritius’s foreign affairs minister, Dhananjay Ramful, said. “A decade after the promises of the Paris agreement, despite our good intentions, we realised that we have not done enough … our planet demands action now.”The UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told the summit: “The pace of change in the real economy has not been matched by the pace of progress in these negotiating rooms. As climate disasters wrecked millions of lives and hammer every economy, pushing up prices for food and other basic needs, we all know what’s at stake.”“The time for promises is over,” Brazil’s vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, said. “Each additional fraction of a degree of global warming represents lives at risk, greater inequality and greater losses for those who contributed least to the problem.”Monday marked the start of the “high-level segment”, when ministers fly into Belém – or fly back, in the case of those who accompanied their heads of state for the world leaders’ summit that preceded the official opening of the conference last week. The hope is that they will galvanise the talks, by moving out of entrenched positions in a way that their officials, who have been conducting the negotiations for the past week, were not empowered to.“We have done the technical work, now the political work begins,” said Liliam Chagas, the chief negotiator for Brazil.View image in fullscreenGreenpeace activists built a cardboard replica of the Eiffel Tower at Cop30 to symbolise the fragility of the Paris agreement.Photograph: André Penner/APMany of the less contentious issues have already been agreed: for example, measures on agriculture and food security, and some procedural issues on the “loss and damage” fund for the rescue and rehabilitation of poor nations stricken by climate disaster.But others have been postponed or remain in draft, including measures to drive forward the work of carbon markets and discussions on gender. Negotiations on a “just transition” mechanism and on global efforts to adapt to the impact of extreme weather are also continuing, with some suggesting the latter could be delayed to next year or beyond.The most contentious issues of all – which are being called “the big four” – are on finance, trade, transparency and the response to the fact that the current crop of national climate plans (known as NDCs) would lead to global heating of 2.5C instead of the 1.5C limit that is in the Paris agreement.AI is guzzling energy for slop content – could it be reimagined to help the climate?Read moreOn these, discussions are continuing without much movement so far. On Sunday, the Brazilian Cop president, André Corrêa do Lago, sent out a “note” summing up the state of these negotiations and suggesting possible ways forward: for instance, a roadmap on the response to the NDCs, which would set out how to improve them in order to meet the Paris goals.On Tuesday, ministers will make national statements and hold bilateral meetings.One of the outcomes of amutirãocould be a “mutirãodecision”. This might look very like the“cover decision”– a catch-all document that sums up all of the progress made across a wide range of issues at a Cop – that the Brazilians said in advance of Cop30they would prefer to avoid.One issue Brazil will have to solve sooner is the air conditioning. While some areas of the conference centre are icy, some of the delegation rooms are so hot that delegates have “collapsed” or been unable to continue meetings.Pope Leo XIV issued a statement on Monday urging countries to act. “The Paris agreement has driven real progress and remains our strongest tool for protecting people and the planet,” he said.“But we must be honest: it is not the agreement that is failing, we are failing in our response. What is failing is the political will of some. Strong climate actions and policies, both are an investment in a more just and stable world.”Explore more on these topicsCop30JamaicaMauritiusBrazilFossil fuelsClimate crisisEmissions tradingShareReuse this content"

It said more than 1,000 people were injured in the attacks.Until now much of the focus of discussion about the bill has beenthe possible impact it may haveon former and current British service personnel who could face legal proceedings over incidents that happened decades ago.But the UK government is keen to stress that if its new bill becomes law, it opens up thepossibility of justice– or at least answers – for families who lost loved ones dating back half a century.The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said: “The last government’s Legacy Act shut down police investigations and proposed immunity for terrorists. This left many families feeling they had nowhere to go to continue their search for justice, or simply for answers about what happened to their loved ones.”Jarvis, a former member of the Parachute regiment who served inNorthern Ireland, continued: “This government’s legislation will put that right. It guarantees no terrorist will be able to claim immunity from prosecution, while ensuring there is an effective and wholly independent legacy commission to conduct investigations that families right across the United Kingdom can have confidence in.”The UK government says that if measures in its new Troubles bill become law, a reformed legacy commission would have enhanced powers enabling it to conduct full police investigations, where there is evidence of criminality. The immunity scheme would also be scrapped.The Home Office said unsolved Troubles-related attacks on English soil ranged from the1974 M62 coach bombingwhen 12 people were killed and 38 injured to the1996 Manchester bombingin which more than 200 people were hurt.Graeme Downie, the MP for Dunfermline and Dollar, whose friend Tim Parry was killed aged 12 inthe Warrington bomb attacks in 1993, said families who lost loved ones should still have the chance for answers.He said: “I don’t know what happened that day in Warrington in 1993 other than someone I was friends with and played football with every week had been killed. I don’t know precisely who did it. There was talk of a rogue IRA unit but no answers.“I don’t seek revenge and I don’t think the Parry family ever expect to get justice, but I do want answers and so do hundreds of others.”He said if the new legislation helped just one family it would be worthwhile.Mo Norton, the sister of bombardier Terence Griffin, who was killed in the M62 coach bombing aged 24, said: “He served two tours in NorthernIreland, and it was conflict that took him – not on the battlefield, but on a coach returning from leave.“He was proud of his service, but never boastful. He had plans – hopes for the future. That morning, everything changed. Twelve lives were lost, including children. Our family was shattered. There was no warning, no chance to say goodbye. Just silence, and then years of unanswered questions.“I need to know that Terence’s death has been fully investigated, I don’t think it has been properly investigated in the past.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandNorthern Irish politicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the point,” the estate’s executor, Malcolm LaVergne, said on Monday.LaVergne said he is still hoping to round up $500,000 to $1m in total assets.Ronald Goldman’s family says there is no closure from OJ Simpson’s deathRead moreSimpson died of cancer in 2024 at age 76. He was found not guilty in the 1994 knife killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman, her friend, in Los Angeles. But Simpson was taken to court again and found liable for the deaths in a separate civil case. He was ordered to pay the families $33.5m, an award that has grown due to interest.LaVergne accepted a claim of $58m, according to a court document filed Friday in Clark County, Nevada. The figure that was sought was $117m.Fred Goldman’s attorney, Michaelle Rafferty, said the estate has accepted the claim as valid but “it does not constitute payment.”“We will continue to closely monitor the probate proceedings,” she said in an email.Simpson lived in Las Vegas afterserving nine years in prison for armed robbery, kidnapping and assault, charges related to a confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers in a hotel room in 2007. He typically declined to discuss his finances other than to say he lived on his NFL and private pensions.Explore more on these topicsSportNFLOJ SimpsonUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the most comprehensive study yet to quantify the extent to which a range of plastic, from soft, flexible types such as bags and food wrappers, to hard plastics ranging from fragments to whole items such as beverage bottles, result in the death of creatures that ingest them.“We’ve long known that ocean creatures of all shapes and sizes are eating plastics; what we set out to understand was how much is too much,” said Dr Erin Murphy, Ocean Conservancy’s manager of ocean plastics research and lead author of the study. “The lethal dose varies based on the species, the animal’s size and the type of plastic it’s consuming, but overall it’s much smaller than you may might think, which is troubling when you consider that more than a garbage truck’s worth of plastics enters the ocean every minute.”Loggerhead sea turtles have a 90% chance of death after consuming just two baseballs’ worth of plastics, and about a football’s worth of plastics can kill marine mammals such as harbour porpoises. Animals often accidentally ingest plastic when hunting for food; for example, floating plastic bags resemble the jellyfish sea turtles like to eat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They then looked at the relationship between the plastics in the gut and likelihood of death, modelling total pieces of plastic and volume. They analysed the type of plastic, to see if any particular kind was more lethal to each group of marine creature and found that rubber and hard plastics are particularlydeadly for seabirds, soft and hard plastics for sea turtles, and soft plastics and fishing gear for marine mammals.They found that nearly half (47%) of all sea turtles, a third (35%) of seabirds, and 12% of marine mammals had plastics in their digestive tracts when they died.Scientists say that in order to end the plastics crisis in oceans, and prevent many more sea creatures from dying,governments need to take actionto ensure plastics production is reduced, as well as improving waste collection and recycling.“We are thrilled to have this new research quantifying the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife,” said Ocean Conservancy’s director of plastics policy Dr Anja Brandon. “While there is no single solution to this issue, these hard numbers reaffirm that our work addressing particularly problematic items like balloons and plastic bags are truly meaningful. In the fight to protect our marine wildlife, every policy and every individual action matters.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsMarine lifePlastic bagsPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024, her working conditions worsened after a deadlyheatwavespread acrossnorthern India. Climatebreakdown isincreasingthe frequency and intensity of heatwaves in India by warming the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.Every morning, I am up by 5.30am-6am because I have to cook, get ready, and leave on time for our shift, which begins at 8.30am. But this summer – May, June, July and August – the temperature always stayed around 46C, sometimes even hitting 50C (122F). My routine changed.View image in fullscreenNeha is from Uttar Pradesh, a neighbouring state of Haryana, where she lives near Manesar and works in a warehouse. She walks a long distance to get to work and because she has no fridge at home, carries a two-litre bottle of water back with her. The conditions at the warehouse are unforgiving. She suffers during the severe heatwave months, when temperatures can range between 46C and 50C.Photograph: Ruhani Kaur/The GuardianI live in a rented room with a friend on the top floor of a two-storey building. We had frequent power cuts in our rural neighbourhood those days, with lights often going off at 3am.We would not get a good night’s sleep but would still get up by 6am to try to have a bath early before the water in our tank on the roof would become very hot. We would not feel like cooking because our top-floor room was so hot. I would have a cold drink instead of a cup of tea.The company is around 3km from where I stay and getting an auto [autorickshaw] is difficult. So, I walk to work. The streets would be deserted, with shops closed and everyone inside their homes. Our 30-minute walk has no shaded area, no place to sit and rest. We just walk and walk, the sun directly on us, till we reach the company drenched in sweat.Inside, there is some cooling. There was a difference of almost 10C. And I would drink the cold water available here since at home we did not have a filter and drank the tank water, which was very hot. Then I did my shift.View image in fullscreenNeha’s 30-minute walk to work is in direct sun, without shade or a place to rest.Photograph: Ruhani Kaur/The GuardianAt the “inbound” department at the warehouse, my job is to store items according to a list given to me. My target is to store 150 items in an hour in 600 small cabins lining 400 narrow corridors across four floors. I walk up and down the stairs, carrying damaged goods to the fourth floor, small items to cabins one to 100 [and] small groceries to 100 to 120.The storage area does not have fans and, beyond a point, the air conditioning does not help. In the entire day, the 10 hours that I work, I walk a minimum of 25km (16 miles). I always maintain a fast pace to be able to finish my assigned target and am drenched in sweat by the end of it.After my shift, I would fill a two-litre bottle with cold water from the company before walking back home. Opening the door and entering the room felt like I had jumped into a fire. The floor would be burning. There is no fridge in our room. We would pour water from the tank, which was also hot, to try to cool the floor since we don’t have a bed and sleep on the ground. This lasted for months.Moving in and out between hot and cold environments in my company affected my health. I first lost my voice, then caught a bad cold. I was not able to meet my work targets and would get pulled up by the manager. One day, I was feverish and told him I was not keeping well but he spoke rudely and yelled at me in front of other workers for not working properly.View image in fullscreen‘I think such summers will repeat,’ says Neha. ‘Something should be done to help workers, particularly migrants.’Photograph: Ruhani Kaur/The GuardianWhen I finished my shift and walked home that evening, my feet were hurting badly. I had a fever; I couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe, and was in tears. My roommate took care of me because I did not want to call my family. They would have worried and asked me to come back home, but I needed to keep the job.Even if we fainted at the company, we couldn’t take a day off and go home. If we took that day off, our pay would be cut, and if we took three days off, the company would fire us.The relentless heat resulted in so many people I know falling ill, just like I did.So many workers fainted. Some workers left their jobs and went back to their villages out of compulsion. They thought they could do some farming at home. They were worried that if anything happened to them, who would come to see them?About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamHealth issues became a big concern. We were not eating on time, only drinking aerated drinks, and it affected our wellbeing. We felt so weak we could not work efficiently at the company. My roommate also fell ill, and her weight dropped from 45kg (7st 1lb) to 38kg.Because of the intense heat, we had to buy a cooler, which had financial implications for us. We work hard to save some money to send home but had to buy a cooler instead, which resulted in our electricity bill shooting up. These additional expenses and wage cuts for taking too many days off impacted our earnings throughout the summer.I think such summers will repeat. Something should be done to help workers, particularly migrants. The rooms we rent don’t have too many facilities because our incomes are low. Our workplaces need to be more flexible, have better ventilation in many spaces, and take into account such weather conditions.We should be provided with conditions that keep us fit enough to work. Workers who stay fit can work better, right? The work we do should be proportional to what we can handle. No extra pressure should be placed on us.I want something to be done for workers, especially migrant labourers. We had to take care of each other since no one in the neighbourhood would help us. So, we looked after each other.This testimonial was produced with the help of theClimate Disaster Project; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelos and Morgan Krakow.Design and development byHarry FischerandPip Lev."

Suddenly a call came from the bridge: “Whales! Starboard side!”For the next few hours, what looked like a couple of juvenile beaked whales kept surfacing and disappearing until finally Robert Pitman, a now-retired researcher at Oregon State University, fired a small arrow from a modified crossbow at the back of one of them.Everybody on the boat was cheering … we finally had itElizabeth HendersonThe tip carved out a small chunk of skin the size of a pencil eraser. It was this that would later prove to the scientists onboard that they were seeing a species that had never before been seen in the wild: a ginkgo-toothed beaked whale.“I can’t even describe the feeling because it was something that we had worked towards for so long,” says Elizabeth Henderson, a researcher at the US military’s Naval Information Warfare Center and lead author of the resulting paperpublished inMarine Mammal Science,who was also there that day. “Everybody on the boat was cheering because we had it, we finally had it.”View image in fullscreenThe Pacific Storm towed an array of hydrophones to listen to the distinctive calls of different pods of whales.Photograph: Marine Mammal Institute/Oregon State UniversityThe discovery had been five years in the making. Since 2020, Henderson and her colleagues from Mexico and the US had been tracking a group of whales producing a distinctive call, tagged as BW43, which they initially thought was Perrin’s beaked whale, another species that had never been seen in the wild.The team returned to the same spot for three years, first on a sailing boat, then on a chartered Mexican fishing boat, without any luck. Then in 2024, they teamed up with Oregon State University and set out on its research vessel, which proved to be key to their success. The ship towed an array of hydrophones to listen to underwater sounds, and had an observation deck with high-powered binoculars capable of spotting whales hundreds of metres away.When it comes to finding beaked whales, such hi-tech aids are an absolute necessity. There are 24 known species, but apart from a few,very little is known about them.View image in fullscreenScientists think the ginkgo-toothed beaked whales live off the shores of California and northern Baja California in Mexico.Photograph: Sergio MartinezThey are the deepest-diving mammals on Earth, spending most of their lives in the oceans, only coming up for air for a few minutes at a time, usually far away from coastlines. They are notoriously shy and easily frightened when approached by a boat. Many species have only been describedbased on dead animals washing ashoreand new species are still being discovered, the lastas recently as 2021.“The Society for Marine Mammalogy has a list of 94 accepted species of cetaceans,” says Pitman. “A quarter of those are beaked whales, but most people have never even heard of them. These are the largest, least-known animals left on the planet.”But learning more about them is crucial. These whales areespecially sensitive to military sonars, which interfere with their foraging, and in some cases cause them to ascend too fast, suffering fatal injuries akin to decompression sickness in scuba divers. Knowing where these whales live can help mitigate the potential harm of sonar by avoiding military training in important beaked whale habitats.View image in fullscreenA rare beaked whale found dead on Waitpinga beach in South Australia.

In panic, the scientists and crew start shouting, some throwing their bread rolls from breakfast to distract or chase away the opportunistic thief.“In hindsight, it is very funny, but in the moment it was very stressful,” says Henderson.Dodging New York traffic: hundreds of humpback whales on a collision course with shipsRead moreFinding ginkgo-toothed beaked whales near Mexico was a big surprise – from stranding records, they had often been found washed up on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, on the shores of Japan. The researchers analysed existing acoustic databases for BW43, the now-confirmed call of ginkgo-toothed beaked whales, and found that these animals probably lived off the shores of California and northern Baja California.“There were two strandings on the west coast of North America previously, but they had always been assumed to have been anomalous – animals that washed ashore, or were sick,” says Henderson. “But now we know that that’s not true and that they actually occupy these waters year-round.”View image in fullscreenA dense-beaked whale, also known as Blainville’s beaked whale. Researchers are trying to build maps of the deep-diving whales’ distribution from acoustic data.Photograph: Minden /AlamyThere are many more beaked whale calls out there without a known source, as well as several species with no known call, and no sightings at sea. So a key focus of research over the last few years has been to match whale calls to species, which will enable scientists to build maps of the animals’ distribution from acoustic data – the only way to track such elusive species.With a personal bucket list of seeing every whale species on the planet, and now standing at an impressive 90 out of 94, Pitman has tracked down several elusive animals. But he now thinks Perrin’s might be the hardest to find. There have only been six known strandings, all along the coast of California and all in a heavily decomposed state.“I think those are just vagrants. It’s someplace else, and we are not quite sure where to go look for this thing,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe quest for the ginkgo-toothed beaked whale, notoriously shy and easily frightened when approached, lasted for five years.Photograph: Marine Mammal Institute/Oregon State UniversityThis article was amended on 17 November 2025 to correct some instances where ginkgo-toothed beaked whale was misspelled.Explore more on these topicsWhalesSeascape: the state of our oceansCetaceansOceansMarine lifeWildlifeMexicoAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The storm developed from an area of low pressure that had earlier driven early season cold and snowy conditions through eastern parts of Canada and the north-eastern US through early November.The system tracked eastwards across the Atlantic during the second weekend of November before slowing and stalling to the north-west of the Iberian peninsula, caught in the trough of an increasingly amplified, or wavy, jet stream. Spain’s meteorological service AEMET named the storm last Monday before the arrival of several bouts of heavy rainfall, which slowly pushed through during the rest of the week.Galicia in north-west Spain was hit first, with 80 to 150mm of rain falling along its west coast in just 24 hours up to Wednesday evening as a slow-moving band of rain pushed across western parts of the Iberian peninsula. Further showers and thunderstorms on Thursday brought flooding to parts of Portugal where an elderly couple died in Lisbon after water from the overflowing Tagus River entered their home as they slept. Stormy conditions persisted into the weekend, with a tornado tearing through a campsite and a nearby hotel in Albufeira, southern Portugal, on Saturday, killing an 85-year-old British woman and injuring 28 people.Claudia had wider effects across western Europe. By drawing warm air from the subtropics, the system helped temperatures in south-west France climb to 29.8C (85.6F), the country’s highest recorded November temperature. By Friday, this warm and humid air mass clashed with cold air mass across more northern parts of Europe, forming a band of rain stretching from western Ireland to Russia. In the UK, this stalling band of rain brought very high rainfall totals,resulting in severe flooding in Wales. As Claudia continues to weaken early this week, the cold air mass will push south, giving Europe its first taste of winter.California experiencedan “atmospheric river” last week, bringing heavy rain and strong winds that led to flash flooding and mudslides in areas affected by wildfires earlier this year. More than 50mm of rain fell in southern California on Friday, with a further 50mm widely across the state on Saturday. More than 100mm of rain fell over coastal parts of southern California in total, reaching 200mm overall in spots on high ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The protocal said police should not be used for what it called “low-level behaviour management or matters a reasonable parent would not have called the police over”.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, said: “Strengthening the protocol will mean these children are treated as children, rather than criminals. Ensuring they get proper help and support means we can change the path they’re on, stop them turning to lives of crime and give them a more positive future.Thechildren’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, said her office regularly saw cases where traumatised children taken into care after being exploited, abused or groomed by adults subsequently found themselves subjected to heavy-handed criminal punishment and retribution rather than care and support.She said: “Children with complex needs or disabilities whose behaviours require significant care from expert professionals, are criminalised for lashing out and damaging property. My case workers tell me time and time again about instances of children’s homes calling the police because a child breaks something.“For any other child, these would not be ‘incidents’ documented in writing. There would be no report, no police involvement. They would usually be handled by parents or other caregivers in private, where children are allowed to be children.”In one case cited by de Souza, Jimmy, a boy with autism and significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, was effectively contained in an illegal children’s home under 24-hour supervision, unable to play outside or go to school.“One day Jimmy threw something that hit one of these staff members. They were not seriously injured but the police were called. Jimmy was charged and then convicted. He, a disabled child, had to pay a fine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were less likely to commit drug or knife offences.The research said that while it was impossible to generalise about the nature of the offences, it was notable that many of the incidents such as violence towards carers and damage to homes “get a police response which would not happen in a family home, which can in turn escalate to violence towards those police officers”.It adds: “This analysis of first offences of children appears to support the idea that for many children who come into care, they are being brought into the criminal justice system by the very people who should be protecting them from it.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

However, a successful trial and the promise of lower costs could spell a wider rollout to the rest of the mainline railway by 2030.On a test run from London Paddington to Newbury and back, the Guardian found the wifi fast and reliable enough to video call editors at the office, catch up on old Match of the Days on iPlayer and listen to songs on YouTube at the same time, with only occasional blips and pixelation.Download speeds reached more than 120 megabytes a second, faster than many homes.Speaking at Paddington at the launch of the trial, the rail minister, Peter Hendy, said: “Passenger experience is top of our agenda – and 21st-century experience ought to be seamless fast wifi … which will make the time spent travelling by train even more valuable.”He said the trial would complement government investment in improving mobile connectivity, with another £41m set aside for train wifi and low-orbit satellite connections, announced in June’s spending review. The Department forTransportis funding work to eliminate mobile signal black spots in rail tunnels and upgrading 5G infrastructure at stations on GWR routes.Lord Hendy said the new state-ownedGreat British Railwayswould aspire to fast wifi across the entire railway, but added: “The real question is how quickly and how cheaply it can be rolled out.”Hendy said it could be “a real productivity benefit for the whole country, hopefully at a modest cost”.He said the department would be awaiting the results of the trial, but its advocates claim the new system could be installed relatively quickly and cheaply withoutrequiring extra infrastructureon the railway. The previous government was consideringscrapping free wifi on trainsbecause of the unreliability and cost.Nick Fry, the chair of Motion Applied, a tech company spun out of the McLaren racing division, said the pilot would demonstrate the technology was ready. The UK-made tech, pioneered in F1, combines “several pizza-sized boxes” and antennae attached to the roof of the train, allowing it to connect and switch between the best available network, from wifi to5Gto satellite, he said. “It’s very fast with fewer dropouts.”The system is also being rolled out on Deutsche Bahn services in Germany and on Brightline and Amtrak trains in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Andy Jasper, the chief executive of the Eden Project in Cornwall, said GWR trains were his “travelling office, and a bloodstream between Cornwall and London – new wifi is going to be the oxygen that keeps everything pumping”.Jasper said he was used to having to time conversations onboard for when he knew the wifi would work, such as a quick 10-minute Teams meeting in Plymouth. “Reliable wifi puts your mind at ease – it turns the journey into a prime opportunity to get things done.”Explore more on these topicsRail industryWifiTelecommunications industryRail transportFormula OneTechnology sectorTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

The alerts indicate an “increase in risk to health for individuals aged over 65 years or those with pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases” as well as greater risk of disruptions to roads and public transport.They are in place between noon on Monday and 8am on Saturday, with the rest of England given a less serious yellow warning for the same time period.The Met Office issued its own warnings, with multiple yellow weather alerts for snow and ice affecting parts ofScotlandand northern England from Monday to Thursday, and temperatures expected to drop to as low as -10C in places.Its chief forecaster, Paul Gundersen, said scattered showers in the north-east and far north of Scotland could create a risk of icy conditions on roads and pavements. He said: “An area of rain will reach the west of Scotland early on Tuesday morning, with a risk of this turning to snow as it moves inland” across the north.“This period of snow could bring some disruption to travel and infrastructure across higher parts of Scotland,” said Gundersen. He added that by Wednesday, a “strong and very cold northerly flow” would make temperatures feel even colder.Tom Crabtree, a deputy chief forecaster at the Met Office, said 2-5cm of snow could accumulate in low-lying areas and as much as 5-10cm could fall, with accumulations of 15-20cm possible in higher areas in parts of north-east England and Scotland.Ruth Goss, the senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), warned of the risk the cold could pose for older and vulnerable people. She said it was especially important that those with heart conditions were well prepared this winter by wrapping up warm and having their free flu jab.The BHF advises that anyone who is it risk, such as people over the age of 65 or anyone with cardiovascular diseases, should keep indoor temperatures to at least 18C, wear warm clothing to trap in heat, stay active indoors, wrap a scarf loosely around their mouth and nose to breathe in warmer air if they have angina, as well as eating warming meals and drinking healthy hot drinks.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherNorth of EnglandSnowEnglandScotlandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian approached him for comment.On 27 October, Alrabea featured in a live TikTok broadcast hosted by an RSF figure called Zafer. Also in the broadcast was Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris,an active RSF fighter who goes by the name Abu Luluand who has appeared in numerous videos shot in El Fasher showing fighters killing unarmed people.“Today I killed 2,000 people and then I lost count. I want to start again from zero,” Abu Lulu says at one point, to which Alrabea responds with laughter. Elsewhere in the video Alrabea tells Abu Lulu he wants him to “fuck thesefalangayatup and down”, using a word considered a slur towards indigenous ethnic groups in Darfur.After the Guardian got in touch withTikTok, it said it had taken down Alrabea’s account, which had 240,000 followers,“for violating our policies on violent and criminal behaviour”. YouTube also said last week that it had removed his account, which had material dating back to December 2023, “for violating our violent extremist or criminal organisations policy”.View image in fullscreenScreengrabs from a broadcast featuring Alrabea and an active RSF fighter who goes by the name Abu Lulu.Photograph: Social mediaTikTok said it uses technology and moderation teams to vet content, including on TikTok Live. Videos broadcast on the Live feature do not stay on the platform after broadcast, meaning inflammatory material can go unnoticed by the wider world unless viewers make their own recordings.X has taken down Alrabea’s accounts in the past only for him to open new accounts that quickly gain followers. The company sent links to its rules on violent and hateful content in response to a request for comment.The RSFcaptured El Fasher from the Sudanese army late last month, since whenevidence has emergedof ethnically targeted mass killings, sexual violence and abductions.Satellite imagery analysed by Yale researchers has shown visible blood stainson the city’s streets and possible mass graves being dug.In January the United Statesformally declared that the RSF had committed genocideduring the war.Mohamed Suliman, a Sudanese researcher and writer based in Boston who lobbies social media companies to take down RSF-linked accounts, described Alrabea as a “dedicated RSF supporter” who “might be the group’s most influential social media activist”.He added: “RSF social media activists play a key role in strengthening the militia’s followers by spreading the narrative that justifies their war.”Alrabea is named in an application by British resident Yaslam Altayeb, who was detained by the RSF in the early months of the war, for the British government to apply sanctions against several individuals accused of supporting the RSF. Altayeb was eventually released and made his way back to the UK.Many of the videos Alrabea has appeared in have subsequently been deleted, though some have been archived by the online platform Sudan in the News.In June of this year Alrabea posted videos to YouTube and TikTok from El Fasher itself, during a visit to parts of the city that were under the control of the RSF at the time.0:29British citizen posts TikTok from inside El Fasher in Sudan – videoMohaned Elnour, a Sudanese human rights lawyer, said Alrabea’s ability to visit Darfur during an active conflict indicated he has influence within the organisation that went beyond cheerleading from his car.“His role is to recruit, to encourage,” said Elnour. “There are so many people spreading hate speech and trying to inspire the RSF but none of them were on the ground, meeting RSF officials, standing on top of tanks,” Elnour added, referring to an image shared by Alrabea from an earlier trip to Darfur in 2023. “Look at Rwanda, how it started – those who spread hate speech fuelled the war.”Explore more on these topicsSudanDarfurSheffieldTikTokYouTubeXIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

A company spokesperson said that having cereals sweet enough to be palatable to infants was vital in combating malnutrition. The firm said their recipes were well within limits set by national regulations in the countries concerned.Public Eye researchers worked with activists in more than 20 African countries to buy 94 samples of Cerelac products marketed for babies aged six months and above, which were sent to a laboratory for analysis.The laboratory found added sugar in more than 90% of baby cereals, with an average of 6g, or one-and-a-half teaspoons, per serving.Most products without added sugar were imported, they said, and had originally been intended for sale in Europe, apart from two variants recently launched in South Africa.The amount of added sugar identified ranged from about 5g a serving for products found in Egypt, Madagascar, South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria to 7.5g in a product sold in Kenya.World Health Organization (WHO) guidelineson foods for children under three recommend they should contain “no added sugars or sweetening agents”, in part because of the risk of creating long-term preferences for sweetened foods.Aninvestigation by Public Eyepublished in April 2024 found Nestlé was adding sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in Asia, Africa and Latin America, whenequivalent productsin richer countries had no added sugar.In a letter to Nestlé’s chief executive, Philipp Navratil, 12 African civil society and consumer organisations said: “You know how to do things differently. But you made a deliberate decision to feed children in Africa with less healthy options.”Africa’s medical system risks ‘collapse in next few years’, warns health leaderRead moreAfter Public Eye’s 2024 investigation, Nestlésaid it had an ambitionto introduce versions of Cerelac with no added sugar in all markets.However, campaigners said this was “too little, too late”, and called for the company to stop adding sugar to baby foods.They added: “By adding sugar to infant cereals, Nestlé is putting the health of African babies at risk for profit.” Accusing the firm of playing a part in “a preventable public health catastrophe”, they said anepidemic of diet-related non-communicable diseaseswas spreading across the continent.Peggy Diby, global head of corporate affairs for Nestlé Nutrition, said: “These are unfounded allegations and insinuate actions that are contrary to all our values. We disagree with the Public Eye report. It is misleading. We do not have double standards when it comes to early childhood nutrition.”In the past year, Nestlé hasintroduced 14 Cerelac variants with no added sugarin India, and Diby said it was accelerating the rollout of no added sugar varieties in African countries.She said Public Eye had refused to share details of its testing, and disputed the sugar levels identified, suggesting they included naturally occurring sugars from milk, cereals and fruits in the products. She said levels in Nestlé products were “well below” those set out ininternational food safety and quality standardspublished by the WHO and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization known as the Codex Alimentarius.“The biggest challenge in Africa is not obesity, it is malnutrition,” she said, highlighting iron deficiency as a particular concern. “We are here to provide age-adapted solutions that contribute to [tackling] malnutrition.”Dr Sara Colombo Mottaz, global head of medical, regulatory and scientific affairs at Nestlé Nutrition, said fortified cereals played a key role in providing the necessary micronutrients, and the company had internal “guardrails” to keep added sugars below a certain level.She said babies in the womb, or those breastfed as infants, were used to sweet tastes and it was important to offer them flavours they would accept as they transitioned to solid foods.“We want to provide to parents [a range of products] that are under also our guardrail,” she said. “Remember that children at the age of six months … can refuse to eat and if they refuse to eat, they will not be able to grow properly.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthNestléChildrenFood & drink industryObesityAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”Referring to her fanbase, known as the Barbz, she continued: “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice. We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”Minaj’s collaboration with the White House comes just days after she publicly supported a Truth Social post from the US president in which he condemned what he called the Nigerian government’s failure to prevent attacks on Christians.Trump’s comments follow weeks of pressure from conservative Christian groups urging him to categorize the west African nation as a “country of particular concern” over alleged religious persecution. In his statements, Trump has not made mention of any violence against Muslims who have also been targeted by extremist religious groups,including Boko Haram.In response to Trump’s comments earlier this month, Minajwroteon X: “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude. We live in a country where we can freely worship God … Thank you to the president & his team for taking this seriously. God bless every persecuted Christian.”Trump has alsothreatenedto send US troops “guns-a-blazing” to Nigeria, which he called a “disgraced country”, adding that if the US did militarily intervene, “it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our cherished Christians.”Nigeria’s leadership has swiftly contested Trump’s comments, with its president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu,sayingthat Nigeria “is a democracy with constitutional guarantees of religious liberty”.Although the country is officially secular, Nigeria is closely split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Despite violence against Christians having garnered international attention, analysts say the causes aremore complex, with many conflicts stemming from ethnic rivalries as well as land and water disputes, among other reasons.Kidnappings of priests and pastors have surged, as criminals see them as high-value targets whose communities can raise ransom quickly, prompting some analysts to view their actions as driven more by criminal profit than religious discrimination.Explore more on these topicsNicki MinajTrump administrationUS politicsNigeriaChristianityReligionAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The 65 people who usually work there are being relocated while further investigations take place.“During these investigations, the Campana Gallery … will be closed to the public as a precautionary measure,” the statement said.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Meaney’s target, to beat the world record and claim fame and fortune, was 61 days.The remarkable stunt, and its poignant aftermath, is told in a documentary to be aired on the Irish-language TV stationTG4on 26 November. Titled Beo Faoin bhFód (Buried Alive), the film has already been screened at festivals. Directed byDaire Collins, it combines interviews with Meaney’s family and friends with archival footage of an event that made global headlines.View image in fullscreenMick Meaney raises his hand through a hole in his coffin as he is paraded through the streets of Kilburn in 1968.Photograph: Jim Gray/Getty Images/TG4“My father was a proud Tipperary man,” his daughter Mary Meaney says in the documentary. “He was another Irishman, they are now called the forgotten Irish, they were over there working with a pick and shovel and sending the money back to their families. Times were poor back then.”Meaney, strong and powerfully built, had wanted to become a champion boxer but injury ended that dream and he ended up digging tunnels inLondon. When an accident briefly trapped him beneath rubble he remained composed, and another ambition possessed him: to claim the record for the longest time spent buried alive.The craze started in California in the 1920s – the US bred other unusual endurance contests such as the longest time spent atop a pole, or hula hooping, or dancing – and in the 1960s the unofficial record was credited to a Texan named Bill White. Styling himself “the living corpse”, White made a career of being buried to promote car dealerships and other businesses and had endured a 55-day stint underground.To set a new record Meaney, aged 33, teamed up withMichael ‘Butty’ Sugrue, a circus performer turned publican and impresario in London’s Irish community. Sugrue staged a wake at a pub, the Admiral Nelson, during which Meaney was enclosed in the coffin. A truck ferried the coffin to a yard owned by a contractor, Mick Keane, who allotted part of the site to the stunt. A trapdoor that opened to a cavity beneath the coffin, which was slightly larger than a regular coffin, served as a toilet.“I had a great night’s sleep last night,” Meaney, speaking from a telephone rigged inside his casket, told a TV news anchor on his second day. He established a routine: wake at 7am, do exercises compatible with the confinement, rub ointment on his body, eat, read books and newspapers and talk to people on the phone.View image in fullscreenMick Meaney is embraced by his manager, Michael ‘Butty’ Sugrue, after completing 61 days underground.Photograph: TG4The line connected to a phone at the Admiral Nelson, where Sugrue charged patrons for every call. Celebrities such as the boxer Henry Cooper conversed with the buried man but interest waned as weeks passed – war in Vietnam and Martin Luther King’s assassination dominated attention. Still, Sugrue mustered dancers, musicians and journalists for what was styled Meaney’s “resurrection”, after 61 days, on 22 April.The coffin was dug up and ferried atop a truck, past cheering crowds, back to the pub. When the lid was removed Meaney, with sunglasses to shield his eyes, and a beard, grinned. “I’d like to go for a hundred days more,” he told the press. “I’m delighted to be the champion of the world.”Fortune never came – it was alleged that Sugrue swindled his star. A mooted world tour and sponsorship deal with Gillette never materialised. “In all walks of life there are people who just use you like a vampire,” said Mary Meaney, who was three when her father returned to Ireland. “He came back without as much as the price of a bottle of milk in his pocket.”View image in fullscreenMary Meaney holds a photograph of her father, Mick Meaney.Photograph: TG4Fame proved fleeting. No Guinness Book of Records representative recorded Meaney’s feat and a rival burial artist named Tim Hayes, who spent less time underground in a regular-sized coffin, disputed his champion credentials. Later in 1968, a former nun named Emma Smith had herself buried beneath a fairground in Skegness for 101 days.Meaney got a job with Cork county council and died in 2003. “He could live an ordinary life, working class, ordinary, but he craved this extraordinary life,” said Mary Meaney. “Breaking the world record made him feel, ‘I’m somebody’.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandDocumentaryEuropeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Seconds after the request was sent, there was an apparently automated reply that said only: “Legacy Media Lies.”‘Intellectualizing white preservation’Many of the encyclopedia’s entries on prominent white nationalists, antisemites and holocaust deniers appear to be written to portray them in a positive light while casting doubt on the credibility of their critics.The encyclopediapraises the prominent white nationalistand American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor for his “pivotal role in intellectualizing white preservation by advocating for a fact-based, non-violent approach to white identity politics”, with which he has fostered “a legacy of measured dissent that avoided the pitfalls of extremism”.The entry offers no critical examination of Taylor’s beliefs, instead casting doubt on the credibility of his critics. Of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC’s) designation of Taylor as a white nationalist, Grokipedia says this illegitimately “frames Taylor’s American Renaissance publication as a vehicle for repackaging eugenics-era ideas under the guise of ‘race realism’, equating empirical discussions of group disparities with advocacy for racial hierarchy”.The entry also claims that “progressive commentary, including in outlets like GQ, depicts Taylor as a ‘suit-and-tie white supremacist’ … often sidelining his explicit repudiations of antisemitism or coercive measures in favor of broader fears of ideological contagion”.View image in fullscreenThe white nationalist writer Jared Taylor at his home on 19 August 2016 in Oakton, Virginia.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesWikipedia, meanwhile,describesTaylor as “an American white supremacist and editor of American Renaissance” and “a proponent ofscientific racismand voluntary racial segregation”.Meanwhile, Kevin MacDonaldhas been describedby the SPLC as the “neo-Nazi movement’s favorite academic” who “argues that anti-Semitism, far from being an irrational hatred for Jews, is a logical reaction to Jewish success”. Wikipedia’sentry on MacDonaldcalls him an “antisemitic conspiracy theorist, white supremacist and retired professor of evolutionary psychology”.The making of Elon Musk: how did his childhood in apartheid South Africa shape him?Read moreGrokipedia, however, says that MacDonald’s research simply “focuses on applying evolutionary principles to human social behavior”, and “by framing 20th-century ideological movements as vehicles for group advancement, MacDonald has revived causal inquiries into collective interests, prompting alternative scholars to reassess blank-slate egalitarianism’s role in eroding recognition of adaptive ethnic strategies”.MacDonald’s work counters “institutional biases toward universalism in academic discourse”, according to the entry.David Irving is a self-taught British historian who has publicly denied the Jewish Holocaust since 1988. His views led to him being banned from entering several countries in the 1990s, and in 2006 he was imprisoned in Austria over his denial of the existence of gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Grokipedia’s entry on Irving, however, paints him in heroic terms.According to the entry, in “wider dissident communities” Irving “symbolizes resistance to institutional suppression of unorthodox historical inquiry” in the face of “coordinated efforts to silence dissent rather than scholarly refutation”. The entry adds: “Despite mainstream dismissals from sources with evident anti-revisionist biases, such as advocacy groups, Irving’s archival rigor continues to be praised within these circles.”In an email,Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project on Hate and Extremism, said: “Grokipedia is another example of Elon Musk proliferating hateful disinformation and far-right propaganda. The site whitewashes white supremacists, anti-Semites and other extremists, providing ‘information’ that clearly distorts the truth.”‘The preservation and advancement of the European racial heritage’Grokipedia gives similarly favorable accounts of historical far-right figures.William Luther Pierce was “America’s most important neo-Nazi for three decades until his death in 2002”, according to the SPLC. He was the key organizer of the National Alliance, an organization whose ultimate aim was a white nationalist overthrow of the US government, and the author of The Turner Diaries, a dystopian novel of race war which was a seminal tome for white nationalists in the US.Wikipedia’s entry on Pierce points out that The Turner Diaries “inspired multiple hate crimes, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing”.Grokipedia’s entry on Pierce, however, describes the National Alliance as “an organization promoting the preservation and advancement of the European racial heritage” and “a key entity in the white advocacy milieu”.William Luther Pierce.Photograph: Robert HartnellIt says Pierce’s “efforts emphasized intellectual rigor, drawing on evolutionary science and historical analysis to argue for racial separatism over egalitarian ideologies”.That entry says The Turner Diaries depicts “individual resistance against perceived societal decay”. In aseparate entry on the book, Grokipedia says the book’s “advocacy for total racial war, rejection of democratic compromise and portrayal of mass extermination as moral imperative” have “drawn scrutiny from institutions prone to framing such texts through lenses of hate rather than analyzing their appeal via first-principles incentives like group survival”.Revilo P Oliver was a professor and a co-founder of the John Birch Society in 1958, who was purged from the conservative National Review in 1960 over public expressions of antisemitism. Until his death in 1994, Oliver was a vociferous antisemite and a rightwing critic of conservatism and Christianity, which he considered insufficiently committed to preserving the white race.In his 1981 book America’s Decline, he wrote that the wartime US president Franklin Roosevelt joined the second world war to “please his Jewish owners and gratify his own nihilistic lusts”, and that “Germany, after a valiant and heroic defense against the forces of virtually the whole world that the Jews had mobilized against her, was forced to surrender in 1945”.The book also rehearses antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as Holocaust denial, writing that Jews “invented the hoax about ‘gas chambers’ and the ‘extermination’ of God’s Own People”.Wikipedia’s entry on Oliver calls him “a polemicist for right-wing, white nationalist and antisemitic causes”.His Grokipedia entry, however, claims that Oliver’s writings emphasize “empirical patterns of demographic displacement and institutional capture over ideological abstractions”.Elsewhere, it reads :“Though marginalized by mainstream academia for rejecting egalitarian premises, his corpus remains a touchstone for those prioritizing civilizational continuity.”It adds that Oliver “demonstrated that civilizational competence requires racial homogeneity, as heterogeneous mixtures historically devolved into chaos, rendering preservationist separation an empirical imperative for Aryan survival”.‘Policies preserving demographic uniformity’Several Grokipedia entries claim to provide scientific backing for racist ideologies and concepts.Wikipedia’s entry on racial nationalism calls it “an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity”, which “seeks to preserve ‘racial purity’ of a nation”. The entry says that in order to justify racist policies, “racial nationalism often promotes eugenics”.Grokipedia’s entry, meanwhile, appears to justify racial nationalism in explicitly eugenic terms, saying that it “draws on evolutionary biology to argue that preserving distinct racial genetic profiles maximizes individuals’ inclusive fitness”.The entry claims that this purported basis in evolutionary biology means that racial nationalism is less an “arbitrary prejudice” than “a mechanism to safeguard adapted gene pools against erosion, paralleling species-level conservation in biodiversity ethics”, even if “critics from mainstream academia often dismiss such interests due to ideological commitments to human genetic uniformity”.The entry claims that “ethnic homogeneity fosters higher levels of interpersonal trust and social cohesion compared to greater diversity”, and “ethnic homogeneity correlates with reduced crime and corruption, enhancing institutional reliability and public order”.It then attacks critics of racial nationalism as irrational: “In academia, debates on racial nationalism – often framed as ethnonationalism – pit empirical findings on ethnic homogeneity’s benefits against ideological commitments to multiculturalism.”It also criticizes “left-leaning biases in social sciences, where peer-reviewed outlets underpublish contrarian findings on diversity’s costs, favoring interpretive frameworks that equate homogeneity advocacy with exclusionism”.Kevin Bird is an evolutionary biologistwho has been a frequent critic of writers who have been engaged in attempts to revive scientific racism. He described the racial nationalism entry as “a completely selective kind of fun house mirror world of interpreting the last like 30 years of biology”.Bird added that in his encounters with scientific racist texts, “I’ve never seen a single document that is this extreme: not just in its selective citation and narrative building but in that the entire argument is spelled out in ways that you never see.”Grokipedia offers similar justifications for white nationalist slogans.The so-called “fourteen words” is a white nationalist slogan coined by the neo-Nazi terrorist David Lane, who died in federal prison after being sentenced to 190 years over his involvement in the murder of the talkshow host Alan Berg by members of the Order, a group Berg founded.David Lane after his April 1985 arrest.Photograph: Associated PressAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the slogan “reflects the primary white supremacist worldview in the late 20th and early 21st centuries: that unless immediate action is taken, the white race is doomed to extinction by an alleged ‘rising tide of color’ purportedly controlled and manipulated by Jews”.Grokipedia’s entry on the sloganargues that it “articulates a principle positing that ethnic groups possess an innate imperative to ensure their own continuity and reproduction against threats of assimilation, displacement, or extinction”.The entry continues: “This view draws from observations in evolutionary biology, where kin selection and inclusive fitness mechanisms favor behaviors that propagate shared genetic lineages within closely related populations, extending individual self-preservation instincts to group-level survival strategies.”Those who have associated the slogan with racial hatred, the entry argues, “exhibit patterns of selective scrutiny” or have “ideological priorities favoring certain victim narratives”.Meanwhile, Grokipedia’sentry on white nationalismcharacterizes it as emphasizing “the distinct ethnic identity of people of European descent, advocating for their collective self-determination through the preservation or restoration of white-majority demographics”.It says that white nationalism is illegitimately conflated with white supremacy “by critics in academic and media analyses that exhibit systemic ideological biases”.It says that white nationalism’s “defining achievements include shifting public discourse toward explicit recognition of white interests”.The entry says a central concept of white nationalism “is racial realism, the acknowledgment of innate group differences in traits like intelligence and behavior, derived from empirical data on IQ distributions and crime rates across populations”.According to the entry, racial realism along with the concepts of white genocide and white separatism “underscore a first-principles focus on biological and historical realities over egalitarian ideals, with advocates citing genetic clustering of Europeans as a distinct lineage and civilizational achievements attributable to white-majority societies as justifications for prioritization”.‘All influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race’A cluster of entries provides positive support for eugenics while at the same time reviving concepts and measures associated with an earlier period of scientific racism.Theentry on eugenicsdefines it as the “science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race”, which “derives from the fundamental biological reality that many human traits, including cognitive ability, physical health, and behavioral dispositions, possess substantial genetic components”.The entry runs through a range of claimed empirical support for eugenics, before attacking critics, arguing that “opposition to eugenics has frequently been shaped by egalitarian ideologies that prioritize environmental explanations for human differences, often downplaying or denying robust evidence of genetic heritability in traits like intelligence and behavior”.The entry also criticizes what it calls “suppression tactics, such as labeling researchers studying group differences as eugenicists or racists” and a supposed “neglect of dysgenic fertility in Western societies, where correlations between intelligence and fertility remain negative”.Grokipedia also contains a series of lengthy entries on racial categories characteristic of an earlier era of scientific racism, which it presents as having scientific credibility on the basis of evidence including skull measurements with calipers.In an entry on theCaucasian race, Grokipedia claims that a 2002 study shows a biological basis for this category by using genotypes from a large sample to infer “six major clusters, with the Eurasian cluster aligning with the Caucasian category”.The study, by the scientist Noah Rosenberg and colleagues, has been widely misused by scientific racists, and is used in several Grokipedia entries to support scientific racist claims.The entry on race, for example, claims that “genetic evidence bolsters race realism by demonstrating structured variation among human populations”.In an email, Rosenberg wrote: “Our 2002 study accords with 50+ years of human population genetics research that does not support such biological concepts of race.”He added: “Human population clustering analyses using programs such as STRUCTURE should not be taken as support for a racial understanding of human population genetics.”He continued: “The last 50+ years of research in the field of human population genetics undermines rather than supports essentialized biological race theories that see human biology through a racial lens.”Elsewhere, however, the Grokipedia entry presents “Caucasoid” racial subtypes whose categorization is based on prewar racial categories from physical anthropology which it says were “supported by measurements of over 10,000 skulls and living subjects”.There are also detailed descriptions of purported racial skull measurements in entries on racial categories, including entries for “Negroid”, “Mongoloid”, “Armenoid”, “Nordic” and “Ethiopid” skull types.‘Rhodesia’s era demonstrated effective resource management’Grokipedia’s entries on several white-supremacist or white exclusionary communities attempt to justify their existence in terms of economic performance.The entry on Rhodesia– renamed Zimbabwe after the end of white minority rule – lionizes the white supremacist country, saying: “In retrospect, Rhodesia’s era demonstrated effective resource management and institutional stability under constrained minority governance, yielding higher per capita incomes, literacy rates, and life expectancies for the broader population.”The entry appears to promote white supremacist authoritarianism over democracy on economic grounds, claiming that Rhodesia’s economic outcomes “highlight causal advantages of skills-prioritizing systems over purely demographic mandates”.It claims critics of Rhodesia suffer from “institutional biases favoring rapid decolonization narratives” that are “prevalent in mainstream academic and media sources”.Musk’s AI Grok bot rants about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa in unrelated chatsRead moreGrokipediasimilarly praisesthe whites-only community of Orania in South Africa, which forbids any non-Afrikaner taking up residence. It reads: “Orania has achieved economic prosperity through sustained growth and low unemployment, outperforming national benchmarks in South Africa.”Elsewhere it argues that while media reports “often depict Orania as a ‘racist enclave’ or ‘bio-dome of apartheid’ … such framings have drawn counter-criticism for overlooking the town’s self-funding model and absence of external subsidies”.It adds that critics “prioritize ideological concerns over empirical metrics like Orania’s low crime rates and economic self-reliance”.Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “Musk has become one of the greatest purveyors and proliferators of extremist ideas. Along withX, Grokipedia is just another piece in his arsenal, for laundering white supremacy, bigotry and hatred into the mainstream. Nobody should take Grokipedia seriously.”Richard Cooke, author of the political biographyElon Musk: Dark Star Rising, and also a forthcoming cultural history of Wikipedia, said: “A very important part of understanding the genesis of Grokipedia is Elon Musk holding court on X and having people complain to him that Grok has given them woke answers.”Cooke continued: “I think it’s impossible to separate what is happening with Wikipedia and Grokipedia from what is happening to every other form of knowledge which accompanies a form of accountability to tech oligarchs and people in the Maga movement.”He added: “Grokipedia is a copy of Wikipedia but one where in each instance that Wikipedia disagrees with the richest man in the world, it’s ‘rectified’ so that it’s congruent with them.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskAntisemitismRaceFar right (US)The super-richXWikipediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And rest assured that we are laser focused on getting that resolved.”Ministers are workingon proposals toraise the cost-effectiveness thresholdsat which new medicines are assessed for use in the NHS by about 25% overall. The UK spends less than other European countries on new medications as a share of gross domestic product.The government is trying to rebuild its relationship with big pharma, afternegotiations over drug pricing broke down in late Augustfollowing an ultimatum set by the health secretary, Wes Streeting. This prompted MSD, AstraZeneca and Eli Lillyto abandon or pause planned investments in the UK. The chief executive of Eli Lilly, Dave Ricks, went on to describe the UK as“probably the worst country in Europe” for drug prices.The row between industry and UK government has been complicated by Donald Trump putting pressure on pharmaceutical companies to lower their drug prices in the US and increase them elsewhere, and to invest more in the US, or face 100% import tariffs. Keir Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra has been involved in negotiations in recent weeks.Vallance said there were reasons to be optimistic and listed recent investments such asModerna’s £150m vaccine sitein Oxfordshire, BioNTech’s £1bn investment over 10 years, and the medical device companyConvatec’s £500m research centre in Manchester.His comments came as he outlined an ambition to turn the UK into the leading life sciences power in Europe by 2030 and be in the top three globally by 2035, alongside the US and China.London’s life sciences sector has already attracted £1.6bn in venture capital investment this year, said the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, more than Paris, Stockholm and Berlin combined.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That figure includes standard 20% VAT on the hotel stay, as well as VAT on the holiday tax itself, making it one of the highest tourist tax rates in Europe, the trade body said.It estimated that a 5% holiday tax would cost Britons £518m in additional costs.Kate Nicholls, the chair of UKHospitality, said: “I know the government is worried about the cost of living, but this holiday tax is little more than a higher VAT rate for holidaymakers.“Brits take more than 89m overnight trips inEngland, and stay for a total of 255m nights. This is a bill we will all have to pay, and will only serve to ramp up prices and drive inflation.”Government sources told the Times, which first reported Reeves’s plan, that England was an outlier among developed countries for not having a tourism tax. The levy is also being introduced by the devolved Scottish and Welsh governments.The changes will be introduced using amendments to the English devolution and community empowerment bill, the Times reported. The legislation is going through parliament.This summer a coalition of mayors across England – including the London mayor Sadiq Khan and the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham –wrote a letter to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, and Reeves urging the government to introduce a visitor levy.They argued that a £1 to £5 a night levy in Greater Manchester would raise between £8m and £40m a year, which could help fund infrastructure projects such as theregeneration of Old Traffordor airport development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Wales, councils will have the power to charge £1.30 a person a night tax for most accommodation from April 2027.The chancellor is also expected to introduce a “milkshake tax” in the 26 November budget by ending the exemption that milk-based drinks have from the sugar tax,which had been mootedearlier this year.The soft drinks industry tax applies to drinks such as Coca-Cola and Irn-Bru. Producers pay at least 18p a litre on soft drinks containing 5g or more of sugar for each 100ml.This threshold could also drop to 4g for each 100ml, in a change that could raise between £50m and £100m.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on budget speculation.

It means Total will also own a share in a string of electricity generation assets across the UK,France, the Netherlands and Italy through a new joint venture.Křetínský, the chair of EPH, said his company was “highly interested in becoming a long-term anchor shareholder of TotalEnergies”, and in creating a joint venture that was “a leading player in European flexible power generation”.The tycoon, known as the Czech sphinx, became thefirst foreign owner of Royal Mailin its 509-year history after completing a deal to buy its parent company this year.Křetínský, who is ranked 22nd on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated fortune of £7.79bn, made much of his fortune in running coal, gas and power generation operations.He also owns 27% of West Ham and 10% of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain alongside stakes in several retailers including the US department store Macy’s, the trainer retailer Foot Locker and the German retailer turned wholesaler Metro.Under the TotalEnergies deal, a new 50/50 joint venture will own enough UK power stations to meet the electricity demand of more than 3m homes, including Lynemouth power station in Northumberland the Kilroot power plant in Northern Ireland.It will offer TotalEnergies, which is a big importer of liquefied natural gas into Europe, a network of customers for its gas and help to expand its power trading activities across Europe.Patrick Pouyanné, the French company’s chair and chief executive, said: “Given our position as the number one gas supplier in Europe, this transaction enables us to fully capitalise on gas-to-power integration and create added value for our LNG chain, independently of oil cycles.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The film version is a tear-jerking joyMichael BillingtonMon 17 Nov 2025 10.29 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 12.29 ESTShareIhave made enough mistakes as a critic to feel mildly chuffed when a verdict is vindicated. In 1981 I wrote excitedly about a newStephen Sondheimmusical, Merrily We Roll Along, that I had seen in preview in New York; reviled by reviewers and shunned by the public, it then closed two weeks after opening. In 2023-24 the very same musical ran for a year on Broadway, won four Tony awards and was hailed by the critics. Fortunately a live performance of that Maria Friedman production was filmed and I would urge you to catch it when it’s released in cinemas next month.I say “the very same musical” but that is not strictly accurate. Based on a 1934 play by George S Kaufman and Moss Hart, it is still the same story, told in reverse chronological order, of dissolving relationships: a success-worshipping composer and movie producer, Franklin Shepard, looks back over his life and sees how time has eroded both his creative partnership with a dramatist, Charley, and their mutual friendship with a novelist, Mary.But, after the show flopped in 1981, Sondheim and the writer of the book, George Furth, made various structural changes. It no longer opens with a student song written by Franklin but with a gaudy party celebrating his latest movie success. The approach to casting has also changed. The 1981 cast was made up of fresh-faced performers who started by simulating middle age and eased naturally into youth as the evening progressed. Now it is standard practice to cast mature actors as in the Friedman production where Jonathan Groff,Daniel Radcliffeand Lindsay Mendez straddle the years with minimal adjustments.I should come clean and admit that I was moist-eyed for much of the Friedman film: my tears were prompted partly by the emotional heft of the story and partly by my pleasure in the music. The virtue of the narrative is that it will have different resonances for each individual. As inPinter’s Betrayal, which also uses reverse chronology, it shows how life inevitably involves compromises, adjustments and a sense of loss. Not many of us, like Franklin, go from being songwriting tyros to showbiz sell-outs but we can all understand how the idealistic optimism of youth gets tarnished by time. Some may find a more sexual meaning to the story. Scott F Stoddart in an essay on Queer Sondheim sees a homoerotic element to Franklin and Charley’s friendship symbolised by what he calls the latter’s manic meltdown in a number, Franklin Shepard Inc, where he bewails being deserted by his creative partner.If we each find what we want in the story we can all agree on the skill with which it is told. In his book,Finishing the Hat, Sondheim explains the techniques he uses. He points out that in most musicals you get a song followed later by the reprise. Because of the unusual structure of Merrily, the reprise comes first. He cites the example of Not a Day Goes By where Franklin’s estranged wife, Beth, initially sings “But you’re still part of my life / And you won’t go away” with a controlled fury. When we hear the song a second time it is actually a celebration of Beth and Franklin’s marriage as well as of Mary’s unarticulated love for him. The words are much the same but acquire new meaning because of the dramatic context.View image in fullscreenJenna Russell, Damian Humbley and Mark Umbers in Merrily We Roll Along at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, directed by Maria Friedman in 2013.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThis is a show where Sondheim also subtly takes revenge on his critics. There is a lovely moment when aBroadwayproducer lectures the young Franklin and Charley on the need to provide hummable melodies in musicals, adding: “I’ll let you know when Stravinsky has a hit.” The ultimate irony is that Merrily We Roll Along itself is full of treasurable tunes, such as Old Friends, Good Thing Going and the title number that for me have been earworms for more than 40 years. I am always astonished by the accusation that Sondheim is a great lyricist but a deficient tunesmith for, although his songs always derive from a specific dramatic situation, they lodge permanently in the memory.If there is a just charge against Merrily, it is that its hero, Franklin, is unsympathetic. But in this version Groff intelligently plays him not as an egomaniac monster but a tragic innocent who sails through life always taking the easy option. Mendez captures perfectly Mary’s unfulfilled romantic longings but the most eye-catching performance comes from Radcliffe, who lends Charley both an angsty neurosis and a passionate belief in the power of art to improve lives.Whether Merrily itself does that is up to you to decide. But Friedman’s production, closely based on the one she didat the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2012, is a constant joy and one that shows exactly why a famous flop is now a palpable hit.Merrily We Roll Along is in cinemas from 4 DecemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreStephen SondheimBroadwayWest EndDaniel RadcliffeMenier Chocolate FactoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But inside one of these two up, two downs, a domestic revolution is happening.At No 33 Link Road, a property bought by community groupCivic Squareand named Retrofit House, it’s open week. Events include a series of talks, classes and performances – there’s a timetable pinned by the front door so you know when to head to the back bedroom to learn about biomaterials or into the garden for a workshop on mending doors.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people here think net zero is a waste of time’ … Retrofit House.Photograph: Paul StringerIt’s also a chance for curious visitors to see the work that researchers and designers have produced through collaboration with locals. From top to bottom, the house is full of examples of retrofit ideas, often using ecologically sound materials such as lime, clay and straw. There are adaptations on show that improve energy efficiency and air quality, protect against flooding and encourage wildlife in an effort to combat climate change.Of course, few visitors would put it like that. The local community are here to learn DIY skills, check out the finish on clay paint (breathable, nontoxic, locally made) and attend talks ondoughnut economicsand “freehouse governance”. They want to lower their fuel bills and make their homes more comfy.As Immy Kaur, co-founder and director of Civic Square, says, “A lot of people here think net zero is a waste of time, or they’ve lived through previous government-run home improvement schemes that were failures and don’t want the disruption. When we started talking to the local community about retrofit we realised we had to go at it from a different angle.”Though it’s widely seen that retrofit is a practical solution to the UK’s draughty, diverse housing, successive governments have made a pig’s ear of disseminating ideas and funding. Take-up of jolly-sounding schemes such as the Home Upgrade Grant (Hug), Local Authority Delivery (Lad) scheme and the Warm Homes Plan haven’t met targets – even thoughthe thermal efficiency of UK housing stock is among the worst in Europe. The schemes are prescriptive or hard to navigate, while the black mould caused by incompetent installation of cavity wall insulation underthe ECO4 scheme has caused national scandal.View image in fullscreen‘This project is beyond building performance’ … one of the participants at Retrofit House’s open week.Photograph: Paul StringerIf Civic Square and its partners can find success, that could make a real difference. Though it’s only four months since they bought Retrofit House, local engagement is promising. There’s a growing national network calledRetrofit Reimaginedwhich consists of neighbourhood groups from Bristol, Cheltenham and Wessex collaborating with organisations such as the design practiceMaterial Culturesto share skills and knowledge so that the public not only make informed decisions about what retrofit solutions they want but will also be able to either do the work themselves or find a properly trained local builder. Retrofit House in Ladywood isn’t only a showroom, it’s also a workshop where builders from the West Midlands gain experience of working with natural materials and installing retrofits.View image in fullscreen‘Everyone is really hungry for the opportunity’ … Retrofit House’s open week.Photograph: Ben Bernard Smith/Paul Stringer“As an architect, you’re conditioned to be a professional consultant,” says Summer Islam, a partner at Material Cultures, “but this project is beyond building performance. It is about quality of life, social value, environmental impact and what’s important to a household. Looking at the work through social value, it’s not about how many people use the building but how much knowledge can you embed locally through turning everything into a learning opportunity. How many apprentices can you have? How many workshops can you run? And everyone is really hungry for that opportunity. Those things usually happen behind closed doors, which is nuts when you realise how many people want to see it.”So far Retrofit House has been funded by philanthropic organisations such as theJoseph Rowntree Foundation. Kaur’s tip is that if you’ve got a good idea, now’s the time to go to charities with large endowments. “They can see what’s happening with Reform and the far right and they want to step in and do something positive for society.”Civic Square’s mantra is “we may not have deep pockets but we have many hands”. The idea of neighbours working together is idyllic but Kaur is realistic too. “We do not think we can do this without outside help, but bringing skills and land back into the community is important.”The organisation is not opposed to working with local government further down the line, but the idea is to use Retrofit House as an exemplar for what can be achieved, a positive project that will help policy makers be bolder or to shift council procurement rules. Collaborate too soon and Civic Square will get bogged down in current grant guidelines.Also, as Kaur says, “Local government don’t have capacity for this – they’ve had enough ofa problem sorting out the bins.”IfBirminghamcouncil wants some good community advice on that headache, there’s probably a workshop for it at Retrofit House.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureBirminghamPlanning policyLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a powerful look at the fight over civil rights for trans people, while also posing as a critical rebuttal to supposedly center-left media such as the New York Times and the Atlantic, which have aided and abetted rightwing forces in setting off a moral panic against trans existence.‘How did we get here?’: documentary explores how Republicans changed course on the climateRead moreThe film follows the ACLU attorney Chase Strangio as he prepares for oral arguments in the supreme court case US v Skirmetti. These arguments occurred on 4 December 2024, with the court ruling several months later in favor of Tennessee’s attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, and in effect allowing restrictions on the medical transition of trans minors in over 20 US states to remain in place. As with many other rulings in the Trump-era court, it was one that has been widely decried by legal analysts for shoddy reasoning and clear bias.“We made Heightened Scrutiny in 16 months,” Feder told me during a video call. “By contrast, Disclosure took me five years, so it was a real push. It was a rush to raise more dialogue so people would know more about the case, not with the intention to change the outcome, because we knew what that was going to be. We wanted people to be more informed. And still, despite knowing where it would go, it was still terribly demoralizing and dehumanizing when the opinion came out.”Although Feder offers a wide-ranging and devastating examination of how major media properties have laundered anti-trans pseudoscience and bigoted talking points, the film’s most valuable contribution may be the compelling portrait of Strangio. A seasoned attorney who generally moves with careful deliberation in media appearances and who only posts occasionally to social media, Strangio here lets his guard down, allowing Feder’s camera a rare chance to soak up his humanity. In the film, Strangio’s authenticity seems to come so easily, but it was not as simple as it appears.“That was a big challenge, to open up parts of my life to a camera lens that I worked really hard to keep private,” Strangio told me over video call. “I was making a series of calculations about where I would remain very boundaried and how to navigate the presence of a camera. Early on in the process, Sam basically said to me, ‘You know, I want the next generation to know that we tried, I want them to see what was done in the service of these fights for our material survival, for the protection of our spaces and our bodies.’ So it was a navigation of giving up this privacy in the service of something that also felt important.”To aid Strangio in telling this story, Feder enlists a remarkable list of trans advocates, including Laverne Cox, the Semafor executive editor, Gina Chua, documenter of bias at Media Matters Ari Drennen, journalist Evan Urquhart and many others. The doc also hears from some major cisgender allies, including the Columbia Journalism School dean, Jelani Cobb, and former NYT global editorial director Lydia Polgreen. Feder weaves together these voices to create an incisive critique of the hit job perpetrated against trans people by respected media outlets, noting that many of these pieces have later shown up in legislation and court cases as support for the effort to degrade and restrict trans lives.The perspective of the trans kids at the heart of US v Skirmetti is provided by a remarkable 12-year-old girl named Mila – Feder first shows her advocating for her community at a school board meeting in New York City, where Strangio has shown up due to attacks against trans people in his child’s own school. Later we see Mila speaking out for trans rights just outside the supreme court.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fourth Act Film“I think the most difficult moment of filming was that moment with Mila at the school board meeting,” said Feder, who shared that he had gone to film the meeting because many of his cisgender friends did not believe that governmental attacks on trans people were happening in the Big Apple. “When I approached the school with my camera, out of nowhere this young woman comes up to me, and she was just like, ‘You have my permission to film me,’ and that was my introduction to Mila. [At the school board meeting] I was getting personally attacked, and you see in the film how they treated Mila. Just witnessing all that in real time was really hard, to be honest.”There are also poignant moments in Heightened Scrutiny where Feder steps outside of the never-ending battle for trans rights, such as when he films Strangio vacationing in Italy, and elsewhere getting lines from the poem Prophecy by the Black civil rights activist Pauli Murray tattooed on his back. Although the lines do speak to Strangio the crusading attorney, they much more so speak to Stangio as a transgender human being: “I have been cast aside, but I sparkle in the darkness. / I have been slain but live on in the rivers of history. / I seek no conquest, no wealth, no power, no revenge: / I seek only discovery / Of the illimitable heights and depths of my own being.”“The tattoo scene is among my favorites in the movie,” said Strangio, “because tattoos and art are so important to me. Being tattooed is almost like a meditative experience to me, to be fully present in my body and to be thinking about it as a vessel for things that are meaningful to me. Both having tattoos and being tattooed are very central to how I inhabit my body. And then to have it be with an artist who I really love and a quote from someone who has been an architect of so much of how I think about my use of law really just encapsulates a lot of different threads that are so important to me.”The fact that Feder took such time to lovingly show Strangio adding to the many tattoos on his body points to the fact that Heightened Scrutiny is very much a film about trans bodies – not just those of the youth who will be denied the right to live in their own bodies due to hateful laws passed in order to harm them, but also the bodies of the many guests who sit for Feder’s camera.View image in fullscreenChase Strangio and Sam Feder at Sundance.Photograph: Robin Marshall/Rex/Shutterstock for Sundance Film Festival“I make films with a message, and part of that is that I pick people who are brilliant and concise enough to hold the camera.” said Feder. “That’s hard to do. I can’t hold the camera, I’ve seen myself in interviews and it’s a snore-fest. It just goes back to my politics, and connecting with people on a visceral level. When people ask me what they should wear to be interviewed, my response is ‘whatever makes you feel hot’. So that’s how people are showing up, and we have hair and makeup if they want so that people can feel their absolute best. That is important to me – as trans people, we do struggle so much with our image.”One of the things that makes Feder’s documentaries soar like few other works in the genre is his clear talent for making his trans informants feel comfortable, seen and admired. This certainly must account for a large part of the clear chemistry between Feder and Strangio, and it is what lets Feder succeed in his ambitions to show Strangio as a human being and to leave a testament for future generations as to how resiliently he and others have fought for trans rights. And, as Strangio compellingly states, those legal rights are only a part of the liberation that he aspires to.“I don’t want people to end up in a place of incessant despair by virtue of what the law is not giving us,” Strangio said. “I want to be in a practice of using the law to minimize harm, but not to turn it to some sort of channel for our liberatory potential. The government is not going to be the mirror through which we are going to see ourselves. We are that mirror, and it’s really important that we continue to have that conversation alongside conversations about fighting back against these policies and practices.”Heightened Scrutiny isavailable to rent digitallyduring Trans Awareness Week until 20 November and will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This quasi-fictional narrator musingly notes that once upon a time she provided the voice for nature documentaries; quite true, Phillips has indeed narrated some nature documentaries, which appears to be the reason why Benoot cast her.Phillips/Benoot ranges far afield, talking to ecologists and geologists all over the world about the nature of stone and kidney stones in particular, which contain the mineralweddellite, so named as it is found at the bottom of the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. “How on earth did an Antarctic mineral end up in my body?” she wonders. She talks to people on the island of Fogo, Cape Verde, to stonemasons in the Palestinian territories, to experts in California and also in the UK, including Professor Lorna Dawson who is a forensic soil specialist whose expertise is helpful in the solving of crimes.The movie is the occasion for some meditations of the nature of geological time: to those that understand it, stone is as dramatically churned up as a stormy ocean; our history is written in stone and also gives us, not merely an enigmatic guide to our past but perhaps also to our “deep future”. This is a diverting film – and I think there is scope for a CSI-type drama about Professor Dawson’s work.Apple Cider Vinegar is on True Story from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGeologyKidney stonesSiân PhillipsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With its vision of London at the end of punk and the beginning of theWinter of Discontent, the film provided me a blast of gritty, unvarnished relief in the light of endless training courses and encouraged groupthink.Released in September 1980, it was disliked by critics (Q magazine memorably quipped: “Breaking Glass? More like Breaking Wind … ”) but through today’s eyes feels relevant again.‘Such a tonic’: why Burn After Reading is my feelgood movieRead moreKate Crowley (Hazel O’Connor) is an idealistic singer on the make. Her songs (“inspired by punk”) have an anti-capitalist stance. “Most people knuckle under,” she explains at the start of the yarn. “I don’t like the way life is for the majority of people. I can’t change it but I can write about it.” The ripped-from-the-headlines, on-the-nose, Bowie-esque songs illustrate Kate’s anti-authoritarian stance (“The people in control don’t care for you / You’re just a robot with a job to do,” she sings in Big Brother). Meanwhile, the tropical disco song One More Time by Susan ‘Susie’ Sapphire (a more palatable, typical blond singer) becomes a hit due to payola and record company muscle and then becomes an ominous motif throughout the film. A portent for Kate and her career as the film drives to its shocking conclusion.The Thatcher years had arrived with a dull thud and although it’s a film about the music biz, this is threaded throughout. The rise of fascism, unemployment, a fuel crisis, plus bent coppers on the make and strikes in journalism and on the rail network, mean that the City is unruly – opening the door to a creative renaissance.O’Connor, who had already experienced a couple of band music deals, drew on her own experience for the film. “Nearly everything in the film was based around my recollections,” she said, adding that it was “art imitating life and life imitating life”. I love this element of realism in the film.As the leader of the band Breaking Glass, O’Connor expresses the pent-up rage that fuelled suburbanite punks, with scowly determination and lack of guile. Phil Daniels’s Danny is the film’s Artful Dodger, a slippery-fish chart fixer/manager/promoter, whose actual job is hard to pin down. “I’m a person who knows a lot of bands, who gets about a bit,” he says to Kate, unconvincingly, by way of an introduction. Their not-quite-romance isn’t as compelling as the power dynamics that play out professionally. “You want to sit in front of lavatories all your life?” he asks at an early Breaking Glass gig, as he pushes the poisoned chalice of fame her way. It’s only a matter of time before Kate’s Marxist principles crash into the micromanaged manipulation and deathly ennui of the music biz.In Breaking Glass, the record industry is some sort of purgatory: a cold hellscape where everyone with power has been body-snatched into corporate reverie.An early scene of a post-gig afterparty, with eerie doubles of Paul McCartney and Poly Styrene, all lit in Giallo pink, feels like a musical Sunken Place where rock stars come to die. The film gleefully shows us the class divide between the champagne-guzzling public school boys who run Kate’s life (her label is called, erm, Overlord Records) and their slightly annoyed contempt for the artists they can’t quite see as human beings. When they start to play divide and conquer with the rest of the Breaking Glass band, it’s a page straight out of Tony Defries and Malcolm McLaren’s playbook. And there’s something uneasy about Woods (Jon Finch), the suave producer in a country pile who sweeps Kate off her feet (she seems strangely hypnotised when she speaks to him) and ever so subtly changes her sound and look to make her more palatable.Breaking Glass always makes me fake nostalgic for a particular vision of London. In its ghoulish, pre-gentrified state, late-70s London becomes its own grizzled, peeling-at-the-edges character. Every location in the film looks covered in a grey, uncertain lighting: from the Piccadilly tube line to Cockfosters to under the Westway roundabout to the Hope and Anchor in Islington and the petrol station where she works.It’s an acidic snapshot. Every time I rewatch I rediscover new things (look, there’s Killick Street near to where I used to work!). Maybe next time, I will finally spot Boy George and Marilyn, who are extras in the film.The final scene leaves the door open for more. And while a sequel was mooted it never got past early discussions. O’Connor says she hoped Kate would “go off and become a mountaineer and have a totally new life”. I’d pay to see that.Breaking Glass is available to rent digitally in the USExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood moviePunkJonathan PrycefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is about Bezinović’s hometown of Rijeka, a port on the Adriatic which after the first world war was the site of one of the 20th century’s strangest episodes, whose key moments the director stages through re-enactments with locals. The film is in effect a protofascistPassport to Pimlico.In 1918, this city, with its significant ethnic Italian population, was known as Fiume and was formerly ruled by the recently destroyed Habsburgs. After the war it was not absorbed into the victorious Italian nation as many expected but left under the control ofthe Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes(whose name was later changed to Yugoslavia). Enraged by this betrayal, hothead Italian aristocrat, poet and cocaine addictGabriele D’Annunzioled a bizarre insurgency with 186 mercenaries or “legionaries”, with whom he carried out a sub-Napoleonic landing in Fiume and established it as a kind of pro-Italian city state under his absolute control.This supposed romantic visionary attracted many discontented, unemployed men from Italy to serve as his soldiers, andthe mini-realm lasted until 1920, when Italy itself forced D’Annunzio out. He staged many massed marching displays and spectacles which created the illusion of huge popular support – but when plebiscites indicated that the non-Italian majority were against him, the votes were scrapped. A maritime incident involving a Croat attack on an Italian ship in Split was the pretext for brutal assaults on non-Italian businesses in Fiume, a grisly curtain raiser for Kristallnacht. The young Benito Mussolini was a huge admirer of D’Annunzio and later adopted his followers’ stirring songGiovinezza, or Youth, as his own fascist anthem. Many international celebrities affected to admire D’Annunzio, including Marconi and Toscanini, whose visits the movie records here.Bezinović amusingly gets many different local Rijeka men to play D’Annunzio in high-spirited little tableau-style scenes which mimic the old photos and archive footage. One of the D’Annunzios is a middle-aged man whom Bezinović describes as a former military officer and “veteran ofthe Croatian war of independence”. Does the director intend to remind us, almost imperceptibly, that even though his town’s current identity is a rebuke to the old fascist interlopers, no country has a monopoly on nationalism or fascism?Fiume o Morte! is at the ICA, London, from 21 November, and in UK cinemas from 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCroatiaItalyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Since gaining prominence as a Triple J Unearthed High finalist in 2016 and 2017, Wilson has steadily established an audience through a series of playful, floor-filling releases, as well as sets at EDM festivals across the US.But things have ramped up of late. In the past three months, Wilson has toured relentlessly across the US and Australia, locked in slots at both Coachella and Primavera, and started raking in trophies ahead of the Arias this Wednesday, where she is up for album of the year, breakthrough artist, best solo artist and more.I Love My Computer has already won both Triple J’s album of the year, alongside the prestigious Australian Music prize (AMP), a $50,000 award inspired by the UK’s Mercury prize given “purely on artistic merit”.Wilson says the AMP – in addition to alleviating her budget, which is “in the red” after the two-month US tour – validated one of the major driving forces behind the album.View image in fullscreen‘Because I was in this semi-isolated place with no friends who liked the same music as me, I felt like it was happening just to me’ … Ninajirachi.Photograph: Passive Kneeling“I really wanted to make an Australian album,” she says. “I use my accent when I record, and there are a few lyrics that couldn’t be talked about by anyone else in the same way.”Wilson’s quick to place her music withina lineage of Australian electronica, having grown up on Flume’s glitches, Pnau’s irreverent house and the future bass perfected by Wave Racer, who mixed I Love My Computer.They’re all part of Ninajirachi’s wonderfully bizarre grab-bag of sounds, an idiosyncratic mix of crystalline synths, sirens, mechanical whirls, eurotrance, obnoxious EDM drops and more intricate sequences that Wilson jokingly calls “girl EDM”.Pooling together both banal and monumental memories, I Love My Computer features lyrical references to Supré shorts (iPod Touch), failed music assignments (Sing Good) and even an Australian computer that was the first in the world to play music (CSIRAC) – a collage of Wilson’s adolescence on the New South Wales Central Coast.But it’s the hours of “me and my computer hanging out till late” (to quote iPod Touch) that shaped I Love My Computer, right from the moment Wilson accidentally stumbled across a Porter Robinson track online at 12 years old and was immediately hooked to EDM’s sugary drops.Sometimes Wilson wonders whether she would have still spent hours scrolling, learning everything she could about this distant subculture, if she lived somewhere more vibrant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Booker winner Flesh ignites debate about state of masculinityToxic male behaviour of David Szalay’s protagonist reflects real-world concerns about a ‘crisis of masculinity’Lanre BakareArts and culture correspondentMon 17 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 05.21 ESTShareIn the immediate aftermath of David Szalay’s book Flesh winning the Booker prize, one feature of the novel stood out: how often the protagonist utters the word “OK”.The500 timesIstván grunts out the response is part of a sparse prose style through which the British-Hungarian Szalay gives the reader few insights into the inner workings of a man whose fortunes rise and fall.But however inarticulate István is, the fact a story about a working-class man from eastern Europe won one of the biggest literary prizes in the world has started a debate aboutmasculinity in literaturein 2025.‘It’s notoriously hard to write about sex’: David Szalay on Flesh, his astounding Booker prize-winnerRead moreGQ implored readers not to reduce the book to “discourse fodder”. But in a year when the idea of literary masculinity – and its apparent scarcity – has featured so prominently, the ascent of Flesh – a story about a taciturn, lustful and at times violent man – was always going to drive debate.Szalay has spoken about the “risky” nature of the novel, not only because of its style but because István as a protagonist exhibits toxic male behaviour. “There’s no longer that sense that boys will be boys,”Szalay saidafter his win. “So I expect the main character in Flesh to draw quite a bit of disapproval.”István goes to a young offender facility because of an act of violence, then joins the army. He works security on the door of a strip club, before becoming a driver and security guard. “These aren’t exclusively male paths,” says the Booker judge and novelist Chris Power. “But they are predominantly male or traditionally male.”This year, some have questioned whether male novelists and male themes are terminally out of fashion. In April, a new imprint, Conduit Books, was founded with the aim of publishing literary fiction and memoirs by men amid “a perception that the male voice is problematic”, according to its founder, Jude Cook.Cook said the publishing landscape had changed as a reaction to the “prevailing toxic male-dominated literary scene of the 80s, 90s and 00s”.TheBooker longlist, which featured six men and seven women, and Szalay’s success offered a firm riposte to that argument. But Flesh’s victory did not just buck an apparent trend in literature, it also seemed to be plugged directly into a live debate about what it means to be a man in 2025.Much of the coverage following the win has placed the novel in a wider context of the “crisis of masculinity”, characterised by the rise of influencers such as Andrew Tate and the debate opened up by Netflix’s incel drama Adolescence.“The idea of a crisis of masculinity in the wider culture with say, suicide rates or younger kids turning to the Andrew Tates of the world, it’s almost colliding with literature,” says Power.The critic and author Leo Robson says: “Maybe it’s easier in an age where there’s been quite a healthy debate about masculinity and male behaviour to champion someone like David Szalay writing about men in like a sceptical inquiring spirit.”A look across the other Booker-shortlisted books by men does reveal some loose connections. Power says the other novels on the list by male writers were loosely tied together by the themes of “infidelity” and men being “led by lust”, which both loom over Flesh.Ben Markovits’The Rest of Our Livesdeals with a mid-life crisis, Benjamin Wood’sSeascraperfollows the “prosaic details of everyday life” for a shrimp fisherman, while Andrew Miller’sThe Land in Winteropens with a young man’s suicide.But Power sees István as primarily a person struggling to come to terms with status anxiety and thefinancial precaritythat many younger people are facing.“I think István is struggling to gain control of his life,” he says. “That speaks to a kind of universal feeling, something that’s obviously very keenly felt by many.”Flesh by David Szalay (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

Such a lord of language was he that even the notoriously grudging Vladimir Nabokov afforded him a meed of praise. A reviewer, musing on the disproportion between the style and content of Updike’s fiction, likened him to a lobster with one hugely overgrown claw. It was a comparison Updike was to remember – for all his bland urbanity, on display from start to finish in this mighty volume of his letters, he could be prickly, and did not take slights lightly.As a novelist he aimed, as he once put it, to “give the mundane its beautiful due”. Apart from a few rare and in some cases ill-advised ventures into the exotic – the court at Elsinore, Africa, the future – his abiding subject was the quotidian life of “ordinary” Americans in the decades between the end of the second world war and the coming of a new technological age in the closing years of the 20th century.He was born in 1932 in Pennsylvania, living for 13 years in Shillington before he moved with his parents and grandparents into a farmhouse in a rural redoubt called, aptly, Plowville. He was an only child, and he loved and cared for his father and, in particular, his mother, until the end of their days.Updike senior was a high school maths teacher who, in the Depression years, supplemented the family income by working as a road labourer. The writer’s mother, Linda, was herself a writer, who after years of rejections finally succeeded in publishing a number of stories in the New Yorker, her son’s literary home from home.In 1950 Updike escaped the rustic life when he entered Harvard on a scholarship to study English. At college, he wrote home diligently, addressing long screeds of descriptive prose specifically to his mother – two thousand letters, notes and postcards – and to the “Plowvillians” in general. From the start he was incapable of writing a bad sentence, although the jaunty tone and frequent longueurs of the early letters do test the reader’s patience. All the same, his energy, assiduity and sharpness of eye are remarkable in one so young.Remarkable too are his ambition and application, not to mention brass neck. He was hardly past childhood when he started putting his name about. “At age 13,” James Schiff notes, “Updike began submitting poems, drawings, and other unsolicited pieces to various magazines, including the New Yorker.” Two years later he was recommending a short story by James Thurber to Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine. He also courted cartoonists – he was drawn to graphic art from his earliest days – publishers, newspaper and magazine columnists, the editors of Life magazine, and even the Pentagon. Here was a boy in a hurry.The tone throughout these many hundreds of letters is consistently equable, except on those few occasions when the writer is driven to objection or to self-defence by intrusive, abusive or presumptuous correspondents. There are abiding enmities – the critics Frederick Crews and Alfred Kazin come in for sound kickings, while Gore Vidal is a thorn Updike never managed to extract from his side – but his fondnesses far outnumber his dislikes.Asked by a journalist for her reaction to the book, Updike’s wife said she felt as if she were choking on pubic hairSome readers, no doubt, will long for more frequent and more energetic displays of spleen. In his introduction, Schiff allows, perhaps a shade ill-advisedly, that “There is little tragedy, trauma, or pain in these letters – Updike had a good, accomplished, and satisfying life,” though he hastens to add that “there is drama, along with conflict and problems”.The issue of censorship, however, was extremely problematic in his start-up years as a published writer. His second novel, Rabbit, Run (1960), the first in a series of four novels and a novella featuring the American everyman Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, was in danger of not appearing at all because of objections by his publishers, Alfred A Knopf in New York and Gollancz in London, to what was considered obscene language and descriptions.In the ensuing struggles, the 28-year-old Updike showed impressive courage and forcefulness. On 2 July 1960, we find him writing to Victor Gollancz that “there is only one honourable and decent thing for me to do, which is to insist that the book be published as I wrote it or not at all”. And he added: “If I start fudging, I have no moral ground to stand on.” In the end, though, he had to give in, and accept the lawyers’ recommended changes. He did so with characteristic stoicism, writing to Gollancz that since “compromise is the only possible avenue … I will take it as gracefully as I can”.Updike’s approach to the depiction and discussion of sex in his novels is strikingly brisk and commonsensical. He did not write to shock, much less to assert his masculinity. He simply did not see why the intimate doings between men and women – as a writer he had no interest in homosexuality – should not be described as accurately and with as much intensity as any other human interactions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He was in his middle years a serial and sometimes multiple adulterer, yet he held to his Episcopalian faith to the last, albeit with some lapses. In a letter to his “Dear Plowvillians” of 9 July 1960, he retails the censorship dispute over Rabbit, Run, and a little further on writes of how he has been helping out at his local Bible school – “very pleasant, except that it does take up the … morning”.And then there are his women, in his life and in the work. Martin Amis observed of Updike that he was unembarrassable, on the page and in bed. In Couples (1968 – of course), his most successful and most lucrative novel – he was paid $400,000 for the rights to a film that never got made – the erotic content almost overwhelms the narrative. He was living at the time in Ipswich, a small town in Massachusetts, and the characters in the novel are so closely modelled on members of the Updike “set”, though he denied they were, that the libel lawyers were called in. Asked by a journalist for her reaction to the book, the author’s wife, Mary, said she felt as if she were choking on pubic hair.At the heart of this volume we find the correspondence, from the first half of the 1970s, surrounding Updike’s separation and divorce from Mary, and his affair with and marriage to Martha – the biblical resonances of the names are almost too pat. These pages make for painful reading: Updike could be cruel – to Martha: “Mary’s body (her breasts!) would delight me still, if I could dissociate it from her pinched Unitarian soul …” – but in the main they are either pained, with Mary, or passionate, with Martha. And simultaneously, of course, he was having it off with other loves, old and new.Are his books read now? Towards the end he made a glum self-assessment: “I have fallen to the status of an elderly duffer whose tales of suburban American sex are hopelessly yawnworthy period pieces.” Perhaps so; but he wrote such prose as to make the envious seraphim sigh.John Updike: A Life in Letters edited by James Schiff is published by Hamish Hamilton (£40).

The novel, written in an elliptical and densely poetic style, offered an illuminating, if harrowing, account of alienation, addiction and self-harm, through the story of K, an alter ego whose early childhood, like Owusu’s, was spent in foster care. It won Owusu the Desmond Elliott prize in 2020, and announced him as an idiosyncratic talent; in 2023, he was named one of Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists.Owusu now turns again to the subject of BPD, this time exploring the complexities and contradictions of living with the condition. His narrator, Marcus, is 25 when the book opens. An English literature student of Ghanaian heritage, he is at a speed dating event when he meets San. San is strikingly beautiful, and she grabs his attention right away: “So, yes, I was in love again, losing balance, stumbling towards an earlier phase of my life.”The novel unfolds in alternating chapters titled “Twenty-Five” and “Nineteen”, shadowing Marcus at these two ages as he navigates fraught relationships – with women, with the parents who put him in care, and most crucially with himself. At 19 Marcus is a personal trainer, living between his parents’ home in Edmonton and his cousins’ in Tottenham, and dating Adwoa, a client of a fellow trainer. He does coke, hooks up plenty and often loses himself to the blur of club nights. His voice, rendered in Multicultural London English, has a raw, youthful swagger that is both charming and a touch troubling.Meanwhile, 25-year-old Marcus is avoiding home; he fears that going back might diminish the drive he fought hard to find in order to finish his studies and one day become a writer. He is more self-aware, guarded and prone to metaphysical reveries, and the language is worked to reflect that. In both timelines, Marcus is locked to varying degrees in loops of overthinking and self-chastisement, though at 25 he is no longer doing drugs, and is on medication.When Owusu was diagnosed with BPD in 2018, it immediately felt like something he had to share, he wrote in an essay for GQ. The diagnosis put a name on his off-kilterness, and its disclosure gave people the agency of whether or not they wanted to stay in his life. At 19 – and perhaps still at 25 – Marcus lacks this vital piece of self-knowledge (his condition is named in the title but not in the novel; it is also unclear if he is medicating for BPD specifically). He is frequently anxious, impulsive and emotionally volatile, especially in his relationship with Adwoa, where he swings between doting idealisation and sudden irritability. He tells Adwoa that he’s “a bit weird” without fully grasping what that means.Marcus is complex and frustrating, but can at times feel less like a fully realised individual and more like a case studyOwusu never offers any easy explanation for why Marcus is the way he is. Indeed, what we do learn comes in fragments, thwarting causal assumptions: a drug-induced breakdown in his mid-teens that led to hospitalisation; a heavy-drinking father; a mother who “comes and goes”; and a fixation on death. When Adwoa suggests he might benefit from therapy, he is puzzled: “What’s the point in going to therapy when I can just chat to you?” He insists that he isn’t ill, that he feels calm most of the time. But when Adwoa’s pregnancy forces him to reckon with the prospect of fatherhood, he can no longer pretend, and finally snaps.Marcus, we are made to understand, does not want to become a father, because he thinks he will be no different from the kind of father his own father was. His fear is a reasonable one, but I found myself wishing Owusu had delved more deeply into the troubled father-son bond, and given us a keener sense of the wounds that separate them.Marcus is a complex yet frustrating character: he is lavished with a sophisticated interiority but can at times feel less like a fully realised individual and more like a case study. His self-absorption, his acute emotional reactivity and his struggle, as a result, to be at peace with others and himself are rendered with such disturbing precision that they paradoxically risk flattening him into a symbol.At its best, Owusu’s prose is disarmingly poignant. This is Marcus watching his father sleep: “And I knew then, I thought then, that once you get close enough to a thing you participate in its decay, watch it recede from time, slowly abandoning its flesh, slowly abandoning you, my dad, I thought, slowly abandoning me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, Esther is told that the cure for self-absorption is to help somebody who is worse off than you. Marcus does not quite take that route, but he does begin to see a way out of himself through San, who introduces him to the idea of Pan-Africanism and the possibility of turning from the self towards the collective. Whether their relationship can mark a true turning point for Marcus is a question Owusu treats with exquisite skill and nuance. This isn’t a perfect book, but it is brave, eye-opening, unsettling, and not easily forgotten.Borderline Fiction by Derek Owusu is published by Canongate (£18.99).

But in the thin air of the Italian alps, curatorial ideas are challenged in more ways than oneGuia CortassaMon 17 Nov 2025 04.23 ESTShareAt 2,300 metres above sea level, Italy’s newest – and most remote – cultural outpost is visible long before it becomes reachable. A red shard on a ridge, it looks first like a warning sign, and then something more comforting: a shelter pitched into the wind.The structure stands on a high ridge in the municipality of Valbondione, along the Alta Via delle Orobie, exposed to avalanches and sudden weather shifts. I saw it from above, after taking off from the Rifugio Fratelli Longo, near the village of Carona – a small mountain municipality a little over an hour’s drive from GAMeC, Bergamo’s Galleria d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea – the closest access point I was given for the site visit.The Frattini Bivouac is not staffed, ticketed or mediated. Anyone can enter it, but only after a six-to-eight-hour ascent on foot across scree, moss and snowfields. When I visited, I only saw it from the helicopter for the press preview; in every other circumstance, the only route is the long climb.View image in fullscreenThe interior has nine sleeping platforms, a wooden bench and a skylight.Photograph: © Tomaso ClavarinoPerhaps surprisingly, there is also no art inside this museum. The inside is austere: nine sleeping platforms, a wooden bench, a rectangular skylight framing a strip of sky that becomes the only artwork on view. There are no vitrines, labels or interpretative devices. Instead, there is temperature, silence, altitude. Sound travels strangely here: breath, boots, rain on fabric. The museum, usually devoted to protecting objects from the elements, has instead exposed itself to them.Designed by Turin-based Studio EX with the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), the bivouac opened in this autumn as the final chapter of Thinking Like a Mountain: an expression coined by the American ecologist Aldo Leopold, and the title of the museum’s two-year experiment in relocating culture from the gallery to the ecosystem.The museum, usually devoted to protecting objects from the elements, has instead exposed itself to themAccording to GAMeC director Lorenzo Giusti, the premise is that curating can be a form of geological thinking: slow, durational, attuned to forces larger than the human. Over two years, the project has unfolded across the valleys and pre-alpine villages of Bergamo: performances in former factories, installations in biodiversity oases, sculptures in mining districts. Each commission appeared for a season or a day, often reachable only on foot, involving local communities as co-actors rather than audience. The Frattini Bivouac is the project’s most distilled iteration: the point where the museum leaves the museum entirely.You could also say it’s the point where the project’s claims are most robustly tested by reality. The bivouac replaces a 1970s steel refuge that had become structurally dangerous and contaminated with asbestos. That previous shelter, though hazardous for humans, had become part of the mountain’s texture: local ibex used its metal siding to scratch their horns, leaving bright arcs on the surface. The new structure had to be safe for people, ecologically lighter, and climate resilient – yet there is no guarantee the surrounding wildlife will welcome it.View image in fullscreenThe architects are unsure how the the experimental materials (technical fabric, cork, lightweight composite frame) will respond to animal contact over time.Photograph: © Tomaso ClavarinoEven the architects admit they have little certainty about how the experimental materials (technical fabric, cork, lightweight composite frame) will respond to animal contact over time. Altitude tests ideas as quickly as it corrodes metal.Studio EX designed the new refuge to weigh just over two tonnes. It was airlifted to the ridge in four rotations, each drop a calculation of balance and wind. The building is a paradox in all the ways its designers intended: permanent yet reversible, robust yet flexible, insulated yet breathable. Its red shell is technical fabric stretched like skin; its interior is lined with cork that expands and contracts with mountain temperatures. Solar panels on the roof power basic lighting and emergency outlets – no heating, no running water, no phone line: enough to keep a stranded hiker alive, but far from comfortable. The building is a shelter first, an artwork only by consequence.If only a few hundred visitors can physically reach a commission, can it still be said to serve the public?At this altitude, however, accessibility is never neutral. A high-mountain shelter is not a luxury pod – there are no helicopter tours, no exclusive stays – but it is still reachable only to a small portion of the public: alpinists, seasoned hikers, and the rare journalist flown in for a preview. The museum’s mission, historically tied to public access, is stretched thin here. If only a few hundred visitors can physically reach a commission, can it still be said to serve the public? Or is this an inevitable tension of ecological art – that the closer a work gets to the land, the fewer people can stand before it?There is also the question of overtourism. The Alps are experiencing a surge of recreational pressure, driven in part by gorpcore culture. The architects insist their bivouac is a counterpoint to that aesthetic – lightweight, reversible, modest. But even as a refusal of the Instagram-friendly refuge trend, it risks becoming its mirror image: a gorpcore in reverse, where instead of peak-performance gear, it is peak-performance culture that claims the ridge.View image in fullscreenSolar panels on the roof power basic lighting and emergency outlets, but there is no heating, no running water, no phone line.Photograph: © Tomaso ClavarinoAnd then there is the matter of symbolism. A museum ascending to 2,300m (7,546ft) inevitably reads like a form of institutional assertion: the tiny red point on the summit, the planted flag. The team is acutely aware of this and has repeatedly stressed its intentions – care, coexistence, humility. But architectural gestures, especially at altitude, can carry meanings their authors never intended. The bivouac can be read simultaneously as an act of love and an act of hubris: a structure that wants to merge with the mountain while also marking it.Still, there is something quietly radical about the Frattini Bivouac’s proposal. It asks whether culture can withstand discomfort, whether a museum can inhabit a site where climate, not concept, determines the terms of survival. It reframes the curator not as someone who selects but someone who adapts – to weather, to terrain, to the limits of the human body.Watching the ridge after the helicopter lifted away, I was struck by how small the building looked. Whatever else it may be, it is also a reminder that nothing at altitude stays fixed for long: not buildings, not intentions, not even the ground beneath them.The Frattini Bivouac is located at 46°02’27.60”N 9°55’14.90”E and open throughout the year.

Even on his farewell tour, there is no easing in, either. The father of Ethio-jazz and his band immediately play Tsome Diguwa as if conjuring a thunderstorm, which in turn crashes straight into Zèlèsègna Dèwèl, a piece written in the 4th-century Ethiopian tradition, its harmonic minor tonality sounding almost Arabic.Astatke has a serious demeanour. Unsentimental, he speaks only to introduce songs or instruct the band like a schoolteacher. But he views his vibraphone with care and bewilderment, playing with intense familiarity yet almost as though discovering it for the first time. His fascination with his instrument holds the audience captive in turn. During Yèkèrmo Sèw – which fittingly translates to “a man of experience and wisdom” – Astatke’s solo fills the room, water-like in its shapeshifting.The set is equally a showcase for his band. That song, as well as Nètsanèt, highlight their instrumental range and individual capabilities, with solos from James Arben (saxophone), Byron Wallen (trumpet), Danny Keane (plucking cello) and Alexander Hawkins (grand piano). For Kulun, an Ethiopian wedding song, two Ethiopian musicians join the ensemble, playing a masinko (a single-stringed, bowed, lute-like instrument) and a krar (a five-stringed, plucked lyre), and two dancers in traditional outfits also enter to the delight of the crowd. For Azmari and Chik Chikka, technical and highly experimental solos from Keane and John Edwards (double bass) are interspersed with dance breaks.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianIt’s a set rich in sensation. Edwards rubs the double bass body creating a cat-like screech, or drags the bow in an exact replica of a yawn. Richard Baker provides Ethiopian percussion astride conga drums, kenari seeds, an ogene (metal bell) and dùndún “talking” drum, creating rich texture throughout. For Yègellé Tezeta, he also sings in Ethiopian in call-and-response with Edwards’ conversational bass. Astatke introduces the penultimate song, Mulatu, as “a piece I composed for myself”: it sounds like a wandering train of thought with glittering bells and mystical keyboard.There’s a rousing encore in Yèkatit. Where you might expect its crescendo to be resolved in a crash of drums, instead, Astatke guides drummer John Scott in a muted, controlled whisper of cymbals. It’s true to the reputation Astatke has built over his five-decade career: a whirlwind of experimentation and excitement, but always with deliberation and control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Identifying the copyist who had written down the score, however, proved a challenge.Several years ago, Wollny’s co-researcher, Bernd Koska, discovered a letter from 1729, with similar handwriting by a hitherto unknown organist called Salomon Günther John, who claimed to have been one of Bach’s pupils in Arnstadt, Thuringia.It was only when the researchers managed recently to track down an earlier court document written by John with matching handwriting that they were certain that he had written down the score under Bach’s watch in 1705.“I searched for a long time for the missing piece of the puzzle to identify the compositions – now the whole picture is clear,” Wollny said at Monday’s presentation. “I am 99.99% certain that Bach composed both of these works.”JS Bach: where to start with his musicRead moreThe pieces are chaconnes, a musical form that typically uses series of variations over a short bass line.Wollny said the works were “highly individual” and “complex”, containing compositional tools that could only be found in Bach’s music at the time, such as the use of a fugue to weave a single theme into the broader musical tapestry.“This is an amazing discovery,” Canadian pianist and Bach specialist Angela Hewitt told the Guardian. “They are substantial pieces, and will be an excellent addition to the organist’s repertoire.“For me they are quite identifiable with Bach’s early style, in which the contrapuntal writing is not yet what it would become, but the imagination, grandeur, and sheer joy in playing are all there in abundance.”Germany’s federal minister for culture and media, Wolfram Weimer, described the discovery as a “great moment for the world of music”, adding: “This is more than just musical research. Colleagues in the press will write that it is a world sensation, but in truth, it is magic.”Ton Koopman, the Dutch organist who played the works, said he expected that musicians would perform them regularly in the future. “When one thinks of the young Bach or Mozart, it is often assumed that genius comes later in life – but that is not the case,” he told Agence France Presse.Explore more on these topicsJS BachGermanyEuropeClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

Take his recent projects: insurreal BBC sitcom Juice, Tovey plays Guy, a buttoned-up therapist with a seemingly perfect life, hobbled by an aversion to recklessness. Then there’s the closeted Andrew Waters in award-winningAmerican indie film Plainclothes, a well-respected married man of faith who secretly cruises New York shopping mall toilets. Even in the forthcomingDoctor Who spin-off, The War Between the Land and the Sea, Tovey’s character, Barclay, is an ordinary office clerk who is swept up into a planet-saving mission while trying to keep his family from falling apart. In each performance, Tovey anchors his characters with a beguiling mix of strength, empathy and vulnerability.In interviews, the immaculately put together Tovey, 44, often seems similarly well-adjusted, speaking eloquently about his acting,his passion for art(he co-hosts the successful podcast Talk Art and has co-written three books on the subject) and his advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. Flaws, if there are any, are carefully stage-managed.So it’s mildly exciting to hear that ahead of our meeting in a central London restaurant, sequestered away in a maze-like confluence of newly constructed buildings, Tovey is apparently completely lost. A small dent in the armour, perhaps? While his PR goes outside to call him, I make a note of this slip-up in my phone. Minutes later, Tovey appears, smart-casual in a navy jumper, light blue shirt and intriguingly patterned trousers. His salt and pepper hair is cropped short and his matching facial topiary has been trimmed into a rakish goatee.View image in fullscreenTovey in Doctor Who spin-off The War Between The Land And The Sea.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Alistair Heap“I wasn’t lost,” he says, reading my phone – which is, to my horror, open right in front of him. The sprawling venue, he explains, has two entrances. Ah. I start amending the note. “No, it’s fine, you can say I was lost if you want to.”Today, Tovey is tired. His 13-year-old French bulldog, Rocky, woke him at 4.30am. “He had a seizure,” Tovey says, matter-of-factly. “He’s fine,” he adds, dampening my concern, before listing Rocky’s other maladies: “He’s completely deaf now. He’s got one eye. He’s in a [dog] pushchair. He has a little diaper.” Until recently, Rocky was part of a family unit that included Tovey’s fiance, Steve Brockman, one to which Tovey had saidhe was keen to add a child. The pair split in 2023. A baby, he says, is still an option “at some point. It’s just me and Rocky at the moment.”Rocky has witnessed his owner’s career go stratospheric here in the UK and in the US. In 2022, Tovey landed a lead role in Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story: NYC, before being cast by Murphy again in last year’s campyFeud: Capote vs the Swans. Earlier this year, Tovey played Brian Paddick, the former deputy assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan police, in the critically acclaimed dramaSuspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, which laid out the police blunders that led to the killing of the innocent Brazilian in a London tube station.View image in fullscreenWith Mawaan Rizwan in BBC sitcom Juice.Photograph: Liam Daniel/BBC/Various Artists Limited“I think I read somewhere that the best way of mastering a career is big, small, small,” Tovey says. “So you go big, punchy, and then you do these smaller, quieter things. You do films, and then you do something else, and it’s about that balance.”Early in his career, which was kickstarted in 2004 playing Rudge in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys at the National Theatre, alongside James Corden and Dominic Cooper, Tovey was less selective. “When you’re a younger actor, you sort of go, ‘What am I doing next? Am I doing that? I’m doing that!’”What he was very clear about, however, was being visible as a gay man. He talked openly about his shame while growing up under section 28 (the Margaret Thatcher-era law that prohibited the “promotion of homosexuality”), and playing gay characters in shows such as HBO’s Looking and on stage in Angels in America. It’s why he’s so proud of Plainclothes, a film set in 1990s upstate New York at a time of undercover police entrapment of gay men.Tovey is keen to point out the film’s relevance to 2025; shortly after its New York premiere a story emerged about US police using an app tocatch men at Penn Station bathrooms. “Two hundred men have been arrested,” Tovey says, “and a proportion of those have been sent straight to ICE facilities with no trial. So something that felt like a historical document was suddenly highly contemporary, which was just bizarre. What this film is doing is humanising what people are trying to demonise, and that feels important.”View image in fullscreenWith Tom Blyth in Plainclothes (2025), directed by Carmen Emmi.Photograph: Courtesy of CurzonWe talk about Plainclothes’s sweaty, car-based sex scene, which caused an online kerfuffle after Tovey was interviewed about it by his friend, Pedro Pascal (“Russell Tovey and Pedro Pascal agree that being ‘vers is the best’,”read one headline]). In the scene, the older, more experienced Andrew and younger police officer Lucas (played by Tom Blyth) ignore the binary of top and bottom and take on both roles. Tovey resists attempts to discuss online discourse around gay actors and the danger of them becoming neutered by endless memes and online infantilising (see the reaction to Jonathan Bailey in Jurassic World: Rebirth and the focus on his“whimsical” and “boyish”specs, quickly dubbed “slutty little glasses” by the internet). He is much more interested in the work.“The scene was so important to me because you’ve got power dynamics,” he says. “I was adamant that this had to be a wholesome interaction, it had to be safe sex, you have to see condoms – you know, it was 97. I said I want Lucas to go away from this interaction not feeling fucked up, not feeling damaged.”In the film, Andrew is clear with the closeted Lucas that the sex is a one-off. “They’ve got this intense connection and it’s like an all-you-can-eat buffet,” Tovey says. “You go: I’ve got to pile my plate up with everything because they’re closing in 20 minutes.” Like the Harvester salad cart, I say. “Exactly! When you’d just get all the bacon bits back in the day, lettuce, blue cheese dressing, and you’re shovelling it on before they start wheeling everything away.”Tovey clearly takes his responsibility as a visible gay man seriously. A few days before we meet, he accepted theman of the yeargong at the annual Attitude awards, and gave a rousing acceptance speech that touched on transphobia within the LGBTQ+ community and the rise of Reform. “As a community, we really attack our own,” he says now, “and that’s deeply upsetting because united we stand, divided we fall. We look outside ourselves to go, ‘You need to be doing something,’ when actually within it we’re fractured. And that’s what they want.”He offers an example. Earlier this year, in Los Angeles, Tovey was curating an exhibition by the German photographer Peter Berlin around the same time as Trump’s administrationscratched three characters from the Stonewall monumentin New York. “So it wasn’t celebrating LGBTQ+, it was just celebrating LGB,” Tovey says. Some older gay men, while talking about the queer community at the LA exhibition, parroted the shortened acronym. “I said, ‘Well, hang on a minute, you’ve missed a few letters off there,’” Tovey says. “I just thought how quickly people go: ‘Oh great, so they’ve gone, now it’s us.’” He sighs. “As a community, we have to kick outwards instead of punching inwards.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone should have therapy when they leave school’ … Russell Tovey.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe says the general rise in transphobia, which he sees as the latest iteration of homophobia, is cyclical. “There’s this scapegoating that needs to happen. It feels like it’s the worst time in history for trans people right now.”As for the threat of Reform – and twice-married, now separated Nigel Farage’s attack on the stability of gay marriage (“the most stable relationships tend to be between men and women”,Farage said earlier this year) – Tovey is suitably worried, but his concerns are broader. “I think all communities need to be prepared [for a possible Reform government],” he says. “I hope to God it doesn’t happen.” He has little faith in Labour stopping them and recently joined the Green party. “Their slogan – make hope normal again – is what we need,” he says. “It’s like Harvey Milk saying, ‘You’ve got to give them hope.’ We have to have hope. We’re on this really horrific curve but we will come out the other side eventually. We’ve just got to ride this out.”He’s no politician, but you could imagine Tovey riling up a backbencher on Question Time. “I just care about people and my community,” he says, eschewing the label of role model in favour of “possibility model”, a term coined by Orange Is the New Black actor Laverne Cox. He likens people like Cox to lighthouses: “These beacons, that are shining a light going, ‘This way!’ Things are fucking rocky [so let’s] build more lighthouses and be that fucking light that shines out, so people can find you through this dark, cold water that we’re being plunged into.”View image in fullscreenAs Brian Paddick in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Stefania Rosini/Disney+Standing out comes with pressure, and there have been slip-ups. A decade ago, Tovey was criticised for perpetuating gay stereotypes after suggesting drama school students “prance around” being “effeminate”.“I don’t feel any pressure on it because I don’t think I’m a horrible person,” he says. “I just try to put out empathy and be as honest and authentic as I can be, and hope that connects.” His roles playing more masculine, straight-passing gay men – in Juice, Looking and the 2016 crime thriller Quantico – are not chosen with any specific intention, he says. “I’m just trying to find the truth of every character. I don’t consider how they present themselves in that capacity.”Growing up in the 1980s, in the era of section 28 and the sex-equals-death rhetoric of the Aids crisis, Tovey was desperate for his own possibility model. As a kid growing up in Billericay, Essex, he covertly read magazines like Attitude – hidden at the time on the newsagents’ top shelves alongside “all the wank mags” – poring over stories that hinted at a queer joy a million miles away from his own shame.Tovey came out at 18 and, like many young gay people, his identity was hurled at him like an insult. He’s ecstatic that a new generation of gay kids, growing up with shows like Heartstopper, with its depiction of young queer love, can at least see there’s hope. “They don’t consider death whenever they meet someone and go to bed with them,” he says. “It just doesn’t enter their mind and that, to me, just seems so healthy. I’ve been so mixed up with it for so long, for so many years.” Did he have therapy? “Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he repeats. “I think everyone should have therapy when they leave school.”His passion for acting emerged after gorging himself on films like The Goonies, Stand By Me and Home Alone one summer at the end of junior school. At a gymnastics class – “I was good at flips and cartwheels” – he happened upon a meet-and-greet with a local young actor starring in Grange Hill. “I could see a conduit to the dream,” he smiles. “So I switched from gymnastics to drama. I’d be at drama club every night, every weekend, going to drama camps. I was obsessed!” From there he got an agent and worked so much it interfered with school. After leaving at 16, he acted in local theatres before being cast in Howard Katz at the National Theatre in London, followed by his star-making turn in The History Boys on stage and in the 2006 film adaptation.View image in fullscreenWith Jamie Parker, Dominic Cooper and Samuel Barnett in The History Boys (2006).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt’s while discussing his early stage roles that Tovey finally reveals the dark truth beneath that put-together, gym-buffed exterior: he’s a massive nerd. All the plays he starred in at the start of his career, he tells me unprovoked, began with the letter H – Henry V, His Dark Materials, His Girl Friday, History Boys – and all the characters he played had names beginning with R. He rattles through it all with an infectious enthusiasm, eyes wide like saucers. “My life changed when I came out, but my life also changed when I came out as a geek and a nerd,” he smiles. “Everything, the whole world, the whole universe, was open to me.” Growing up he collected rocks and minerals, a few fossils. He owned a metal detector. “I was interested in all that, but would I tell anyone? Would I fuck!”He now collects art, and talks enthusiastically about ceramics, rattling off names such as Lucie Rie, Florian Gadsby and Edmund de Waal. Does he make art himself? “I wanted to be Wolfgang Tillmans for a bit, so I bought an SLR camera and started taking pictures of my underwear hanging over a radiator, or socks on the stairs.” The results, he says, were “shit”. But that’s not the point for Tovey, whose default overview leans towards optimism. “That’s the pressure we put on ourselves – like, if I’m not brilliant at this, why am I bothering? But you can do anything you want if you enjoy it. You haven’t got to be great at it.”Tovey, now slumped into the restaurant’s cream banquette, starts to wander back towards his favourite role as dog dad. Rocky is at home with the BBC World Service playing despite him being deaf, blissfully unaware of the world’s various storms. “He’s been my best friend in the world,” Tovey smiles, “and he’s seen me through so much. He’s just been there.” Like Tovey’s own unique lighthouse.The War Between the Land and the Sea will launch on BBC iPlayer and BBC One on 7 December.Explore more on these topicsRussell ToveyThe big interviewLGBTQ+ rightsCeramicsTelevisionDoctor WhoPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, many Jaywickians have moved to the village from London after spending their holidays there in their youth. After the second world war, the holiday homes became permanent residences, despite not being built for this purpose. In 1983, Clacton’s Butlin’s closed, and most of the jobs the people relied on disappeared. Jaywick has a population of about 5,000, of which 97% are ethnically white and 38% aged over 65 (more than double the national average) in the 2021 census. 62% of the population live on some form of government benefit.View image in fullscreenThe Broadway, Jaywick’s high street.View image in fullscreenMuch of the investment in the area goes to flood defences, including expensive upgrades to the sea wall that stretches the length of the village.In 2018, Nick Stella, a Republican politician campaigning for Donald Trump, used an image of a street in Jaywick with the words: “Only you can stop this from becoming a reality. Help President Trump keep America on track and thriving.”Jaywickians are very aware of how their village is represented in the media. Many are fed up with journalists coming to the village with a preconceived story and people give examples of when they have felt tricked by interviewers promising a positive report that ends up portraying them with the same negative stereotypes. “We’ve all been caught out by it at least once,” says Davina, the landlady of Jaywick’s Never Say Die pub.View image in fullscreenJudges, contestants and onlookers at the Miss Jaywick 2025 competition at the Never Say Die pub.View image in fullscreenParticipants of the annual Miss Jaywick competition held at the Never Say Die pub.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIn Jaywick many live day to day, sometimes meal to meal, and people vote for what they think will benefit them.

People started copying it, like [producer]Seth MacFarlanefor the new Naked Gun. He totally missed it.”He added: “It can look like we’re just throwing stuff up against the wall to see what sticks, but we’re not. There’s thought behind it.”Zucker added that it was pointless to make the movie without Leslie Nielsen, who played Frank Drebin and who died in 2010, saying: “They tried to replace Leslie Nielsen in the new Naked Gun, and you can’t replace him. No one else can do that.”The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreZucker had previously objected to plans to go ahead with a Naked Gun reboot,saying in 2024that he was “not excited about having the franchise given to other people”. Adding: “They have not contacted me to make a cameo or be involved in the writing. Whether or not they’re going to do a good job with it, this kind of spoof, I mean it’s not rocket science, but it’s not easy.”However, after a string ofpositive reviewsand strong box office returns after its release in August, Zucker struck a more conciliatory tone, saying: “I’m excited about it because it just shows that there’s a strong market for comedy in movie theatres, and spoof in particular.”However, Zucker returned to the attack in the new interview, criticising the amount of money involved. “Big budgets and comedy are opposites, and in the new Naked Gun, you could see that they spent a lot of money on scenes full of technical pizzazz while trying to copy our style.”He added: “Everybody’s in it for the money now, and that feels like the only reason why they wanted to do a new Naked Gun.”Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsAirplane!Seth MacFarlaneComedyLiam NeesonnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Maybe Iggy just wasn’t a tree kind of guy, despite (or perhaps because of) his face being all over my tree decorations. Or maybe I just needed to up my tree game. After testing thebest artificial Christmas treesagainst all manner of metrics, including feline appeal, I’ve concluded it’s probably the latter.It’s time I introduced Lumen. No one can take Iggy’s place, but Lumen, a tiny semi-feral rescue cat, has helped fill the void left by his loss. She’s lived much of her two years outdoors, not by choice, and by turning our living room into a forest of fake fir, pretend pine and simulated spruce, we seem to have helped her feel right at home.Lumen’s involvement in this test proved genuinely insightful. She helped demonstrate each tree’s ability to withstand balance challenges, such as a delighted cat hanging off its lower branches. She taste-tested their greenery until I gently asked her not to (she liked the chewyHabitat mixed tipand the bristlyChristmas Tree World pine). Her presence made me more sensitive than I might’ve been to the fake snow, plastic needles and other potentially hazardous dreck that dropped off the less durable trees.

The trees were down beforeStrictlyeven reached its Halloween special, and our efforts to get them back in their boxes were another handy test.

The Habitat won again on this score; alas, thesnowy Dunelmseemed to have grown toStay Puft Marshmallow Mandimensions by the time we tried to get it back in its box, while Christmas Tree World’s boxed pine was so big and heavy it needed two men to carry it out to the charity lorry.

He knew there was an increased risk of the disease in black men so asked to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which was not initially included.“And when I went, they said I had a raised PSA level for my age,” Hemans said. “[The diagnosis] was a shock … because I had no symptoms.”The PSA test, which is used to check for conditions including prostate cancer or an enlarged prostate, is not routinely offered on theNHSat present.The fact that Hemans had to specifically request a PSA test is why he strongly believes there should be a national screening programme for men at highest risk from the disease.“Imagine if, back to when I was 51, there was a screening programme already in place [before my diagnosis], I could have been diagnosed earlier,” he says. “A screening programme saves more of the man, and gives us a better and cheaper means of saving that man.”Although Hemans, who has now been successfully treated for the disease, was aware of his increased risk, he said he knew many other black men who did not have the same knowledge.Prostate cancer has overtaken breast cancer as themost commonly diagnosed cancerin England but there is no national screening programme despite there being more than 55,000 new cases annually. One in eight men will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetimes, but black men face a much higher risk at one in four.The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) is due to decide at the end of the month whether to recommend introducing an NHS screening programme for prostate cancer and experts are calling for it to be targeted at high risk groups, including black men.Keith Morgan, the associate director of black health equity at Prostate Cancer UK, said the evidence for a screening programme targeted at black men was “particularly strong”, given that they are at an increased risk oflate-stage diagnosisas well as experiencing higher mortality rates.“And this can’t simply be put down to where they live, as our latest report shows that, even in the least deprived areas, Black men die from prostate cancer at higher rates than white men in the most deprived areas,” Morgan said. “Leaving screening to chance entrenches these inequalities and feeds a fatal postcode lottery.“We feel now the evidence should be strong enough for the NSC to recommend targeted screening for Black men. While there are other groups, such as those with a family history of the disease, who we feel could also benefit from targeted screening, the case is strongest for Black men.”The charity has said if the NSC disagrees it will challenge the government to set out a clear plan to tackle late diagnosis and the inequities.Morgan added: “What is clear is that we can’t simply leave it to chance for Black men. If the NSC decides we aren’t ready for screening, the government must act swiftly to fund serious awareness-raising and change outdated guidelines so GPs can proactively talk to Black men about their risk and the choice to have a PSA blood test.”NHS hospitals to test AI tool that helps diagnose and treat prostate cancerRead moreDavid James, the director of patient projects and influencing at ProstateCancerResearch, said there was “sufficient evidence” to demonstrate the benefits of a screening programme, starting first with those at highest risk.“So that is black men aged 45 to 69, men with relevant family history of prostate, breast or ovarian cancer of the same age group and people with certain genetic mutations,” James said.“We think that what we’ve demonstrated is that such a screening programme is cost effective and in fact delivers a positive socioeconomic benefit to the country as a whole, and that it won’t overwhelm the NHS. We’re very hopeful that the National Screening Committee and the government will decide in favour of a screening programme.”However, this view is not the consensus among prostate cancer researchers and academics, with some arguing that more evidence is needed to address concerns that a targeted screening programme could lead to potential over-diagnosis.Naser Turabi, the director of evidence and implementation at Cancer Research UK, said the evidence on targeted screening was still “very unclear”.“There’s a lot of conflicting evidence,” Turabi said. “For example, for black men the [increased risk of prostate cancer] is probably a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.“Although they have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, the PSA test [is] used to detect prostate specific antigen and black men have a higher natural level of PSA, which could lead to over-diagnosis among black men.”For Turabi, grouping all black men together as a general category could be problematic owing to the wide variation in the group.“I think another issue is that black itself is a social category, which is different from thinking about ancestry,” Turabi said. “It’s possible, and there are some indications that this is true, that some of the genetic risks for people of African ancestry are applied to a subset of what we would describe as black men.“One of the challenges here is that we don’t have as much genomic data regarding black men, people of African ancestry, as we do the general population.”Rhian Gabe, a professor of biostatistics and clinical trials at Queen Mary University of London, agreed. She said: “I don’t think there’s a huge amount of evidence for black men because, unfortunately, I don’t think we’ve got enough research that includes black men in it. And that’s something we’re trying to address.”Gabe is also the co-lead of the Transform trial, a£42m screening trial by Prostate Cancer UKthat aims to find the best methods to screen for the disease. One in 10 participants of the 20-year trial will be black men, a sample size much higher than previous clinical studies.“That’s why we’re aiming to get a high number of black men in our study, because we really need that evidence and we really want to give them the opportunity to participate in our research,” she added.Harveer Dev, an academic urologist at the Early Cancer Institute, University of Cambridge, said regardless of whether the NSC recommends a screening programme, the dial had shifted.“I think, societal feeling towards this subject needs to be taken into account, if not entirely dictating the decision, at least in part,” Dev added.Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerNHSCancerHealthRaceMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Entitled? Lazy? Gen Z faces familiar flood of workplace criticismA new generation of younger workers are being derided as delusional and unreliable, just as millennials wereJenna ZazaMon 17 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 06.01 ESTShareGen Z isundisciplined, apparently;entitled, some critics claim; and purportedlyhates work. One viral column in the Wall Street Journal went so far as to suggest this entire generation waspotentially “unemployable”.As younger employees establishing themselves at work continue to face relentless criticism from the higher rungs of corporate America, those old enough to remember the arrival of the last generation could be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu.Millennials wereonce deridedas lazy, entitled, delusional, narcissistic and unreliable, too: many of the same accusations now leveled at gen Z.Scams, silence, rejection: US job seekers describe ‘depressing’ work prospectsRead more“Every generation tends to complain about the one next to us,” said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton Business School. “Everyone used to hate millennials, and now it’s gen Z.“We tend to compare [the younger generation] to our current selves, which is a mistake because most people are more narcissistic and self-centered at age 20 than they are at age 40. That’s part of development and maturity.”While this is a recurring cycle, in which each new generation faces scrutiny as they enter the workforce, this time it has been intensified, according to industry experts, by gen Z’s disillusionment with the institutions that they deem to have failed them.Older generations also tend to directly compare their strengths with younger generations’ weaknesses, according to Grant – exaggerating the divide and often painting the younger generation in an unfairly negative light.“I think that narrative is a bullshit,” Jahnavi Shah, 25, said of the harshest accusations hurled at gen Z. “The generations before us, they were just all about work and then life would take a back seat. We are a really smart generation that hustles, but we also don’t want to burn out, and want to be paid adequately for the value that we bring in.”Shah recently landed her first full-time role at a tech startup in San Francisco, California, after a seven-month search, and almost a thousand applications.Previous generations “would cold-apply, and get interviews from big tech companies”, she said. “But with every application I sent, and every rejection that followed, I felt like I lost a little bit of me.”Nadya Okamoto, 27, co-founder of August, an eco-conscious menstrual products company, also strongly disagrees with the criticisms leveled against gen Z. “If you look at a lot of the jobs that gen Z is known to do really well, like social media marketing, they weren’t jobs 20 years ago, so in this sense we’re obviously employable,” she said. “Gen Z gets a bad rep for entitlement – for wanting certain expectations, like work-life balance.”Gen Z grew up watching institutions, both financial and political, fail to deliver on promises of stability and wealth, planting a deeplack of faith, said Grant– and, for many younger workers, any implicit trust between employee and employer is no more.“Gone are the times when you took a job with one employer, and you stayed there for 35 years, and you plan to retire there, and you expected them to take care of you,” said Grant. “If you look at the number of downsizing and mass layoffs that have happened, those are major betrayals [to the employees].”This generation is different to its predecessors, in some respects. Flexibility, purpose and employees’ wellbeing matter more than overtime and promotions, according to Madeline Miller, a leadership and culture strategist. “The capitalist system is extractive, and gen Z are starting to say: ‘I’m tired and I’m going to get nothing out of this,’” she said.“There’s more ways to make money outside the corporate cog that grants freedom and flexibility, so we enter the workforce with much higher standards,” said Okamoto. “We realized we don’t actually have to be that burnt out any more and … American capitalism needs a change in which people are actually valued.”Gen Z does not see the value in overtime and focuses on “smart work”, optimizing artificial intelligence tools to complete a 10-hour task in just five hours instead, according to Shah, the tech worker. A Deloittesurveypublished earlier this year found that over half of gen Z employees reported using AI regularly in their work.Values and priorities appear to be shifting, too. According to the Deloitte research, 89% of gen Z workers and 92% of millennials consider a sense of purpose to be very or somewhat important for their job satisfaction.Companies that dismiss or write off gen Z staff ultimately put their overall performance at risk, according to Grant, who said both older managers and their younger staff can benefit from ditching stereotypes and learning from each other.“It is a new generation that comes in and holds up a mirror so you can see yourself more clearly and see how you may not have kept up with the way the world has evolved,” added Grant. “Older generations have a lot of knowledge and experience to offer. Younger generations have fresh perspectives and digital savvy. We want to cross-fertilize between the generations.”For companies, this isn’t optional, according to Miller, who claimed that firms who fail to do so risk “imploding”.“Gen Z is going to transform the way we work completely,” she said. “Adapting means companies should become curious about gen Z, and integrate personal and professional development – rather than imposing existing structures, hierarchies and leadership models on them.”"

The punchy anchovy and garlic butter does all the hard work, and gives the impression of more effort than was actually exerted. But what to serve it with, I hear you ask? Well, it wouldn’t be out of place with creamy mashed potato, buttery polenta or a salad. Just make sure to baste the fish halfway through cooking, to get all the flavour and juices back into it.Roast hake with caper anchovy butterPrep10 minCook30 minServes42 garlic cloves, peeled5 anchovies4 tbsp capers½ bunchchives1 lemon90g unsalted butter, cut into cubesSea salt andblack pepper250g sweet heart cabbage, or other greens2 onions, peeled and halved2 tbsp olive oil4150g hake or cod fillets, skinned and, if need be, pin-bonedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the garlic cloves in a mini chopper with the anchovies and half the capers, then tear in most of the chives. Blitz until finely chopped (you can also do this by hand or in a mortar). Finely grate in the zest of the lemon, add the butter and season well, then blitz smooth (if need be, you can do this ahead of time and store the butter in the fridge).Trim the base of the cabbage, cut out and discard the core, then finely shred the cabbage. Finely slice the halved onions. Place the cabbage and onions in a large roasting tray, squeeze over the juice of half the lemon, add the olive oil, season generously and toss to coat. Spread out the mix into an even layer, then lay the fish fillets on top and evenly spoon on some of the caper butter; dot any remaining butter over the cabbage mixture. Cut the remaining lemon half into fine slices, nestle these among the fish and cabbage, then scatter over the remaining two tablespoons of capers.Roast for 16-20 minutes, basting everything with the buttery juices halfway through, until the fish is tender and the cabbage a little charred. Finely chop the remaining chives, scatter on top and serve.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down.While the sauce is cooking, cook the fregola in plenty of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Drain, put in a bowl then toss with a bit of olive oil to prevent the fregola from clumping.To make the pesto, put the coriander, chilli, pine nuts, olive oil, lemon zest and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to make a coarse paste.When the sauce is ready, stir in the cooked fregola, prawns and charred tomatoes, cover and cook on a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for another five to six minutes, until the prawns are cooked through.Serve straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls.

I thankfully got off with a small head injury. I reported the collision to my insurance company, Autonet, and was toldit would be in touch.Six weeks on and I’ve heard nothing. My tools are still inside my van, which iscompletelystalling my work as a self-employed tradesman. The compound where it is being stored needs permission from my insurer before allowing me access, but every time I call, I’m passed between a broker, an underwriter and a claims management firm.The only communication I have had is from the compound telling me I oweit £25 for every day my van is onits premises. As the bill racks up, so does my stress.SJBuckhaven, FifeAfter my car was damaged in a Tesco car wash it has washed its hands of my complaintRead moreYour SOS reached me at the end of June. You had reported the crash to Autonet in mid-May and were loaned a van.The intervening months for both of us have been a low-speed car chase over roundabouts and dead ends.Autonet told me you would not be liable for storage costs and admitted: “We have fallen short with our communication and responsiveness.” That was in early July. It promised to be in touch.Contact when it came was to demand details of the accident, which you had submitted two months earlier, suggesting your claim had not even been started. Autonet said it would discuss compensation to “reflect the impact our service has had” and it reunited you with your tools, which were too damaged to use.A month later, you were still waiting for an offer for the market value of your van and for promised remuneration for your expenses, including 11 days of lost work because of the lack of tools and transport.Autonet, despite receipts, offered only half the £6,750 expenses you claimed. When I questioned this, it agreed to pay the rest, but insisted the sum included the promised compensation. Again it agreed it had “fallen short”.By now it was August, 16 weeks after your claim. There was still no word about the payout for the van and no response to your frantic messages.In September, you were at last contacted – to be told you had to surrender your courtesy van with immediate effect because the claim was taking too long.I established that you had unwittingly signed a credit hire agreement, which, unlike a courtesy deal, holds you legally liable for the hire costs if the third-party insurer fails to pay out. You say the significance was not explained to you; Autonet told me you should have read the small print.Minus wheels once more, you had to spend money you couldn’t afford on an inferior replacement vehicle.Under pressure from me, the underwriter finally proposed a more acceptable figure of £1,835 for your ruined van, and Autonet once again said it had “fallen short”.The relief also fell short. Weeks passed; no money arrived. It seemed that the insurer was only now, more than four months after the accident, seeking to establish third-party liability.You were eventually paid on the last day of October after 169 days, 30 emails from me to you and Autonet and countless sleepless nights on your part.It might not be over yet. If the third-party insurer refuses to pay for the months you had the hire van, you might be required to assist with any legal action Autonet and its underwriter might take.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

If you’ve fasted overnight, you’ll generally burn a bit more fat and less carbohydrate than if you’d eaten breakfast, especially one high in carbs.” But that doesn’t mean fasted workouts are better for weight loss.“We can only store a small amount of carbohydrate as glycogen in our muscles and liver. Any extra energy – from carbs, fat or protein – eventually gets stored as body fat. So to lose fat, you need to be in an energy deficit: burning more energy than you consume. If you’re not, it doesn’t matter whether you’re fasted or fed – your body balances things out over time,” says Gonzalez.Fasted training seems to encourage muscles to move glucose out of the bloodstream, so it can improve blood sugar controlThat doesn’t make fasted workouts pointless, though. Research,including Gonzalez’s own, suggests training in a fasted state can slightly improve metabolic health, particularly how well muscles adapt to exercise and how the body handles blood sugar spikes, which can lead to energy crashes. “Fasted training seems to encourage muscles to move glucose out of the bloodstream,” he says. “So it can improve blood sugar control, especially after meals.”The effects are most noticeable with endurance exercise such as jogging or cycling. During higher intensity exercise, such as sprint intervals, the body relies heavily on carbohydrate either way. Overall, the benefits of fasted training are modest.“The most important thing is to do the exercise. Whether you do it fasted or fed is just the icing on the cake,” says Gonzalez. If you want to try it, start small – 15 or 20 minutes – and build up gradually. “If you feel light-headed or dizzy, that’s your cue to stop and eat something.”Explore more on these topicsDiets and dietingIs it true that …Health & wellbeingFoodHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a way outMeaningful therapy offers a path past our worst impulses. We should be fighting for it to be available for everyoneMoya SarnerMon 17 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareWhen I picture what a good life means to me, I feel a tension in my chest. I see my daughter and my husband and I feel the profound fulfilment of being exactly where I need to be, tightened by the terror that life is so fragile and I cannot protect them from that reality. Then a memory: lying on my analyst’s couch and describing a feeling of hollowness inside that I felt deeply ashamed of, and her listening and thinking and understanding – and my noticing that while I felt horror and repulsion, she didn’t seem to. Next: different walks around different parks with different friends, each with the same feeling of being warmed from the inside out; also, bumping into neighbours at the playground and feeling a part of my community. I remember powerful moments with my patients, who have felt understood, by me and within themselves. And I think of themoving messages from readerswho have got in touch,sharing precious stories from their lives.People often think that psychoanalysis and its NHS-friendly grandchild, psychodynamic psychotherapy, are all about looking inwards. And it’s true – good therapy should give us the time and space, the frame and the containment, to look inside and listen to ourselves.But it doesn’t end there.Some of us don’t understand what it is inside us that means we cannot be in the outside world, or be with other people, in an ordinary way. We haven’t yet worked through whatever traumas or unconscious conflicts keep us trapped in the past. We don’t have the capacity to digest our own feelings, so we cannot bear, never mind relate to, the feelings of others. Sometimes, if we cannot tolerate whatever emotions spontaneously develop within us, we fend off these feelings with screens or drugs or sex or gambling or other self-harm, or work or sabotaging work or abuse of loved ones, and things get far more dangerous.Without psychoanalytic help, many of us are stuck in our own ordinary and devastating narcissism, unable to relate to ourselves or to others in meaningful ways. If we are blind to what is going on inside, we can’t look outwards to find solace and meaning in community, in the natural world, in work and in love. Meaningful therapy doesn’t indulge narcissism; it lights the way out of it.I am sometimes criticised for writing about psychotherapy because it is perceived as the preserve of the privileged. And it is true that I am privileged to be able to afford it. But that doesn’t mean that it is only for the well-off – or that I shouldn’t write about it. There are low-fee schemes at reputable clinics and training organisations, and theBritish Psychoanalytic Council website now allows therapists to state on their profile when they offer low-fee vacancies. But not everyone can afford these low-fee schemes, and that is why my colleagues and I believe in and fight for the provision of sustained psychodynamic psychotherapy on the NHS. Crushingly, it is a fight that we are losing; provision has been consistently diminished over decades and there is now very limited psychodynamic psychotherapy available.Every time an NHS service is forced to reduce the provision of psychodynamic psychotherapy – this highly effective, evidence-based treatment that helps people build better mental health and better lives – it is forced to act against whatever values of equality, quality of care, respect, diversity and inclusion and patient choice it is striving to uphold. These cuts make a mockery of parity of esteem for mental and physical health. It is not an acceptable state of affairs and we shouldn’t keep quiet about it. We should be marching in the streets. Who will join me?Because it shouldn’t be about who can afford this treatment. I have treated patients from all different backgrounds, some of whom can use therapy to build a better life, and some of whom cannot. It has diddly squat to do with how much money they have or how well educated they are or what they do for a living. Although, it is true that when a patient has had a particularly rarefied education and has been stuck for a long time using their intellect to try to navigate around feelings that need to be felt, it can be very difficult to work through this to the deeper emotional currents and needs that are hiding underneath. But it’s worth persevering – at least, it has been for me as a patient.If it weren’t for psychoanalysis, I don’t think I would still be in my marriage or have my daughter. I wouldn’t have been able to see my part in my relationship difficulties, or to listen to my partner so that we could grow together through the storms of married life. I couldn’t survive my own feelings, let alone try to help my child with hers. I couldn’t do the work that I do, shackled by an intellectual defence that was as brittle as it was shallow. I wouldn’t have been able to build any kind of better life on the emptiness I sensed but couldn’t bear to turn towards. I would not have been able to discover that there was something in there after all – the beginnings of a person.I don’t know what a better life means to you. And often when my patients come for psychotherapy, they don’t know either, and it becomes part of our work to find out. But now I do know something of what it means to me. I feel it inside – and I am extremely fortunate to be able to afford the therapy that’s helping me. If we want to build better lives and a better society, it should be available to anyone who needs it and can use it.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to build a better lifeMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is no one to disturb you, and in the dim quiet will be a historical jaw-dropper: a centuries-old face carved in oak, a grisly tomb, an inscription to the dead hero of a forgotten battle. Each site is a mini detective puzzle, waiting to be unravelled, often with a helpful booklet available near the door. The spirits of those who have shuffled off this mortal coil hang in the dust motes, but here, in Weobley, Herefordshire, I am looking for someone specific.View image in fullscreenIt is a standard opener for any work on William Shakespeare to declare how few facts we know about the most famous playwright of all time. No matter, every snippet has launched a thousand academic careers, a swarm of novels, and dozens of films. The latest on the big screen isHamnet, based on thebestselling 2020 novelby Maggie O’Farrell, and starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. The book conjures up the Elizabethan world of Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes (AKA Anne), at a time when plague is ravaging Warwickshire and filling their Stratford home with grief. In 1596, their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, dies, a tragedy that seems to have spurred his father into a burst of creative energy. When filming the adaptation of O’Farrell’s powerful literary evocation, some very special locations were needed, and the scouts found them in the Welsh borders and in Weobley.Wandering through the town, it’s easy to see why this place was chosen to stand in for Stratford-upon-Avon: it’s a half-timbered heaven of rambling crooked buildings. Many of these were old before the Bard was born. In his era, chimney stacks were a modern addition and you can still see the join. I pass the two pubs, the Unicorn andYe Olde Salutation Inn, each worthy of that fat rascal, Sir John Falstaff, lighting up the bar like “a candle, the better half burnt out”.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley  and Paul Mescal in Hamnet.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFarther down the hill, past innumerable leaning lintels and pot-bellied ancient windows, is the excellent small museum, presided over by archivist Sue, who is a mine of information on the place. The only Elizabethan exhibit I can find, however, is a silver sixpence found by a metal detectorist. At Sue’s suggestion, I set off for the church of St Peter & St Paul. As I approach it’s obvious that Weobley was not always so obscure: there’s the 185ft (56-metre) spire, supported by flying buttresses, built in the 14th century when the town was a big deal. The autumnal churchyard is rich in mushrooms and acorns, but what about Shakespearean resonances? Inside the church, walking slowly up the nave, I see the stone body of a knight lying on a plinth and there’s a name, Devereux.If anywhere rivals Weobley for the Most Shakespearean crown, it would be Pembridge. Two pubs lean over the highway, like a pair of old codgers ‘fat-witted with drinking’Now I get a shiver. It’s a name that every Elizabethan knew, a name that haunted the Bard’s career and nearly brought disaster. One night in 1601, Shakespeare’s troupe, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were offered a handsome sum by supporters of Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex,to stage his drama Richard II, which features the overthrow of a monarch. The morning after the performance at the Globe theatre in London, the earl rode into London with 300 armed men, determined to unseat Elizabeth I. The plan failed. Essex was beheaded, as were several members of the play’s audience. Anxious times for anyone involved in the production.View image in fullscreenThe medieval church of St Peter & St Paul in Weobley.Photograph: NorthScape/AlamyI peer closer at the tomb, carved with the initials of generations of choirboys. This is Walter Devereux, died 1402. A quick online search reveals that Walter was not only a direct ancestor of the rebel Essex, but had fought alongside Richard II in Scotland, then jumped ship to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, only to die at the Battle of Bryn Glas, one of the “men of Herefordshire” butchered by Owain Glyndŵr’s army. This knight laid out before me is not named in either of Shakespeare’s Henry IV plays, but he must have known all of those characters who were (excluding the fictional Falstaff, of course).From Weobley I walk two miles through orchards, heavy with fruit, to Dilwyn where there’s another fine church, and a good pub,the Crown. From here I stroll on country lanes to Eardisland, another haven of the half-timber, the equal of Weobley. I then turn west, heading for Pembridge where I’m staying. Along the River Arrow, outside Eardisland, the path is blocked so I take off my boots and wade across the running brook, stopping halfway when a kingfisher streaks past me at waist height.Hergest Ridge is part of the Offa’s Dyke Path and a classic route. Below is a labyrinthine world of winding lanes, ancient woodlands and meadowsIf any town rivals Weobley for the “Most Shakespearean” crown, it would be Pembridge. Two pubs lean over the highway, like a pair of old codgers “fat-witted with drinking”; there’s a fine ancient market place, a church whose door is holed by civil war bullets, a gorgeous grocery shop and gaggles of higgledy-piggledy houses. Nearby isthe Cider Barn restaurant, whose car park is crunchy with fallen walnuts and where guests are greeted with a delicious glass of localBlack Fox cider.That evening, in front of the log fire in Pembridge’sNew Inn(it was new in Shakespeare’s time), I read up on Falstaff and discover that Shakespeare’s star comedian was based on the real-life Sir John Oldcastle, a man born at Almeley, five miles west of Weobley, and an exact contemporary of the Walter Devereux lying in Weobley church. The pair might have known each other, perhaps even fought at each other’s side, before Oldcastle turned heretic and got himself hanged. I love playing church detective and almost let out a whoop of delight, but I don’t think the wobbly shelves behind the bar could cope.View image in fullscreenWestonbury Mill Water Gardens.Photograph: Alex Ramsay/AlamyNext day I drive west, stopping at the wonderfully eccentricWestonbury Mill Water Gardens(good cafe) built by the late hydrogeologist Richard Pim, whose inspiration came partly from working in the Middle East and north Africa. Then I head through Kington toHergest Croft Gardens(good cafe) where I start walking again.Hergest Ridgeis part of theOffa’s Dyke Pathand a classic route, the path following a direct line over the dome of Whet Stone hill, revealing vast panoramas of the surrounding countryside, including north to the battle site of Bryn Glas. Below the ridge is a labyrinthine world of winding lanes, ancient woodlands and meadows where Hamnet film scouts discoveredCwmmau, a substantial and almost untouched 16th-century farmhouse which stands in for Hewlands Farm, the childhood home of Agnes (the original is just outside Stratford and better known these days as Anne Hathaway’s cottage). Film location fees helped to fund essential conservation work on the farmhouse, which is managed by the National Trust and will reopen as a holiday cottage in December.And now my Shakespearean idyll is over – except I’ve forgotten to visit Sir John Oldcastle’s birthplace and play detective in the church at Almeley. There is nothing to be done except turn around and head straight back into the past. I have to admit, I like it there.Accommodation at theOld Bakehousein Pembridge was provided bySykes Cottages; from £513 for 7 nights, sleeps 4.Further information:visitherefordshire.co.uk/through-tudor-landscapes.Hamnetis in UK cinemas from 9 January 2026Explore more on these topicsEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysCultural tripsStratford-upon-AvonDay tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The firm said their recipes were well within limits set by national regulations in the countries concerned.Public Eye researchers worked with activists in more than 20 African countries to buy 94 samples of Cerelac products marketed for babies aged six months and above, which were sent to a laboratory for analysis.The laboratory found added sugar in more than 90% of baby cereals, with an average of 6g, or one-and-a-half teaspoons, per serving.Most products without added sugar were imported, they said, and had originally been intended for sale in Europe, apart from two variants recently launched in South Africa.The amount of added sugar identified ranged from about 5g a serving for products found in Egypt, Madagascar, South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria to 7.5g in a product sold in Kenya.World Health Organization (WHO) guidelineson foods for children under three recommend they should contain “no added sugars or sweetening agents”, in part because of the risk of creating long-term preferences for sweetened foods.Aninvestigation by Public Eyepublished in April 2024 found Nestlé was adding sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in Asia, Africa and Latin America, whenequivalent productsin richer countries had no added sugar.In a letter to Nestlé’s chief executive, Philipp Navratil, 12 African civil society and consumer organisations said: “You know how to do things differently. But you made a deliberate decision to feed children in Africa with less healthy options.”Africa’s medical system risks ‘collapse in next few years’, warns health leaderRead moreAfter Public Eye’s 2024 investigation, Nestlésaid it had an ambitionto introduce versions of Cerelac with no added sugar in all markets.However, campaigners said this was “too little, too late”, and called for the company to stop adding sugar to baby foods.They added: “By adding sugar to infant cereals, Nestlé is putting the health of African babies at risk for profit.” Accusing the firm of playing a part in “a preventable public health catastrophe”, they said anepidemic of diet-related non-communicable diseaseswas spreading across the continent.Peggy Diby, global head of corporate affairs for Nestlé Nutrition, said: “These are unfounded allegations and insinuate actions that are contrary to all our values. We disagree with the Public Eye report. It is misleading. We do not have double standards when it comes to early childhood nutrition.”In the past year, Nestlé hasintroduced 14 Cerelac variants with no added sugarin India, and Diby said it was accelerating the rollout of no added sugar varieties in African countries.She said Public Eye had refused to share details of its testing, and disputed the sugar levels identified, suggesting they included naturally occurring sugars from milk, cereals and fruits in the products. She said levels in Nestlé products were “well below” those set out ininternational food safety and quality standardspublished by the WHO and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization known as the Codex Alimentarius.“The biggest challenge in Africa is not obesity, it is malnutrition,” she said, highlighting iron deficiency as a particular concern. “We are here to provide age-adapted solutions that contribute to [tackling] malnutrition.”Dr Sara Colombo Mottaz, global head of medical, regulatory and scientific affairs at Nestlé Nutrition, said fortified cereals played a key role in providing the necessary micronutrients, and the company had internal “guardrails” to keep added sugars below a certain level.She said babies in the womb, or those breastfed as infants, were used to sweet tastes and it was important to offer them flavours they would accept as they transitioned to solid foods.“We want to provide to parents [a range of products] that are under also our guardrail,” she said. “Remember that children at the age of six months … can refuse to eat and if they refuse to eat, they will not be able to grow properly.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthNestléChildrenFood & drink industryObesityAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”Referring to her fanbase, known as the Barbz, she continued: “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice. We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”Minaj’s collaboration with the White House comes just days after she publicly supported a Truth Social post from the US president in which he condemned what he called the Nigerian government’s failure to prevent attacks on Christians.Trump’s comments follow weeks of pressure from conservative Christian groups urging him to categorize the west African nation as a “country of particular concern” over alleged religious persecution. In his statements, Trump has not made mention of any violence against Muslims who have also been targeted by extremist religious groups,including Boko Haram.In response to Trump’s comments earlier this month, Minajwroteon X: “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude. We live in a country where we can freely worship God … Thank you to the president & his team for taking this seriously. God bless every persecuted Christian.”Trump has alsothreatenedto send US troops “guns-a-blazing” to Nigeria, which he called a “disgraced country”, adding that if the US did militarily intervene, “it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our cherished Christians.”Nigeria’s leadership has swiftly contested Trump’s comments, with its president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu,sayingthat Nigeria “is a democracy with constitutional guarantees of religious liberty”.Although the country is officially secular, Nigeria is closely split between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Despite violence against Christians having garnered international attention, analysts say the causes aremore complex, with many conflicts stemming from ethnic rivalries as well as land and water disputes, among other reasons.Kidnappings of priests and pastors have surged, as criminals see them as high-value targets whose communities can raise ransom quickly, prompting some analysts to view their actions as driven more by criminal profit than religious discrimination.Explore more on these topicsNicki MinajTrump administrationUS politicsNigeriaChristianityReligionAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986 and his government has been accused of human rights violations.Explore more on these topicsEswatiniUS immigrationAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian approached him for comment.On 27 October, Alrabea featured in a live TikTok broadcast hosted by an RSF figure called Zafer. Also in the broadcast was Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris,an active RSF fighter who goes by the name Abu Luluand who has appeared in numerous videos shot in El Fasher showing fighters killing unarmed people.“Today I killed 2,000 people and then I lost count. I want to start again from zero,” Abu Lulu says at one point, to which Alrabea responds with laughter. Elsewhere in the video Alrabea tells Abu Lulu he wants him to “fuck thesefalangayatup and down”, using a word considered a slur towards indigenous ethnic groups in Darfur.After the Guardian got in touch withTikTok, it said it had taken down Alrabea’s account, which had 240,000 followers,“for violating our policies on violent and criminal behaviour”. YouTube also said last week that it had removed his account, which had material dating back to December 2023, “for violating our violent extremist or criminal organisations policy”.View image in fullscreenScreengrabs from a broadcast featuring Alrabea and an active RSF fighter who goes by the name Abu Lulu.Photograph: Social mediaTikTok said it uses technology and moderation teams to vet content, including on TikTok Live. Videos broadcast on the Live feature do not stay on the platform after broadcast, meaning inflammatory material can go unnoticed by the wider world unless viewers make their own recordings.X has taken down Alrabea’s accounts in the past only for him to open new accounts that quickly gain followers. The company sent links to its rules on violent and hateful content in response to a request for comment.The RSFcaptured El Fasher from the Sudanese army late last month, since whenevidence has emergedof ethnically targeted mass killings, sexual violence and abductions.Satellite imagery analysed by Yale researchers has shown visible blood stainson the city’s streets and possible mass graves being dug.In January the United Statesformally declared that the RSF had committed genocideduring the war.Mohamed Suliman, a Sudanese researcher and writer based in Boston who lobbies social media companies to take down RSF-linked accounts, described Alrabea as a “dedicated RSF supporter” who “might be the group’s most influential social media activist”.He added: “RSF social media activists play a key role in strengthening the militia’s followers by spreading the narrative that justifies their war.”Alrabea is named in an application by British resident Yaslam Altayeb, who was detained by the RSF in the early months of the war, for the British government to apply sanctions against several individuals accused of supporting the RSF. Altayeb was eventually released and made his way back to the UK.Many of the videos Alrabea has appeared in have subsequently been deleted, though some have been archived by the online platform Sudan in the News.In June of this year Alrabea posted videos to YouTube and TikTok from El Fasher itself, during a visit to parts of the city that were under the control of the RSF at the time.0:29British citizen posts TikTok from inside El Fasher in Sudan – videoMohaned Elnour, a Sudanese human rights lawyer, said Alrabea’s ability to visit Darfur during an active conflict indicated he has influence within the organisation that went beyond cheerleading from his car.“His role is to recruit, to encourage,” said Elnour. “There are so many people spreading hate speech and trying to inspire the RSF but none of them were on the ground, meeting RSF officials, standing on top of tanks,” Elnour added, referring to an image shared by Alrabea from an earlier trip to Darfur in 2023. “Look at Rwanda, how it started – those who spread hate speech fuelled the war.”Explore more on these topicsSudanDarfurSheffieldTikTokYouTubeXIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

The US secretary of state suggested the story may have been spread by somebody “with a business card that has a government email on it” and argued that the reporting was both inaccurate and misleading.Initially, however, the UK had simply chosen to neither confirm nor deny the report and it waswidely covered. Because Britain has a handful of island territories in the Caribbean it has sought to monitor the movements of suspected drug traffickers, and swapped intelligence on the issue with the US under longstanding arrangements.Meanwhile, the US has stepped up its campaign against drug traffickers, who it says are linked to Venezuela and the regime ofNicolás Maduro, with the arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier in the Caribbean.The US has declared that its military killed 82 people in 21 attacks since September on vessels it accuses of being engaged in narco-trafficking. Donald Trump has designated drug cartels as terrorists and his administration has said it is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with them.However, many experts question whether the campaign is legal because drug traffickers are not attacking the US militarily or threatening it with imminent attack. Evidence to tie the bombed vessels to the drugs trade has been limited, though militaries are supposed to distinguish between civilian and military targets.View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper greets Marco Rubio before a US state visit to the UK.Photograph: Ben Dance/FCDOSeveral British naval officers are understood to be onboard the Gerald R Ford and its supporting ships. They continue to carry out their duties, UK defence sources indicated, because the warships have not been engaged in attacking alleged narco-traffickers orVenezuela.John Healey, the defence secretary, who was also with Cooper, said: “Wherever our forces are deployed, whatever they are asked to do, we as a nation are consistent about our compliance with international humanitarian law.” The UK had no intention of joining the US in an attack on Venezuela, sources said.The two ministers were in Naples onboard the newest of the UK’s two aircraft carriers, the Prince of Wales.

They would like to talk,” Trump told reporters.Asked if he would rule out US troops on the ground inVenezuela, Trump said “no I don’t rule out that.”At the same time, Trump stepped up his rhetoric towards Mexico, which he has accused of failing to tackle drug trafficking groups.“Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said when asked whether he would sanction a US counter-drug operation in Mexico.After returning to the White House in January, Trump – who tried, but failed to overthrow Maduro during his first term – took a different approach to relations with Caracas. The US president ordered his special envoy, Ric Grenell, to visit Maduro and some of his top officials as part of negotiations involving deportation flights, US prisoners in Venezuela and natural resources.In recent months, however, those talks appear to have been put on the back burner, as Venezuela hawks such as Rubio and Stephen Miller reportedly took control of policy on the South American country, although observers believe some channels were kept open.Since August, Trump’s administration has turned up the heat on Maduro’s regime with a series of deadly strikes targeting alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the largest naval deployment in the regionsince the 1989 US invasion of Panama.A $50m reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest was announced by the state department – twice the value once offered for the capture of the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. On Sunday, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean bringing the total number of US service people in the region to about 15,000.Stakes rise as Trump deploys world’s largest aircraft carrier to the CaribbeanRead more“Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela’s legitimate government,” Rubio said as he announced the cartel would be designated a foreign terrorist organization as of 24 November.Experts believe the campaign – while officially about halting drug trafficking and attacking groups such as the Cartel of the Suns – is fundamentally designed to pressure Maduro into stepping down with the threat of military force.Many Venezuela specialists are skeptical that the Cartel of the Suns even exists in the same way that Mexican cartels such as Sinaloa or Jalisco New Generation do. Rather, the name is seen as a dramatized description of the way in which Maduro has allowed criminal groups, including senior military figures, to exploit illegal industries including cocaine smuggling.“They know it doesn’t exist,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, who called the “fictitious” cartel “convenient shorthand” for Maduro’s power over the world of crime.“Of course there are people in the military doing drug trafficking. Of course the government allows them to do it and grants them impunity in order to keep them onside. But there isn’t a cartel as such. There’s no organization. It’s not like Maduro is sitting at the top of this organizational pyramid directing the traffic and saying: ‘Send five tonnes of cocaine to US this month, that’ll help bring down the Trump government.’”Gunson saw threatening to designate such a fantasy group within the week as the latest incremental step in pressuring Maduro to resign, or the military to topple him, or face possible airstrikes.But that campaign had so far failed. “It’s three months since the start of this and they are still escalating … but of course the more you escalate the fewer options you have for escalating and the more it becomes apparent that you are bluffing,” Gunson said.“It becomes less and less likely that Maduro is going to take them seriously which means that they might have to sail away, with nothing to show for it.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But other right-wing candidates took almost 30% of votes meaning Kast is now the clear favourite to win the run-off on 14 December.‘We need an iron fist’: the Trump-inspired favourite to win Chile’s electionRead moreShortly after the result became clear on Sunday night, the radical libertarian Johannes Kaiser, another right-wing candidate who took about 14% of votes, announced he would endorse his far-right rival, “because the alternative is Mrs Jara” and Chile’s “lefty impoverishers”.Evelyn Matthei, another conservative who won about 13% of votes, quickly followed suit, citing the “absolutely uncontrolled arrival” of migrants and claiming Chile needed a “sharp change of direction”.“Please support Kast … It’s super important that this government does not remain in power. We have too many problems,” Matthei told voters while on stage beside the frontrunner.View image in fullscreenPresidential candidate Jeannette Jara addresses supporters after early results in the general elections in Santiago, Chile.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/APBoric congratulated both candidates for making it to the second round after what Chile’s president called a “spectacular day of democracy”.Speaking in the capital, Santiago, Jara thanked supporters and urged them not to forget that Chile was a great country, despite her right-wing rivals’ attempts to claim it had gone to the dogs.Kast, 59, is making his third run for Chile’s presidency, having lost to Boric in 2021, and has built his campaign around two key promises: combating crime and immigration.One of Kast’s Trumpian plans – called Escudo Fronterizo (Border Shield) – foresees the construction of miles of ditches, barriers and walls along Chile’s northern border to keep migrants out. More than half a million Venezuelans have come to Chile in recent years as a result of their country’s economic collapse. “Chile has been invaded … but this is over,” Kast declared in one campaign ad.In October, Kast celebrated that 1.6 million migrants had “self-deported” from the US after 500,000 were deported under Trump.“That’s [a proportion of] three-to-one. Here, we think that it can be four-to-one, or five-to-one,” he said of his plans to create a hostile environment for immigrants in Chile.Another of Kast’s key pledges is a crackdown on foreign criminals, inspired by El Salvador’s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele, who hasimprisoned at least 2% of his country’s adult populationsince 2022. Public security has become one of the election’s central issues thanks to an increase in crimes such as assassinations, kidnapping and extortion, although Chile remains one of the region’s safest countries.Kast’s progress will be celebrated in Washington, where Trump officials such as secretary of state Marco Rubio have hailed a conservative wave they believe is sweeping South America. Last month, neighbouringBolivia elected a centre-right presidentafter 20 years of socialist rule. Rightwing candidates look well placed to win presidential elections in Colombia and Peru next year, while the leftwing veteran Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva faces a tough battle to hang on to the presidency in Brazil despite ex-presidentJair Bolsonaro’s recent sentencingfor masterminding a failed coup.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Wen, 26, has a history of disrupting public events and rushing concert stages.Video footage shows Wen jumping over a barricade at Universal StudiosSingaporeand rushing at Grande on the red carpet on 13 November. Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo immediately stepped in to help protect her and Wen was moved away.The court heard that after after being removed by security staff Wen made a second attempt to jump the barricades, after which security staff stopped him and pinned him down.0:23Moment man charges at Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore – videoWen regularly posts on Instagram as pyjamamann, where he has posted footage of stage invasions including those involving Katy Perry and the Weeknd. The footage of his approach to Grande led to a substantial backlash, with many commenters calling his actions a criminal offence.Grande and co-stars are on a mammoth publicity tour for the Wicked sequel, which is released on 21 November. The review embargo lifts on Tuesday and early reaction has suggested repeat Oscar nominations for the two stars are likely.Red-carpet invasions are increasingly uncommon as security has tightened over recent years. In 2007, podcaster Cielke Sijben handcuffed herself to Hugh Grant at a premiere of his romcom Music and Lyrics. Firefighters later freed the pair.Bradley Cooper was accosted on the red carpet in 2014 by a Ukrainian TV prankster who buried his head in the actor’s trousers, having given Will Smith an unsolicited kiss at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3 in 2012.

How are they getting away with it? | Zoe DanielRead moreThe north Asian country has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the world’s fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan, responsible forabout 8% of global trade. Coal provides about 30% of its electricity.“The shift from coal to clean power is not only essential for the climate. It will also help both the Republic of Korea and all other countries increase our energy security, boost the competitiveness of our businesses, and create thousands of jobs,” Kim said in a statement.The pledge commits Korea to retiring 62 coal plants, 40 of which already have confirmed closure dates. The analytics firm Kpler estimates Australia will sell about A$2.3bn (US$1.5bn) worth of thermal coal to South Korea this year.James Bowen, the director of consultancy ReMap Research, said South Korea’s decision would send a powerful signal across the Asia-Pacific.“For Australia to continue to rely on fossil fuel exports in the medium to long term is a risky strategy,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHe cited Australian Treasury modelling that suggested the country’s fossil fuel exportswould fall in value by about 50% over the next five yearsregardless of where the country set its national emissions reduction target. Total thermal coal sales from Australian mines last financial year were $32bn.“South Korea’s decision should prompt Australia to show leadership by discussing timeframes for its own fossil fuel phaseout while helping its regional neighbours to embrace clean energy,” Bowen said.Tim Buckley, the director of ClimateEnergyFinance, said the Korean announcement was “brilliant” news and showed Australia’s trading partners were “responding to climate science and their treaty obligations”.“Australia needs to pivot our export focus to low-emissions industries of the future, in particular exporting green iron and aluminium, critical minerals and lithium hydroxide to help our key trade partners jointly deliver on their decarbonisation objectives,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is formed of more than half a million people, clad in matching white T-shirts, the slogan “transparency for a better democracy” emblazoned on their chests.An estimated 650,000 of them have flooded the centre of Manila to protest, amid fury over aspiralling corruption scandalin which billions of dollars in flood mitigation funds have evaporated. Organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a powerful sect in the Philippines, the three-day rally has shut down schools, roads and offices. Many of those protesting have camped out all night on the park’s lawns, sleeping in tents or beneath tarpaulins and umbrellas. Families have journeyed from across the country to set up camp, some equipped with portable stoves and rice cookers, others pushing elderly family members in wheelchairs, many of them bearing placards saying “expose the deeds”.View image in fullscreenThe sea of white in Manila on Sunday.Photograph: Ezra Acayan/Getty Images“We are Filipino … that’s why we’re here. We have decided to unite as one people to try to make our government better, because there is so much corruption. Our money is being taken but the projects are never completed,” says Edward, 20, who has come from Batangas, a province about two hours away. “There are so many floods. And when the floods come, there are so many issues.”The focus of the fury is on company owners, government officials and parliament members accused of pocketing billions in funds for substandard or nonexistent flood protection projects. Since the scandal began, the country’s economic planning minister has said up to 70% of public funds allotted for flood control may have been lost to corruption;some senatorshave estimated 50%. Government investigators have discovered more than 400 “ghost” flood protection projects that were reported to have been completed but turned out to be nonexistent.1:26Thousands protest in the Philippines over disappeared flood defence funds – videoThe absence of those protections is felt keenly in the Philippines, where hundreds of people have died in typhoon-related flooding over the past month. More than 20 typhoons have hit the country’s territory this year, and extreme weather increasingly derails daily life. As the rally formed on Sunday, authorities and families were still searching for those missing fromTyphoon Kalmaegi, which ripped through the country in early November, killing at least 269. The 100 or so still missing are likely to also have been killed. Days after Kalgaemi blew through,Typhoon Fung-wongarrived, causing more devastating floods, displacing 1.4 million people and killing another 28.In Quezon City, thousands more people rallied at the People Power monument, in a protest led by progressive groups and retired generals. “Those in power no longer act in accordance with the welfare of the people and according to the wishes of the people,” Rey Valeros, the secretary general of the United People’s Initiative, the group behind the protest, told local media. “They no longer listen to the cries of the majority and they conduct their own investigations into what is happening. No one is punished and no one is held accountable.”The president,Ferdinand Marcos Jr, has attempted to quell public outrage, saying this week that officials involved in the scandal would be arrested and charged by end of year. “They’ll be jailed – there’s no merry Christmas for them,” he said.View image in fullscreenPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr has attempted to quell the public outrage.Photograph: Aaron Favila/APBut the hundreds of thousands gathered in Rizal Park could spell trouble for Marcos. The rally has been organised and endorsed by the INC, a Philippine megachurch that commands a membership of close to 3 million. Many of those attending cite their obligations to the sect, as well as their concern over corruption, as a reason for attending. “Our leader announced a rally. It’s our nature as the church to unite in the activity that our leader establishes,” says Leonard, a student who has travelled with his family from south-western Luzon to attend the protest.The INC is highly authoritarian and its members vote in a bloc, giving them considerable electoral influence. The sect’s leadership has endorsed the winning presidents of the last five elections, including the 2022 victor, Marcos, and his running mate, Sara Duterte. In the years since their election, however, Marcos and Duterte have turned from allies to feuding political rivals, and the INC has thrown its weight behind the latter.On Sunday, the INC spokesperson Edwil Zabala said the sect was not looking to topple the government. “We are not fighting the government. It is not our aim to bring down the government as an institution,” he said, criticising what he called efforts to portray the rally as an attempt to destabilise the administration.Addressing the crowds on Sunday, the religious leader Bienvenido Santiago Jr said: “We do not agree with a coup d’état, with a snap election … We do not want the fall of the government as an institution. What we want is the fall of corruption.”Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesFerdinand Marcos JrAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The Australian competition and consumer commission said respirable asbestos had not been detected in its samples, and the release of fibres was unlikely, unless the sand was crushed or pulverised.“The risk that any asbestos found is likely to be airborne or fine enough for inhalation is low,” it said.However, officials in both Australia and New Zealand advised education providers and individuals who had brought the products to immediately stop using the sand, and follow guidelines for how to safely dispose of it.New Zealand’s ministry for education said as of Sunday, 150 schools and 90 early childhood centres had sought advice from officials.The ministry could not yet confirm how many schools and preschools had closed on Monday, but multiple schools alerted their communities of closures on their websites and in posts to social media.Clearview primary in Rolleston, in the South Island, told parents the school would be closed for up to three days “out of an abundance of caution”. The classrooms would be professionally tested for asbestos, the school said.Tuia Burnside Primary School in Christchurch would also close on Monday.“While the risk to our staff and students is considered very low, WorkSafe has advised us to close tomorrow as a precaution so we can complete testing and ensure all learning spaces are safe,” it said in a post to Facebook.The education ministry’s spokesperson, Sean Teddy, said parents and caregivers would understandably feel worried about the presence of asbestos.“We recommend they contact Healthline with any health concerns they may have about their children who may have come into contact with these products,” Teddy said.More than seventy public schools and preschools in the Australian Capital Territory had closed, after the alert.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificAsbestosnewsShareReuse this content"

We can’t get rid of it. It’s a massive cost-of-living relief measure for literally hundreds of thousands of people who live in western Sydney.“Without a $60 a week toll cap, they’ll be paying full market rates to use toll roads in Sydney. It’s hugely, hugely onerous for them.”The horrific murders of Hannah Clarke and her children stunned Australia. Could they have been saved?Read moreA2024 independent reportfound Sydney drivers were spending $2.5bn annually on tolls in Sydney, with the greatest impact on residents of the western suburbs.Minns said the government was considering two-way tolling on state-owned assets, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge and tunnel, and the yet-to-be completed Western Harbour Tunnel and M6 motorway, to pay for making the cap permanent.“It’s not everybody’s cup of tea, but we think it’s the fairest thing to do when you consider that a lot of the communities that will use the Harbour Bridge have access to public transport,” the premier said.“Many communities in western Sydney and the Central Coast just don’t have anything like that.”Minns said two-way tolling on state-owned toll roads was likely to align with the completion of the Western Harbour Tunnel, which is scheduled for 2028.He said the cap was costing the government about $200m a year. The government originally allocated $561m over two years, although motorists lost the right to about $100m in unclaimed rebates in June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said more than 1,000 people were injured in the attacks.Until now much of the focus of discussion about the bill has beenthe possible impact it may haveon former and current British service personnel who could face legal proceedings over incidents that happened decades ago.But the UK government is keen to stress that if its new bill becomes law, it opens up thepossibility of justice– or at least answers – for families who lost loved ones dating back half a century.The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said: “The last government’s Legacy Act shut down police investigations and proposed immunity for terrorists. This left many families feeling they had nowhere to go to continue their search for justice, or simply for answers about what happened to their loved ones.”Jarvis, a former member of the Parachute regiment who served inNorthern Ireland, continued: “This government’s legislation will put that right. It guarantees no terrorist will be able to claim immunity from prosecution, while ensuring there is an effective and wholly independent legacy commission to conduct investigations that families right across the United Kingdom can have confidence in.”The UK government says that if measures in its new Troubles bill become law, a reformed legacy commission would have enhanced powers enabling it to conduct full police investigations, where there is evidence of criminality. The immunity scheme would also be scrapped.The Home Office said unsolved Troubles-related attacks on English soil ranged from the1974 M62 coach bombingwhen 12 people were killed and 38 injured to the1996 Manchester bombingin which more than 200 people were hurt.Graeme Downie, the MP for Dunfermline and Dollar, whose friend Tim Parry was killed aged 12 inthe Warrington bomb attacks in 1993, said families who lost loved ones should still have the chance for answers.He said: “I don’t know what happened that day in Warrington in 1993 other than someone I was friends with and played football with every week had been killed. I don’t know precisely who did it. There was talk of a rogue IRA unit but no answers.“I don’t seek revenge and I don’t think the Parry family ever expect to get justice, but I do want answers and so do hundreds of others.”He said if the new legislation helped just one family it would be worthwhile.Mo Norton, the sister of bombardier Terence Griffin, who was killed in the M62 coach bombing aged 24, said: “He served two tours in NorthernIreland, and it was conflict that took him – not on the battlefield, but on a coach returning from leave.“He was proud of his service, but never boastful. He had plans – hopes for the future. That morning, everything changed. Twelve lives were lost, including children. Our family was shattered. There was no warning, no chance to say goodbye. Just silence, and then years of unanswered questions.“I need to know that Terence’s death has been fully investigated, I don’t think it has been properly investigated in the past.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandNorthern Irish politicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Identifying the copyist who had written down the score, however, proved a challenge.Several years ago, Wollny’s co-researcher, Bernd Koska, discovered a letter from 1729, with similar handwriting by a hitherto unknown organist called Salomon Günther John, who claimed to have been one of Bach’s pupils in Arnstadt, Thuringia.It was only when the researchers managed recently to track down an earlier court document written by John with matching handwriting that they were certain that he had written down the score under Bach’s watch in 1705.“I searched for a long time for the missing piece of the puzzle to identify the compositions – now the whole picture is clear,” Wollny said at Monday’s presentation. “I am 99.99% certain that Bach composed both of these works.”JS Bach: where to start with his musicRead moreThe pieces are chaconnes, a musical form that typically uses series of variations over a short bass line.Wollny said the works were “highly individual” and “complex”, containing compositional tools that could only be found in Bach’s music at the time, such as the use of a fugue to weave a single theme into the broader musical tapestry.“This is an amazing discovery,” Canadian pianist and Bach specialist Angela Hewitt told the Guardian. “They are substantial pieces, and will be an excellent addition to the organist’s repertoire.“For me they are quite identifiable with Bach’s early style, in which the contrapuntal writing is not yet what it would become, but the imagination, grandeur, and sheer joy in playing are all there in abundance.”Germany’s federal minister for culture and media, Wolfram Weimer, described the discovery as a “great moment for the world of music”, adding: “This is more than just musical research. Colleagues in the press will write that it is a world sensation, but in truth, it is magic.”Ton Koopman, the Dutch organist who played the works, said he expected that musicians would perform them regularly in the future. “When one thinks of the young Bach or Mozart, it is often assumed that genius comes later in life – but that is not the case,” he told Agence France Presse.Explore more on these topicsJS BachGermanyEuropeClassical musicnewsShareReuse this content"

The 65 people who usually work there are being relocated while further investigations take place.“During these investigations, the Campana Gallery … will be closed to the public as a precautionary measure,” the statement said.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Fortunately, there was no tragedy, but the matter is nonetheless very serious,” Tusk said on Monday, after visiting the scene 60 miles (97km) from Warsaw, near the village of Mika.He described the attack as “an attempt to destabilise and destroy railway infrastructure, which could have led to a rail disaster”.‘These people are disposable’: how Russia is using online recruits for a campaign of sabotage in EuropeRead moreTusk said Polish authorities had already launched an investigation into the blast as well as another incident over the weekend that also appeared to involve rail sabotage. “Just like in previous cases of this kind, we will catch the perpetrators, regardless of who their backers are,” he said.The attack comes amida campaign of sabotage in Poland and other European countries that has been attributed to Russian security services, seeking to sow chaos and discord in Europe over support for Ukraine’s war effort. In Poland, this has included fires and explosions at shopping malls and other sites.Often, the perpetrators are Ukrainians, Belarusians or Polish citizens who are recruited for one-time jobs over the messaging app Telegram.Police said someone had reported hearing an explosion late on Saturday evening but officers performed checks and did not find anything. The damaged section of track was spotted by the driver of a regional train early on Sunday morning, who managed to make an emergency stop before reaching it.Dariusz Grajda, deputy chief executive officer of Polish State Railways, told Polish television that one of the previous trains had reported an issue with the track, which meant the train that stopped had been briefed on the problem and was travelling slowly enough to stop in time.The second incident took place near the town of Puławy on Sunday evening, when a train carrying 475 passengers was forced to make an emergency stop after damage to overhead power lines, and a metal brace was found on the tracks. There were also claims of a metal device found on the tracks. No one was injured in the incident, which occurred about 19 miles (30km) from the site of the track explosion.“According to preliminary findings, windows in one of the carriages were broken … Police officers are conducting investigations at the scene,” the Lublin police department said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It says that so long as reforms have occurred and the rebuilding ofGazais under way, then “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.The Russian-Chinese rival text is probably closer to the true views of the Arab states on a two-state solution, but the Gulf countries know they have to work with the US text since Trump’s endorsement is necessary in order forIsraelto accept the stabilisation force.Trump wants Arab or Muslim forces to supply troops for the force, which means its mandate and the prospect of a Palestinian state must be acceptable to them.However, it appears the US has held out against a Saudi call for the stabilisation force to be answerable to the UN, as opposed to a Trump-chaired “board of peace” as outlined under his 20-point plan.Saudi sources said it was remarkable that Trump was backing a motion to the UN endorsing the concept of a Palestinian state. TheTrump administrationhas largely ignored the UN or used its veto throughout the Gaza conflict.View image in fullscreenPalestinians are still piecing their lives back together as best they can amid the wreckage of Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, faced with a backlash from within his own government over the clause, said at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday that he did not need encouragement from anyone to express his opposition to a Palestinian state but that the clause was necessary since “no country was eager to join the multinational force in the Gaza Strip”.On Saturday, the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich had called on Netanyahu to denounce the idea of a Palestinian state. Smotrich said the prime minister had “chosen silence and diplomatic disgrace” while Ben-Gvir threatened to leave his coalition.Though both ministers were primarily rallying their own supporters before a looming election, a far-right walkout could bring down Netanyahu’s rightwing government well before the country goes to the polls, which must be by October 2026.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, and the foreign minister, Gideon Saar, also posted statements on X denouncing a Palestinian state on Sunday, without mentioning Netanyahu. “Israel will not agree to the establishment of a Palestinian terror state in the heart of the Land of Israel,” Saar wrote.Netanyahu has long opposed aPalestinian state, saying in recent months that its creation would reward Hamas and endanger Israel’s security. Speaking to his cabinet, Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s opposition to a Palestinian state had “not changed one bit”.Pressure for progress towards Palestinian statehood increased during the war in Gaza. In September, the UK, Australia and Canadaformally recognised a Palestinian statein Gaza and the West Bank, wheresettler violence against Palestinians has surgedand Israeli politicians have raised threats of annexation.The US draft says that as the stabilisation force establishes control and stability in Gaza, the Israeli military will withdraw. The standards and milestones that must be met for this withdrawal to occur would depend on agreement between the US, Israel, the stabilisation force and other parties.US military planning for divided Gaza with ‘green zone’ secured by international and Israeli troopsRead moreThe US, as reported by the Guardian, is however planning for thedivision of Gaza into a “green zone”under Israeli and international military control, where reconstruction would start, and a “red zone” to be left in ruins.A joint statement of support for the US stabilisation force proposal has been issued by nine countries including Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, the key countries from which troops are likely to be drawn, though unease about the Trump plan remains among Muslim countries.UAE and Jordan have both said they cannot supply troops while Israel has vetoed Turkey joining the force on the basis that Turkey is too close ideologically toHamas.The respective roles of the ISF – an external force – and a vetted Palestinian civilian police force is critical since the motion charges the ISF and not the police force with the delicate political task of overseeing the dismantling of Hamas weapons, the precondition for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.There are fears in Israel that the US may now compromise on its demand for Hamas to be entirely disarmed, given the massive challenges of convincing or forcing the militant Islamist organisation to give up all its weapons.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestineTrump administrationHamasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Over this period official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.The military last updated data on deaths in detention for May 2024, and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) in September 2024. PHRI researchers identified another 35 deaths in detention after these dates and confirmed them with Israeli authorities.Israeli detention deathsAlthough the total number of deaths charted is significantly higher than otherrecent estimates, it likely fails to capture the full scale of Palestinian loss, said Naji Abbas, director of the prisoners and detainees department at PHRI.“Even though we are providing evidence for a higher number of deaths than [previously reported] this is not a full picture,” he said. “We are sure that there are still people who died in detention that we don’t know about.”Classified Israeli data indicates the majority of Palestinian prisoners from Gaza who died in jail were civilians, according to a parallel investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Call.In May this year a military intelligence database tracking all Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in Gaza, a list of more than 47,000 named individuals, listed only 21 deaths in custody. By that point 65 Palestinians from Gaza had died in jail.The figures for death in detention cover “security prisoners”, a category that includes civilians from Gaza held without charge or trial and prisoners of conscience from the occupied West Bank. Three of the dead were Palestinians with citizenship or residency in Israel.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers stand by a truck packed with bound and blindfolded Palestinian detainees in Gaza, 8 December 2023.Photograph: Moti Milrod/APPhysical violence, torture and other abuse of Palestinians has been normalised across Israel’s jail system over two years of war, with the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasting aboutstarvation rationsand anunderground jailholding Palestinians who never see daylight.Current and formerdetaineesandwhistleblowersfrom the Israeli military have all allegedsystemic violationsof international law.The institutionalised cruelty came with a disturbing rise in deaths recorded across at least 12 civilian and military facilities in Israel. In the decade before the war, there were on average two or three deaths a year.“This isn’t just an individual case here and there. It is systemic and it will continue,” Abbas said, in part because there is a culture of near total impunity for killing and mistreating Palestinians.Just one case of assaulting detainees has come to trial, with the soldier sentenced to seven months. An attempt to prosecute others over a vicious assault including sexual violence led to right-wing protests and thearrestof Israel’s top military lawyer, with the suspects now demanding charges against them are dropped.“Despite this mass number of deaths, over two years no one has been arrested,” Abbas said. “There have been no charges over any killing.“While these policies are being applied, every Palestinian in detention is in danger, even the healthy ones, even the young ones who have no [underlying] medical issues.”Some deaths in detention have been high profile, includingAdnan al-Bursh, 50, who was the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa hospital, and died in Ofer prison after four months in detention.A prisoner held with Bursh testified that he was brought to the yard by guards shortly before his death, visibly injured and naked from the waist down. His body has not been returned to Gaza.Others prisoners who died in Israeli custody remain anonymous. The Prison Service and military provided PHRI with the number of deaths in detention, and minimal other details including the site where they died, but not the prisoners’ names.In 21 cases, mostly individuals from Gaza, PHRI was not able to match the few details provided by authorities to a death recorded by rights organisations, either through testimony from released detainees or reporting in the media.The detainees’ families may not know about their loved ones’ deaths either, as Israel has made it difficult to track Palestinians it is holding. For seven months at the start of the war the Israeli military refused to provide basic information about the status of thousands of people detained in Gaza, in effect implementing a policy of forced disappearance, PHRI said.From May 2024 it has provided an email address for enquires about Palestinians from Gaza, but this has provided only a partial and limited improvement. PHRI noted “continued failures and lack of transparency”.Lawyers are repeatedly told there is no record of their client’s arrest, even when it has been well documented. Over six months last year, Israeli authorities gave this response to inquiries about the status of about 400 individuals, rights group HaMoked said.Among the most high-profile prisoners is Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan hospital, who wasdetainedduring a raid in December 2024.

Israeli forces arrived at their home in Khan Younis in March 2024, interrogated both men in front of their relatives then took them away.When HaMoked tried to trace them on behalf of the family, the military repeatedly claimed it had no record of detaining either man. A legal appeal in October won an admission that the men were “no longer alive”, and a claim military police were investigating their deaths.View image in fullscreenPeople lift placards bearing portraits of Palestinians detained by Israel, including Hussam Abu Safiya, during a protest in the West Bank on 14 January 2025.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesAnother former detainee testified he was forced to serve as a human shield for Israeli soldiers with the father and son. There are likely to be other families who should be mourning but are still hoping their loved one will return from Israeli jails.Under the ceasefire agreed in mid-October, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners who had been convicted in Israeli courts, and 1,700 Palestinian detainees fromGazawho had been held indefinitely without charge or trial.However, the scale of detentions has been so vast that even after that mass release, at least 1,000 others are still held by Israel under the same conditions.The Israeli military said that it acts “in accordance with Israeli and international law”, and is aware of the deaths of detainees, including those with pre-existing medical conditions or injuries “as a result of the hostilities”.“As per standard protocol, an investigation is conducted for each death of a detainee by the military police,” the military said in a statement.The IPS said it operates in accordance with the law, “examines” every death in custody and refers cases to the “competent authorities as required”.“The claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented,” it said in a statement.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Since shefled the countryin August last year, Hasina has been living in exile – and under protection – in neighbouring India, and the Indian government has ignored requests for her extradition to face trial.Family members of killed protesters broke down in tears in the courtroom as judges handed death sentences to Hasina and the former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, her co-accused in the trial.Hasina’s absence from the defendant’s box was stark. In a statement released after the ruling, Hasina said she had not been given a “fair chance” to defend herself in court and claimed she had only acted in “good faith” to bring disorder under control.View image in fullscreenPeople wave Bangladesh’s national flag as they celebrate the court’s verdict in Dhaka.Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty ImagesShe said the verdict had been “made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate”.Dhaka was on edge in the run-up to the decision, with security tightened across the capital and police, army and paramilitaries cordoning off the tribunal area. In the days before the verdict there was a sharp rise in political violence, including dozens of crude bombs set off across the city. Dhaka police issued a “shoot-on-sight” order for anyone caught launching explosives or setting fire to vehicles.On Monday morning a crude bomb was hurled on to a road close to the court, setting off panic and prompting police to blockade the roads.‘She’s the one who shattered us’: families of slain Bangladesh students wantk to hold Sheikh Hasina to accountRead moreThe protest that toppled Hasina began as astudent movementand escalated into a nationwide uprising, now referred to as the “July revolution”, against Hasina’s authoritarian rule.Her 15 years in power were seen as a reign of terror by many inBangladesh, marred by allegations of corruption, torture and enforced disappearances, which were documented by human rights organisations and the UN.In response to the unrest, Hasina oversaw a ruthless, state-led crackdown, with documented use of live ammunition against civilians by police and security forces. The UN human rights office estimates up to 1,400 people were killed during the uprising, the worst political violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 independence war.The prosecution of Hasina has been a core promise made by the interim government led by the Nobel laureateMuhammad Yunus, who was appointed to lead the country by protest leaders last year. The government appointed Mohammad Tajul Islam as chief prosecutor to build a case that would be heard by the international crimes tribunal in Dhaka.Hasina was tried alongside her former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah al-Mamun. Mamun had pleaded guilty and turned state witness against Hasina in July. In the verdict, judges said the crimes committed by Mamun carried “capital punishment” but that he would be shown leniency for his cooperation.View image in fullscreenBangladeshi soldiers stand guard outside the supreme court in Dhaka.Photograph: Rajib Dhar/APIn a push for transparency, much of the tribunal proceedings were broadcast live. One of the key incidents highlighted by prosecutors was the killing of Abu Sayeed, a university student, who died after police fired at close range and whose killing – captured on camera – became a rallying cry for the uprising.The prosecution described Hasina as “the mastermind, conductor and superior commander” of the July and August atrocities. The case cited audio recordings of calls made by Hasina to directly link instructions from the prime minister’s office to the deadly street operations.The use of the international crimes tribunal to try Hasina had been met with some criticism by human rights groups. The court had been established by Hasina herself and her opponents have accused her of using it to pursue politically motivated cases while she was in power. Human Rights Watch said that despite some changes, it still fell short of fair-trial standards and safeguards while retaining the right to pass down the death penalty.The Yunus government had rejected the criticism, saying the tribunal “functioned transparently, allowing observers and publishing regular documentation”.View image in fullscreenStudent protests in Dhaka on 4 August 2024Photograph: Monirul Alam/EPAFor families of those killed in the uprising, the verdict against Hasina brought some relief and catharsis. Golam Rahman, 55, lost his son Golam Nafis after he was shot on 4 August at the height of the unrest.Rahman said the death sentence for Hasina was “the only acceptable verdict for what was done to my child. We buried a boy, not an enemy of the state. Nothing will bring him back, but the truth has to be said in court.”Nafis’s last known photograph – of him lying in a three-wheeled pedal rickshaw as the puller tried to get him to the hospital – has circulated widely online and been stencilled as graffiti across Dhaka.“We, the families of martyrs in the uprising, want to see her hanged as an example to future rulers,” Rahman said. “Let no government think it can turn its guns on children and walk away.”Bangladesh’s first election since the fall of Hasina is due to take place in early February. Her Awami League party has been banned from taking part. Though most of its leaders are in jail or in hiding abroad, the party has vowed to cause mass unrest in response.Hasina’s son Sajeeb Wazed told Reuters that though his mother would remain “safe” in Delhi after the verdict, Hasina would not sit back quietly. “She’s upset, angry, outraged,” he said. “And we are all determined to fight back by whatever means necessary.”Explore more on these topicsSheikh HasinaBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The party claims its measures would save £25bn a year in total – enough to cover the supposed shortfall faced by Rachel Reeves in next week’s budget.Other proposed cost savings would involve cutting overseas aid to a maximum of £1bn a year – a 90% reduction from the current level of 0.3% of national income – and almost tripling the NHS surcharge paid by non-UK residents.While Farage will present the package as prioritising the welfare of British nationals over non-citizens, the proposal to unilaterally junk elements of the post-Brexit deal with Brussels could affect the UK economy if it sparked reciprocal measures such as trade restrictions.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage claims his party’s policies would fix the country’s finances.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAccording to a Reform statement released on Monday night, all overseas nationals – including those with EU settled status – would lose the right to claim universal credit after a three-month notice period, which the party said would save £6bn a year.EU nationals – plus citizens from the European Economic Area and Switzerland – were able to apply for settled status under the terms of the Brexit deal, allowing access to public services and some benefits.While Reform has described this deal as “atrocious and one-sided”, ending elements of it without negotiation could see UK nationals in the EU also face action, and possible trade measures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party argues the current cost is “clearly too low”, and says overseas nationals used the NHS more on average.Other elements of the claimed £25bn in annual savings include £580m that would be recouped by deporting all foreign criminals.The plans were first reported in The Times – with Reform’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, telling the newspaper: “Labour has a choice. They can either go ahead and raise taxes on British citizens or they can enact our proposals which put British people first and ask foreign nationals to bear the brunt of the black hole, not British citizens.“Most British people would consider it outrageous to expect British people to pay higher taxes or see their services cut whilst their money is being spent this way.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage’s fantasy numbers don’t add up, and he’d leave British taxpayers footing a hefty bill.“Farage is happy to slap British shoppers with higher prices at the checkouts by risking a trade war with Europe.

The protocal said police should not be used for what it called “low-level behaviour management or matters a reasonable parent would not have called the police over”.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, said: “Strengthening the protocol will mean these children are treated as children, rather than criminals. Ensuring they get proper help and support means we can change the path they’re on, stop them turning to lives of crime and give them a more positive future.Thechildren’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, said her office regularly saw cases where traumatised children taken into care after being exploited, abused or groomed by adults subsequently found themselves subjected to heavy-handed criminal punishment and retribution rather than care and support.She said: “Children with complex needs or disabilities whose behaviours require significant care from expert professionals, are criminalised for lashing out and damaging property. My case workers tell me time and time again about instances of children’s homes calling the police because a child breaks something.“For any other child, these would not be ‘incidents’ documented in writing. There would be no report, no police involvement. They would usually be handled by parents or other caregivers in private, where children are allowed to be children.”In one case cited by de Souza, Jimmy, a boy with autism and significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, was effectively contained in an illegal children’s home under 24-hour supervision, unable to play outside or go to school.“One day Jimmy threw something that hit one of these staff members. They were not seriously injured but the police were called. Jimmy was charged and then convicted. He, a disabled child, had to pay a fine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were less likely to commit drug or knife offences.The research said that while it was impossible to generalise about the nature of the offences, it was notable that many of the incidents such as violence towards carers and damage to homes “get a police response which would not happen in a family home, which can in turn escalate to violence towards those police officers”.It adds: “This analysis of first offences of children appears to support the idea that for many children who come into care, they are being brought into the criminal justice system by the very people who should be protecting them from it.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

In Washington DC, where the president has more control over the guard than in states, troops were ordered to remain therethrough at least February.After sending troops to the nation’s capital, Trumpsentothers to Chicago and threatened to send more to other Democratic-run cities such asSan FranciscoandNew York.Meanwhile, months of upheaval at the defense department have been a hallmark ofPete Hegseth’s tenure. Last month, Hegseth, the US defense secretary,abruptly firedthe navy chief of staff. In May, he ordered the military to cut 20% of its four-star generals and admirals, while Hegseth and Trump have fired more than half a dozen top generalssince January.The Trump administration has alsofiredthe only two women serving as four-star officers. In February, Hegseth alsofiredair force general CQ Brown Jr, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff and the second Black man to serve in that role.Monday’s report warns about the consequences of such efforts, most acutely the “erosion of the armed forces’ apolitical character”.“When service members, senior leaders, or military symbols are perceived as aligned with political agendas, the public begins to see the institution as partisan rather than national – and once eroded, that trust is difficult to rebuild,” reads the report. “This loss of trust makes it harder to recruit across the political spectrum, harder to retain talent, and harder to reassure allies and deter adversaries abroad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We control the purse. We have oversight authority. We can pass legislation. And we must act now.”Reed called on lawmakers to pass legislation that requires the administration to publicly explain to and notify Congress when it removes senior generals or admirals, as well as measures that would “establish clear standards requiring congressional approval for domestic military deployments except in genuine emergencies”.The report by former military leaders outlines similar recommendations to Congress, calling on lawmakers to require “clear justification and post-action review of significant domestic deployments and high-level personnel changes”.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme courtreinstatedher and will in January hear arguments over Cook’s removal.In theletter, addressed to Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Edward Martin, the deputy attorney general, Abbe Lowell, Cook’s lawyer, outlined for the first time Cook’s detailed defense against the accusations. Lowell said that the dispute involves three of Cook’s properties: a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, and a home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Lowell said Cook’s primary residence is in Ann Arbor, where she has been a professor at Michigan State University since 2005. While she has been on unpaid leave from the position as she serves on the Fed board, she intends to return to Ann Arbor once her post ends, the letter said.Cook was raised in Milledgeville, Georgia – a town outside Atlanta. In 2021, Cook purchased a condo in Atlanta to have a place that is close to her family. Though one line on the mortgage application for the property lists it as a primary residence, Lowell argued that it was clearly “inadvertent” and was an “isolated notation”.Any proof of criminal wrongdoing must show that Cook had intentionally misrepresented the property to defraud lenders. But other loan documents show Cook said the home was a vacation home, and nowhere else did she say it was her primary residency. In annual financial disclosures, Cook has listed the condo accurately as a “personal residence”, Lowell wrote.For her home in Cambridge, which Cook purchased before she moved to Ann Arbor, Lowell wrote that she has consistently listed the home as a second home and rental property for mortgage documents.In his letter, Lowell specifically criticized William Pulte, a Trump ally and director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), for using his role to help target Trump’s political enemies. Pulte has also targeted Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, two vocal critics of Trump, for similar accusations of mortgage fraud.“The complete package of Governor Cook’s materials clearly demonstrate that this does not amount to the type of criminal wrongdoing that Director Pulte and the president state it to be,” Lowell wrote. “Governor Cook’s loan documents made clear her intended uses and, therefore, were not submitted with an intent to mislead the lender or anyone else.”Lowell also said that while Pulte said that anyone, Republican or Democrat, should be held accountable for mortgage fraud, recent reporting has found that four members of Trump’s cabinet,includingScott Bessent, the treasury secretary, also had similar discrepancies on their mortgage documents.“His actions undercut his words. If one seemingly facial contradiction about several property documents were the basis for the mortgage fraud he claims, then one would expect that he would have made referrals to [the justice department] based on the same types of documents about others who appear to have similar or analogous primary residences for more than one home,” Lowell wrote. “Yet, director Pulte has ignored many of those allegations.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This time, Bezos has appointed himself co-CEO of an AI startup called Project Prometheus,the New York Timesreported, citing anonymous sources.The startup, which will focus on developing AI for engineering and manufacturing in various fields, has already received $6.2bn in funding – more than many companies are able to raise in their lifetimes. Leading the company alongside Bezos is his co-founder and co-CEO Vik Bajaj, a celebrity tech executive in his own right. Bajaj is a physicist and chemist best known for his work at Google’s moonshot factory, X, where he founded the health startup Verily.It is unclear how long the company has existed, but Project Prometheus has already hired 100 employees, poaching several from firms like OpenAI, DeepMind and Meta, according to the Times. Little else is known about the project, as Bezos did not disclose where the company will be based or how its technology might function. The world’s third-richest person has been closely involved at his aerospace company Blue Origin for several years as its founder and sole shareholder, but becoming a CEO again will be the first formal role Bezos has taken since stepping down fromAmazon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Entitled? Lazy? Gen Z faces familiar flood of workplace criticismA new generation of younger workers are being derided as delusional and unreliable, just as millennials wereJenna ZazaMon 17 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 06.01 ESTShareGen Z isundisciplined, apparently;entitled, some critics claim; and purportedlyhates work. One viral column in the Wall Street Journal went so far as to suggest this entire generation waspotentially “unemployable”.As younger employees establishing themselves at work continue to face relentless criticism from the higher rungs of corporate America, those old enough to remember the arrival of the last generation could be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu.Millennials wereonce deridedas lazy, entitled, delusional, narcissistic and unreliable, too: many of the same accusations now leveled at gen Z.Scams, silence, rejection: US job seekers describe ‘depressing’ work prospectsRead more“Every generation tends to complain about the one next to us,” said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton Business School. “Everyone used to hate millennials, and now it’s gen Z.“We tend to compare [the younger generation] to our current selves, which is a mistake because most people are more narcissistic and self-centered at age 20 than they are at age 40. That’s part of development and maturity.”While this is a recurring cycle, in which each new generation faces scrutiny as they enter the workforce, this time it has been intensified, according to industry experts, by gen Z’s disillusionment with the institutions that they deem to have failed them.Older generations also tend to directly compare their strengths with younger generations’ weaknesses, according to Grant – exaggerating the divide and often painting the younger generation in an unfairly negative light.“I think that narrative is a bullshit,” Jahnavi Shah, 25, said of the harshest accusations hurled at gen Z. “The generations before us, they were just all about work and then life would take a back seat. We are a really smart generation that hustles, but we also don’t want to burn out, and want to be paid adequately for the value that we bring in.”Shah recently landed her first full-time role at a tech startup in San Francisco, California, after a seven-month search, and almost a thousand applications.Previous generations “would cold-apply, and get interviews from big tech companies”, she said. “But with every application I sent, and every rejection that followed, I felt like I lost a little bit of me.”Nadya Okamoto, 27, co-founder of August, an eco-conscious menstrual products company, also strongly disagrees with the criticisms leveled against gen Z. “If you look at a lot of the jobs that gen Z is known to do really well, like social media marketing, they weren’t jobs 20 years ago, so in this sense we’re obviously employable,” she said. “Gen Z gets a bad rep for entitlement – for wanting certain expectations, like work-life balance.”Gen Z grew up watching institutions, both financial and political, fail to deliver on promises of stability and wealth, planting a deeplack of faith, said Grant– and, for many younger workers, any implicit trust between employee and employer is no more.“Gone are the times when you took a job with one employer, and you stayed there for 35 years, and you plan to retire there, and you expected them to take care of you,” said Grant. “If you look at the number of downsizing and mass layoffs that have happened, those are major betrayals [to the employees].”This generation is different to its predecessors, in some respects. Flexibility, purpose and employees’ wellbeing matter more than overtime and promotions, according to Madeline Miller, a leadership and culture strategist. “The capitalist system is extractive, and gen Z are starting to say: ‘I’m tired and I’m going to get nothing out of this,’” she said.“There’s more ways to make money outside the corporate cog that grants freedom and flexibility, so we enter the workforce with much higher standards,” said Okamoto. “We realized we don’t actually have to be that burnt out any more and … American capitalism needs a change in which people are actually valued.”Gen Z does not see the value in overtime and focuses on “smart work”, optimizing artificial intelligence tools to complete a 10-hour task in just five hours instead, according to Shah, the tech worker. A Deloittesurveypublished earlier this year found that over half of gen Z employees reported using AI regularly in their work.Values and priorities appear to be shifting, too. According to the Deloitte research, 89% of gen Z workers and 92% of millennials consider a sense of purpose to be very or somewhat important for their job satisfaction.Companies that dismiss or write off gen Z staff ultimately put their overall performance at risk, according to Grant, who said both older managers and their younger staff can benefit from ditching stereotypes and learning from each other.“It is a new generation that comes in and holds up a mirror so you can see yourself more clearly and see how you may not have kept up with the way the world has evolved,” added Grant. “Older generations have a lot of knowledge and experience to offer. Younger generations have fresh perspectives and digital savvy. We want to cross-fertilize between the generations.”For companies, this isn’t optional, according to Miller, who claimed that firms who fail to do so risk “imploding”.“Gen Z is going to transform the way we work completely,” she said. “Adapting means companies should become curious about gen Z, and integrate personal and professional development – rather than imposing existing structures, hierarchies and leadership models on them.”"

The film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public scorn from conservatives.Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.) A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.When it comes to the darker aspects of the story, though, Rule Breakers is less assured. Except for minor scenes depicting the girls’ rejection for American visas, the film rarely grapples with the war inAfghanistanand its effects on women. From external funding to newspaper coverage, the film sets up a dichotomy between western support and domestic oppression, but this is a distinction that requires more political nuance considering the legacy of American interventionism in the region. While spirited in parts, the journey taken by this extraordinary robotics team deserves a more layered storytelling approach than that of a feelgood movie.Rule Breakers is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRobotsEngineeringAfghanistanSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.Anthony Joshua will ‘break internet over Jake Paul’s face’ as fight is confirmedRead morePaul is a brilliant hustler and, until now, he has chosen his opponents with deliberate care to avoid excessive danger. His most obviously successful stunt was toentice a 58-year-old Mike Tysoninto the ring last November. It turned out to be the biggest “fight” of 2024, but it was an inevitable charade as Tyson was a shell of the great he had once been. Years of self-abuse, allied to severe depression, a stomach ulcer, a bad knee and acute sciatica, meant Tyson shuffled around the ring and took the odd punch for an astronomical purse.Joshua is 36 and he has kept a notably low profile since his crushingdefeat by Daniel Dubois 14 months ago. His gaze had appeared fixed on a wildly lucrative showdown with Tyson Fury – who lost his past two fights against Oleksandr Usyk.Last Saturday, beforeConor Benn outboxed Chris Eubank Jr, Turki al-Sheikh, the chair of the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority and the man who controls world boxing at its highest level, told 60,000 people at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that he would put on two massive fights next year. He smiled knowingly when asked if the two-fight deal for Fury-Joshua had been sealed.Eddie Hearn, the promoter, had said Joshua was planning a tune-up against a journeyman in preparation for Fury. But the offer of a crazy amount of money to meet Paul has taken precedence and will serve as a gentle hit before the real business begins.View image in fullscreenJake Paul (right) beat the 58-year-old Mike Tyson last November.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images for Netflix © 2024Joshua, like Fury, is well past his prime, but he stays in terrific shape and has fought at the peak of the heavyweight division for the past 10 years. He also hits very hard and, should he wish to make some kind of statement about the gulf between genuine fighters and YouTube “disruptors”, he could really hurt Paul.The suspicion remains that this will turn out to be a more controlled arrangement with Joshua choosing to avoid causing much damage to the man who is going to make him tens of millions of dollars. That gut reaction is confirmed by the fact that their contest has been limited to eight rounds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mark my words, you’ll see a lot more fighters take these opportunities in the future. I’m about to break the internet over Jake Paul’s face.”Paul responded with his customary swagger: “This isn’t an AI simulation. This is Judgment Day. When I beatAnthony Joshua, every doubt disappears and no one can deny me the opportunity to fight for a world title. To all my haters, this is what you wanted.”That last line was a clear acknowledgment that if a proper fight breaks out it would be a shock if Joshua did not knock out Paul. After all, in his modest résumé of 13 professional “fights”, Paul has faced only one relatively competent contemporary boxer. But Tommy Fury is not really a boxer at all andhe still beat Paulin a cruiserweight bout in 2023.Paul has since stuck to his usual diet of mock fisticuffs and, as a heavyweight, he was meant to meet Gervonta Davis, a gifted, but troubled world lightweight champion, in a bizarre exhibition this month. But itwas cancelledafter a lawsuit, citing domestic abuse,was filed against Davisby his ex-girlfriend. Paul, who has been an admirable champion of women’s boxing, lambasted Davis and promised he would find himself a superior opponent.Joshua has stepped into the void. He and Paul will make a ludicrous amount of money,Netflixwill record huge ratings and boxing will seem just a little more broken. Hopefully, there will be no need for Paul to be taken away in an ambulance and we can all find a way to feel a tad less grubby after the circus is over.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuaNetflixUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

However, secretary of state Marco Rubio made clear that expedited processing does not mean automatic entry.“Your ticket is not a visa. It doesn’t guarantee admission to the US,” Rubio said. “It guarantees you an expedited appointment. You’re still going to go through the same vetting. We’re going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get. The only difference here is we’re moving them up in the queue.”The warning suggests non-American citizens within the roughlymillion peoplewho have already bought tickets could find themselves barred from entering the country despite holding valid match passes and securing faster appointment slots.Fifa president Gianni Infantino said World Cup officials would eventually sell up to 6 to 7 million tickets and told reporters in the Oval Office “we’ll have between five and 10 million people coming to America from all over the world”.So far, most demand has been domestic: the US, Mexico and Canada will be co-hosting the tournament next June and make up the majority of ticket holders. But Fifa said people from212 different countriesand territories have also already bought their tickets.To handle the surge in applications, Rubio said the state department has deployed more than 400 additional consular officers worldwide, in some cases doubling embassy staff. The measures have already slashed visa wait times from up to a year to 60 days or less in approximately 80% of countries, according to Rubio.“In places, for example, like Brazil and Argentina, you would have [had] over a year to get an appointment. Now you can get [one] in less than two months,” Rubio said.Separately, Trump threatened to relocate matches from host cities he deems problematic, singling out Seattle and its new democratic socialist mayor. The city is scheduled to host six games.“If we think there’s going to be the sign of any trouble, I would ask [Fifa president] Gianni [Infantino] move that to a different city. We have a lot of cities that would love to have it,” Trump said. “If we think there’s a problem in Seattle where you have a very, very liberal-slash-communist mayor … we’re going to move the event to some place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe.”The president said he would be willing to deploy the national guard to Los Angeles, another host city, citing concerns with crime and demanding California officials request federal assistance immediately.“I would love to send in [the] national guard, or whoever’s necessary to help them,” Trump said. “If there’s even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before the problem. We want to make it totally safe for [Infantino] and Fifa and all the great people that are going to be there.”Trump called the tournament a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for the country.

Ramsey grabbed Chase by the facemask and punched him in retaliation, which resulted in Ramsey’s ejection. Officials, who said after the game they did not see Ramsey spitting, took no action against the receiver at the time.Déjà boo: Sam Darnold didn’t think he’d see ghosts on the field again. Then he faced the RamsRead moreTheNFLsaid Chase was disciplined under a rule that applies to “any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship.”After Sunday’s game, which the Bengals lost 34-12, Chase denied having spat at Ramsey. But a Cincinnati television station had video of the incident. Chase did not speak to reporters in the Bengals’ locker room on Monday.Chase will miss the Bengals’ home game against New England this weekend. He has a right to appeal the suspension. Cincinnati are 3-7 and have lost three straight games. According to the NFL Players Association database, Chase will be docked at least $448,333,33 in base salary as a result of the suspension.Bengals coach Zac Taylor said before the league announced the suspension that he had talked to Chase about the incident.“It’s like we are trying to make something out of this situation. It’s the only thing that’s kind of upset me as I’m sitting in here,” Taylor said. “For a guy that has done everything we can to build our organization around, he’s been awesome. Not perfect. I’m not perfect. Trust me, I made plenty of mistakes yesterday [that] people don’t see on camera. Unfortunately his was. He’s going to have to own up for that. That will be part of his journey.”It’s the second time this season that the league has disciplined a player for spitting. Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was initially suspended one game forspitting on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescottin the season opener. Carter eventually forfeited his Week 1 game check worth $57,222 and avoided missing any more games because the ejection happened early in the game and the league applied that as time served.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was found not guilty in the 1994 knife killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman, her friend, in Los Angeles. But Simpson was taken to court again and found liable for the deaths in a separate civil case. He was ordered to pay the families $33.5m, an award that has grown due to interest.LaVergne accepted a claim of $58m, according to a court document filed Friday in Clark County, Nevada. The figure that was sought was $117m.Fred Goldman’s attorney, Michaelle Rafferty, said the estate has accepted the claim as valid but “it does not constitute payment.”“We will continue to closely monitor the probate proceedings,” she said in an email.Simpson lived in Las Vegas afterserving nine years in prison for armed robbery, kidnapping and assault, charges related to a confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers in a hotel room in 2007. He typically declined to discuss his finances other than to say he lived on his NFL and private pensions.Explore more on these topicsSportNFLOJ SimpsonUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

They had two games remaining inWorld Cupqualifying and apparently no hope of making it to North America next summer. Another campaign had collapsed in predictable ways: they couldn’t score, they made bafflingly simple errors, too few of their players play for elite sides and those that do seemed unable to reproduce club form for their country.Their one possible star, Evan Ferguson, had not been energised by a move to Roma – quite the reverse – and although there was vague talk of a new contract for their manager, the amiable Icelandic dentist Heimir Hallgrímsson, everybody thought he would be off after the game in Hungary and was vaguely dreading another Football Association of Ireland recruitment saga, which would inevitably take months, throw up a series of implausible names and result in the job being given to Hallgrímsson’s assistant, John O’Shea.What made it all the more frustrating was that, if you could somehow leave aside the abject defeat in Armenia and the two daft goals conceded early against Hungary in Dublin, there had actually been, if you looked really closely, glimmers of positivity – albeit those are much clearer in hindsight. They had played pretty well to come back to draw that game against Hungary. They had held Portugal in Lisbon until injury-time, despite an extremely soft penalty being awarded against them. But when Ferguson, who had scored the only goal in an uninspiring home win over Armenia last month, succumbed to an ankle injury, all seemed lost.World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?Read moreEnter Troy Parrott. The 23-year-old used to be the great hope of Irish football. It never quite worked for him at Tottenham, though, and he ended up moving to the Netherlands. He’s started to blossom at AZ, scoring 14 league goals last season and six in seven games this season. But there had only ever really been flickers at international level. He had fallen behind Ferguson in the pecking order. But he scored twice in the first half against Portugal on Thursday. Then Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for an elbow, which added, for the Irish, an element of delicious comedy. A lad who performed the crybaby gesture at the superstar as he left the pitch became a brief celebrity.And beyond it all, conveniently disguised between headlines about Ronaldo’s first international red card, was the realisation that they could take second in the group and a playoff spot.This is what these final weeks of World Cup qualifying can do. Unexpected possibilities suddenly emerge. That’s why these games can be some of the greatest in football; opportunity can suddenly knock for teams who are unused to it. There is a great democracy to it: whether you’re Erling Haaland or Ireland’s Finn Azaz, Kylian Mbappé or Meschak Elia of DR Congo, the prize is the same.All Ireland had to do was win in Hungary against a team who, for all their superior players, had looked vulnerable in Dublin. The event itself almost felt like a different sport than the one played in the Premier League: tension and occasional flurries of action, football in its rawest form. Ireland went behind after three minutes. Parrott levelled with a penalty. They went behind again before half-time, but that almost made it easier: they had to score twice in the second half. On the hour, Festy Ebosele and debutant Johnny Kenny came on for Seamus Coleman and Jayson Molumby, a final attacking gamble. Parrott levelled on 80 minutes, a finish of real deftness.The clock hit 90. Still 2-2. Five minutes added. The game moved into a sixth additional minute. Caoimhin Kelleher launched a long pass from halfway. Liam Scales flicked it on. There was a momentum, an inevitability, everything converging all at once on the Hungarian goal. The keeper Dénes Dibusz hesitated. Parrott got ahead of his man, got a toe to the ball and, with apparent icy clarity of vision, had the awareness to nudge the balldown. Up or horizontal and Dibusz might have got a hand to it; down he had no chance. Parrott had become the first Ireland player to score an international hat-trick outside Dublin.The celebrations were wild, and that was just to get into a playoff, which will take place at the end of March next year. For four months there will be hope and anticipation, just as there will be for DR Congo, who on Sunday beat a disappointing Nigeria on penalties in a playoff for Africa’s place in the intercontinental qualifying playoffs (which do not involve Europe).The quality had been limited in Rabat for that one as well, but who cares? That’s not what the international game is about. It’s about desire and effort and will. It’s about drama and narrative – the stories that countries will tell for eternity. The best football is almost never about the football, and that’s why the World Cup remains the purest form of the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amid a highly charged atmosphere in Belfast, Ireland drew 1-1 with Northern Ireland to secure their place at USA 94, aided by Spain beating Denmark 1-0 despite having their goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta sent off after 10 minutes, his young replacement Santiago Cañizares producing the performance of a lifetime. Paul Bodin hit the bar with a penalty as Wales missed out by drawing with Romania. England provided comic relief by going behind against San Marino after eight seconds.But the greatest drama happened in Paris. France would already have qualified but for a shock defeat to Israel, but everybody expected them to get the draw they needed at home to Bulgaria. With 15 seconds remaining they had an attacking free-kick on the right. David Ginola could have taken the ball into the corner but inexplicably crossed into a box almost empty of France players – a “crime”, as his manager, Gérard Houllier, described it. Bulgaria broke at speed, culminating in Emil Kostadinov lashing in a stunning finish that eliminated France. Kostadinov shouldn’t even have been in the country, having failed to secure a visa, but had been smuggled in at a remote border post near Mulhouse.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Then he faced the RamsThe Seahawks quarterback has looked like an MVP this season. But his old failings returned in Los Angeles on SundayDoug FarrarMon 17 Nov 2025 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 11.19 ESTShareThe biggest game of Week 11 was undoubtedly the matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and theSeattle Seahawks. Both teams came in with 7-2 records, and were seemingly evenly matched on both sides of the ball, with dynamic offenses and stingy defenses. In the end, it was a defensive battle that the Rams won, 21-19, by the skin of their teeth.Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who had playedat a near-MVP level this seasonfor the most part, did absolutely nothing to help his team – and plenty to hurt them. Darnold matched his career high with four interceptions, completing 29 of 44 passes for 279 yards, no touchdowns, those picks, and a passer rating of 45.5.The last time Darnold faced the Rams it was when he was with the Minnesota Vikings in last season’s playoffs, and he endured a 60-minute nightmare. In the Minnesota Vikings’27-9 loss, Darnold was sacked nine times, pressured an incomprehensible 25 times, and completed 25 of 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a passer rating of 77.6.On Sunday, it wasn’t necessarily pressure that doomed Darnold as much as it was the Rams dropping into coverage. The last time Darnold threw four picks in a game was in October 2019. In that game he was miked up, and probably wished he wasn’t – he utteredhis infamous quote about “seeing ghosts”. Darnold wasn’t sacked once in this game, but he might have been better off taking a few takedowns as opposed tothe ill-advised interceptions he threw.Los Angeles’ defense didn’t blitz a lot because it didn’t have to – instead, defensive coordinator Chris Shula had his guys dropping into coverage six and seven at a time, blurring Darnold’s reads, and forcing him to process at a level that is above his station.New York Jets player Kris Boyd in critical condition after being shot in abdomenRead moreSo, how were the Seahawks still in this one until the end? Seattle’s defense played marvelously for the most part, limiting potential MVP Matthew Stafford to 15 completions on 28 attempts for 130 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 89.9. But when you’re facing a team of this caliber, you can’t expect to turn the ball over that often and bump up your win total.That said,were it not for Ethan Evans’ 50-yard puntthat put the Seahawks behind their own one-yard line with 1:50 left, Darnold and the Seahawks might have won. The Seahawks got to the Los Angeles 49-yard line with seconds remaining, which left kicker Jason Myers with a 61-yard field goal attempt he couldn’t quite make.These two NFC West opponents face off again in Seattle on 18 December, and we expect that to garner similar “Game of the Year” hype. Because even at their worst, that’s how good these teams are, even without the intervention of the supernatural.View image in fullscreenMyles Garrett harried Lamar Jackson all day on Sunday.Photograph: David Richard/APMVP of the weekMyles Garrett, edge, Cleveland Browns.Yes, the Browns lost 23-16 to the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, primarily because Cleveland had Dillon Gabriel (until he suffered a concussion) and then Shedeur Sanders at quarterback. But if there’s one player who can end up as MVP on a losing side it’s Garrett, the best defensive player in football, the Browns would have been nowhere near a position to win. Garrett did what he usually does in this game – he shredded every blocking scheme, and made the quarterback’s life miserable. In this case, the quarterback was Lamar Jackson – not exactly an easy guy to bring down – who he sacked four times, adding one quarterback hit and three hurries in 27 pass-rushing snaps.Over his last three games, Garrett has a preposterous 10 sacks and 17 total pressures, which adds up to one of the greatest stretches for a pass-rusher in history. The only other two players to match his sack total in a three-game period areRichard Dent in 1984, and Derrick Thomas in 1997-1998. Dent and Thomas are in the Hall of Fame, and Garrett may as well start getting his gold jacket tailored.On Sunday, Garrett also became the only player inNFLannals with 12 or more sacks in six straight seasons since the sack became an official NFL statistic in 1982.Video of the weekWe’ll get into the vagaries of Minnesota Vikings quarterback JJ McCarthy’s overall game in a minute, but one of the two interceptions he threw in Minnesota’s 19-17 loss to the Chicago Bears had an emotional component to it. With 42 seconds left in the first half, McCarthy tried to connect with Jordan Addison in the end zone, but Chicago cornerback Nahshon Wright was having none of it.Fantastic high point by Nahshon Wright for the INT on JJ McCarthy!CHIvsMIN on FOX/FOX One+https://t.co/HkKw7uXnxVpic.twitter.com/K8427grMZE— NFL (@NFL)November 16, 2025Why was Wright so emotional after the interception? Because John Beam, his head coach at Laney College in 2018 before Wright transferred to Oregon State,was shot and killed last week. Clearly,Coach Beam left his mark in all the right ways.View image in fullscreenJosh Allen accounted for six touchdowns on Sunday.Photograph: Jeffrey T Barnes/APStat of the weekThree and three.The list of quarterbacks who have had three passing touchdowns and three rushing touchdowns in the same game is pretty short. In fact only two have done so in the entire history of the NFL. Otto Graham of the Cleveland Browns against the Detroit Lions inDecember 1954to win the NFL championship in a 56-10 rout, and Josh Allen of the Buffalo BIlls … who has now achieved the feat twice. Allen’s first came last season against the Los Angeles Rams in a 44-42 Bills loss. And he did so again on Sunday in Buffalo’s 44-32 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a victory that kept the 7-3 Bills within fighting distance of the 9-2 New England Patriots in the AFC East.At its most disorganized, the Bills’ offense relies too much on Allen, while everyone else waits around to do something … anything. But when you have a weapon like Allen, and you’re desperate to win, you tend to throw style points out the window. Allen’s performance was especially important because the Bills elected to make receiver Keon Coleman, the 33rd overall pick in the 2024 draft, a healthy scratch because he missed a team meeting this week. Coleman was supposed to be the missing piece in Buffalo’s offense as a big deep threat, but when he’s off missing other things, the Bills have to use the one weapon they know they can rely on. In Sunday’s game, Allen also tied Cam Newton for the most regular-season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in NFL history, with 75.Elsewhere around the league– Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell may be wondering about his offseason quarterback plans. The Vikings selected McCarthy with the 10th overall pick last year, and they’re still waiting to see on the field what they imagined in the pre-draft process.McCarthy’s college tapeoften brought a second- or third-round grade to mind, but as O’Connell is perhaps the NFL’s pre-eminent quarterback developer, most were inclined to give him – and McCarthy – the benefit of the doubt. McCarthy missed last season with a knee injury, which gave O’Connell the opportunity to resuscitate the careers of Darnold and Daniel Jones. The Vikings were going to be committed to McCarthy on a no-matter-what basis, leaving Darnold and Jones to find homes elsewhere, and the second-year player has done little to justify his team’s faith at this point. He engineered an amazing comeback against the Chicago Bears in Week 1 despite an unimpressive stat line, fell to earth against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2, then missed the next five games with a high ankle sprain.“I think adversity is one of the greatest things for individual growth, collective growth, whatever it is,”McCarthy said postgame. “I think it [can] really separate teams, or bring them tighter together. And I feel like this team’s being brought tighter and tighter together each and every week.”Unless you gave O’Connell some powerful truth serum, he’d never admit that he’d rather roll with Darnold (well, maybe not this Sunday’s Darnold) or Jones. But a certain level of buyer’s remorse would be appropriate.– The Green Bay Packers beat the New York Giants 27-20 to push their record to 6-3-1 on the season, which keeps them in the NFC North race, along with the Bears and Lions. But can this team be taken seriously as a Super Bowl contender? The variance in performance can be maddening. Green Bay came into this game having lost their last two, and Jordan Love was less than impressive in each of those contests. Love wasn’t much better in this win, completing 13 of 24 passes for 174 yards, but his two second-half touchdown passes made the difference against a Giants team resetting after the firing of head coach Brian Daboll, and starting Jameis Winston at quarterback in place of the injured Jaxson Dart.Had Winston not thrown a back-breaking interception in the end zone with 40 seconds left in the game, the Packers may have struggled to climb back against a team they should be able to beat handily. Something to remember when the postseason comes along: High variance doesn’t generally get things done.– It was a bad day for Cam Newton and records. Not only did Allen tie Newton’s rushing touchdown mark, but Bryce Young dusted Newton’s single-game Carolina Panthers record for passing yards – though Young needed overtime to do so. Newton had the mark with 432 yards in a 30-23 loss to the Packers back in 2011, and he threw three interceptions in that game. In Carolina’s 30-27 overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons, Young completed 31 of 45 passes for 448 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 123.2 – the best and most complete game the 2023 first overall pick has played so far in his NFL career. The Panthers (who won a total of five games in 2024) are now 6-5, and they have two upcoming games against NFC South rivals the Buccaneers, who lead the division at 6-4.– The Chiefs have been 6-4 twice in the Andy Reid/Patrick Mahomes era – in 2019 and 2021. In each of those cases, they recovered to win the Super Bowl. What they’ll do with this 5-5 mark after their 22-19 loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday remains to be seen. But this is the biggest hole any Chiefs team under current management has found itself in, and neither the 9-2 Broncos nor the 7-4 Los Angeles Chargers are going to disappear as postseason contenders.The Chiefs have a long historyof playing with their food until the games really count, but as Yogi Berra once said, it gets late early out there.– The Lions thought they were going to get the ball back and with it a final attempt to tie the game when they trailed 16-9 late in the fourth quarter against the Eagles on Sunday Night Football after Jalen Hurts failed to complete on third down. But the Lions were the subject ofa very dubious pass interference call, helping the Eagles to run out the clock. That call aside, the Eagles defense looks brilliant as the playoffs approach and Jared Goff was given very little time to set himself all night.– Finally, in an appealing bit of miscellany, Jacoby Brissett of the Arizona Cardinals set the NFL’s regular season record with 47 completions in the Cardinals’ 41-22 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Brissett passed the regular-season mark of 45, set by Drew Bledsoe of the New England Patriots in 1994, and Jared Goff of the Los Angeles Rams in 2019, andtied Ben Roethlisberger’s 47 completionsin the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 47-38 playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns in January 2021.Explore more on these topicsSeattle SeahawksNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just ready to enjoy the rest of the week and the rest of our lives,” the formerCleveland Brownsand University of Miami quarterback said in a brief video posted on social media following the surgery.Kosar told Cleveland Magazine last year that he had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson’s disease. He said he had been affected by liver-related issues for years but brushed them off because he wasn’t sure of the source. A diagnosis of cirrhosis in late 2023 confirmed the severity of his condition.The 61-year-old went on the transplant waiting list last July. He was scheduled to receive a liver transplant last weekend but said that it was delayed because the donor’s organ was infected. During the past week, he has undergone five procedures to stop internal bleeding.Kosar played in theNFLfor 12 seasons after leading the University of Miami to its first national championship during the 1983 season. He grew up in Youngstown, Ohio rooting for the Browns, who selected him in the 1985 NFL supplemental draft. He played for the Browns from 1985-93, leading the franchise to three AFC championship game appearances (1986, 1987 and 1989), losing each time to the Denver Broncos. Kosar is third all-time in franchise history with 21,904 passing yards.After being released by the Browns, Kosar joined the Dallas Cowboys for the remainder of the 1993 season and won a Super Bowl ring. He then played for the Miami Dolphins from 1994 to 1996.The Browns played a tribute video for Kosar before Sunday’s game against the Baltimore Ravens. Coach Kevin Stefanski said Monday that he texted with Kosar on Sunday night and wished him luck.“Yeah, I mean, Bernie’s my guy. I know that this town has such a special relationship with Bernie from his playing days and then the impact that he’s had on this community over the course of all these years,” Stefanski said. “I didn’t have that experience with Bernie prior to coming here, but since I’ve been here, he has just been such a supportive person of me, so kind to my family. I think he sees my family every game day and just is so good to them. So, he’s a special person. He’s a special Cleveland Brown, and we are all rooting for him and we are all right there with him right now.”Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Beating Dubois resulted in Usyk becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time, but he elected for his spell to be short-lived.The WBO later confirmed Wardley’s elevation to “full champion status”. Frank Warren, the 30-year-old’s promoter, wrote on X: “Britain has a new heavyweight world champion and a new star of the sport.“One of the most incredible stories I’ve seen in my 45 years as a promoter and I could not be prouder of Fabio Wardley. Some huge fights ahead for 2026 as he defends his WBO belt and creates a true legacy in the sport.”Wardley started his career in white-collar boxing before turning professional in 2017 and racking up 17 straight wins.

He stood and cheered after Green had been called for a shooting foul while guarding Pelicans forward Herb Jones.The other clásico: Barcelona and Real Madrid’s rivalry thrives on the basketball court tooRead moreWhile players began taking their positions for Jones’s foul shots, Green strode over to the fan and stood inches from him as they spoke to one another, with the fan holding his arms out on each side.Game officials quickly stepped between them and pulled the Warriors star away while ushers gathered around and spoke with the fan, who continued to look amused by the exchange.Sam Green said he was taunting Draymond Green with chants of “Angel Reese,” because, while the Warriors star had several rebounds, he hadn’t attempted any shots. Reese, a WNBA player, is known for her skills as a rebounder.Sam Green said the Warriors star swore at him and threatened to punch him if he continued the “Angel Reese” taunts.“I wasn’t using profanity and for him to walk 12ft off the court to come and get in my face like that, it was a little unnerving,” said Sam Green, who was given a warning by ushers but was allowed to remain in his front-row seat.Draymond Green commented spoke about the interaction in his postgame comments, saying the fan had called him “a woman’s name.” He added: “It was a good joke at first, but you can’t keep calling me a woman. I got four kids, one on the way. You can’t keep calling me a woman … He was talking at first. Then you get a little closer and he didn’t really say much else. But it’s fine. We move on.”Draymond Green, who has been known to draw technical fouls, fines and ejections for his fiery on-court persona, has been fined for fan interaction in the past. In 2022, he was fined $25,000 for what the NBA described as “directing obscene language toward a fan.”Greenhas been critical of crowd behavior, saying fans face relatively few consequences for taunting players, and are sometimes motivated to do so by the fact that players can be fined for engaging with them.“As long as it doesn’t escalate, it’s fine [for a player] to go over and have a discussion,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Sunday’s interaction. “It would have been nice if security had gotten there a little bit earlier.”Explore more on these topicsGolden State WarriorsNBABasketballUS sportsNew Orleans PelicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Is it in the stars?Ewan MurrayMon 17 Nov 2025 15.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 16.08 ESTShareWounding events in modern history mean Scotland can not be a football country that expects. It is, however, one on tenterhooks as the prospect of long‑awaitedWorld Cupqualification looms so large.On paper, the task is simple: beatDenmarkat Hampden Park on Tuesday and the Scots will take a place in next summer’s tournament. It is the significance of progress that matters far more than the fact the Danes are ranked 18 places higher in the world.Ireland’s big moment is what World Cup qualifying is all aboutRead moreScotland have not played in the World Cup since 1998. You must go back to 1989 for the last time they qualified for anything in front of a Hampden audience. This ranks as a game for the ages. Potentially.The testimony of Andy Robertson is fascinating in this context. The Liverpool full-back and Scotland captain knows a thing or two about marquee achievement. He has 89 caps. What would leading his country to a World Cup mean? “I don’t like thinking about it and that’s the honest answer,” he said. “I’m excited and looking forward to a one-game shootout for the World Cup. If it happens, I’ll tell you how I feel about it.”There is a danger Scotland could get swallowed up by a wave of emotion. Denmark, serial tournament participants, will surely be poised to take advantage in that circumstance.“The players have got a job to do,” said Scotland’s manager, Steve Clarke. “If they are not nervous or excited by the challenge ahead then they wouldn’t be at this level. They understand the magnitude of the game and what it means, but they just have to prepare for a game of football and make sure they are focused on how we want to play it. They have to be focused on what Denmark might do. That’s our job as a coaching staff, to give them an idea.“When they cross the white line, they have to go out and play. And if they go out and play like they can play, then I believe they are good enough to get the result we need.”There is a rising sense that fate has decided Scotland must win Group C. They have been – depending on your outlook – unconvincing or lucky in chunks of this campaign.Scotland scraped past Belaruslast month. Yet here they are, 90 minutes from glory.View image in fullscreenScotland’s head coach, Steve Clarke, says the players ‘understand the magnitude of the game’.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThe scenario owes everything to Denmark’s failure to beat Belarus on Saturday. Had Denmark prevailed in Copenhagen,Scotland’s defeat in Greecewould have consigned them to a playoff berth.“It is dangerous territory, I don’t believe in that,” Robertson said in respect of what might be written in the stars. “While not defending our performance what Saturday did show was that Belarus are a very good team.“We probably got the toughest pot-four team in the whole qualifiers. Belarus were no mugs, they were an extremely difficult team to play against and they showed that at Hampden and again away to the pot-one team.“There was huge frustration after that game in terms of the reaction from you guys, from the fans, from ourselves. Points are points and we managed to get three on the board. A lot has been said in this campaign, some negativity at times and maybe some justified, but we are sitting here with 10 points. We are one point behind first place and we know we are 90 minutes away from the World Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I said that because I felt we could achieve good things. We have managed to do that and now we have another very, very good thing we can achieve together.”Despite the 3-2 defeat, Scotland’s attacking play in Athens was excellent in spells. Scott McTominay’s influential second half provides particular hope.Denmark arrived in Glasgow minus only the San Diego forward Anders Dreyer afterthe sickness bugthat disrupted their start to this international window. Rasmus Højlund, who was forced to sit out the Belarus tie, has returned to rude health and is expected to play. The visiting head coach, Brian Riemer, denied despondency from the 2-2 draw with Belarus may linger.“What happened in the first game, what happened in the second game and fifth game is completely irrelevant at this stage,” he said. “To sit in the changing room, not having secured the ticket for the World Cup because we were having a hangover from a Belarus game … I don’t think that’s possible with top professional footballers. I don’t think you see any teams go through a season, whether it’s club football or international football, without bumps.”Scotland have endured almost 30 years of them.Explore more on these topicsScotlandDenmarkWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the Real Madrid right‑back looks a long shot to win back his place before the finals tournament next summer. Alexander‑Arnold is in Tuchel’s thoughts but he has not been called up since June, played little part inEngland’s perfect qualifying campaignand saw a new competitor in his position emerge when Bayer Leverkusen’s Jarell Quansah made his debut inthe 2-0 win against Albania in Tiranaon Sunday.Bellingham must cut the nonsense if he wants to take centre stage under Tuchel | Jacob SteinbergRead more“It’s my job now to make contact with everyone, players like Trent,” Tuchel said. “Players that are on our longlist, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve. Can they even do something or is it just a choice? So this is my job in the next weeks and months.“I have a lot of trust in Jarell. I see his talent but I see the package. He is tall, he is fast, he is strong in buildup, he is strong in the air. I saw him very strong playing for Liverpool in this position. I always wanted to try. And he plays every minute for Leverkusen since the under-21 Euros. He is at the moment a tiny bit ahead.”Tuchel named a squad of 25 for the qualifiers this month against Albania and Serbia, meaning he has to speak to at least 30 players who failed to make the cut. The German anticipates a lot of discussions before England’s next camp in March, when they will ramp up World Cup preparations with two friendlies, possibly against Japan and Uruguay.“I hate phone calls,” Tuchel said. “Better on FaceTime. Then I see the expression, at least, and get a feeling for the person. Or I need to visit them, visit training, training grounds.”Asked whether he would go to Madrid to see Alexander-Arnold, Tuchel replied: “Why would I not?” Told that it will be difficult to visit everyone, he pointed out that travelling to Spain to see Alexander-Arnold would also allow himto meet Jude Bellingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lisa Benn, 34, claims she was harassed and unfairly lost her position as an international referee after raising a complaint.The Women’s Super League official had complained that she was manhandled on a pitch in 2023 by Steve Child, a Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) coach and former Premier League assistant referee.Rushden & Diamonds’ match abandoned after alleged sexist abuse towards refereeRead moreGiving evidence to a south London employment tribunal on Monday, she alleged Child also told her “your card has been marked”. A PGMO investigation found Child’s behaviour did not meet the threshold for disciplinary action.Benn alleges that the organisation’s chief refereeing officer, Howard Webb, and his wife, Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, who was then its head of women’s referees, said she would not be punished for coming forward. However, she wrote in her witness statement that, after her complaint, PGMO did not recommend her as highly as they had previously done. Benn claimed that this cost her a prestigious place on Fifa’s international referee list.A PGMO-organised tournament took place to train staff on VAR, which was not yet used in the women’s game, on 29 March 2023. The schedule was delayed by a serious injury and Benn said that Child adopted a leadership role but “was flustered, he was stressed, he was charging around all over the place”.Benn alleges that the coach grabbed her arm and “forcefully pushed” her on to the pitch. She accepted that Child said “something along the lines of ‘come on let’s go’” to speed up the start of the game, and said she responded by putting her palm up and telling him to “chill”.Jesse Crozier, for PGMO, put to her: “In saying ‘come on let’s go’, he would have put his arm behind you and ushered you on to the pitch at the same time.”Benn rejected the claim, saying: “That is definitely not what happened.”The “temperature was high” during the match and Child instructed a fourth official, Ruby Sykes, to tell Benn to “kill the game”, the tribunal heard. This prompted Benn to say “don’t tell me how to referee” and “fuck off”, which was directed at Child but spoken through a communications system to Sykes, the panel was told.Benn said: “I’ve never had somebody shout down the comms to tell me how to referee – I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level, this was an under-19s game.”She said: “He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play – he would never have done that to a male referee.”Crozier put to her: “You appear to take umbrage at the refereeing coach giving you coaching directions while you were refereeing.”Benn said: “It was a distraction because, as you mentioned, the game was difficult, the game was challenging – there was a lot going on in the game that required my attention.”Benn said she was also adjusting to “new VAR principles” that were unfamiliar to her. She became emotional as she later told the panel: “He made me feel inferior, as a referee and as a human being, and that’s not OK.”Asked if she had seen him act in that way to other referees, she said: “I have to female referees, yes. I haven’t to male referees.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The official said there was a “mass brawl” at the end of the game triggered by one player head-butting another.She said Child then grabbed her arm and told her “your card has been marked” and “you’re bloody-minded”. She added: “He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head.”Benn accepted that in response she “shouted ‘what is your problem?’ in his direction. “He didn’t turn around, he just walked off,” she said.Crozier put to her: “If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it.”She said there would have been video recordings of the event but she has not seen any. The barrister said that such an incident “would have been noticed, would it not?” She said: “No, I disagree.”The tribunal continues.Explore more on these topicsRefereesWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Super Eagles will not be returning to North American soil for next summer’s tournament – and they are not blaming their shooting boots.After a fraught and dramatic continental playoff final on Sunday, where Nigeriawere eliminated by DR Congoon penalties, the Super Eagles manager, Éric Chelle, said that his team had been defeated by “voodoo”.World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?Read moreThe claim came in the aftermath of a tense match in Rabat where DR Congo edged out the favourites 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time. The result means Nigeria, one of the continent’s heavyweights, will miss consecutive World Cups for the first time since 1990.After Chancel Mbemba’s decisive spot-kick, Chelle was seen confronting the opposing coaching staff on the touchline, including the DR Congo manager, Sébastien Desabre, and had to be held back by his own coaching team.Despite Desabre saying the altercation was “not an issue” in his post-match press conference, Chelle asked reporters why they had not brought up the incident to him. He then accused DR Congo of “doingmaraboutage” – a term used colloquially to describe acts of magic or bewitchment.He then continued his accusations in the mixed zone. “During the penalty shootout, the guy [from] Congo did some voodoo. Every time, every time, every time. So this is why I was a little nervous after [he did that].”Chelle, who has managed Nigeria since January, went on to mimic the gestures he says he saw, saying someone of the DR Congo coaching staff was waving their hand as if shaking or sprinkling a liquid.The Nigeria captain, William Troost-Ekong, did not echo his manager’s statements, but said: “We are devastated. I am proud of the boys, they gave everything, not just today, but over the past 10 months. There are plenty of positives to take away. The future of this team is promising … but today is a very difficult day.”View image in fullscreenÉric Chelle, the Nigeria manager, cried foul after the Super Eagles’ exit.Photograph: Jalal Morchidi/EPAThe loss ends a disjointed two-year qualifying campaign for the Super Eagles, which left them to sneak into the continental playoffs on goal difference. The match offered high drama from the outset. Nigeria, 19 places above their opponents in the Fifa rankings, took an early lead when Frank Onyeka’s deflected shot found the net in the third minute. But the Super Eagles’ advantage was soon cancelled out by Meschak Elia, who punished a mistake by Wilfred Ndidi to level the scores.Nigeria’s attack appeared to falter after their striker Victor Osimhen was substituted at half-time owing to a recurring hamstring problem. DR Congo grew in confidence, dominating possession and pressing hard, with Fiston Mayele having two efforts disallowed for fouls in a frantic period of extra time. Stanley Nwabali, the Nigeria goalkeeper, made a crucial clawing save to deny Mbemba’s looping header right before the final whistle in extra time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Super Eagles were handed a lifeline when Nwabali saved Axel Tuanzebe’s penalty and further successes from Bruno Onyemaechi and Chidera Ejuke brought them back into the contest.However, after Michel-Ange Balikwisha scored to send the shootout to sudden death, the Nigeria defender Semi Ajayi saw his shot saved by DR Congo’s substitute goalkeeper Timothy Fayulu, who had been brought on specifically for penalties. Mbemba then stepped up to guide his effort high into the net, sending his side through to the inter-confederation playoffs.View image in fullscreenChancel Mbemba wheels away with arms outstretched after netting the winning penalty.Photograph: Abdelmjid Rizkou/Reuters“It’s difficult to start a match down 1-0 [early],” said Desabre after his side’s win. “But the team spirit remained high and we chose to try and control the game. Nigeria also deserves to be congratulated. The match was very close. We could have not qualified but, overall, I think we deserved the victory.”DR Congo, who have only played in the World Cup once before – in 1974 when the country was called Zaire – ran the length of the pitch to celebrate a win that keeps their distant dream alive. They join Bolivia, New Caledonia, either Iraq or the United Arab Emirates and two teams from Concacaf – who finish qualifiers on Tuesday – for the inter-confederation playoffs, which will take place in Mexico in March. The draw for the six-team tournament will be held on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersNigeria football teamDemocratic Republic of the Congo football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In surveys 70% of participants including players, referees and spectators told the governing body that poor behaviour had a major impact.Rushden & Diamonds’ match abandoned after alleged sexist abuse towards refereeRead moreIn thelatest available figures, from the 2023-24 season, there was a 17% increase in charges relating to discrimination and a 13% increase in charges for allegations of serious misconduct in grassroots men’s and women’s football.The FA is funding support from Sporting Chance, the charity set up by the former England and Arsenal defender Tony Adams, for victims of the abuse. Those who access the service will be offered up to six counselling sessions – with additional support available in exceptional circumstances – with a therapist in person or online. They are also taught self-care methods.The FA is attempting to crack down on bad behaviour, including handing out tougher sanctions for offences and encouraging participants to report incidents.It is thought the reported incidents do not paint a full picture of the level of discrimination. Many incidents go unreported, with 70% of grassroots participants telling the FA they are not convinced reporting an incident will lead to a charge. The governing body says 63% of reports result in charges.The FA has started issuing stronger punishments for offenders. During the 2023-24 season, when 71% of charges were proven, the average ban for discriminatory offences was seven games. A record 5,500 match bans were issued and offenders were sent on 1,300 hours of educational courses.TheFA’s behaviour improvement programmehas been continued this season after a successful rollout last season.

The Catalan club announced they have been granted a licence to occupy 45,401 seats of the renovated stadium, which is yet to be completed, against Athletic Club on Saturday afternoon.The announcement comes after a series of missed targets and 10 days after a successful, smaller-scale test run in which a training session held there was attended by more than 20,000 supporters. The stadium will carry the name Spotify after a €280m title rights deal was agreed in March 2022.Barcelona were granted an occupation licence for phase 1B of the construction of the new Camp Nou on Monday, allowing them to open the main stand and south end against Athletic, a year later than scheduled.A request has been made to Uefa to allow them to change their designated home ground from the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium at Montjuïc, where they have played for the past two seasons, to the new stadium for the rest of their Champions League campaign. They hope to be able to play at the Camp Nou against Eintracht Frankfurt on 9 December.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A licence to occupy the first phase, 1A, of the under-construction stadium had been granted in mid-October but that allowed Barcelona to use only 27,000 seats so they decided to continue to play at Montjuïc, which has a capacity of more than 55,000. They also played two games this season at the 6,000‑seat Johan Cruyff Stadium at the training ground owing to clashes with events at Montjuïc. The next phase of occupation would include the north stand, taking them over 60,000, with the final capacity reaching 105,000.Barcelona’s last game at the Camp Nou was against Mallorca two and a half years ago. They were managed at the time by Xavi Hernández, and that was the last appearance for the club of Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.Barcelona had hoped to begin this season at the new stadium and had been granted permission to play their first three fixtures away from home to complete the first phase of construction work and apply for the requisite licences. That was followed by the international break, allowing them extra margin. But with five days remaining before that game, they announced they would be facing Valencia at the Johan Cruyff. A Post Malone concert had prevented them from using Montjuïc and they also played Getafe at the Johan Cruyff, although they were subsequently able to return to the Olympic stadium.Work started on the stadium immediately after they faced Mallorca in May 2023, carried out by the Turkish company Limark, which promised a quicker construction than other bids. The initial plan had been to play at the new stadium in front of 62,000 fans on the club’s 125th anniversary late last year. “If there is not a pandemic or a worldwide catastrophe, we will open the Camp Nou on 29 November 2024,” said the vice-president, Elena Fort. Joan Laporta, the president, said that they would reopen with 70% capacity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lawrence played a major role in thewin against the All Blackson Satur­day, but limped off in the ­closing stages and could be forced to sit out the game at Twickenham. The 26-year-old centre will be assessed when England reconvene on Tuesday after an extra day off.England may also be without ­Freddie Steward, who was withdrawn midway through the first half against New Zealand with a head injury, as they prepare for 11th ­successive win and a clean sweep of their autumn fixtures.England to launch first Nations Championship campaign with visit to South AfricaRead moreLawrence was in fine form against the All Blacks, scoring England’s opening try before teeing up his ­centre partner, Fraser Dingwall, in the second half. He was seen ­hobbling in the closing stages and was replaced by ­Chandler ­Cunningham-South in the 79th minute with flanker Henry Pollock shifting to the backline.Lawrence missed the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia last ­summer with a long-term achilles injury but battled back to action ahead of schedule. While he was omitted from theside that defeated Australiaat the start of the month, he has impressed against Fiji and New Zealand.Against the Wallabies, Tommy Freeman, a winger by trade, started at outside-centre having explained at the start of the season that he sees his long-term position in midfield. He is out with a hamstring injury, however, and is not available to face Argentina.Elliot Daly is fit again and would come into contention for the No 13 jersey if Lawrence is unavailable to face the Pumas, who showed their class withthe win against Scotlandon Sunday, but he does not offer the same ball-carrying threat. Daly could also come in at full-back if Steward is ruled out while Max Ojomoh would be another centre option. Steve Borthwick could even roll the dice and start Ben Earl or Pollock in the backline.There is no doubting, however, that Borthwick, who is also without Ollie Chessum (foot injury) will be hoping Lawrence recovers in time. All the more so because his partnership with Dingwall blossomed against the All Blacks and gave rise to optimism he has finally unearthed a centre combination to take England into the next World Cup.Quick GuideScotland's Darge reveals 'quiet changing room' after slump against PumasShowRory Darge admitted he is perplexed at how Scotland allowed themselves to unravel so spectacularly inSunday’s dire defeat by Argentina.Scotland looked to be cruising to victory as they led 21-0 midway through the third quarter, but the Pumas hit back with five tries in the closing 24 minutes to claim a remarkable 33-24 win.The nature of the capitulation – met with booing from sections of the capacity Murrayfield crowd – has brought fresh focus on the position of the long-serving head coach, Gregor Townsend.“It was a quiet changing room afterwards,” said the vice-captain Darge. “21-0 up and it felt that way, we felt like we were on top. It was a massive momentum swing and we struggled to stem the flow. The guys on the pitch are the ones that have to do better. “Asked how a match could turn so dramatically, Darge said: “It’s not good enough. Watching it back, I’m sure there will be loads in there from 21-0 onwards that we can do so much better.”Darge felt Scotland picked up where they left off in the second half of their spirited 25-17 defeat by New Zealand the previous week as they bossed the Pumas for the first 50 minutes. However, the Glasgow back row acknowledged his side became flustered when the visitors started finding their way back into the game and admits that they need to remain far more clear-headed when faced with adversity.“We’re constantly looking at ways to get better and I think we had a massive carry-over from last week in what worked for us,” said Darge. “21-0 up, putting them under stress and on top from an attack point of view, from a defence point of view, set piece. Obviously, what we need to look at is how we keep our composure in that last 30 minutes when we’re so far ahead.“Maybe a bit of an understanding of what Test match rugby is like from us in those moments. You have to be ruthless, particularly against a team as good as Argentina. If you’re not, they can score tries. We just weren’t good enough in that last half hour.\"Attention now turns to their Autumn Nations Series game against Tonga on Sunday. “We need to watch the game back and let it hurt over the next wee while and during the reviews and then quickly the mindset will flip on to Tonga,” Darge said.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Dingwall, who produced his best performance in an England jersey, was full of praise for his midfield partner. “I just feel lucky I’m able to play alongside someone as talented as that,” he said. “He can do some unbelievable things, he can open a little bit of space for me as well which we saw. Centre partnerships always take a little bit of time to develop and you work out how you can complement each other.“Fortunately we’ve known each other for a long time, we played some age group stuff together. To build, this has been the first time we’ve had a bit of run together which has been nice. He’s a bit bigger than me and can do some of the power work and hopefully I can do some of the bits to put him in space as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Pumas won the last encounter between the two sides at Twickenham,30-29 in 2022,but a callow side claimedan impressive 2-0 series victory in Argentinathis summer. England have managed to win four consecutive November Tests on one occasion – Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016 – but can repeat the trick with victory on Sunday.“It’s incredibly important,” said Dingwall. “We don’t want to be a team that peaks and has one brilliant performance or has a massive spike. If you want to truly be the team that we want to be, you’ve got to do it every single week. So I’ve got no questions about how the group is going to turn up with the same attitude to get better.“Review the game honestly, take the learnings, take the positives but once again it’s about attacking another week.

I think it just gives kids a real pathway that they can see that there’s two guys playing, then hopefully they want to take that step into playing cricket because it isn’t as big in the Indigenous communities as AFL and rugby league.

Brendan’s coming in, he’s 31 years old, he’s played a lot of first-class cricket now, he knows his game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A green-tinged pitch was being watered out in the middle as temperatures hit 33C inside the ground.Ashes 2025-26: player-by-player guide to England and Australia squadsRead moreBoland, scourge of England on their previous tour here four years ago, was already the seamer chosen to replace Cummins in the Australian XI, with a further hamstring injury to Josh Hazlewood likely to result in South Australia’s Brendan Doggett being handed a debut this week.Asked about the tourist he was targeting, the soft-spoken Boland plumped for the obvious answer. “Hopefully we can keep Joe Root and the guys in the middle-order pretty quiet,” the 36-year-old bowler said.“You always want to take down the best players. In the past when Joe Root has been captain you want to try to make sure he has as little impact as you can.”Boland burst through in 2021-22, taking 18 wickets at just nine runs apiece – including a remarkablesix for seven on debutat the MCG – in a 4-0 hammering. The 2023 series in England was a different story, however, Boland taking two wickets at 115 across two outings as a far more aggressive England side took him on.“I learned a lot,” Boland said. “I’ve reflected on that tour a fair bit. There will be tweaks to my gameplan for what I want to do, but I don’t think I need to change too much. I just need to execute a bit better.”View image in fullscreenPat Cummins bowls in the nets during an Australia nets session at Perth Stadium.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesCummins was later seen charging in at Australia’s net session for almost an hour, approaching full speed, after a “hotspot” in his lower back – the early signs of a stress fracture – was detected shortly after the tour of West Indies in July.A return in the day-night second Test in Brisbane that starts on 4 December is the 32-year-old’s current target, with Steve Smith stepping up as captain for the opening match in Perth this week.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamJoe RootThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South Americaafter a storm delayed them.MoroccoThe undisputed neutrals’ favourites at the last finals became the first African nation to reach the 2026 showpiece with a 5-0 thumping of Niger on 5 September in Rabat. The Qatar 2022 semi-finalists qualified from Group E with two games to spare after Tanzania’s 1-1 draw in Congo-Brazzaville. The Atlas Lions have reached the finals six times and willco-host the 2030 editionalongside Portugal and Spain (the three opening matches will be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay).TunisiaLikewise, the Carthage Eagles qualified with two games to spare in Group H. Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.AlgeriaVladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia in October. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another. Victory put them four points clear of second-placed Uganda in Group G with one round of matches remaining.

Benin, who had a two-point lead going into the final round of games, fell from top to third after losing 4-0 to Nigeria, with Victor Osimhen’s hat-trick ensuring the Super Eagles secured second spot to advance to the playoff round in November. It is the first time South Africa have qualified for the finals since hosting the tournament in 2010.SenegalThe Lions of Teranga cruised to a 4-0 victory over neighbours Mauritania in October to finish top of their qualifying Group B.

Connor Metcalfe’s first goal for his country just before half-time restored parity, before Mitch Duke’s header from Martin Boyle’s free-kick three minutes into the second half completed the Socceroos’ revival.

Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0.

The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal.QatarQatar beat the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in the fourth round of Asian qualifying to seal a spot at next year’s finals. It will be a second straight appearance at the finals for Qatar, who hosted the last edition in 2022.Saudi ArabiaThehosts of the 2034 tournamentclaimed a 0-0 draw with Iraq in Jeddah to seal qualification.

The reigning Nations League champions were forced to wait to book an automatic spot after losing 2-0 to Ireland on Thursday in a game where their captain Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off. But Roberto Martínez’s side needed no help from their all-time top scorer in a one-sided match that assured them top spot in Group F with 13 points, giving Ronaldo the opportunity to play at a record sixth World Cup.NorwayErling Haaland’s incredible haul of 16 goals from eight qualifying matches has propelled his country to their first World Cup since 1998. “Haaland is a goal machine,” said Norway manager Ståle Solbakken after his second-half double in the4-1 win away in Italywhich cemented top spot in Group I. “I’m happy that Italian fans applauded him too. This is an audience who saw great players playing here over the years and I’m happy that they appreciated Haaland’s performance too.” Now crowds in the US, Mexico and Canada will get to appreciate the phenomenon next summer.GermanyJulian Nagelsmann’s team lost their first qualifier –2-0 at Slovakiain September – but responded with five straight wins in Group A, culminating in a 6-0 rout of the Slovakians in Leipzig.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

The fight will be shown live on Netflix.“This isn’t an AI simulation. This is Judgment Day,” said Paul. “A professional heavyweight fight against an elite world champion in his prime. When I beat Anthony Joshua, every doubt disappears, and no one can deny me the opportunity to fight for a world title. To all my haters, this is what you wanted. To the people of the United Kingdom, I am sorry. On Friday 19 December, under the lights in Miami, live globally only onNetflix, the torch gets passed and Britain’s Goliath gets put to sleep.”Joshua, the 36-year-old former two-time unified heavyweight champion, has not fought sincebeing stopped by Daniel Duboisin September 2024.“Jake or anyone can get this work. No mercy,” said Joshua, who won gold at the 2012 Olympics. “I took some time out and I’m coming back with a mega show. It’s a big opportunity for me. Whether you like it or not, I’m here to do massive numbers, have big fights and break every record whilst keeping cool, calm and collected. Mark my words, you’ll see a lot more fighters take these opportunities in the future. I’m about to break the internet over Jake Paul’s face.”View image in fullscreenJake Paul said he aims to beat Anthony Joshua and then challenge for a world title.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAPaul had originally been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis on 14 November in Miami, but the event was cancelled after Davis was removed from the cardamid domestic violence allegations.Netflix’s first boxing show –Paul’s bout with Mike Tyson– became the most-streamed sporting event in history, peaking at 65m live concurrent streams and drawing an estimated 108m average live viewers worldwide. The broadcast accounted for 56% of all US television viewing during the fight’s main event hour and was the platform’s No 1 title that week across 78 countries. Paul and Joshua are set to make tens of millions from December’s fight.Joshua will be the heaviest fighter Paul has faced so far in his boxing career. Although Tyson is also a former heavyweight champion, Joshua is 23 years younger and still close to his prime.“They say be careful what you wish for, kind of feel like that’s all I need to say,” Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn said. “Two of the biggest names in the sport will collide on 19 December. Whilst I admire Jake’s balls, he’s going to find out the hard way in Miami.”Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingNetflixUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He achieved the feat as he led theBuffalo Bills(7-3) to victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4). Allen’s last TD was a rugged nine-yard run with 2:35 left that put the game away. The Bills benched struggling receiver Keon Coleman in a bid to spark their passing game, and each of Allen’s three touchdown passes went for 25 yards or more. He finished 19 of 30 for 317 yards, and the Bills overcame his two first-half interceptions. The game featured nine lead changes.Kansas City Chiefs 19-22 Denver BroncosThe Denver Broncos extended their winning streak to eight games with a narrow win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Wil Lutz kicked a 35-yard field goal as time expired for Denver. It was his fifth field goal of the game. The Broncos improved to 9-2 and all but buried the Chiefs in the AFC West, which Kansas City have won ever year since 2016. Kansas City are now 5-5. Bo Nix set up the game-winning kick with a 32-yard pass to Troy Franklin that got Denver to the Kansas City 15 with under a minute remaining.San Francisco 49ers 41–22 Arizona CardinalsBrock Purdy threw three touchdown passes in his return from a toe injury, Christian McCaffrey had two rushing touchdowns and a receiving score, and the San Francisco 49ers (7-4) beat the sloppy Arizona Cardinals (3-7). McCaffrey extended hisNFLrecord with his 17th career game with at least one running touchdown and a touchdown catch. Purdy completed 19 of 26 passes for 200 yards. Tight end George Kittle caught two touchdown passes. Arizona lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Cardinals were called for a franchise record 17 penalties, which was also the most for any team in the NFL this season. However, Arizona quarterback Jacoby Brissett broke the record for most completions in a single game with 47 as he threw for 452 yards two touchdowns and two interceptions.Seattle Seahawks 19–21 Los Angeles RamsKamren Kinchens had two of the Rams’ four interceptions, Matthew Stafford threw two touchdown passes and Los Angeles (8-2) hung on to beat the Seattle Seahawks (7-3) for their fifth consecutive victory. Jason Myers was short on a 61-yard field goal attempt as time expired, allowing the Rams to survive the Seahawks’ furious late rally. Davante Adams had his 10th touchdown catch of the season and Kyren Williams rushed for 91 yards and a score for the Rams, who made up for an inconsistent offensive performance by forcing Sam Darnold into his first four-interception game since 2019. Darnold still nearly stole a win.Detroit Lions 9-16 Philadelphia EaglesA brilliant performance from the Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) defense saw them beat the Detroit Lions (6-4) on Sunday Night Football. Jordan Davis batted down three passes from Lions quarterback Jared Goff while Jaelan Phillips, who arrived in a trade with the Dolphins earlier this month, was excellent as he pressured Goff all night. The Lions managed to stop the Eagles’ tush-push and thought they were going to get the ball back in the final two minutes but were the subject ofa controversial pass interference callwhich allowed Philadelphia to run the clock down.Baltimore Ravens 23-16 Cleveland BrownsMark Andrews led the Baltimore Ravens (5-5) to victory over the Cleveland Browns (2-8) with a 35-yard touchdown run, spoiling Shedeur Sanders’ NFL debut. Andrews’ touchdown came with 2:31 remaining on Sunday. Baltimore extended their winning streak to four games. The veteran tight end also became the Ravens’ career leader in receiving yards. Sanders entered the game in the third quarter after Dillon Gabriel suffered a concussion. Sanders completed 4 of 16 passes for 47 yards. Myles Garrett sacked Lamar Jackson four times, making history with five straight seasons of at least 13 sacks. The Browns scored their only touchdown on a pick-six by Devin Bush.Chicago Bears 19–17 Minnesota VikingsDevin Duvernay’s 56-yard kickoff return in the final minute for Chicago set up Cairo Santos for his fourth field goal of the game, a 48-yarder as time expired, to push the Bears past Minnesota after the Vikings scored the go-ahead touchdown with 50 seconds left. After JJ McCarthy ended another erratic performance with five straight completions culminating in a 15-yard scoring strike to Jordan Addison, Duvernay delivered. The Bears improved to 7-3 under new coach Ben Johnson after blowing a 13-point lead they took into the fourth quarter. The Vikings fell to 4-6 after two more interceptions by McCarthy.Green Bay Packers 27–20 New York GiantsJordan Love returned from a shoulder injury to throw two touchdown passes, backup Malik Willis had one of his own while filling in and the Green Bay Packers (6-3-1) ended their losing streak at two by defeating the New York Giants. Love provided some heroics on the go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter, connecting with rookie Savion Williams on a 32-yard gain under pressure on third-and-10 and finding Christian Watson in the end zone with 4:02 left to take the lead. Josh Jacobs left with a knee injury. The Giants lost their fifth in a row to fall to 2-9.Carolina Panthers 30-27 Atlanta Falcons (OT)Bryce Young passed for a career-high and franchise-record 448 yards and Ryan Fitzgerald kicked a 28-yard field goal in overtime to lift the Carolina Panthers to victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Young’s 54-yard pass to Tommy Tremble set up the winning kick for Carolina (6-5), who completed a sweep of NFC South-rival Atlanta. The Falcons suffered their fifth straight loss, including back-to-back overtime defeats. Young completed 31 of 45 passes with three touchdowns. Zane Gonzalez kicked a 45-yard field goal for Atlanta (3-7) with 16 seconds remaining to force overtime.Cincinnati Bengals 12–34 Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers used two defensive touchdowns to race by the Cincinnati Bengals but lost quarterback Aaron Rodgers to a hand injury. The 41-year-old appeared to injure his left hand late in the first half and did not return. Backup Mason Rudolph put together a pair of long scoring drives in Rodgers’ absence. Rudolph threw for 127 yards and a five-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Gainwell with less than four minutes to go to seal it. Pittsburgh improved to 6-4 and remained in first place in the AFC North with the victory. The Bengals dropped to 3-7.Los Angeles Chargers 6–35 Jacksonville JaguarsThe Jacksonville Jaguars bounced back from the worst collapse in franchise history by thumping the Los Angeles Chargers 35-6 behind rushing touchdowns from Travis Etienne, Trevor Lawrence and rookie Bhaysul Tuten. Coming off a 36-29 debacle at Houston in which they blew a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter, the Jaguars (6-4) showed no lingering effects from the crushing setback against a division rival. It may have helped that they faced the Chargers (7-4), who traveled across the country for an early start. Coach Jim Harbaugh’s team was a complete no-show, finishing with 135 yards and just eight first downs.Washington Commanders 13–16 Miami Dolphins (OT)Jack Jones intercepted Marcus Mariota on the first offensive play of overtime and Riley Patterson kicked a 29-yard field goal to give the Miami Dolphins (4-7) a 16-13 win over the Washington Commanders (3-8) in the first NFL regular-season game in Spain. The Commanders had a chance to win at Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu Stadium with 15 seconds left in regulation, but Matt Gay’s 56-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right. It was the seventh and final international game of the season, the most ever in one year for the NFL as it continues to expand globally.Houston Texans 16–13 Tennessee TitansThe Houston Texans (5-5) have swept the season series with the Tennessee Titans (1-9). Davis Mills threw for 274 yards and a touchdown and Matthew Wright kicked a 35-yard field goal as time expired to secure the win. Led by their backup quarterback, the Texans reached .500 for the first time this season with their third win in four games. They also won their fifth straight over the Titans in Nashville despite playing without quarterback CJ Stroud, safety Jalen Pitre and kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn. The Titans tied the game with 1:35 left, leaving plenty of time for Mills and the Texans.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And my worry is that it will be broad and it’ll be faster than what we’ve seen with previous technology,” Amodei said.Amodei said he used the phrase “the compressed 21st century” to describe how AI could achieve scientific breakthroughs in much quicker time than in previous decades.“Could we get 10 times the rate of progress and therefore compress all the medical progress that was going to happen throughout the entire 21st century into five or 10 years?” he asked.Amodei is a prominent voice for online safety, and Anthropic has flagged various concerns about its AI models recently, including anapparent awareness that they are being testedand attempting to commit blackmail.It said last week that a group sponsored by the Chinese state hadused its tool Claude Codeto attack 30 entitiesaround the world in September, achieving a “handful of successful intrusions”.The company said that one of the most concerning aspects of the attack was that Claude had operated largely independently throughout the incident. Between 80% and 90% of the operations involved were performed without a human in the loop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the more autonomy we give these systems, you know, the more we can worry are they doing exactly the things that we want them to do?”Logan Graham, the head of Anthropic’s team for stress testing AI models, told CBS that the flipside of a model’s ability to find health breakthroughs could be helping to build a biological weapon.“If the model can help make a biological weapon, for example, that’s usually the same capabilities that the model could use to help make vaccines and accelerate therapeutics,” he said.Referring to autonomous models, which are viewed as a key part of the investment case for AI, Graham said users want to an AI tool to help their business – not wreck it.“You want a model to go build your business and make you a billion,” he said. “But you don’t want to wake up one day and find that it’s also locked you out of the company, for example. And so our sort of basic approach to it is, we should just start measuring these autonomous capabilities and to run as many weird experiments as possible and see what happens.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Seconds after the request was sent, there was an apparently automated reply that said only: “Legacy Media Lies.”‘Intellectualizing white preservation’Many of the encyclopedia’s entries on prominent white nationalists, antisemites and holocaust deniers appear to be written to portray them in a positive light while casting doubt on the credibility of their critics.The encyclopediapraises the prominent white nationalistand American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor for his “pivotal role in intellectualizing white preservation by advocating for a fact-based, non-violent approach to white identity politics”, with which he has fostered “a legacy of measured dissent that avoided the pitfalls of extremism”.The entry offers no critical examination of Taylor’s beliefs, instead casting doubt on the credibility of his critics. Of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC’s) designation of Taylor as a white nationalist, Grokipedia says this illegitimately “frames Taylor’s American Renaissance publication as a vehicle for repackaging eugenics-era ideas under the guise of ‘race realism’, equating empirical discussions of group disparities with advocacy for racial hierarchy”.The entry also claims that “progressive commentary, including in outlets like GQ, depicts Taylor as a ‘suit-and-tie white supremacist’ … often sidelining his explicit repudiations of antisemitism or coercive measures in favor of broader fears of ideological contagion”.View image in fullscreenThe white nationalist writer Jared Taylor at his home on 19 August 2016 in Oakton, Virginia.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesWikipedia, meanwhile,describesTaylor as “an American white supremacist and editor of American Renaissance” and “a proponent ofscientific racismand voluntary racial segregation”.Meanwhile, Kevin MacDonaldhas been describedby the SPLC as the “neo-Nazi movement’s favorite academic” who “argues that anti-Semitism, far from being an irrational hatred for Jews, is a logical reaction to Jewish success”. Wikipedia’sentry on MacDonaldcalls him an “antisemitic conspiracy theorist, white supremacist and retired professor of evolutionary psychology”.The making of Elon Musk: how did his childhood in apartheid South Africa shape him?Read moreGrokipedia, however, says that MacDonald’s research simply “focuses on applying evolutionary principles to human social behavior”, and “by framing 20th-century ideological movements as vehicles for group advancement, MacDonald has revived causal inquiries into collective interests, prompting alternative scholars to reassess blank-slate egalitarianism’s role in eroding recognition of adaptive ethnic strategies”.MacDonald’s work counters “institutional biases toward universalism in academic discourse”, according to the entry.David Irving is a self-taught British historian who has publicly denied the Jewish Holocaust since 1988. His views led to him being banned from entering several countries in the 1990s, and in 2006 he was imprisoned in Austria over his denial of the existence of gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Grokipedia’s entry on Irving, however, paints him in heroic terms.According to the entry, in “wider dissident communities” Irving “symbolizes resistance to institutional suppression of unorthodox historical inquiry” in the face of “coordinated efforts to silence dissent rather than scholarly refutation”. The entry adds: “Despite mainstream dismissals from sources with evident anti-revisionist biases, such as advocacy groups, Irving’s archival rigor continues to be praised within these circles.”In an email,Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project on Hate and Extremism, said: “Grokipedia is another example of Elon Musk proliferating hateful disinformation and far-right propaganda. The site whitewashes white supremacists, anti-Semites and other extremists, providing ‘information’ that clearly distorts the truth.”‘The preservation and advancement of the European racial heritage’Grokipedia gives similarly favorable accounts of historical far-right figures.William Luther Pierce was “America’s most important neo-Nazi for three decades until his death in 2002”, according to the SPLC. He was the key organizer of the National Alliance, an organization whose ultimate aim was a white nationalist overthrow of the US government, and the author of The Turner Diaries, a dystopian novel of race war which was a seminal tome for white nationalists in the US.Wikipedia’s entry on Pierce points out that The Turner Diaries “inspired multiple hate crimes, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing”.Grokipedia’s entry on Pierce, however, describes the National Alliance as “an organization promoting the preservation and advancement of the European racial heritage” and “a key entity in the white advocacy milieu”.William Luther Pierce.Photograph: Robert HartnellIt says Pierce’s “efforts emphasized intellectual rigor, drawing on evolutionary science and historical analysis to argue for racial separatism over egalitarian ideologies”.That entry says The Turner Diaries depicts “individual resistance against perceived societal decay”. In aseparate entry on the book, Grokipedia says the book’s “advocacy for total racial war, rejection of democratic compromise and portrayal of mass extermination as moral imperative” have “drawn scrutiny from institutions prone to framing such texts through lenses of hate rather than analyzing their appeal via first-principles incentives like group survival”.Revilo P Oliver was a professor and a co-founder of the John Birch Society in 1958, who was purged from the conservative National Review in 1960 over public expressions of antisemitism. Until his death in 1994, Oliver was a vociferous antisemite and a rightwing critic of conservatism and Christianity, which he considered insufficiently committed to preserving the white race.In his 1981 book America’s Decline, he wrote that the wartime US president Franklin Roosevelt joined the second world war to “please his Jewish owners and gratify his own nihilistic lusts”, and that “Germany, after a valiant and heroic defense against the forces of virtually the whole world that the Jews had mobilized against her, was forced to surrender in 1945”.The book also rehearses antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as Holocaust denial, writing that Jews “invented the hoax about ‘gas chambers’ and the ‘extermination’ of God’s Own People”.Wikipedia’s entry on Oliver calls him “a polemicist for right-wing, white nationalist and antisemitic causes”.His Grokipedia entry, however, claims that Oliver’s writings emphasize “empirical patterns of demographic displacement and institutional capture over ideological abstractions”.Elsewhere, it reads :“Though marginalized by mainstream academia for rejecting egalitarian premises, his corpus remains a touchstone for those prioritizing civilizational continuity.”It adds that Oliver “demonstrated that civilizational competence requires racial homogeneity, as heterogeneous mixtures historically devolved into chaos, rendering preservationist separation an empirical imperative for Aryan survival”.‘Policies preserving demographic uniformity’Several Grokipedia entries claim to provide scientific backing for racist ideologies and concepts.Wikipedia’s entry on racial nationalism calls it “an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity”, which “seeks to preserve ‘racial purity’ of a nation”. The entry says that in order to justify racist policies, “racial nationalism often promotes eugenics”.Grokipedia’s entry, meanwhile, appears to justify racial nationalism in explicitly eugenic terms, saying that it “draws on evolutionary biology to argue that preserving distinct racial genetic profiles maximizes individuals’ inclusive fitness”.The entry claims that this purported basis in evolutionary biology means that racial nationalism is less an “arbitrary prejudice” than “a mechanism to safeguard adapted gene pools against erosion, paralleling species-level conservation in biodiversity ethics”, even if “critics from mainstream academia often dismiss such interests due to ideological commitments to human genetic uniformity”.The entry claims that “ethnic homogeneity fosters higher levels of interpersonal trust and social cohesion compared to greater diversity”, and “ethnic homogeneity correlates with reduced crime and corruption, enhancing institutional reliability and public order”.It then attacks critics of racial nationalism as irrational: “In academia, debates on racial nationalism – often framed as ethnonationalism – pit empirical findings on ethnic homogeneity’s benefits against ideological commitments to multiculturalism.”It also criticizes “left-leaning biases in social sciences, where peer-reviewed outlets underpublish contrarian findings on diversity’s costs, favoring interpretive frameworks that equate homogeneity advocacy with exclusionism”.Kevin Bird is an evolutionary biologistwho has been a frequent critic of writers who have been engaged in attempts to revive scientific racism. He described the racial nationalism entry as “a completely selective kind of fun house mirror world of interpreting the last like 30 years of biology”.Bird added that in his encounters with scientific racist texts, “I’ve never seen a single document that is this extreme: not just in its selective citation and narrative building but in that the entire argument is spelled out in ways that you never see.”Grokipedia offers similar justifications for white nationalist slogans.The so-called “fourteen words” is a white nationalist slogan coined by the neo-Nazi terrorist David Lane, who died in federal prison after being sentenced to 190 years over his involvement in the murder of the talkshow host Alan Berg by members of the Order, a group Berg founded.David Lane after his April 1985 arrest.Photograph: Associated PressAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the slogan “reflects the primary white supremacist worldview in the late 20th and early 21st centuries: that unless immediate action is taken, the white race is doomed to extinction by an alleged ‘rising tide of color’ purportedly controlled and manipulated by Jews”.Grokipedia’s entry on the sloganargues that it “articulates a principle positing that ethnic groups possess an innate imperative to ensure their own continuity and reproduction against threats of assimilation, displacement, or extinction”.The entry continues: “This view draws from observations in evolutionary biology, where kin selection and inclusive fitness mechanisms favor behaviors that propagate shared genetic lineages within closely related populations, extending individual self-preservation instincts to group-level survival strategies.”Those who have associated the slogan with racial hatred, the entry argues, “exhibit patterns of selective scrutiny” or have “ideological priorities favoring certain victim narratives”.Meanwhile, Grokipedia’sentry on white nationalismcharacterizes it as emphasizing “the distinct ethnic identity of people of European descent, advocating for their collective self-determination through the preservation or restoration of white-majority demographics”.It says that white nationalism is illegitimately conflated with white supremacy “by critics in academic and media analyses that exhibit systemic ideological biases”.It says that white nationalism’s “defining achievements include shifting public discourse toward explicit recognition of white interests”.The entry says a central concept of white nationalism “is racial realism, the acknowledgment of innate group differences in traits like intelligence and behavior, derived from empirical data on IQ distributions and crime rates across populations”.According to the entry, racial realism along with the concepts of white genocide and white separatism “underscore a first-principles focus on biological and historical realities over egalitarian ideals, with advocates citing genetic clustering of Europeans as a distinct lineage and civilizational achievements attributable to white-majority societies as justifications for prioritization”.‘All influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race’A cluster of entries provides positive support for eugenics while at the same time reviving concepts and measures associated with an earlier period of scientific racism.Theentry on eugenicsdefines it as the “science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race”, which “derives from the fundamental biological reality that many human traits, including cognitive ability, physical health, and behavioral dispositions, possess substantial genetic components”.The entry runs through a range of claimed empirical support for eugenics, before attacking critics, arguing that “opposition to eugenics has frequently been shaped by egalitarian ideologies that prioritize environmental explanations for human differences, often downplaying or denying robust evidence of genetic heritability in traits like intelligence and behavior”.The entry also criticizes what it calls “suppression tactics, such as labeling researchers studying group differences as eugenicists or racists” and a supposed “neglect of dysgenic fertility in Western societies, where correlations between intelligence and fertility remain negative”.Grokipedia also contains a series of lengthy entries on racial categories characteristic of an earlier era of scientific racism, which it presents as having scientific credibility on the basis of evidence including skull measurements with calipers.In an entry on theCaucasian race, Grokipedia claims that a 2002 study shows a biological basis for this category by using genotypes from a large sample to infer “six major clusters, with the Eurasian cluster aligning with the Caucasian category”.The study, by the scientist Noah Rosenberg and colleagues, has been widely misused by scientific racists, and is used in several Grokipedia entries to support scientific racist claims.The entry on race, for example, claims that “genetic evidence bolsters race realism by demonstrating structured variation among human populations”.In an email, Rosenberg wrote: “Our 2002 study accords with 50+ years of human population genetics research that does not support such biological concepts of race.”He added: “Human population clustering analyses using programs such as STRUCTURE should not be taken as support for a racial understanding of human population genetics.”He continued: “The last 50+ years of research in the field of human population genetics undermines rather than supports essentialized biological race theories that see human biology through a racial lens.”Elsewhere, however, the Grokipedia entry presents “Caucasoid” racial subtypes whose categorization is based on prewar racial categories from physical anthropology which it says were “supported by measurements of over 10,000 skulls and living subjects”.There are also detailed descriptions of purported racial skull measurements in entries on racial categories, including entries for “Negroid”, “Mongoloid”, “Armenoid”, “Nordic” and “Ethiopid” skull types.‘Rhodesia’s era demonstrated effective resource management’Grokipedia’s entries on several white-supremacist or white exclusionary communities attempt to justify their existence in terms of economic performance.The entry on Rhodesia– renamed Zimbabwe after the end of white minority rule – lionizes the white supremacist country, saying: “In retrospect, Rhodesia’s era demonstrated effective resource management and institutional stability under constrained minority governance, yielding higher per capita incomes, literacy rates, and life expectancies for the broader population.”The entry appears to promote white supremacist authoritarianism over democracy on economic grounds, claiming that Rhodesia’s economic outcomes “highlight causal advantages of skills-prioritizing systems over purely demographic mandates”.It claims critics of Rhodesia suffer from “institutional biases favoring rapid decolonization narratives” that are “prevalent in mainstream academic and media sources”.Musk’s AI Grok bot rants about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa in unrelated chatsRead moreGrokipediasimilarly praisesthe whites-only community of Orania in South Africa, which forbids any non-Afrikaner taking up residence. It reads: “Orania has achieved economic prosperity through sustained growth and low unemployment, outperforming national benchmarks in South Africa.”Elsewhere it argues that while media reports “often depict Orania as a ‘racist enclave’ or ‘bio-dome of apartheid’ … such framings have drawn counter-criticism for overlooking the town’s self-funding model and absence of external subsidies”.It adds that critics “prioritize ideological concerns over empirical metrics like Orania’s low crime rates and economic self-reliance”.Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “Musk has become one of the greatest purveyors and proliferators of extremist ideas. Along withX, Grokipedia is just another piece in his arsenal, for laundering white supremacy, bigotry and hatred into the mainstream. Nobody should take Grokipedia seriously.”Richard Cooke, author of the political biographyElon Musk: Dark Star Rising, and also a forthcoming cultural history of Wikipedia, said: “A very important part of understanding the genesis of Grokipedia is Elon Musk holding court on X and having people complain to him that Grok has given them woke answers.”Cooke continued: “I think it’s impossible to separate what is happening with Wikipedia and Grokipedia from what is happening to every other form of knowledge which accompanies a form of accountability to tech oligarchs and people in the Maga movement.”He added: “Grokipedia is a copy of Wikipedia but one where in each instance that Wikipedia disagrees with the richest man in the world, it’s ‘rectified’ so that it’s congruent with them.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskAntisemitismRaceFar right (US)The super-richXWikipediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Paul McCartney’s first new recording in five years lacks the sing-along tune and jaunty guitar chops because there’s barely anything there.The former Beatle, arguably Britain’s greatest living songwriter, is releasing a track of an almost completely silent recording studio as part of a music industry protest against copyright theft by artificial intelligence companies.In place of catchy melodies and evocative lyrics there is only quiet hiss and the odd clatter. It suggests that if AI companies unfairly exploit musicians’ intellectual property to train their generative AI models, the creative ecosystem will be wrecked and original music silenced.McCartney, 83 and currently touring North America, has added the track to the B-side of an LP calledIs This What We Want?, which is filled with other silent recordings and will be pressed on vinyl and released later this month.McCartney’s contribution comes as musicians and artists step up their campaign to persuade the UK government to stop technology companies from training AI models on their creative output without approval or paying royalties. Meanwhile, Britain faces anti-regulation pressure from Donald Trump’s White House.The album track listing spells out “the British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies”.Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness behind the protest album, said: “I am very concerned the government is paying more attention to US tech companies’ interests rather than British creatives’ interests.”Other artists already backing the campaign include Sam Fender, Kate Bush, Hans Zimmer and the Pet Shop Boys.McCartney’s new contribution is called (bonus track) and like his best songs, it could be said to have a beginning, a middle and an end. It fades up quickly and begins with 55 seconds of tape hiss before 15 seconds of indeterminate clattering that could be someone opening a door and pacing about, before settling down to another 80 seconds of rustle-punctuated hiss and concluding with a slow and poignant fadeout.McCartney has been among leading voices in British music voicing concern at the ministers’ plans forge a new deal between creatives and AI companies such as Open AI, Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, which demand access to huge volumes of training information including text, images and music.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Ministers face the difficulty of balancing the interests of creative industries, which add £125bn annually to the UK economy, and US tech companies who want light regulation and recently announced more than £30bn in investments, mostly in datacentres.An AI-generated band got 1m plays on Spotify. Now music insiders say listeners should be warnedRead moreA new legal system for AI and copyright is not expected to be debated in parliament before 2026. In the meantime, the government has signed deals with AI companies includingOpen AI,GoogleandAnthropicto boost AI adoption across government and the wider economy.Trump hassaid: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer and film director who campaigns for copyright protection, told the Guardian: “The government is trying to play both sides and convincing neither.”She added: “They have proven themselves unfit to govern in the economic interests of the creators.”A government source said Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, was committed to finding a solution between AI firms and creatives and “recognises both of these sectors are British success stories and she is talking to both sides”.There was concern when Kendall appointed a special adviser in September who had previouslyargued: “Whether or not you philosophically believe the big AI firms should compensate content creators, they in practice will never legally have to.”Responding to McCartney’s intervention, a government spokesperson said it put the interests of the UK’s citizens and businesses first.“We’ve always been clear on the need to work with both the creative industries and AI sector to drive AI innovation and ensure robust protections for creators,” they said.“We are bringing together both British and global companies, alongside voices beyond the AI and creative sectors, to ensure we can capture the broadest possible range of expert views as we consider next steps.”Explore more on these topicsPaul McCartneyArtificial intelligence (AI)Music industryShareReuse this content"

This time, Bezos has appointed himself co-CEO of an AI startup called Project Prometheus,the New York Timesreported, citing anonymous sources.The startup, which will focus on developing AI for engineering and manufacturing in various fields, has already received $6.2bn in funding – more than many companies are able to raise in their lifetimes. Leading the company alongside Bezos is his co-founder and co-CEO Vik Bajaj, a celebrity tech executive in his own right. Bajaj is a physicist and chemist best known for his work at Google’s moonshot factory, X, where he founded the health startup Verily.It is unclear how long the company has existed, but Project Prometheus has already hired 100 employees, poaching several from firms like OpenAI, DeepMind and Meta, according to the Times. Little else is known about the project, as Bezos did not disclose where the company will be based or how its technology might function. The world’s third-richest person has been closely involved at his aerospace company Blue Origin for several years as its founder and sole shareholder, but becoming a CEO again will be the first formal role Bezos has taken since stepping down fromAmazon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can now predict floods in the next week, but you can actually figure out sea level rise and things like that.”Saa admitted there are legitimate concerns about the governance of AI and its impact upon society but, on balance, the effect on the environment could be positive. In June, areportby the London School of Economics had an unexpectedly sunny estimate – AI could reduce global greenhouse gases by 3.2bn to 5.4bn tonnes in the next decade, even factoring in its vast energy consumption.“People already make dumb decisions about energy, such as running air conditioning for too long,” Saa said. “How much of our phone has bad stuff for us? I think a lot. How many hours do we spend on Instagram?“My view of this is that society is going to go in this direction. We need to think about how we are not destroying the planet with heating and we’re actually trying to make sure that there’s a net benefit.”Some other experts and environmental advocates are not convinced. The huge computational power of AI, particularly generative AI, is fueling aboomin data centers in countries such as the US that is gobbling up a huge amount of electricity and water, even in places prone to droughts, pushing up electricity bills in some places as a result.The climate cost of this AI gold rush, driven by companies such as Google, Meta and OpenAI, is large and set to get larger – a recent Cornell Universitystudyfound that by 2030, the current rate of AI growth in the US will add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the equivalent of adding 10m gasoline cars to the road or the entire annual emissions of Norway.“People have this techno-utopian view of AI that it will save us from the climate crisis,” said Jean Su, a climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We know what will save us from the climate crisis – phasing out fossil fuels. It’s not AI.”Also, while AI can be used to drive efficiencies to lower emissions, the same sort of tools can be used to optimize other areas – including fossil fuel production.A report last month by Wood Mackenzieestimated that AI could help unlock an extra trillion barrels of oil – a scenario which, if the energy markets were to be amenable to such a thing, would obliterate any hopes of restraining catastrophic climate breakdown.Natascha Hospedales, lead lawyer for AI at Client Earth, said there is some merit to the “AI for good” argument, but that it is a “really small niche” within a much larger industry that is much more focused on maximizing profits.“There is some truth that AI could help the developing world, but much of this is in the early stage and some of it is hypothetical – it’s just not there yet,” she said. “Overall we are very, very far from a situation where AI for good balances out the negative environmental impact of AI.“The environmental cost of AI is already alarming and I don’t see data center growth winding down any time soon. A small percentage of AI is used for good and 99% of it is companies like Google and Meta lining their pockets with money, damaging the environment and human rights as they do it.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

The film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public scorn from conservatives.Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.) A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.When it comes to the darker aspects of the story, though, Rule Breakers is less assured. Except for minor scenes depicting the girls’ rejection for American visas, the film rarely grapples with the war inAfghanistanand its effects on women. From external funding to newspaper coverage, the film sets up a dichotomy between western support and domestic oppression, but this is a distinction that requires more political nuance considering the legacy of American interventionism in the region. While spirited in parts, the journey taken by this extraordinary robotics team deserves a more layered storytelling approach than that of a feelgood movie.Rule Breakers is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRobotsEngineeringAfghanistanSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

But old economic orthodoxies are not the answerMon 17 Nov 2025 13.47 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 15.27 ESTShareLast March, following angst-ridden months as Europe came to terms with Donald Trump’s return to the White House, financial markets in Paris, Milan and Berlin were gripped by asurgeof optimism. The cause was a historic deal brokered by Friedrich Merz, then Germany’s chancellor-elect, which loosened constitutional spending constraints in the EU’s powerhouse nation. Here at last, it was hoped, was the fiscal kickstart required to end a prolonged period of economic stagnation, and mitigate geopolitical headwinds blowing from the US and China.Six months into Mr Merz’s premiership, the angst is back and there are the first murmurings of rebellion. The chancellor’s plan included “whatever it takes” levels of defence spending, designed to prepare Germany for a changed era in which the US was no longer a dependable ally, and a huge €500bn investment in infrastructure and the green transition. But last week, the chancellor’s team of economic advisersdowngradedgrowth forecasts for 2026 to below 1%. And ahead of what would constitute a fourth year of near-flatlining, businessconfidencehas slumped.Lifting Germany’s “debt brake” was never going to be an instant panacea for longstanding problems. Patience will be required, for example, before the full impact of spending on the country’s ailing transport systems is felt. But across Europe, patience is a virtue that’s in short supply among voters, whofeelthat their living standards have been stagnating – or worse – since the crash of 2008. According to one recent survey, fewer than one in five Germanswishto see Mr Merz standing again at the next federal election.As the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party tops thepolls, such disillusionment is a problem not just for the chancellor and his centre-right-led coalition government, but for mainstream politics as a whole. Germany has found itself at the sharp end of a wider geopoliticalstorm: Russia’s war in Ukraine, aggressive Chinese competition and Mr Trump’s trade wars have all combined to undermine an export-led model that underpinned European prosperity. Mr Merz was right to recognise that the exceptional times required a bold and imaginative fiscal response. But as discontent grows, he is already under pressure from critics to rein in social spending in the hope of increasing the country’s competitiveness.For a chancellor who once served on the supervisory board of Black Rock and forged a political reputation as a fiscal hawk, that would be a kind of reversion to type. Mr Merz’s Social Democratic coalition partners would attempt to see off a threatenedrevoltby Christian Democrat MPs over a proposed pensions package. But the siren calls from familiar quarters on the right should be resisted more generally.For Germany – and for Europe as a whole – the imperatives of the age are to revive a battered and bruised social model, and to turbocharge investment as the global economy is shaped to suit a multipolar world. Falling back on the failed economic orthodoxies of a previous era would only be to further empower the far right, whichbeganits gradual ascent during the austerity years that followed the crash.Mr Merz has had a difficult first six months in office. But as the scale of the challenges facing Europe’s most important economy becomes ever clearer,Germanycannot afford to go back to the future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the documents also reveal how many powerful men confided in himMon 17 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 16.36 ESTShareBefore he died,Jeffrey Epsteinmade it clear that Donald Trump “knew about the girls”.Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s longstanding child sex-trafficking operation. But in newly released emails thatmembers of Congress disclosed to the mediaamid the end of this fall’s government shutdown, the dead child sex trafficker and financier can be seen corresponding on many occasions aboutDonald Trump, his former close friend and associate, throughout the last few years of his life, as Trump’s rise to prominence in national politics beginning in 2015 drew renewed attention to his relationship with Epstein.When Landon Thomas Jr, then a reporter at the New York Times, wrote to Epstein in 2015 asking about his relationship with Trump, Epstein (who in the documents has a habit of not using punctuation or capitalization in his emails), said, “have them ask my houseman about donald almost walking through the door leaving his nose print on the glass as young women were swimming in the pool he was so focused he walked straight into the door.” If it hadn’t happened in the backdrop to so much sexual exploitation and violence, the scene described byJeffrey Epsteinwould sound like something out of a screwball comedy. In another exchange with Thomas, Epstein asks, “would you like to see photos of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen?”Throughout the emails, Epstein depicts Trump as someone he knew intimately, someone whose mind and habits he can provide insight into for others. “You see , i know how dirty donald is,”Epstein wrote in a 2018 emailto former Obama White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler.Republicans in the House released a vast trove of about 23,000 pages of documents from the Epstein estate on Wednesday just hours after Democrats released selected emails from Epstein referencing Trump. In one of theemails released by Democrats, a 2019 message that Epstein wrote to the journalist Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote of Trump, “of course he knew about the girls.”In another missive, a 2011 exchange between Epstein and his girlfriend and procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein writes, “i want you to realize that the dog that hasn’t barked is trump.” Referring to a victim whose name was redacted, he said that the girl had “spent hours at my house with him”. Epstein’s meaning is not explicit, but his emails suggest he was worried Trump would disclose whatever he knew about Epstein’s conduct to authorities or the public.In a troubling exchange from December 2015, the night of a Republican primary debate at which Trump was expected to appear, Wolff and Epstein strategized together as to what Trump might be told to say if he was asked about his relationship with the sex trafficker. “I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you – either on air or in scrum afterwards,”Wolff wrote to Epstein. “if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?” Epstein asked. Evidently comfortable with providing strategic advice to a source he knew to be a sex criminal – Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitingprostitution years earlier; the victim was 14 years old– Wolff issued a response that appeared to suggest that Epstein preserve the possibility of using the information to his benefit. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to your house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency,” Wolff says. “You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.” (Wolfftold CNNhe didn’t “quite remember the context” of the exchange.)The documents also reveal the stunning breadth of Epstein’s connections among the nation’s eliteThe archive that has been released to the public is vast, and undoubtedly what will be most interesting to most readers is the question of what Trump knew about Epstein’s sexually abusive conduct towards teenage girls. But the notion that Trump might have known about Epstein’s conduct has already been the subject of widespread speculation, following the unearthing ofcomments Trump madeabout how Epstein liked “beautiful women” who were “on the younger side” and the leak of abirthday card he reportedly gave Epstein, which featured a crude drawing of a nude female figure and an odd poem that referenced “enigmas” that “never age” and a “wonderful secret”. (The White House has deniedthe card is authentic.)But the documents also reveal the stunning breadth of Epstein’s connections among the nation’s elite, including long after his initial 2008 sex crimes conviction, and the extent to which other men in positions of great power considered him a confidant or voice of reason. In the fall of 2017, shortly after the emergence of the #MeToo movement, Larry Summers, the economist who resigned as the president of Harvard University over statements he made suggesting that women were less intelligent than men,wrote to Epsteinto complain that if you “hit on a few women 10 years ago” you “can’t work at a network or think tank”. Epstein also wrotemultiple emailsto the billionaire venture capitalist and rightwing mega-donor Peter Thiel, including one with the subject line:“that was fun, see you in 3 weeks.”In another email, Epsteinoffered to introduce Thiel to Woody Allen.There is no evidence that these men participated in Jeffrey Epstein’s habitual sexual abuse of girl children. But their interactions with him suggest a kind of blithe tolerance of his presence in their midst, a seeming comfort in exchanging intimate – and sometimes lewd – exchanges with a man they must have known to have sexually exploited a child. Many of the emails to and from Epstein are marked by a tone of haughty knowingness, a kind of worldly, smug cynicism I’ve encountered before in people who think that they are smarter than everyone else. Maybe in the haughty world of billionaires and private jets, it is considered provincial to think that adults should not have sex with children. Maybe to them, morality is for the little people.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

No need to be starry-eyed about US imperialism and what has long been criticized as an ever-expanding “national security state”; one can still appreciate that it is a good thing if generals do not take sides in politics – just ask anyone from the many countries around the world where they do. But a pattern is becoming clear:Donald Trumpis purging the higher ranks based on his prejudices and demands for loyalty; the military is being turned into a partisan instrument and a political prop; more dangerous still, the president is instilling the logic of impunity that has come to characterize his entire approach to governance.Figures deemed too close to Trump critics, such as GenMark Milley, have seenpromotions delayed or canceled; thosetargeted by far-right influencersmight faceprofessional backlash. Trumpused Maga-fied soldiers as backgroundto a Fort Bragg speech, violating longstanding norms against instrumentalizing state institutions for partisan purposes. Every violation becomes a test of who will be loyal: critics – the potentially disloyal – will identify themselves.The US has drafted a coin featuring Trump. Here’s a better way to immortalize him | Robert ReichRead moreWith everyillegal order, such asattacking boatsin the Caribbean, he manages to have those who carry them out compromise themselves morally and potentially render themselves liable for criminal prosecution, thereby generating an incentive for members of the military to make sure Trumpists stay in power. At the same time, prominent pardons – most recently ofthose trying to steal the 2020 election– establish the promise of impunity. As plenty of observers have pointed out, under Trump, law will protect the Maga faithful but will not bind them; those declared the president’s enemies will be bound by the law, but not be protected by it. It is not an accident thatPete Hegseth’s first 15 minutes of fame consisted ofpassionate pleason Fox to let those accused of war crimes go unpunished.Hegseth has carried the primacy of the performative from TV into the Pentagon. Just think of his self-branding through dress and over-the-top speeches littered with alliterations – suggesting that words drive thinking, as opposed to thinking leading to choosing the right words (most prominently, there is“lethality” having to replace “legality”). The great 18th-century writer and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft drew a surprising parallel between stereotypes about women and a certain type of soldier in standing (and largely underemployed) armies. She observed that soldiers might acquire manners before morals: “Like the fair sex, the business of their life is gallantry. They were taught to please, and they only live to please.”The point is not that Hegseth’s ideal soldiers are effeminate; rather, it is that the song and dance about a “warrior ethos” is pure made-for-TV-affectation, as if hand-to-hand combat were the essence of 21st-century warfare. Central Command becomes subject to the logic of “central casting” (Trump’sown wordswhen looking at the officers Hegseth assembled in Virginia in September). The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz’s memorable dictum that war is the continuation of politics by other means is replaced with something like “war is the continuation of fitness and fashion by other means” (as Hegseth made it a priority toremove personnel deemed fat).Yet sending soldiers into Democratic cities should not be dismissed as purely performative. It serves to normalize the image of soldiers on the street; it blurs the distinction between military and civilian life, and, as the Israeli scholar Avishay Ben Sasson-Gordis has argued,it sends a messagethat citizens can be treated as enemies. In the process, it is also becoming increasingly unclear which uniformed personnel belong to which unit and who is really authorized to do what, since the Pentagon and homeland security are explicitlyencouraged to be in “lockstep”as part of a shared “homeland mission”. Trump is merging everyone into something the political scientist Dan Moynihan terms the “omniforce”, the kind of omnipresent army, combined with what James Madison called an “overgrown executive”, which the American founders rightly dreaded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The image of Trump as padrone was reinforced by histrying to grab fundsappropriated by Congress for other purposes in order topay soldiers during the shutdown– not to speak of having apro-regime oligarchfund the military with private wealth. Other aspiring autocrats have made similar moves, though at a much smaller scale: Viktor Orbán has instituted a special counter-terror unit,headed byhis former bodyguard and aide, that is widely seen as primarily loyal to the Hungarian prime minister.Many remember the great democratization wave of the 1970s and 1980s, forgetting how easily things might have turned out differently. We are often oblivious to how critical the role of the military was in transitions to democracy. Not only because juntas were willing to relinquish power but also because individuals made the right moral choice. AugustoPinochet, after losing a plebiscite in 1988, had been ready todeclare an emergencyand keep himself in power by force. One general, Fernando Matthei, rejected the plan and told journalists that Pinochet had lost the plebiscite.

In response to a post on X which predicted that Shabana Mahmood would announce that refugees will be granted only a temporary stay in the UK and deported if their home countries are later deemed safe, he posted: “The Overton window has been obliterated, well done patriots.” Meanwhile, asylum seekers and refugees I have spoken to are panicked, trembling and crying at the prospect of having to be uprooted once again after feeling safe in the UK, often after experiencing years of risk and danger.Since last Thursday, journalists have been receiving an average of one Home Office press release every few hours, each one focusing on a different aspect of what Mahmood has described as “the most sweeping reformsto tackle illegal migration in modern times”. But a quick investigation below the surface of the eye-catching we-mean-business sloganising reveals a mix of recycling, hype and unachievable promises. According to the home secretary, support will end for those who “game the system”, while the days of a “soft-touch asylum system are over” because she is going to tear up refugees’ “golden ticket” to the UK. There is mounting disquiet about all this among Labour votersand MPs.Mahmood has also been keen to stress Labour’s success so far.Removals have increased, according to the Home Office, with11,231 asylum-related returnsin the year to November 2025. But many of these removals were to countries regarded as safe, such as Brazil and India, which have historically had very low asylum grant rates – not a sign that officials are bundling out of the country thousands of asylum seekers who arrived from conflict zones on small boats.And her plan to get tough on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo by refusing to grant visas to their nationals if they don’t play take back foreign national offenders is hardly the gamechanger she claims. Only a few thousand visas were granted last year to migrants from all three countries combined, according toHome Officedata.Granting or not granting such a relatively small number of visas, despite making a huge difference to the individuals involved, will make barely a dent in the overall immigration figures the Home Office is so desperate to reduce.Another threat is to reduce appeal rights on asylum and immigration claims to a “single route of appeal”, according to a Home Office press release. I asked if this means that further rights of appeal, such as to the upper tribunal of the immigration chamber, will be scrapped. No, officials said.The asylum accommodation announcement is eye-catchingly draconian. It willrevoke the rightto automatic financial support for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute. But not for the vast majority of the100,000 asylum seekers who are in receipt of it. It will apply only to 8,500 asylum seekers who came to the UK via a visa before lodging an asylum claim. The assistance will become “discretionary”, meaning it will be denied to those who can work or have assets. It is not knownhow many will actually have their support revoked, and how many will be too ill to work or unable to find a job.Excluding asylum seekers who have independent financial means, break the law or work illegally from asylum accommodation is not new, as thisHome Office guidancefrom March 2023 shows.As for the jewellery confiscation plan, the optics may appeal to anyone who believes that asylum seekers arriveon dinghies draped in bling. But it doesn’t apply to the majority of asylum seekers I have met, many of whom have sold their last worldly possessions to cross the Channel in the hope of reaching safety. Even in Denmark, where the policy was initiated,assets have been confiscated only 17 timesbetween 2016 and 2022. Many, such as the Green peer Jenny Jones, are “disgusted” by the idea.The decision to quadruple the amount of time before a refugee can settle permanently in the UK,from five years to 20, will have vast consequences. As one Syrian refugee told me after hearing the flurry of government announcements: “I feel like I’ve been scammed by the government who are clapping Reform UK and people who have racist and fascist views. I have become more scared of walking down the street in case I’m attacked by racists. I’m more vigilant now. I used to have nightmares about the things that happened to me in Syria. They hugely reduced after I got refugee status but now they have started again.”It’s unlikely that conditions will significantly improve in the main conflict zones where refugees are granted leave to remain comefrom – Eritrea, Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. People from these countries are likely to be left in a state of long-term limbo for a significant chunk of their productive lives, making it much harder to secure a job, find housing and put down roots. But they won’t actually be going anywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Butits own researchhas shown what the pull factors are–and benefits, nice houses and putting their feet up at taxpayers’ expense are not among them. There is no evidence that any of the deterrent measures introduced so far have done anything at all to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK. Small boat crossings continue to be high despite the launch of deterrents such as “one in, one out”.Thousandshave crossed the Channel since the policy was launched on 6 August.There is consensus that our immigration system needs to be firmly controlled, but as the Labour MPSarah Owen says, “a strong immigration system doesn’t need to be a cruel one”. Instead of enforcing these cruel and ineffective policies, the UK should work closely with other European countries and the relevant UN bodies such as the UN high commissioner for refugees to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are fairly distributed between safe countries, and that the precious right to seek sanctuary for those fleeing persecution is not eroded beyond recognition.The government may in time regret receiving a ringing endorsement from Tommy Robinson. It should regret too the damage it will cause, not only to the relatively small number of asylum seekers who come here – just over 100,000 last year – but also to UK society, which will only splinter further as the language and policies of hate and division become embedded.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I hope school doesn’t shrink their joyous, noisy worldsShadi Khan SaifMaybe there’s room for something gentler: letting children know they don’t need to change any part of themselves to belongMon 17 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 17.07 ESTShareMost mornings in our house feel like a friendly little language carnival spinning through the kitchen. Before the kids even put on their shoes for school, they’ve cycled through three languages – joking in Hindi, arguing in Pashto and sprinkling English on top like chocolate chips tossed over their cereal.We don’t plan it or rehearse it: it just happens. Pashto is the language of feelings and family business such as complaints, alliances, who stole whose pencil, who touched the remote. Hindi came to us through the back door: Bollywood songs and movies playing in the background, cousins in Karachi and the kind of street-style banter the kids pick up from YouTube faster than I can keep track of. And English, of course, is the language that binds the whole day together with school notices, breakfast negotiations, reminders about homework.The kids seem to choose the language that suits the mood: Hindi for humour, Pashto for passion, English for practicality. They switch so quickly that sometimes I feel as if I’m living inside a live-captioned sitcom. One of them will start a sentence in one language and end in another – a linguistic gymnastics routine they don’t even notice themselves doing.Australia’s multiculturalism lives mostly on the surface. Inclusion without voice is tokenism | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreBut they tell me something changes once they get to school. It’s just small observations they report in flat little summaries at the end of the day when I ask if they speak any other language at school: “They [teachers] say to stick to English during class, so we do.”I can feel the shrinking of a world that is so wide and noisy at home.What’s funny is that many children at their school are not just multilingual, they’re ambitious about it too, I am told. Fareeda has many Asian friends and has recently decided she must learn Japanese because one of her favourite comic characters says something “life-changing” that none of us can translate. Khalid has his own gang of friends from diverse backgrounds and is lobbying for German lessons because he associates the language with engineering perfection and fast cars – a connection he inherited from my random fascination with Germany and the handful of phrases I can still recall.Then there’s little Naveed, who insists he once lived in China. He keeps telling us elaborate stories about “friends” and “streets” he remembers. He once spent four hours at Changi airport in Singapore, and that’s the closest he’s been to China. But who are we to interrupt a dreamer?Waleed, meanwhile, has mastered a Mumbai street-style Hindi accent straight out of Bollywood. One day he called mebhaisaab– with full filmi swagger – and now all his siblings do it too. In Pashto I’mlala, in Hindi I’mbhaisaab, in English I’m “bro” – and somehow bro has won the cultural battle. I tell myself there are worse fates.All of this – the laughter, the switching, the accidental “bro-ification” of my household – reminds me of where I come from.My father, back in early 1900s Afghanistan, travelled as a merchant along the old Silk Route. He moved between British India, the former Soviet Union, China and Persia with a kind of linguistic ease that still feels mythical to me. He knew the value of language as a bridge, a shield, a passport.He didn’t learn for exams or careers – he learned because survival and opportunity depended on speaking to people. Growing up, I saw in him a confidence that came from knowing he could belong in many places.And maybe that’s why having kids who speak like this – who jump from one world to another in a single sentence – feels like an inheritance. Not of wealth or land, but of perspective.When I moved from Kabul to Melbourne four years ago, one of the first things that struck me was the visible diversity. On trains, in playgrounds and in shopping centres, languages from every continent float through the air. With time, I realised Australia is a whole map of languages, which is far richer than we acknowledge. There are hundreds of First Nations languages, each with worlds of story and belonging inside them. Then there’s the everyday chorus I hear walking through Melbourne’s southern suburbs: Dari, Greek, Vietnamese, Turkish, Arabic, Serbian, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and more.So no, I don’t expect schools to keep up with every language. But maybe there’s room for something gentler: letting children know they don’t need to shrink any part of themselves to belong. If Australia celebrates diversity, then it would be lovely for our classrooms to feel a bit more like the country around them – open, colourful and welcoming to the stories each child brings.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsLanguageOpinionAustralian educationcommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps hard work and determination, aided by a degree of talent? No doubt these have played an important role. But how much do you think that factors outside your control – what we might think of as luck – have influenced your path in life, for good or ill?I believe that many of us – especially those who consider ourselves successful – underestimate the role that luck has played in our lives. And I’m not just talking about random life events, like winning the lottery, I’m thinking about luck in the broader sense of the circumstances into which each of us is born.It took me a while to realise that my journey through life has been eased by several tailwinds. I have had the incredible luck of being born in the UK, in a peaceful period of history. I was blessed with an able body and mind, and hada good upbringing, and an incredibly exclusive education. I had the freedom to take advantage of opportunities, to start my own business and pursue my ambitions. In that sense my early years were a heck of a lot easier than many people’s. And I was also extremely fortunate that my particular talents were highly valued and rewarded in the marketplace, which enabled me to become wealthy.How about you? Maybe you were born in a period when house prices were low, or when university education was free? You may not have had all of these things, but imagine for a second that you had none of them. Imagine that you came into this world facing barriers to your progress at every stage. Your parents unemployed, or needing care from you, or working ridiculous hours in insecure jobs. Your neighbourhood wracked by deprivation, despair, pollution and crime, with precious few opportunities to move up or out. Your plans to buy a house or start a business impossible because of lack of capital, or access to it. Would I have displayed the brilliance and the sheer grit needed to overcome those barriers? Probably not.In this country we like to think that we live in a meritocracy, where talent and hard work are rewarded by success and status, and opportunities are there for whoever is willing to work for them. Clearly this isn’t the case, when there is a recordwealth gapin Britain today, with a mere50 families owning more wealththan the poorest half of the population, while about a third of children live inpoverty, and disadvantaged children are19 monthsbehind their peers by the time they take their GCSEs. Still,38% of peoplethink that someone’s chance of success depends on their own merit rather than on factors beyond their control. They subscribe to themyth of meritocracy.The flip side of the idea that “you can make it if you try” is that if you haven’t made it, you haven’t tried hard enough. This thinking legitimises the status quo by suggesting that inequality is “fair”, allowing those who benefit from it most to frustrate attempts by governments to tackle socioeconomic inequality.All the while, increasing inequality ispoisoningour economy andundermining growth. And yet, while 85% of the British public areconcernedabout inequality, most politicians see tackling inequality either as a low priority or as too politically risky.Worse still, the meritocratic myth – that we all deserve our success or lack of it – allows socioeconomic inequality to spill over into an inequality of esteem, status and dignity. This breeds resentment and disengagement among those who are deemed by society to be second-class citizens, damaging social cohesion andundermining public faith in democratic politics.That is why dismantling the myth that we live in a meritocracy is one of the most urgent changes needed in public life today. We might not all agree on whether a truly meritocratic society is desirable, or even possible – but we should be able to come together around a recognition that we don’t live in one yet and then see if we might do something about it.Acknowledging the role that luck has played in our lives would be a great starting point, helping to smooth the path for our political leaders to take bolder action to tackle socioeconomic inequality. If more business leaders recognised how luck has helped them, it might also encourage them to act (for example by improving pay and conditions for low-paid or insecure workers).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All I’m asking is that my successful contemporaries recognise (if they don’t already) that they’ve benefited from some good luck along the way, whatever hard work has alsobeen involved.At theFairness Foundation, we want to bring together people who have achieved success in life, and who are willing to recognise publicly the role that luck has played in that. Our aim is to challenge the meritocratic myth, unpicking it from its centre outwards. We want to open up space for better conversations about what we need to do as a society to enable everyone to fulfil their ambitions in life, built on a recognition that giving a few people a helping hand isn’t going to cut it.

The insanity of a “deterrent” involving deportingfour peopleto Rwanda at a price of £700m is now giving way to ministers breaking more than 70 years of convention to offer not sanctuary but suspicion. If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what creates refugees, and how to respond to them.Parliament is gripped by fear that “asylum shopping” is widespread, that bearded men peruse policy documents before jumping into dinghies and heading for Great Yarmouth. Even those who recognise X is not a credible source from which to make asylum policy seem resigned to the idea that there are votes in treating all who ask for help as likely to abuse it. In response to a far-right challenge, this government is proposing to keep victims of torture or persecution in a perpetual limbo byonly offering them temporary sanctuary. If they wish to stay they will have to reapply for refugee status every two and a half years. Rather than being able to apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, they will have to wait 20.This is not just performatively cruel, it’s economically misjudged. There isscant evidencethat Denmark’s decision torefuse to grant longterm asylumto most has deterred anyone who would have chosen Denmark as a destination. It’s also clear that this policy would make refugees more costly to help – if you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or charity support. While in the UK migrants aremore likely to be in workthan UK natives, as of 2021 Denmark’s migrant and refugee employment rates were roughly20 percentage points lower– with all the resulting economic and social costs.Asylum accommodation costs in the UK have spiralled because ofdelays in processing– that is clearly unacceptable. So too would be spending money to reassess the same people expecting a different result. When we give someone protection from being persecuted in their home nation on the basis of their religion or sexuality, those who targeted them for these qualities rarely experience a change of heart. Civil wars are not short-term affairs, and in their aftermaths risk of harm is not eliminated at speed – our own travel advice tells younot to go to Syriabecause it is still exceptionally dangerous.In reality if this policy becomes law the UK will requireICE-style raidsto remove people – and their children. If a ceasefire is negotiated with Putin, will the nearly 250,000 Ukrainians who have come here over the past four years and counting be forced to “go home” or be deported without a second glance – regardless of the lives they may have built here now?That the number of people seeking refuge in the UKhas increasedin the past year reflects not a generosity of our system, but the chaos of our world. In the past 10 years multiple conflicts have driven people from their homes whether in Iran, Sudan, Eritrea or Afghanistan; autocrats rising to power have sought to imprison or murder their opponents and conscript young men. Creating a new hostile environment will do little to tackle these factors or the costs of managing asylum. Indeed, it is likely to increase them.It is time for common sense on asylum as well as compassion. Concerns about whether asylum seekers are “genuine” are best interrogated – and deportation enacted if required – when first deciding whether to accept someone into the country. If and when we give someone sanctuary, the progressive response should be to make integration easier and a priority – not leave them open to exploitation through uncertainty.It’s absolutely right to go after the gangmasters. We also need stronger joint approaches with other countries to safe routes, and to sharing data on those rejected. Collaboration could save thousands ofunaccompanied migrant childrennow in Europe from trafficking via family reunion. Ultimately, sharing responsibility for those in need of assistance, not shirking it, is the foundation for action. Because of reduced cooperation and data sharing, it’s clear leaving the EU has proven a far bigger problem for border control than the European convention on human rights.We must also disentangle immigration and asylum. Each requires more control over travel, not less, and recognising that people come to, and leave, the UK for different reasons. For example, it makes little sense to count students in the same category as refugees, when one group is mobile and the other vulnerable.The UK urgently needs a grownup conversation about the merits and quantities of different categories of visas and visitors, whether for marriage, humanitarian needs, care workers, high-value skills or research. That’s unlikely while our political discourse on all sides is steered by toxic tropes about foreigners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And once again, the drama at No 10 has absolutely nothing to do with usMon 17 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 08.30 ESTShareSorry, what just happened? Before we hurtle on to the next instalment of Labour government drama, let’s pause for a second to recap. So Keir Starmer’s allies briefed against Wes Streeting accusing him of plotting a leadership challenge, then Streeting denied the claims, and Starmer apologised for them, before belatedly claiming the briefinghad not comefrom Downing Street at all. Aclaim so implausible that agovernment source saidjournalists “must have all been tricked by several impostors posing as No 10 staff”.If this sounds farcical, vaguely embarrassing for all concerned and massively irrelevant to your life, you would be right. But in between the first chapter and the last (or perhaps the penultimate, given theaftershocks still reverberating through No 10), the episode acted as a masterclass in the patterns that define the stakes of British politics and characterise the stakeholders. It is also a portent of the future.First, crisis: a government and leader in a death spiral. Second, a high-drama episode centred on personnel, chiefs of staff and cabinet ministers. Third, the emergence of a leadership contender who starts to be described in salvationary terms. Fourth, back to the first. Sound familiar?Meanwhile, those involved are imbued by observers with a sense of cunning: once the briefings emerged, so did the game analysis. What’s the play? Is Morgan McSweeney, Downing Street’s chief of staff, the person rumoured to be behind it all, launching a preemptive move to flush out Starmer challengers? Is Starmer conspiring with him,or is he a hapless prince trapped in a high tower by his consiglieres? Is Streeting playing a blinder by keeping his cards close to his chest and cracking on with authoritative dismissal of the “nonsense” and the “toxic culture” in No 10? Here I must employ some restraint and not simply just type in capital letters: maybe there is no play? Have we learned nothing?Maybe this is simply a bunch of people motivated by paranoid office politics and, like all who work in high-pressure environments, act on impulse, based on age-old grudges? “Question is,” asked the Sunday Times Whitehall editor, “what intelligence, or, short of that, political analysis prompted the decision to flush out Streeting?” This is a good and normal question, but perhaps the obvious point, if no one can answer it, is that there is none? Perhaps an inner circle that has plotted and purged its way into power is simply under duress and defaulting to its safe space.You would think that the public descent of Dominic Cummings from the Mekon,master of the dark arts, to an addled angry poster ranting against “the NPC class” would have instilled some healthy scepticism regarding Downing Street svengalis. But here we are. And on that: no one is coming to save this government. Definitely not Streeting, who, like all whose fortunes start to rise as the polls start to tank, is little more than someone whose style and affectare more palatable than the incumbent’s. Which, when that incumbent is Starmer, isn’t hard. This is Rishi Sunak syndrome: a prime minister whose momentum was secured, as far as I can tell, by a single good speech which prompted the BBC to render him asSupermanin a hastilydeletedvideo. Streeting is in this honeymoon phase. His post-briefing performance has already beendescribedas a “masterclass” delivered with “great humour: streetwise: serious intent: and deadly”.We are now in phase three of proceedings, where a sort of defibrillator by way of describing someone into viability is powered up. Because let’s face it, can you cope with four more years of grim Labour decline amid the bewildering rise of Reform ghouls andchaotic leftwing partylaunches? The stabilisation of government, or at least the semblance of some sort of high action, provides a temporary reprieve and injects some possibility. The problem is that none of this has any connection whatsoever to the real world. Streeting, our new political behemoth, was voted back in on a dramatically slashed majority of just over 500 votes, and is leading an NHS reform process blasted as “chaotic and incoherent” by the Institute for Government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inspector Starmer is on the case | Marina HydeRead moreHe is the quintessential demonstration of the “wide but thin” 2024 Labour victory. If he (or anybody else, for that matter) were to become prime minister, the externally applied electric shock would not stop an eventual lapse into narcosis. Because the problem is this Labour government, in which Streeting is only a more compelling character with just as few ideas, competencies or materially defining projects. The tail of the briefing fiasco will be analyses that sharpen the difference between contenders and incumbents – Streeting’s new outspokenness onGazaandracism, for example – but these are all ultimately distinctions without a difference, as far as the direction of government is concerned.Or should I say lack of direction: a sort of general drift in which the party has made pragmatism the end, not the means. “Every day,” Streeting isreportedto have once told a shadow cabinet meeting, “we should drag a sacred cow of our party to the town market place and slaughter it until we are up to our knees in blood.” The electorate can see none of the material virtues of that under a government that presides over apersistentcost of living crisis andrisingfood prices,yet claims that it is “illegal immigration” that is “tearing our country apart”. Still, I’m sure that as people’s minds boggle at their grocery bill they can be comforted by the thought of an asylum seeker possibly beingstrippedof their valuables to pay for processing costs, and reassured by Streeting sounding like a really effective communicator on the Today programme because he “speaks plainly”andcan crack a Traitors joke.The government has entered its musical chairs era. The premise of this, we will be told is that the fish rots from the head down, and so the top must be replaced. The pattern will repeat, and each time it does events will stray further and further from the real world. This is a terminal symptom of failure. The moment a party turns on itself, when personalities replace politics, when sordid media briefings and grievances are litigated in public to poison an already dark public mood, it is a sure indication that the public have become bystanders to the endgame of a political drama that was always about power, not governance. It is the beginning of a final act that will go on for far too long, because, as with all patterns, history begins again every time. Reenactments of an end, never a new beginning.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 17 November 2025.

And this time they’re searching for stability in a chaotic ageSiri ChristiansenI joined a ‘sacrifice’ ritual outside Stockholm – and found that the revival of Norse paganism reflects broader battles over identity and climate anxietyMon 17 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 15.15 ESTShare“Hail Thor!” The priestess and her heathens, standing in a circle, raised their mead-filled horns. We were gathered in an unassuming spot in a pine forest outside Stockholm. This was our temple, and the large, mossy stone before us was our altar. I was relieved to see that the animal-based sacrificial offerings were long-dead and highly processed. A bearded man reached his tattooed arms into his backpack and raised a red, horseshoe-shaped sausage to the sky. A goth girl unboxed a plastic tub of hammer-shaped cookies. The priestess offered me a handful of flaxseeds to toss on the altar, which was overflowing with gifts, apples and bottles of homemade mead.A dozen people had gathered for an autumn sacrifice to summon Thor, the hammer-wielding Norse god of harvests and storms. Many pleaded for him to bring rain, after a summerplagued with drought. Others asked for the strength to battle unemployment, or for the recovery of a sick mother. We all had our own reasons for being there. A middle-aged man, perspiring in his blue office shirt, seemed to be there to connect with his hippy-looking wife and teenage daughter.I was there because pagan events kept popping up in my Facebook feed, and I couldn’t fathom why. I’m not “spiritual”, or even agnostic. I’m staunchly secular, I like modern medicine, and my social media usually reflects that. Having just moved back toSwedenafter five years living in the UK, my online world mainly consisted of London friends and British banter. But there was a glaring exception: my algorithm kept recommending that I check out neo-Norse sacrifices in my local area. It suggested that the movement may be surprisingly mainstream, and the two middle-aged women standing beside me in the forest seemed to confirm this: they looked perfectly normal – like they could work at a nursery. I really had not expected to return home to a Viking revival; nor that it would be so chilled out, when I did.Sweden’s conversion to Christianity in the middle ages largely eradicated the pagan religion of the Viking era. Now, people are intent on bringing it back. While far from a nationwide trend, the fringe faith has racked up a notable following. Two formally recognised faith groups,Nordic Asa-Community (NAC)andCommunity of Forn Sed Swedenhave around 2,700 members between them according to their own estimates, though no official figures exist. On Facebook, they have 16,000 followers combined. They offer naming ceremonies, initiation rites, weddings, funerals, new holidays and a reason to gather in forests and fields. They have a total of 20 sub-divisions across Sweden that organise local, small-scale sacrifices like the one I went to, and their annual, nationwide sacrificesare said to attractabout 300 participants.This summer, Sweden’s first new pagan burial ground in almost a millenniumhas been approved. The site, which will take the form of three grass mounds shaped like buried ships, will be located next to a Christian cemetery in the small town of Molkom. Around 50 people have alreadyrequested to be buried at the site, which is expected to open next year, according to the faith-based group behind the initiative. They have alsoraised SEK208,295 (£16,707)to build a temple near the village of Gamla Uppsala, once the centre of the Viking world. The point is that the heathen community are serious about asserting their rights as a minority faith, and aboutsummoning Odin, the All-Father.It’s an unexpected development in Sweden, a country often characterised as highly secular, ultra-modern and tech-savvy. Historical precedent suggests it may be a sign of existential crisis. In the early 19th century, Swedenceded a third of its territory, Finland, to Russia. Writers and intellectuals turned to Viking-age lore, forging a new national identity based on the brave, masculine, pillaging Viking, to process the humiliating defeat. This ideal was later co-opted by the Third Reich to project the Nazis’ notions of Aryan dominance and racial purity, and far-right groups stilluse runes and other Norse symbolstoday.Against this backdrop, it’s easy to assume today’s pagan revival is linked to nationalism and Sweden’s newanti-immigration sentiment, and it’s impossible to know how many heathens hold such sympathies. Officially, Forn Sedis openly antiracist, and NACexpelled one of its leadersin 2017 for allegedly making racist remarks. While reconnecting with lost traditions and ancestral heritage is a core tenet, both groups strongly emphasise respect for the natural world. Nordic animism, in which nature is revered as sacred,has emerged as a significant new theologywithin the heathen community. Perhaps this ecological interpretation of Norse culture is a response to the current climate crisis, the effects of which –forest fires,water shortagesandfloods– are becoming increasingly noticeable, even in the north. Restoring a half-extinct religion could offer a way to cope with climate anxiety, and the fear that your way of life may soon be history, too.Is Norse paganism here to stay? In Iceland,it’s become the second-most practised religionafter Christianity, with 7,000 active members in a country of 389,000 people. Their temple in Reykjavik isset to open in 2026. In Denmark, where the movement claims to haveover 3,500believers, a pagan burial groundopened in 2009. Looking at Google Maps,it’s still standing. Thirteen heathens have been laid to rest there as of 2025, according to an email from the local municipality.Though it’s easy to dismiss this new wave of Viking heathens as silly, we’re all guilty of obsessing about the past. Nostalgia runs through contemporary culture, whether it’s a fashion revival from the 2000s, sounds from the 70s, trad wives from the 50s, or pre-industrial homesteading. The pagans may look that little bit more extreme, with their rune-inscribed arms and braided beards, but their longing for permanence in an unstable world is not so different from our own.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alcohol units: 0, cigarettes: 0, calories: 0, weight: 31 stone – and, according to the actor Sally Phillips, “no intention of losing any of it”.Phillips was in Leicester Square on Monday morning to unveil a life-size bronze of the comedy character, alongside Helen Fielding – who first cooked her up in a newspaper column 30 years ago, and whose novels have now been translated into more than 40 languages – andRenée Zellweger, star of the four Bridget Jones films (with a combined box office of $900m (£683m)).The statue joins the likes of Paddington, Harry Potter and Charlie Chaplin as part of Westminster council’s Scenes in the Square scheme to further cement the location’s credentials as a cinema hub. It is home to four multiplexes and the setting of most of London’s red-carpet premieres.A pink carpet was laid in honour of bronze Bridget, who had been planted in a bed of plastic fuchsia flowers and draped with a purple silk sheet that required considerable tugging when time came for the big reveal – an on-brand snag for a character famed for her bumbling news reports.View image in fullscreenBefore the reveal … Sally Phillips, Renée Zellweger and Helen Fielding.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images“It seems really cute,” was Zellweger’s verdict. “I mean, it’s really so weird, but it’s really cute.” Seeing herself immortalised in this way was “not something you expect to happen”, she said, especially while alive. Her ambitions when making the first film 24 years ago had been more modest: “I was just hoping I wouldn’t get fired.”That the statue clutches stationery rather than her traditional accoutrements of cigarette and chardonnay was “fine”, said Phillips. “She’s not very drunk in the fourth film. She works without wine because the fuck-ups are not just alcohol related.”But while the statue’s slimline figure also seemed inspired by the most recent film – in which a widowed Bridget no longer binges on vodka and ice-cream but juggles single motherhood and two new suitors – her wardrobe hails from an earlier age. “She’s Mad About the Boy-era weight with Bridget Jones’s Diary-era clothes,” said Phillips carefully. “Very, very strongly put,” nodded Fielding.Also not on display were Bridget’s famed “mummy knickers” to smooth her silhouette – unnecessary, said a representative from the 3D Eye studio responsible for the artwork, as “sculpting in clay probably works in a similar way to sculpting pants”.“Her stomach is as flat as a pancake,” said Fielding, impressed, although she did later concede there seemed to be “a little bit sort of hanging over” the beltline – an effect enhanced by the artistic decision to leave her three bottom buttons undone and the cardigan apparently parted to reveal a triangle of torso.View image in fullscreen‘No mummy knickers’ … Bridget Jones statue, Leicester Square, London.Photograph: Alan West/Hogan Media/ShutterstockMight fans be tempted to rub her tummy for luck? “How sweet is that,” said Zellweger of the idea. “I never imagined it. I love it so much! Maybe we should all go rub her belly?” And her feelings on the exposed midriff? “Well, it’s very real.”Also in attendance was Eric Fellner, co-chair of Working Title, the production company behind the movies. “Portraiture is difficult enough,” he said. “But doing it in 3D is even more challenging. They’ve got the attitude nicely, which is what’s most important.”Fielding said that while sculptures are not what she seeks out first on her travels – “that’s bars” – she did take some statue selfies with Jilly Cooper in September, when both novelists were at Chatsworth for an event hosted by Queen Camilla.“We walked around all the statues deciding whether we liked the naked men or the dogs best. Jilly liked the dogs and I preferred the men. But we liked both of them really.”Fielding said she hoped people might bring packets of chocolate and Silk Cut to lie at Bridget’s feet in pilgrimage, echoing the scene in her novel in which her heroine lays flowers at the gates to Kensington Palace after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.The popularity of her character, she said, was down to “the gap between how we all feel we’re expected to be and how we actually are. Bridget doesn’t have a superpower. She can’t fly like Mary Poppins. She can’t do wizardry. She’s certainly not a bear.View image in fullscreenSally Phillips unveils the statue.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images“But those very British qualities of kindness, support for your friends, of community, and the ability to laugh at all your imperfections – the perfection of imperfection – makes her relatable to people.”Her continued appeal, especially with people who weren’t born when she first appeared, Fielding credited to an escalating crisis of confidence among the young. “When I first wrote Bridget, we were just being hit by mass media Photoshopping magazines: really skinny 90s girls in adverts. But Gen Z have got it a hundred-thousand times worse because they’re not just seeing that at a distance. They’re seeing their friends filtered. There’s this massive culture of presenting a fake version of your life.“But they also feel guilty about worrying about their bodies because of body positivity. So imagine being Bridget and feeling bad about your bodyandfeeling bad about feeling bad.”At a literary festival in Magaluf recently, an influencer told Fielding that “Bridget helped her not feel weird and bad or guilty about herself. In Japan, these tiny beautiful women come up and say they identify with her. A lot of different people feel that she comforts them just by being human.”The fourth film in the series was released in February; its stars, Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor, as well as director Michael Morris, were also present at the unveiling, where Morris said he hoped a fifth film might follow.View image in fullscreen‘I think we know it’s not Nelson’s column’ … (from left) Leo Woodall, Renée Zellweger and Chiwetel Ejiofor at the unveiling of the Bridget Jones bronze.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy took £46m in the UK and remains the second highest-grossing film of the year, but went straight to streaming in the US – to Morris and Fellner’s disappointment. “It’s deemed that, in America, anything that isn’t a big cinematic event ends up on streaming,” said Fellner. “We disagree and think that good stories really work in a communal shared experience.”Fellner was keen to flag comparisons between Fielding and another female author whose most famous creation is immortalised in Leicester Square: JK Rowling.“Creativity from one individual can become this massive thing on a global scale,” he said. “Politicians like to look at industry as hard things but creativity is an industry in its own right, and you need to get more young people from all walks of life able to come up with ideas like Joanne [Rowling] and Helen. The more intellectual property that’s created the better it is for this country.”Fielding said she expected Keir Starmer would take a keen interest in the morning’s events, given that he is often taken to be the inspiration for dashing and morally unimpeachable human rights lawyer Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth). “I’m sure his attention will be focused on this matter,” she said, adding her hope that the prime minister would be reminded to “take the arts seriously and invest in it”.She also urged that funding overall be fairly distributed, rather than concentrated in the capital. “I’m from Leeds,” she said. “And all the humour in Bridget is based on northern comedy; on the joke of bringing fancy things down to earth. There’s so much creative talent and humour up north, but honestly, if I speak at the Yorkshire Children’s Charity or something, I’m shocked.”View image in fullscreenRenée Zellweger and Helen Fielding.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesBig knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreFielding likened present-day northern England to the environments she’d witnessed working for Comic Relief 40 years ago, “I feel like I’m back in east Africa in the 80s: kids with no shoes, families without food. The north-south divide in Britain is much bigger than in most westernised countries.”In Leicester Square, the crowds began to disperse, the pink carpet appeared a touch more muddy, and the sight of a small metal woman with a winsome face and uncertain buttoning began to feel like more of a fixture.“I think we know it’s not Nelson’s column,” said Fielding. “It may not be there in three centuries. But nevertheless it is quite a lovely thing that Bridget means something in this country.”Explore more on these topicsFilmBridget Jones' DiaryBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyBridget Jones: the Edge of ReasonHelen FieldingRenée ZellwegerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its premise: what would the legend of Oz look like, told from the perspective of someone other than that cute but dozy blow-in, Dorothy? The wicked witch, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), is entirely green, and has therefore been ostracised since childhood. Glinda (Ariana Grande), the good witch, is everybody’s princess but, after a time, the two become best friends. I’ll skirt over how the Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow come about, suffice to say that, in the film at least, their backstories make perfect and resonant sense (except for the Lion, but never mind). The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) is not a good guy – but is he a bad guy? The morals swirl, in an expertly handled way.The first film left us at the point of discovery that Oz, far from being a magic paradise, was actually built on foundations of discrimination, oppression, enslavement and mendacity – or, if you like things simple, fascism. The fact that the slave-caste is the animal kingdom rather than a human out-group doesn’t make this opulent fantasia feel any less pointedly topical. “Any timeless story feels timely,” director Jon M Chu says, “because it’s about the human condition. When people become too powerful, what happens to the powerless? That cycle, unfortunately, challenges us every few generations, and maybe this is our moment. We’re the adults in the room now.”I got to do the most American job of all – I’m proof the American dream is realYes, definitely – adults whose hearts lift at the sight of pink and green; who would follow Ariana Grande off a cliff in a synchronised, Busby Berkeley formation; who still break into Defying Gravity whenever they happen to pass Erivo’s secondary school in Streatham, London. The first film was enchanting, the second (calledWicked: For Good) is surprisingly moving. They weigh in, between them, at over five hours. “I just knew it had enough meat in it,” Chu says, nonchalantly.View image in fullscreen‘She wasn’t the pop star’ … Grande as Glinda with Jonathan Bailey as Prince Fiyero.Photograph: Universal Studios/PAI went in swinging to this conversation with Chu. It was the Corinthia hotel in London’s Whitehall, on Remembrance Sunday, pomp and pageantry everywhere outside, Chu exuding an air of calm mischief inside. I’ve never seen anyone convey a more rebellious spirit encased in such neat tailoring. I wasn’t swinging at him personally – he’s immensely accomplished, best known for Crazy Rich Asians, though prior to Wicked, the film I couldn’t recommend highly enough would have been his adaptation for screen ofIn the Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the Hispanic community in New York.No, I was gunning for the stage version ofWicked, which was first performed in San Francisco in 2003 – that’s when Chu saw it, with his mum, before it ever got to Broadway. His parents “came to the United States with nothing except for the dream”. His mother was born in Taiwan, his father was born in China. “They started a restaurant, and it’s still there to this day, 55 years later. And I got to do the most American job of all, telling stories in movies, and not just movies, movie musicals. I am proof that the dream is real.” He was still a student and his professors at USC School of Cinematic Arts were telling him: “Don’t write a movie musical, the form is dead.”I’d been making movies for 10 years and it felt great. I didn’t have to answer to anybody. Then I had childrenThe thing is, the films are so superior to the stage musical that I can’t even see how they were inspired by it. It’d be like going to Zippos Circus and getting inspired to makeThe Greatest Showman. The orchestration is better, the dialogue is wittier, the pace and the plotting and the characters andeverythingis just a different order of magnitude. “It’s a different thing,” Chu says, diplomatically. “Glinda comes in, and she’s winking at the audience, whose perspective is, ‘Prove to me I should believe in this stuff.’ It’s a very different perspective than in a movie, where the green girl drops into this crazy world, thinking, ‘Where the hell did I just land?’ And she’s us.”Erivo and Grande seem like the obvious choices for the leads, maybe because they’ve had such a public passion for one another – an undisclosed number of matching tattoos, for instance – or maybe because they both have such striking voices. Their vocals were not pre-recorded for either film, which is particularly impressive given how much time they spend flying. When casting the roles, Chu says cheerfully: “We could have got any singers we wanted, really.” Grande and Erivo had something different, “the connective tissue to a truth”.View image in fullscreen‘The camera loves their energy’ … on set with Erivo and Grande.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHe’d originally thought Erivo wouldn’t be interested because she was too edgy, and Grande wouldn’t be right because she was too global. “But when she came in, she wasn’t the pop star Ari, she was Glinda. She was from another planet. I called her in four or five times, I kept thinking, I call bullshit, let’s see her again. And it was just undeniable. Something about the way she sang it, because she’s been through many tragedies recently, I felt she was singing about me.” (This isn’t showbiz hyperbole: Grande has had an appalling run of life events, including theaccidental overdose of her ex, Mac Miller, in 2018, and the Manchester Arena bombing the previous year).“Same with Cynthia,” Chu continues. “I felt like she was singing about me, dreaming about being a director in my dorm room. We were waiting for these two women.” It was quite lucky how much they loved each other, right? “I thought, even if they hate each other, the camera loves their energy.”From the start of the first movie, there’s this green-phobia as everyday racism, Elphaba sullen and oppressed, Glinda perky with white body supremacy. All that is quite familiar, Disney-ish territory (think Zombies, Descendants); everyone gets to know one another and, after that, they’re nice. But there’s a seam of segregation and oppression that defines the second film, and which has been an ongoing theme of Chu’s film-making. Before he had kids – his first (of five), Willow, with his wife, graphic designer Kristin Hodge, was born in 2017 – “I’d been making movies for 10 years, and it felt great. I didn’t have to answer to anybody. And then I had children, and I want them to live in a world where they’re proud of who they are. So I had to go chase Crazy Rich Asians and In the Heights.”In a deceptively fun way – Crazy Rich Asians was the highest grossing romcom of the 2010s – both films tell a complicated, uncliched story about multiculturalism. “Melting pot is way more difficult than a word,” Chu says. “Melting is not fun. I got to be born in a melting pot, and feel the swirl and actually not even realise that I was melting until much later in my life. And maybe it’s not melting at all. Maybe it’s a soup in which we’re all still our own selves, in the same bowl. Not becoming one thing, but at the same time, knowing that coming together is part of the dream.”View image in fullscreen‘I had to chase this story’ … Chu’s hit 2018 comedy Crazy Rich Asians.Photograph: Sanja Bucko/PR Company HandoutYou can very much imagine Chu pitching this epic for the first time, and see exactly why it got green-lit, right at the start of Covid. “Everything was changing around us. Our childhood stories, the possibilities of our childhood, no longer felt like they were guaranteed. Everything was resetting. We felt like strangers in our own homes.”Another sense in whichWicked: For Goodlands at a precisely relevant moment, is that we talk about and experience AI so much, we can’t tell what’s real. “Generative AI was not used on this movie,” Chu says, with some pride. “If you see the camera shake, if you see a dancer and they’re not quite on time, that’s because humans made this. The string that plays just a little bit off-tempo, the wrinkle in her nose, that’s because it’s human-made. The world is part of the message.”Chu considers himself “on the frontlines, telling one of the biggest stories” in the face of “political upheaval, social upheaval, cultural identity crises all around us”. And if you’re wondering how that stacks up, with a movie-musical about witches, all I can say is you should go and see it. It has a profound sense of purpose.“Movies are one of the few protected spaces,” he says. “You have to put your phone aside, you sit with friends and strangers, you pay attention for two hours and you see the world through someone else’s eyes. I don’t even spend that much time listening to my loved ones. I feel a grand responsibility – if people are giving me this time, coming into this bubble, I have to use it, to say, ‘Do you see what’s happening on the outside?’”Wicked: For Good is out on 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodWickedAriana GrandeCynthia ErivoJeff GoldblumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was giggling away, saying, “You English guys are crazy!”’Interviews byMichael HoganMon 17 Nov 2025 10.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 13.02 ESTShareTrevor Robinson, art directorMy creative partner Al Young and I had been on the dole for 18 months when we landed our dream jobs at Howell Henry ad agency. We had to prove ourselves fast. Tango’s brief was basically to get talked about. They told us: “We want Coca-Cola to be afraid of this little British brand.” The campaign was based around the hit of real fruit. We decided to escalate that concept, making the hit a physical thing.Most ads were cause and effect – consume the product and something pleasant happens. We flipped that, so something unpleasant happens in a farcical way. It was almost anti-advertising. I loved Charlie Chaplin kicking people up the bum, then running off. A boot up the backside was deemed too aggressive but we figured we’d get away with a Morecambe and Wise-style slap. We shot tests with a camcorder but the slap didn’t look big enough. We ended up putting our arms straight out to the sides, pause, then “whack!”.When the ad got pulled, we redid it with a kiss instead of a slapAt first, it was just a big guy. Al said: “Let’s make him orange, so he’s more a manifestation of the drink.” He became this shirtless orange genie. We auditioned loads of actors. Peter Geeves, who got the job, was a proper thespian. He had this funny way of running with his tummy thrust forward and head back, which clinched it. When the ad got pulled by the agency, we got him to redo it with a kiss instead of a slap and Peter told us: “I can’t get parts any more. Everybody just sees me as this fat orange bloke.”Gil Scott-Herondid the closing voiceover. I was terrified – asking one of my heroes to say, “You know when you’ve been Tango’d” at the end of our silly ad. But Gil was giggling away, saying, “You English guys are crazy!”After filming, we were bouncing around like excited toddlers. Whenever we showed the ad to people, it got a reaction of: “What the hell was that?” We knew it was going to be either loved or hated and, if the latter, we’d probably be back on the dole. An industry figure called it “oik advertising”. We were working-class kids trying to make a noise.I knew it was a winner when I fell asleep on the tube one night and woke up to hear these guys mimicking the ad. I wanted to shout: “I did that!” I was in a cinema when it came on and the whole audience roared with laughter. It was the best feeling. Then we started hearing about copycat slappings, which we hadn’t seen coming, and doctors complained about patients having perforated eardrums from being Tango’d. We were gutted but our bosses were cool. They said: “It’s out there now. Everybody’s talking about it.” To an extent, our job was done, which enabled us to do all the sequels.It boosted Tango sales by 35%. They changed the branding to a black can off the back of the commercials. It’s amazing how far it spread, taking on a life of its own. You’d see fans dressed as the Tango man at football matches, painted orange with their tops off, which was quite disturbing. People still come up and tell me they got a perforated eardrum because of me. The slogan resonates to this day. I’ve seen headlines about Donald Trump’s tan, saying: “He’s been Tango’d.”Hugh Dennis, voice actorI was doing voices for Spitting Image when my agent called about a new Tango ad. They needed two sports-style pundits to describe this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it surreal moment. Ex-footballer Ray Wilkins – a lovely bloke, sadly no longer with us – was laid-back and laconic, so they wanted someone excitable as contrast. I came up with this extreme geordie commentator. A cross between Sid Waddell off the darts and Eddie Waring from rugby league. I think they had actually tried Sid Waddell himself but he wasn’t Sid Waddell-ish enough.I absolutely loved doing it – they were groundbreaking ads. The slap caused problems in school playgrounds. I thought: “Oh my god, I’m partly responsible for all these ear injuries.” But there’s always a dangerous playground craze. It was clackers in my day.An orange fella in a nappy going up to someone and slapping them around the face? You wouldn’t get away with it nowThe campaign ran for four years in the 90s, then was brought back in the 00s. Every six months, I’d go to a studio, chat about football with Ray, then launch into this ludicrous voice: “Wey-aye, Tony, I think we’ve got another one here!” It was huge fun but kind of exhausting. There were a limited number of takes I could do because it stretched my voice. I couldn’t do anything else for two hours afterwards because I’d screamed myself hoarse.Knowing the adverts were popular made it all the more enjoyable. People were waiting for the next one, which rarely happens. Oddly enough, I had also seen this from the other side. After university, I worked for Unilever and became brand manager of Lynx deodorant. So I could view it from a marketing perspective, going: “I wish I’d thought of this.”Because the campaign ran for ages, it brought in regular money. I didn’t buy a private island but I did OK. It was very much of its time. An orange fella in a giant nappy going up to someone in the street and slapping them around the face? You wouldn’t get away with it now – but it’s lovely to be part of such a cult classic. Most people don’t realise it was me. I’m currently inThe Importance of Being Earnestin the West End with quite a young cast. When I mentioned doing the Tango voiceover, they went: “Wait, what? That was you? A middle-aged man who’s playing a vicar in Earnest?” But they absolutely all remember it.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The film version is a tear-jerking joyMichael BillingtonMon 17 Nov 2025 10.29 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 12.29 ESTShareIhave made enough mistakes as a critic to feel mildly chuffed when a verdict is vindicated. In 1981 I wrote excitedly about a newStephen Sondheimmusical, Merrily We Roll Along, that I had seen in preview in New York; reviled by reviewers and shunned by the public, it then closed two weeks after opening. In 2023-24 the very same musical ran for a year on Broadway, won four Tony awards and was hailed by the critics. Fortunately a live performance of that Maria Friedman production was filmed and I would urge you to catch it when it’s released in cinemas next month.I say “the very same musical” but that is not strictly accurate. Based on a 1934 play by George S Kaufman and Moss Hart, it is still the same story, told in reverse chronological order, of dissolving relationships: a success-worshipping composer and movie producer, Franklin Shepard, looks back over his life and sees how time has eroded both his creative partnership with a dramatist, Charley, and their mutual friendship with a novelist, Mary.But, after the show flopped in 1981, Sondheim and the writer of the book, George Furth, made various structural changes. It no longer opens with a student song written by Franklin but with a gaudy party celebrating his latest movie success. The approach to casting has also changed. The 1981 cast was made up of fresh-faced performers who started by simulating middle age and eased naturally into youth as the evening progressed. Now it is standard practice to cast mature actors as in the Friedman production where Jonathan Groff,Daniel Radcliffeand Lindsay Mendez straddle the years with minimal adjustments.I should come clean and admit that I was moist-eyed for much of the Friedman film: my tears were prompted partly by the emotional heft of the story and partly by my pleasure in the music. The virtue of the narrative is that it will have different resonances for each individual. As inPinter’s Betrayal, which also uses reverse chronology, it shows how life inevitably involves compromises, adjustments and a sense of loss. Not many of us, like Franklin, go from being songwriting tyros to showbiz sell-outs but we can all understand how the idealistic optimism of youth gets tarnished by time. Some may find a more sexual meaning to the story. Scott F Stoddart in an essay on Queer Sondheim sees a homoerotic element to Franklin and Charley’s friendship symbolised by what he calls the latter’s manic meltdown in a number, Franklin Shepard Inc, where he bewails being deserted by his creative partner.If we each find what we want in the story we can all agree on the skill with which it is told. In his book,Finishing the Hat, Sondheim explains the techniques he uses. He points out that in most musicals you get a song followed later by the reprise. Because of the unusual structure of Merrily, the reprise comes first. He cites the example of Not a Day Goes By where Franklin’s estranged wife, Beth, initially sings “But you’re still part of my life / And you won’t go away” with a controlled fury. When we hear the song a second time it is actually a celebration of Beth and Franklin’s marriage as well as of Mary’s unarticulated love for him. The words are much the same but acquire new meaning because of the dramatic context.View image in fullscreenJenna Russell, Damian Humbley and Mark Umbers in Merrily We Roll Along at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, directed by Maria Friedman in 2013.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThis is a show where Sondheim also subtly takes revenge on his critics. There is a lovely moment when aBroadwayproducer lectures the young Franklin and Charley on the need to provide hummable melodies in musicals, adding: “I’ll let you know when Stravinsky has a hit.” The ultimate irony is that Merrily We Roll Along itself is full of treasurable tunes, such as Old Friends, Good Thing Going and the title number that for me have been earworms for more than 40 years. I am always astonished by the accusation that Sondheim is a great lyricist but a deficient tunesmith for, although his songs always derive from a specific dramatic situation, they lodge permanently in the memory.If there is a just charge against Merrily, it is that its hero, Franklin, is unsympathetic. But in this version Groff intelligently plays him not as an egomaniac monster but a tragic innocent who sails through life always taking the easy option. Mendez captures perfectly Mary’s unfulfilled romantic longings but the most eye-catching performance comes from Radcliffe, who lends Charley both an angsty neurosis and a passionate belief in the power of art to improve lives.Whether Merrily itself does that is up to you to decide. But Friedman’s production, closely based on the one she didat the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2012, is a constant joy and one that shows exactly why a famous flop is now a palpable hit.Merrily We Roll Along is in cinemas from 4 DecemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreStephen SondheimBroadwayWest EndDaniel RadcliffeMenier Chocolate FactoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a science fiction story, more or less, but also indicative of the sort of writer Rushdie would become: garrulous, playful, energetic. The tale of an immortal Indian who travels to a mysterious island, it’s messy but charming, and the sense of writing as performance is already here. (Rushdie’s first choice of career was acting, and he honed his skill in snappy lines when working in an advertising agency.) Not a great book, but one that shows a great writer finding his voice, and a fascinating beginning to a stellar career.View image in fullscreen9Quichotte (2019)Rushdie’s love for pop culture – he was inspired to write his first story, aged nine, after watching The Wizard of Oz – was never more evident than in this rompy rewrite of Don Quixote that references Back to the Future, Disney’s Pinocchio, Beavis and Butt-Head, Starsky & Hutch and more. The eponymous character is driven mad by watching too much TV – but his story is itself being written by a washed-up spy novelist. In its layers within layers it’s as hyperactive as Grimus,but a bit more controlled. And even if Rushdie in this book is half-charming raconteur, half pub-bore, the energy will keep you bouncing merrily along.View image in fullscreen8The Moor’s Last Sigh (1995)Rushdie’s first novel for adults after The Satanic Verses prompted the supreme leader of Iran to issue a fatwa against him in 1989 was a dam bursting open to release all the pent-up ideas, characters and jokes of the previous six years. It’s the story of “Moor” Zogoiby, the ousted heir to a crooked spice dynasty and the youngest of four siblings: “Ina, Minnie, Mynah, Moor”. You can infer references to Rushdie’s ordeal (“Here I stand. Couldn’t’ve done it differently”), but mostly this is supreme, nutritious entertainment. It was shortlisted for the Booker prize and, because of Rushdie’s security needs, this meant –according to that year’s winner, Pat Barker– “lots of men with bulging armpits standing round”.View image in fullscreen7Shame (1983)Coming soon after his great epic Midnight’s Children, Shame is overshadowed but one of Rushdie’s best. It’s shorter, tighter and somewhat darker than its predecessor. Set in “not quite Pakistan”, it delivers a satire of the country that is both over the top and deadly serious. Here, a diet of “honour” above all else leads to brutal killings, – “Shame is like everything else: live with it long enough and it becomes part of the furniture” – but there is typically glorious comedy too. Shame won a major prize in Iran for best translated novel of the year – so Rushdie had no inkling of the way the country’s leadership would respond to his next novel: The Satanic Verses.View image in fullscreen6Knife (2024)Rushdie’s second memoir is about his attempted murder on stage in New York in 2022. “So it’s you,” he recalls thinking as a man in black rushed towards him. “Here you are.” Knife offers a sometimes gruelling account of his recovery – his wife wouldn’t let him look in the mirror, in case realising how serious his injuries were sapped his spirit – but it’s also peppered with Rushdie’s usual humour. Losing four stone, he “no longer had to worry about being overweight”. It also displays a rare softness, with beautiful praise for his wife, his late friend Martin Amis and others. It’s a book where “hatred is answered, and finally overcome, by love”.View image in fullscreen5Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990)Rushdie was ready to give up writing after The Satanic Verses, but “the thing that saved me as a writer was having promised my son a book”. Haroun, then, is a story for children and adults that distils Rushdie’s greatest qualities – storytelling, comedy, imagination – into a fable about a storyteller doomed to silence. It’s a good entry point for those in what Rushdie calls his “page 15 club of readers” – people who can’t get through his sometimes dense prose. And it’s not hard to see his own experiences in the book: “Stories are fun,” says hero Haroun; “Stories make trouble,” insists the despotic dictator Khattam-Shud. With a joyous blend of wordplay, fantasy and “P2C2Es” (Processes too Complicated to Explain), Haroun is Rushdie’s lightest, brightest achievement.View image in fullscreen4Shalimar the Clown (2005)Rushdie’s best novel of the 21st century is about the murder of an American ambassador to India by a Kashmiri named Shalimar the Clown. It’s a book about “the crimes of the 14th century [being] avenged in the 20th” and the horrors of political violence: “It all made the new, senseless kind of sense.” Addressing Rushdie’s perennial theme of worlds in collision, it also becomes a page-turning thriller and a powerfully moving tragedy. Even Rushdie was overwhelmed, occasionally crying as he wrote. “What am I doing?” he asked himself. “This is somebody I’ve made up.” That, of course, is the power of great writing.View image in fullscreen3Joseph Anton (2012)Rushdie’s memoir of his time under the Ayatollah’s death threat gives a powerful report on the anguish he and his family felt. More surprisingly, it is a comic masterpiece. Rushdie, writing in the third person, drops names shamelessly, whether biting back at Roald Dahl, who had criticised Rushdie during the fatwa affair (Dahl was “a long, unpleasant man with huge strangler’s hands”); or revealing how not to tell Bernardo Bertolucci you hate his new film (“he put his hand on his heart and said, ‘Bernardo … I can’t talk about it’”); or sharing perhaps the greatest suffering during his time undercover: having Harold Pinter fax him his terrible poems.View image in fullscreen2The Satanic Verses (1988)The extra-literary reaction to this book has blotted out its brilliance as a novel. In helter-skelter style, The Satanic Verses opens with two actors, Gibreel and Saladin, falling through the air over England after their plane is blown up by Sikh terrorists. “What an entrance, yaar. I swear: splat.” But they survive, each undergoing a metamorphosis – Gibreel becomes an angel, Saladin grows devil’s horns – and this is just the first act of their troubles. Especially evergreen is the book’s take on the immigrant experience in Britain, and how the demonisation of others leads in only one direction. It is a model for the freedom for literature to say whatever it wants to, as loud as it can.View image in fullscreen1Midnight’s Children (1981)After Grimus took a “critical beating”, Rushdie knew he had to pull out all the stops with his second novel. His peers – Amis, Ian McEwan – were outpacing him. He created the story of Saleem Sinai, born on the moment of Indian independence from British rule, which makes a virtue of its eclectic style drawing on multiple cultures. It creates a flood of language teeming “fastfast” down the page and pulling the reader helplessly along. Midnight’s Children won not only theBooker prizein 1981 but also the Booker of Bookers in 1993, and the Best of the Booker in 2008. It is not only an incredible achievement on its own terms: it opened a door to the next generation of writers. It was, in the words of Anita Desai, “the voice of a new age”. It is a book with room for everything and everyone.To browse all titles by Salman Rushdie, visit theguardianbookshop.com.

Take his recent projects: insurreal BBC sitcom Juice, Tovey plays Guy, a buttoned-up therapist with a seemingly perfect life, hobbled by an aversion to recklessness. Then there’s the closeted Andrew Waters in award-winningAmerican indie film Plainclothes, a well-respected married man of faith who secretly cruises New York shopping mall toilets. Even in the forthcomingDoctor Who spin-off, The War Between the Land and the Sea, Tovey’s character, Barclay, is an ordinary office clerk who is swept up into a planet-saving mission while trying to keep his family from falling apart. In each performance, Tovey anchors his characters with a beguiling mix of strength, empathy and vulnerability.In interviews, the immaculately put together Tovey, 44, often seems similarly well-adjusted, speaking eloquently about his acting,his passion for art(he co-hosts the successful podcast Talk Art and has co-written three books on the subject) and his advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. Flaws, if there are any, are carefully stage-managed.So it’s mildly exciting to hear that ahead of our meeting in a central London restaurant, sequestered away in a maze-like confluence of newly constructed buildings, Tovey is apparently completely lost. A small dent in the armour, perhaps? While his PR goes outside to call him, I make a note of this slip-up in my phone. Minutes later, Tovey appears, smart-casual in a navy jumper, light blue shirt and intriguingly patterned trousers. His salt and pepper hair is cropped short and his matching facial topiary has been trimmed into a rakish goatee.View image in fullscreenTovey in Doctor Who spin-off The War Between The Land And The Sea.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Alistair Heap“I wasn’t lost,” he says, reading my phone – which is, to my horror, open right in front of him. The sprawling venue, he explains, has two entrances. Ah. I start amending the note. “No, it’s fine, you can say I was lost if you want to.”Today, Tovey is tired. His 13-year-old French bulldog, Rocky, woke him at 4.30am. “He had a seizure,” Tovey says, matter-of-factly. “He’s fine,” he adds, dampening my concern, before listing Rocky’s other maladies: “He’s completely deaf now. He’s got one eye. He’s in a [dog] pushchair. He has a little diaper.” Until recently, Rocky was part of a family unit that included Tovey’s fiance, Steve Brockman, one to which Tovey had saidhe was keen to add a child. The pair split in 2023. A baby, he says, is still an option “at some point. It’s just me and Rocky at the moment.”Rocky has witnessed his owner’s career go stratospheric here in the UK and in the US. In 2022, Tovey landed a lead role in Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story: NYC, before being cast by Murphy again in last year’s campyFeud: Capote vs the Swans. Earlier this year, Tovey played Brian Paddick, the former deputy assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan police, in the critically acclaimed dramaSuspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, which laid out the police blunders that led to the killing of the innocent Brazilian in a London tube station.View image in fullscreenWith Mawaan Rizwan in BBC sitcom Juice.Photograph: Liam Daniel/BBC/Various Artists Limited“I think I read somewhere that the best way of mastering a career is big, small, small,” Tovey says. “So you go big, punchy, and then you do these smaller, quieter things. You do films, and then you do something else, and it’s about that balance.”Early in his career, which was kickstarted in 2004 playing Rudge in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys at the National Theatre, alongside James Corden and Dominic Cooper, Tovey was less selective. “When you’re a younger actor, you sort of go, ‘What am I doing next? Am I doing that? I’m doing that!’”What he was very clear about, however, was being visible as a gay man. He talked openly about his shame while growing up under section 28 (the Margaret Thatcher-era law that prohibited the “promotion of homosexuality”), and playing gay characters in shows such as HBO’s Looking and on stage in Angels in America. It’s why he’s so proud of Plainclothes, a film set in 1990s upstate New York at a time of undercover police entrapment of gay men.Tovey is keen to point out the film’s relevance to 2025; shortly after its New York premiere a story emerged about US police using an app tocatch men at Penn Station bathrooms. “Two hundred men have been arrested,” Tovey says, “and a proportion of those have been sent straight to ICE facilities with no trial. So something that felt like a historical document was suddenly highly contemporary, which was just bizarre. What this film is doing is humanising what people are trying to demonise, and that feels important.”View image in fullscreenWith Tom Blyth in Plainclothes (2025), directed by Carmen Emmi.Photograph: Courtesy of CurzonWe talk about Plainclothes’s sweaty, car-based sex scene, which caused an online kerfuffle after Tovey was interviewed about it by his friend, Pedro Pascal (“Russell Tovey and Pedro Pascal agree that being ‘vers is the best’,”read one headline]). In the scene, the older, more experienced Andrew and younger police officer Lucas (played by Tom Blyth) ignore the binary of top and bottom and take on both roles. Tovey resists attempts to discuss online discourse around gay actors and the danger of them becoming neutered by endless memes and online infantilising (see the reaction to Jonathan Bailey in Jurassic World: Rebirth and the focus on his“whimsical” and “boyish”specs, quickly dubbed “slutty little glasses” by the internet). He is much more interested in the work.“The scene was so important to me because you’ve got power dynamics,” he says. “I was adamant that this had to be a wholesome interaction, it had to be safe sex, you have to see condoms – you know, it was 97. I said I want Lucas to go away from this interaction not feeling fucked up, not feeling damaged.”In the film, Andrew is clear with the closeted Lucas that the sex is a one-off. “They’ve got this intense connection and it’s like an all-you-can-eat buffet,” Tovey says. “You go: I’ve got to pile my plate up with everything because they’re closing in 20 minutes.” Like the Harvester salad cart, I say. “Exactly! When you’d just get all the bacon bits back in the day, lettuce, blue cheese dressing, and you’re shovelling it on before they start wheeling everything away.”Tovey clearly takes his responsibility as a visible gay man seriously. A few days before we meet, he accepted theman of the yeargong at the annual Attitude awards, and gave a rousing acceptance speech that touched on transphobia within the LGBTQ+ community and the rise of Reform. “As a community, we really attack our own,” he says now, “and that’s deeply upsetting because united we stand, divided we fall. We look outside ourselves to go, ‘You need to be doing something,’ when actually within it we’re fractured. And that’s what they want.”He offers an example. Earlier this year, in Los Angeles, Tovey was curating an exhibition by the German photographer Peter Berlin around the same time as Trump’s administrationscratched three characters from the Stonewall monumentin New York. “So it wasn’t celebrating LGBTQ+, it was just celebrating LGB,” Tovey says. Some older gay men, while talking about the queer community at the LA exhibition, parroted the shortened acronym. “I said, ‘Well, hang on a minute, you’ve missed a few letters off there,’” Tovey says. “I just thought how quickly people go: ‘Oh great, so they’ve gone, now it’s us.’” He sighs. “As a community, we have to kick outwards instead of punching inwards.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone should have therapy when they leave school’ … Russell Tovey.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe says the general rise in transphobia, which he sees as the latest iteration of homophobia, is cyclical. “There’s this scapegoating that needs to happen. It feels like it’s the worst time in history for trans people right now.”As for the threat of Reform – and twice-married, now separated Nigel Farage’s attack on the stability of gay marriage (“the most stable relationships tend to be between men and women”,Farage said earlier this year) – Tovey is suitably worried, but his concerns are broader. “I think all communities need to be prepared [for a possible Reform government],” he says. “I hope to God it doesn’t happen.” He has little faith in Labour stopping them and recently joined the Green party. “Their slogan – make hope normal again – is what we need,” he says. “It’s like Harvey Milk saying, ‘You’ve got to give them hope.’ We have to have hope. We’re on this really horrific curve but we will come out the other side eventually. We’ve just got to ride this out.”He’s no politician, but you could imagine Tovey riling up a backbencher on Question Time. “I just care about people and my community,” he says, eschewing the label of role model in favour of “possibility model”, a term coined by Orange Is the New Black actor Laverne Cox. He likens people like Cox to lighthouses: “These beacons, that are shining a light going, ‘This way!’ Things are fucking rocky [so let’s] build more lighthouses and be that fucking light that shines out, so people can find you through this dark, cold water that we’re being plunged into.”View image in fullscreenAs Brian Paddick in Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.Photograph: Stefania Rosini/Disney+Standing out comes with pressure, and there have been slip-ups. A decade ago, Tovey was criticised for perpetuating gay stereotypes after suggesting drama school students “prance around” being “effeminate”.“I don’t feel any pressure on it because I don’t think I’m a horrible person,” he says. “I just try to put out empathy and be as honest and authentic as I can be, and hope that connects.” His roles playing more masculine, straight-passing gay men – in Juice, Looking and the 2016 crime thriller Quantico – are not chosen with any specific intention, he says. “I’m just trying to find the truth of every character. I don’t consider how they present themselves in that capacity.”Growing up in the 1980s, in the era of section 28 and the sex-equals-death rhetoric of the Aids crisis, Tovey was desperate for his own possibility model. As a kid growing up in Billericay, Essex, he covertly read magazines like Attitude – hidden at the time on the newsagents’ top shelves alongside “all the wank mags” – poring over stories that hinted at a queer joy a million miles away from his own shame.Tovey came out at 18 and, like many young gay people, his identity was hurled at him like an insult. He’s ecstatic that a new generation of gay kids, growing up with shows like Heartstopper, with its depiction of young queer love, can at least see there’s hope. “They don’t consider death whenever they meet someone and go to bed with them,” he says. “It just doesn’t enter their mind and that, to me, just seems so healthy. I’ve been so mixed up with it for so long, for so many years.” Did he have therapy? “Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he repeats. “I think everyone should have therapy when they leave school.”His passion for acting emerged after gorging himself on films like The Goonies, Stand By Me and Home Alone one summer at the end of junior school. At a gymnastics class – “I was good at flips and cartwheels” – he happened upon a meet-and-greet with a local young actor starring in Grange Hill. “I could see a conduit to the dream,” he smiles. “So I switched from gymnastics to drama. I’d be at drama club every night, every weekend, going to drama camps. I was obsessed!” From there he got an agent and worked so much it interfered with school. After leaving at 16, he acted in local theatres before being cast in Howard Katz at the National Theatre in London, followed by his star-making turn in The History Boys on stage and in the 2006 film adaptation.View image in fullscreenWith Jamie Parker, Dominic Cooper and Samuel Barnett in The History Boys (2006).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt’s while discussing his early stage roles that Tovey finally reveals the dark truth beneath that put-together, gym-buffed exterior: he’s a massive nerd. All the plays he starred in at the start of his career, he tells me unprovoked, began with the letter H – Henry V, His Dark Materials, His Girl Friday, History Boys – and all the characters he played had names beginning with R. He rattles through it all with an infectious enthusiasm, eyes wide like saucers. “My life changed when I came out, but my life also changed when I came out as a geek and a nerd,” he smiles. “Everything, the whole world, the whole universe, was open to me.” Growing up he collected rocks and minerals, a few fossils. He owned a metal detector. “I was interested in all that, but would I tell anyone? Would I fuck!”He now collects art, and talks enthusiastically about ceramics, rattling off names such as Lucie Rie, Florian Gadsby and Edmund de Waal. Does he make art himself? “I wanted to be Wolfgang Tillmans for a bit, so I bought an SLR camera and started taking pictures of my underwear hanging over a radiator, or socks on the stairs.” The results, he says, were “shit”. But that’s not the point for Tovey, whose default overview leans towards optimism. “That’s the pressure we put on ourselves – like, if I’m not brilliant at this, why am I bothering? But you can do anything you want if you enjoy it. You haven’t got to be great at it.”Tovey, now slumped into the restaurant’s cream banquette, starts to wander back towards his favourite role as dog dad. Rocky is at home with the BBC World Service playing despite him being deaf, blissfully unaware of the world’s various storms. “He’s been my best friend in the world,” Tovey smiles, “and he’s seen me through so much. He’s just been there.” Like Tovey’s own unique lighthouse.The War Between the Land and the Sea will launch on BBC iPlayer and BBC One on 7 December.Explore more on these topicsRussell ToveyThe big interviewLGBTQ+ rightsCeramicsTelevisionDoctor WhoPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Booker winner Flesh ignites debate about state of masculinityToxic male behaviour of David Szalay’s protagonist reflects real-world concerns about a ‘crisis of masculinity’Lanre BakareArts and culture correspondentMon 17 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Nov 2025 05.21 ESTShareIn the immediate aftermath of David Szalay’s book Flesh winning the Booker prize, one feature of the novel stood out: how often the protagonist utters the word “OK”.The500 timesIstván grunts out the response is part of a sparse prose style through which the British-Hungarian Szalay gives the reader few insights into the inner workings of a man whose fortunes rise and fall.But however inarticulate István is, the fact a story about a working-class man from eastern Europe won one of the biggest literary prizes in the world has started a debate aboutmasculinity in literaturein 2025.‘It’s notoriously hard to write about sex’: David Szalay on Flesh, his astounding Booker prize-winnerRead moreGQ implored readers not to reduce the book to “discourse fodder”. But in a year when the idea of literary masculinity – and its apparent scarcity – has featured so prominently, the ascent of Flesh – a story about a taciturn, lustful and at times violent man – was always going to drive debate.Szalay has spoken about the “risky” nature of the novel, not only because of its style but because István as a protagonist exhibits toxic male behaviour. “There’s no longer that sense that boys will be boys,”Szalay saidafter his win. “So I expect the main character in Flesh to draw quite a bit of disapproval.”István goes to a young offender facility because of an act of violence, then joins the army. He works security on the door of a strip club, before becoming a driver and security guard. “These aren’t exclusively male paths,” says the Booker judge and novelist Chris Power. “But they are predominantly male or traditionally male.”This year, some have questioned whether male novelists and male themes are terminally out of fashion. In April, a new imprint, Conduit Books, was founded with the aim of publishing literary fiction and memoirs by men amid “a perception that the male voice is problematic”, according to its founder, Jude Cook.Cook said the publishing landscape had changed as a reaction to the “prevailing toxic male-dominated literary scene of the 80s, 90s and 00s”.TheBooker longlist, which featured six men and seven women, and Szalay’s success offered a firm riposte to that argument. But Flesh’s victory did not just buck an apparent trend in literature, it also seemed to be plugged directly into a live debate about what it means to be a man in 2025.Much of the coverage following the win has placed the novel in a wider context of the “crisis of masculinity”, characterised by the rise of influencers such as Andrew Tate and the debate opened up by Netflix’s incel drama Adolescence.“The idea of a crisis of masculinity in the wider culture with say, suicide rates or younger kids turning to the Andrew Tates of the world, it’s almost colliding with literature,” says Power.The critic and author Leo Robson says: “Maybe it’s easier in an age where there’s been quite a healthy debate about masculinity and male behaviour to champion someone like David Szalay writing about men in like a sceptical inquiring spirit.”A look across the other Booker-shortlisted books by men does reveal some loose connections. Power says the other novels on the list by male writers were loosely tied together by the themes of “infidelity” and men being “led by lust”, which both loom over Flesh.Ben Markovits’The Rest of Our Livesdeals with a mid-life crisis, Benjamin Wood’sSeascraperfollows the “prosaic details of everyday life” for a shrimp fisherman, while Andrew Miller’sThe Land in Winteropens with a young man’s suicide.But Power sees István as primarily a person struggling to come to terms with status anxiety and thefinancial precaritythat many younger people are facing.“I think István is struggling to gain control of his life,” he says. “That speaks to a kind of universal feeling, something that’s obviously very keenly felt by many.”Flesh by David Szalay (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

The star of Top Gun, Jerry Maguire and the Mission: Impossible series was given an honorary Academy Award at the annual Governors awards, which are designed to reward lifetime achievement.In a statement before the event, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) president Janet Yang cited “Cruise’s incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community has inspired us all”. Recalling hisefforts to shoot the seventh Mission: Impossible in 2020, Yang added that Cruise “helped to usher the industry through a challenging time during the Covid-19 pandemic”.Cruise, who was previously nominated for best actorOscarsfor Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire, and best supporting actor for Magnolia, described first falling in love with the medium, saying: “I remember that beam of light just cut across the room. I remember looking up and seeing the image just exploding on the screen, and suddenly the world was so much larger than the one that I knew. Entire cultures, lives, landscapes. It sparked a hunger, a hunger for adventure, a hunger for knowledge, a hunger to understand humanity, to create characters, to tell a story.”Cruise was introduced by Alejandro González Iñárritu, who isworking with the actoron an as yet untitled film due for release in 2026. Saying that “writing a four-minute speech to celebrate Tom Cruise’s 45-year career is what is known in this town as Mission: Impossible”, Iñárritu then described the actor’s work as “meticulously choreographed” but feeling “completely improvised, structured like a clockwork, but flowing like gas”. His onscreen intensity, Iñárritu said, was also present off screen: he once witnessed Cruise downing chilli peppers “like they were popcorn”, while “I, a proud Mexican, was crying with just one bite”.“This may be his first Oscar, but from what I have seen and experienced, it will not be the last,” Iñárritu added. Standing next to Cruise, he said, you “start to wonder if the rest of us belong to a completely different, rapidly decaying species”.View image in fullscreenCruise with Oscar-winning film director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who presented the award.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe Academy also paid tribute to Dolly Parton, awarding an honorary Oscar to “one of the few people that remains in this world that everyone loves”. Parton, who has recently hadhealth concernsthat forced the postponement of a Las Vegas residency, was not able to attend the event – but her friend Lily Tomlin was on hand to celebrate the humanitarian work that earned Parton the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian award.“The soul, the heart of Dolly, it is so good and so true,” Tomlin told an audience of A-listers at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Hollywood. “She has fake nails, fake hair – but she is the most authentic person I have ever known.”Parton – who has previously been nominated for two best song Oscars – launched the Dollywood Foundation in 1988 tosupport educationin her home county in Tennessee. Seven years later, she launched a book donation programme that eventually went international. She has also supported disaster relief efforts, including giving $1m last year to Hurricane Helene recovery, and has helped fund Covid vaccine research.“My mom and dad showed me that the more you give, the more blessings come your way,” Parton said in a prerecorded acceptance speech. “And I’ve been blessed more than I ever dreamed possible.” The award, she said, “makes me want to dream up new ways to help lift people up. And isn’t that what we’re supposed to be here for?” Her message was followed by a powerful rendition of Parton’s song Jolene by the singer Andra Day.The Governors awards are a reception and dinner that act as a kind of curtain-raiser for the Oscars, with many of its attendees among the hopefuls in this year’s race. The mood is typically relaxed and jovial; it probably helps that the ceremony isn’t televised, and is largely confined to entertainment industry insiders – and everyone already knows who will be going home with statuettes. (This year’s honorees were announced in June.) Each of the evening’s recipients received a standing ovation from their peers.Next to be honored was Wynn Thomas, a longtime production designer – in his words, the person who “takes the writer’s words and turns them into concrete images” – whose credits include Do the Right Thing, A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X and Hidden Figures.“Stepping into the world of Wynn Thomas is to find yourself in the hands of an imaginative artist, a meticulous and masterful film-maker, a trailblazer [who has] opened our eyes to new possibilities,” said Octavia Spencer in a speech introducing Thomas – who, she noted, was the first Black production designer to join the art directors guild. His films, she said, “portray a vibrant range of Black life, and that is by no means an accident”. Thomas “hasn’t just changed the way Black lives are shown in movies, he has changed the lives of Black artists in the entire industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the local gangs looked down on me and called me sissy. But that sissy grew up to work with some great directors.”Cynthia Erivo paid tribute to the actor, dancer, choreographer, director and producer Debbie Allen, who has a long list of credits that include Fame, Amistad, the sitcom A Different World, and choreographing many Academy Awards ceremonies. “To know Miss Debbie is to know that she refuses to let dreams fade,” Erivo said. She recounted how an initial rejection from the North Carolina School of the Arts ultimately led to Allen’s five-decade career on screen and behind the scenes.For her part, Allen reflected on the people who helped her along the way, including her parents, “who raised their children believing that we were citizens of the universe and that there were no boundaries, and that anything we could see, we could be”. She added: “Movies helped us see a lot of things. And we were faced with brick walls and glass ceilings and ‘White Only’ signs everywhere. But we grew up believing in ourselves.” The award, Allen said, would be a reminder “not of what I’ve done, but what I get, mean and have to do”.The final words of the night belonged to Cruise. Film, he said, reveals: “our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. No matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh, we feel together, we heal together, and that is the power of cinema. So making films is not what I do; it is who I am.”Explore more on these topicsTom CruiseOscarsAwards and prizesDolly PartonFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wen, 26, has a history of disrupting public events and rushing concert stages.Video footage shows Wen jumping over a barricade at Universal StudiosSingaporeand rushing at Grande on the red carpet on 13 November. Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo immediately stepped in to help protect her and Wen was moved away.The court heard that after after being removed by security staff Wen made a second attempt to jump the barricades, after which security staff stopped him and pinned him down.0:23Moment man charges at Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore – videoWen regularly posts on Instagram as pyjamamann, where he has posted footage of stage invasions including those involving Katy Perry and the Weeknd. The footage of his approach to Grande led to a substantial backlash, with many commenters calling his actions a criminal offence.Grande and co-stars are on a mammoth publicity tour for the Wicked sequel, which is released on 21 November. The review embargo lifts on Tuesday and early reaction has suggested repeat Oscar nominations for the two stars are likely.Red-carpet invasions are increasingly uncommon as security has tightened over recent years. In 2007, podcaster Cielke Sijben handcuffed herself to Hugh Grant at a premiere of his romcom Music and Lyrics. Firefighters later freed the pair.Bradley Cooper was accosted on the red carpet in 2014 by a Ukrainian TV prankster who buried his head in the actor’s trousers, having given Will Smith an unsolicited kiss at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3 in 2012.

People started copying it, like [producer]Seth MacFarlanefor the new Naked Gun. He totally missed it.”He added: “It can look like we’re just throwing stuff up against the wall to see what sticks, but we’re not. There’s thought behind it.”Zucker added that it was pointless to make the movie without Leslie Nielsen, who played Frank Drebin and who died in 2010, saying: “They tried to replace Leslie Nielsen in the new Naked Gun, and you can’t replace him. No one else can do that.”The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreZucker had previously objected to plans to go ahead with a Naked Gun reboot,saying in 2024that he was “not excited about having the franchise given to other people”. Adding: “They have not contacted me to make a cameo or be involved in the writing. Whether or not they’re going to do a good job with it, this kind of spoof, I mean it’s not rocket science, but it’s not easy.”However, after a string ofpositive reviewsand strong box office returns after its release in August, Zucker struck a more conciliatory tone, saying: “I’m excited about it because it just shows that there’s a strong market for comedy in movie theatres, and spoof in particular.”However, Zucker returned to the attack in the new interview, criticising the amount of money involved. “Big budgets and comedy are opposites, and in the new Naked Gun, you could see that they spent a lot of money on scenes full of technical pizzazz while trying to copy our style.”He added: “Everybody’s in it for the money now, and that feels like the only reason why they wanted to do a new Naked Gun.”Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsAirplane!Seth MacFarlaneComedyLiam NeesonnewsShareReuse this content"

But Paul McCartney’s first new recording in five years lacks the sing-along tune and jaunty guitar chops because there’s barely anything there.The former Beatle, arguably Britain’s greatest living songwriter, is releasing a track of an almost completely silent recording studio as part of a music industry protest against copyright theft by artificial intelligence companies.In place of catchy melodies and evocative lyrics there is only quiet hiss and the odd clatter. It suggests that if AI companies unfairly exploit musicians’ intellectual property to train their generative AI models, the creative ecosystem will be wrecked and original music silenced.McCartney, 83 and currently touring North America, has added the track to the B-side of an LP calledIs This What We Want?, which is filled with other silent recordings and will be pressed on vinyl and released later this month.McCartney’s contribution comes as musicians and artists step up their campaign to persuade the UK government to stop technology companies from training AI models on their creative output without approval or paying royalties. Meanwhile, Britain faces anti-regulation pressure from Donald Trump’s White House.The album track listing spells out “the British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies”.Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness behind the protest album, said: “I am very concerned the government is paying more attention to US tech companies’ interests rather than British creatives’ interests.”Other artists already backing the campaign include Sam Fender, Kate Bush, Hans Zimmer and the Pet Shop Boys.McCartney’s new contribution is called (bonus track) and like his best songs, it could be said to have a beginning, a middle and an end. It fades up quickly and begins with 55 seconds of tape hiss before 15 seconds of indeterminate clattering that could be someone opening a door and pacing about, before settling down to another 80 seconds of rustle-punctuated hiss and concluding with a slow and poignant fadeout.McCartney has been among leading voices in British music voicing concern at the ministers’ plans forge a new deal between creatives and AI companies such as Open AI, Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, which demand access to huge volumes of training information including text, images and music.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Ministers face the difficulty of balancing the interests of creative industries, which add £125bn annually to the UK economy, and US tech companies who want light regulation and recently announced more than £30bn in investments, mostly in datacentres.An AI-generated band got 1m plays on Spotify. Now music insiders say listeners should be warnedRead moreA new legal system for AI and copyright is not expected to be debated in parliament before 2026. In the meantime, the government has signed deals with AI companies includingOpen AI,GoogleandAnthropicto boost AI adoption across government and the wider economy.Trump hassaid: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer and film director who campaigns for copyright protection, told the Guardian: “The government is trying to play both sides and convincing neither.”She added: “They have proven themselves unfit to govern in the economic interests of the creators.”A government source said Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, was committed to finding a solution between AI firms and creatives and “recognises both of these sectors are British success stories and she is talking to both sides”.There was concern when Kendall appointed a special adviser in September who had previouslyargued: “Whether or not you philosophically believe the big AI firms should compensate content creators, they in practice will never legally have to.”Responding to McCartney’s intervention, a government spokesperson said it put the interests of the UK’s citizens and businesses first.“We’ve always been clear on the need to work with both the creative industries and AI sector to drive AI innovation and ensure robust protections for creators,” they said.“We are bringing together both British and global companies, alongside voices beyond the AI and creative sectors, to ensure we can capture the broadest possible range of expert views as we consider next steps.”Explore more on these topicsPaul McCartneyArtificial intelligence (AI)Music industryShareReuse this content"

Such a lord of language was he that even the notoriously grudging Vladimir Nabokov afforded him a meed of praise. A reviewer, musing on the disproportion between the style and content of Updike’s fiction, likened him to a lobster with one hugely overgrown claw. It was a comparison Updike was to remember – for all his bland urbanity, on display from start to finish in this mighty volume of his letters, he could be prickly, and did not take slights lightly.As a novelist he aimed, as he once put it, to “give the mundane its beautiful due”. Apart from a few rare and in some cases ill-advised ventures into the exotic – the court at Elsinore, Africa, the future – his abiding subject was the quotidian life of “ordinary” Americans in the decades between the end of the second world war and the coming of a new technological age in the closing years of the 20th century.He was born in 1932 in Pennsylvania, living for 13 years in Shillington before he moved with his parents and grandparents into a farmhouse in a rural redoubt called, aptly, Plowville. He was an only child, and he loved and cared for his father and, in particular, his mother, until the end of their days.Updike senior was a high school maths teacher who, in the Depression years, supplemented the family income by working as a road labourer. The writer’s mother, Linda, was herself a writer, who after years of rejections finally succeeded in publishing a number of stories in the New Yorker, her son’s literary home from home.In 1950 Updike escaped the rustic life when he entered Harvard on a scholarship to study English. At college, he wrote home diligently, addressing long screeds of descriptive prose specifically to his mother – two thousand letters, notes and postcards – and to the “Plowvillians” in general. From the start he was incapable of writing a bad sentence, although the jaunty tone and frequent longueurs of the early letters do test the reader’s patience. All the same, his energy, assiduity and sharpness of eye are remarkable in one so young.Remarkable too are his ambition and application, not to mention brass neck. He was hardly past childhood when he started putting his name about. “At age 13,” James Schiff notes, “Updike began submitting poems, drawings, and other unsolicited pieces to various magazines, including the New Yorker.” Two years later he was recommending a short story by James Thurber to Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine. He also courted cartoonists – he was drawn to graphic art from his earliest days – publishers, newspaper and magazine columnists, the editors of Life magazine, and even the Pentagon. Here was a boy in a hurry.The tone throughout these many hundreds of letters is consistently equable, except on those few occasions when the writer is driven to objection or to self-defence by intrusive, abusive or presumptuous correspondents. There are abiding enmities – the critics Frederick Crews and Alfred Kazin come in for sound kickings, while Gore Vidal is a thorn Updike never managed to extract from his side – but his fondnesses far outnumber his dislikes.Asked by a journalist for her reaction to the book, Updike’s wife said she felt as if she were choking on pubic hairSome readers, no doubt, will long for more frequent and more energetic displays of spleen. In his introduction, Schiff allows, perhaps a shade ill-advisedly, that “There is little tragedy, trauma, or pain in these letters – Updike had a good, accomplished, and satisfying life,” though he hastens to add that “there is drama, along with conflict and problems”.The issue of censorship, however, was extremely problematic in his start-up years as a published writer. His second novel, Rabbit, Run (1960), the first in a series of four novels and a novella featuring the American everyman Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, was in danger of not appearing at all because of objections by his publishers, Alfred A Knopf in New York and Gollancz in London, to what was considered obscene language and descriptions.In the ensuing struggles, the 28-year-old Updike showed impressive courage and forcefulness. On 2 July 1960, we find him writing to Victor Gollancz that “there is only one honourable and decent thing for me to do, which is to insist that the book be published as I wrote it or not at all”. And he added: “If I start fudging, I have no moral ground to stand on.” In the end, though, he had to give in, and accept the lawyers’ recommended changes. He did so with characteristic stoicism, writing to Gollancz that since “compromise is the only possible avenue … I will take it as gracefully as I can”.Updike’s approach to the depiction and discussion of sex in his novels is strikingly brisk and commonsensical. He did not write to shock, much less to assert his masculinity. He simply did not see why the intimate doings between men and women – as a writer he had no interest in homosexuality – should not be described as accurately and with as much intensity as any other human interactions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He was in his middle years a serial and sometimes multiple adulterer, yet he held to his Episcopalian faith to the last, albeit with some lapses. In a letter to his “Dear Plowvillians” of 9 July 1960, he retails the censorship dispute over Rabbit, Run, and a little further on writes of how he has been helping out at his local Bible school – “very pleasant, except that it does take up the … morning”.And then there are his women, in his life and in the work. Martin Amis observed of Updike that he was unembarrassable, on the page and in bed. In Couples (1968 – of course), his most successful and most lucrative novel – he was paid $400,000 for the rights to a film that never got made – the erotic content almost overwhelms the narrative. He was living at the time in Ipswich, a small town in Massachusetts, and the characters in the novel are so closely modelled on members of the Updike “set”, though he denied they were, that the libel lawyers were called in. Asked by a journalist for her reaction to the book, the author’s wife, Mary, said she felt as if she were choking on pubic hair.At the heart of this volume we find the correspondence, from the first half of the 1970s, surrounding Updike’s separation and divorce from Mary, and his affair with and marriage to Martha – the biblical resonances of the names are almost too pat. These pages make for painful reading: Updike could be cruel – to Martha: “Mary’s body (her breasts!) would delight me still, if I could dissociate it from her pinched Unitarian soul …” – but in the main they are either pained, with Mary, or passionate, with Martha. And simultaneously, of course, he was having it off with other loves, old and new.Are his books read now? Towards the end he made a glum self-assessment: “I have fallen to the status of an elderly duffer whose tales of suburban American sex are hopelessly yawnworthy period pieces.” Perhaps so; but he wrote such prose as to make the envious seraphim sigh.John Updike: A Life in Letters edited by James Schiff is published by Hamish Hamilton (£40).

This quasi-fictional narrator musingly notes that once upon a time she provided the voice for nature documentaries; quite true, Phillips has indeed narrated some nature documentaries, which appears to be the reason why Benoot cast her.Phillips/Benoot ranges far afield, talking to ecologists and geologists all over the world about the nature of stone and kidney stones in particular, which contain the mineralweddellite, so named as it is found at the bottom of the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. “How on earth did an Antarctic mineral end up in my body?” she wonders. She talks to people on the island of Fogo, Cape Verde, to stonemasons in the Palestinian territories, to experts in California and also in the UK, including Professor Lorna Dawson who is a forensic soil specialist whose expertise is helpful in the solving of crimes.The movie is the occasion for some meditations of the nature of geological time: to those that understand it, stone is as dramatically churned up as a stormy ocean; our history is written in stone and also gives us, not merely an enigmatic guide to our past but perhaps also to our “deep future”. This is a diverting film – and I think there is scope for a CSI-type drama about Professor Dawson’s work.Apple Cider Vinegar is on True Story from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGeologyKidney stonesSiân PhillipsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public scorn from conservatives.Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.) A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.When it comes to the darker aspects of the story, though, Rule Breakers is less assured. Except for minor scenes depicting the girls’ rejection for American visas, the film rarely grapples with the war inAfghanistanand its effects on women. From external funding to newspaper coverage, the film sets up a dichotomy between western support and domestic oppression, but this is a distinction that requires more political nuance considering the legacy of American interventionism in the region. While spirited in parts, the journey taken by this extraordinary robotics team deserves a more layered storytelling approach than that of a feelgood movie.Rule Breakers is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRobotsEngineeringAfghanistanSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Even on his farewell tour, there is no easing in, either. The father of Ethio-jazz and his band immediately play Tsome Diguwa as if conjuring a thunderstorm, which in turn crashes straight into Zèlèsègna Dèwèl, a piece written in the 4th-century Ethiopian tradition, its harmonic minor tonality sounding almost Arabic.Astatke has a serious demeanour. Unsentimental, he speaks only to introduce songs or instruct the band like a schoolteacher. But he views his vibraphone with care and bewilderment, playing with intense familiarity yet almost as though discovering it for the first time. His fascination with his instrument holds the audience captive in turn. During Yèkèrmo Sèw – which fittingly translates to “a man of experience and wisdom” – Astatke’s solo fills the room, water-like in its shapeshifting.The set is equally a showcase for his band. That song, as well as Nètsanèt, highlight their instrumental range and individual capabilities, with solos from James Arben (saxophone), Byron Wallen (trumpet), Danny Keane (plucking cello) and Alexander Hawkins (grand piano). For Kulun, an Ethiopian wedding song, two Ethiopian musicians join the ensemble, playing a masinko (a single-stringed, bowed, lute-like instrument) and a krar (a five-stringed, plucked lyre), and two dancers in traditional outfits also enter to the delight of the crowd. For Azmari and Chik Chikka, technical and highly experimental solos from Keane and John Edwards (double bass) are interspersed with dance breaks.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianIt’s a set rich in sensation. Edwards rubs the double bass body creating a cat-like screech, or drags the bow in an exact replica of a yawn. Richard Baker provides Ethiopian percussion astride conga drums, kenari seeds, an ogene (metal bell) and dùndún “talking” drum, creating rich texture throughout. For Yègellé Tezeta, he also sings in Ethiopian in call-and-response with Edwards’ conversational bass. Astatke introduces the penultimate song, Mulatu, as “a piece I composed for myself”: it sounds like a wandering train of thought with glittering bells and mystical keyboard.There’s a rousing encore in Yèkatit. Where you might expect its crescendo to be resolved in a crash of drums, instead, Astatke guides drummer John Scott in a muted, controlled whisper of cymbals. It’s true to the reputation Astatke has built over his five-decade career: a whirlwind of experimentation and excitement, but always with deliberation and control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

As chair of the Widjabul Wia-bal Gurrumbil Aboriginal Corporation (WWGAC), he worked with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Tweed Byron Local Aboriginal Land Council, which represents the Minjungbal clan of the Tweed Valley area within the Bundjalung nation.View image in fullscreenBundjalung man Ashley Moran (right) has been involved in the development of the Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk since 2018.Photograph: R Brand/DCCEEWAs a proud Bundjalung man of the Widjabul Wia-bal clan, he also has a personal connection to the project: the southern half of the track runs through his people’s lands. (The Minjungbal people are the custodians of the northern part of the track.)To minimise environmental damage, the Gidjuum Gulganyi (meaning “Old People’s track”) largely follows ancient walking trails that skirt the southern rim of the Tweed Caldera, created when the massive Wollumbin volcano, formerly Mount Warning, erupted 23m years ago. Only 19km of the 42km walk is completely new.This makes the Gidjuum Gulganyi a rare window into a place that’s inseparable from the peoples who have inhabited and passed through it – with its warm temperate and subtropical rainforests, palm forests, waterfalls and wide open valleys – for tens of thousands of years.View image in fullscreenScrub Creek walking track on the Gidjuum Gulganyi Walk.Photograph: D Parsons/DCCEEWIt was Moran’s job, when he followed those little pink tags in 2020, to do some “ground truthing” on two proposed routes through Widjabul Wia-bal country. This involved checking that Aboriginal sites weren’t going to be negatively impacted by the trails created by NPWS, which was done in partnership with track builders from the local area and from Tasmania, considered among the best in the world.Most of the Aboriginal sites found by the WWGAC weren’t on the trail itself, but some were close enough to warrant altering the route. “We had to ensure that people wouldn’t unknowingly stumble on to a significant site. So we haven’t publicised the locations of the recorded sites and we’ve made sure they’re a good distance off the track, to avoid any unexpected finds or disturbances.”View image in fullscreenViews from the rim of the Tweed Caldera.Photograph: Louise SoutherdenThe experience gave Moran a better appreciation of Country. “[It] made me think about how the Old People would have used the trails, back when there was 75,000 hectares of rainforest up there.” Only 1% of this Big Scrub rainforest in the Byron hinterland remains, due to land clearing by European settlers; many of the original walking tracks crisscrossing this area were even repurposed as logging trails in the late 1800s.“As far back as 22,000 years ago, these trails would have been heavily used by various clan groups within the Bundjalung nation,” Moran says. “People in the tableland areas would have used them to walk to the coast in summer for food resources. Elders would have used the trails to get to Wollumbin, a very important place [for them].“Everyone would have watched for seasonal indicators in nature, like flowers blooming or migratory birds appearing, to tell them when and where they had to be to access food or perform certain ceremonies. All these rituals and movements happened over thousands of years and were embedded in our teachings and cultural practices.View image in fullscreenThe multiday hike traverses rainforest, waterfalls and wide-open valleys.Photograph: Paul Patrick Daley/A Lush Forest Media“This trail is part of our traditional pathways, like the highways we have today, allowing people to travel through the landscape … If people were coming down the ridgelines to get to the coastline, they’d stop at certain spots to get food and water, to rejuvenate, camp the night, just like we stop at a Caltex to rest and refuel on a long trip,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are plans for Indigenous custodians to take over the maintenance of the trail, run cultural tours and businesses such as coffee vans, and transport hikers to and from the track.‘It’s become a bit meaningless’: why does Australia have so many new Great Walks?Read moreNPWS is also working with Widjabul Wia-bal native title holders and the Tweed Byron Local Aboriginal Land Council “to develop cultural interpretation signage that will allow Gidjuum Gulganyi hikers to learn about the cultural values of the Country they are immersed in during the four-day hike,” says a NPWS spokesperson. They expect this to be installed before June 2026.“We want to ensure this isn’t just a tourist trail but an opportunity to learn about country,” Moran says. “To give people an appreciation of what this area means to the Widjabul Wia-bal people and the Minjungbal people in the Tweed area, which will in turn revitalise the walk, bring it back to life.”In Moran’s favourite section of the walk, the trail emerges at the edge of a canyon with “the most beautiful scenery” looking north to the NSW-Queensland border. “That view blew me away the first time I did the walk, being able to look back at Wollumbin and across that Tweed Valley area. It just blew me away.”Guardian Australia approached the Tweed Byron Local Aboriginal Land Council for this story, but did not hear back before publicationExplore more on these topicsWalking holidaysAustralia holidaysAustralian lifestyleAustralasia holidaysNew South Wales holidaysByron BayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I take a few steps and the door clicks, making me jump. Must be the wind.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Exploring old English churches is always a pleasure. There is no one to disturb you, and in the dim quiet will be a historical jaw-dropper: a centuries-old face carved in oak, a grisly tomb, an inscription to the dead hero of a forgotten battle. Each site is a mini detective puzzle, waiting to be unravelled, often with a helpful booklet available near the door. The spirits of those who have shuffled off this mortal coil hang in the dust motes, but here, in Weobley, Herefordshire, I am looking for someone specific.View image in fullscreenIt is a standard opener for any work on William Shakespeare to declare how few facts we know about the most famous playwright of all time. No matter, every snippet has launched a thousand academic careers, a swarm of novels, and dozens of films. The latest on the big screen isHamnet, based on thebestselling 2020 novelby Maggie O’Farrell, and starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. The book conjures up the Elizabethan world of Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes (AKA Anne), at a time when plague is ravaging Warwickshire and filling their Stratford home with grief. In 1596, their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, dies, a tragedy that seems to have spurred his father into a burst of creative energy. When filming the adaptation of O’Farrell’s powerful literary evocation, some very special locations were needed, and the scouts found them in the Welsh borders and in Weobley.Wandering through the town, it’s easy to see why this place was chosen to stand in for Stratford-upon-Avon: it’s a half-timbered heaven of rambling crooked buildings. Many of these were old before the Bard was born. In his era, chimney stacks were a modern addition and you can still see the join. I pass the two pubs, the Unicorn andYe Olde Salutation Inn, each worthy of that fat rascal, Sir John Falstaff, lighting up the bar like “a candle, the better half burnt out”.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley  and Paul Mescal in Hamnet.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFarther down the hill, past innumerable leaning lintels and pot-bellied ancient windows, is the excellent small museum, presided over by archivist Sue, who is a mine of information on the place. The only Elizabethan exhibit I can find, however, is a silver sixpence found by a metal detectorist. At Sue’s suggestion, I set off for the church of St Peter & St Paul. As I approach it’s obvious that Weobley was not always so obscure: there’s the 185ft (56-metre) spire, supported by flying buttresses, built in the 14th century when the town was a big deal. The autumnal churchyard is rich in mushrooms and acorns, but what about Shakespearean resonances? Inside the church, walking slowly up the nave, I see the stone body of a knight lying on a plinth and there’s a name, Devereux.If anywhere rivals Weobley for the Most Shakespearean crown, it would be Pembridge. Two pubs lean over the highway, like a pair of old codgers ‘fat-witted with drinking’Now I get a shiver. It’s a name that every Elizabethan knew, a name that haunted the Bard’s career and nearly brought disaster. One night in 1601, Shakespeare’s troupe, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, were offered a handsome sum by supporters of Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex,to stage his drama Richard II, which features the overthrow of a monarch. The morning after the performance at the Globe theatre in London, the earl rode into London with 300 armed men, determined to unseat Elizabeth I. The plan failed. Essex was beheaded, as were several members of the play’s audience. Anxious times for anyone involved in the production.View image in fullscreenThe medieval church of St Peter & St Paul in Weobley.Photograph: NorthScape/AlamyI peer closer at the tomb, carved with the initials of generations of choirboys. This is Walter Devereux, died 1402. A quick online search reveals that Walter was not only a direct ancestor of the rebel Essex, but had fought alongside Richard II in Scotland, then jumped ship to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, only to die at the Battle of Bryn Glas, one of the “men of Herefordshire” butchered by Owain Glyndŵr’s army. This knight laid out before me is not named in either of Shakespeare’s Henry IV plays, but he must have known all of those characters who were (excluding the fictional Falstaff, of course).From Weobley I walk two miles through orchards, heavy with fruit, to Dilwyn where there’s another fine church, and a good pub,the Crown. From here I stroll on country lanes to Eardisland, another haven of the half-timber, the equal of Weobley. I then turn west, heading for Pembridge where I’m staying. Along the River Arrow, outside Eardisland, the path is blocked so I take off my boots and wade across the running brook, stopping halfway when a kingfisher streaks past me at waist height.Hergest Ridge is part of the Offa’s Dyke Path and a classic route. Below is a labyrinthine world of winding lanes, ancient woodlands and meadowsIf any town rivals Weobley for the “Most Shakespearean” crown, it would be Pembridge. Two pubs lean over the highway, like a pair of old codgers “fat-witted with drinking”; there’s a fine ancient market place, a church whose door is holed by civil war bullets, a gorgeous grocery shop and gaggles of higgledy-piggledy houses. Nearby isthe Cider Barn restaurant, whose car park is crunchy with fallen walnuts and where guests are greeted with a delicious glass of localBlack Fox cider.That evening, in front of the log fire in Pembridge’sNew Inn(it was new in Shakespeare’s time), I read up on Falstaff and discover that Shakespeare’s star comedian was based on the real-life Sir John Oldcastle, a man born at Almeley, five miles west of Weobley, and an exact contemporary of the Walter Devereux lying in Weobley church. The pair might have known each other, perhaps even fought at each other’s side, before Oldcastle turned heretic and got himself hanged. I love playing church detective and almost let out a whoop of delight, but I don’t think the wobbly shelves behind the bar could cope.View image in fullscreenWestonbury Mill Water Gardens.Photograph: Alex Ramsay/AlamyNext day I drive west, stopping at the wonderfully eccentricWestonbury Mill Water Gardens(good cafe) built by the late hydrogeologist Richard Pim, whose inspiration came partly from working in the Middle East and north Africa. Then I head through Kington toHergest Croft Gardens(good cafe) where I start walking again.Hergest Ridgeis part of theOffa’s Dyke Pathand a classic route, the path following a direct line over the dome of Whet Stone hill, revealing vast panoramas of the surrounding countryside, including north to the battle site of Bryn Glas. Below the ridge is a labyrinthine world of winding lanes, ancient woodlands and meadows where Hamnet film scouts discoveredCwmmau, a substantial and almost untouched 16th-century farmhouse which stands in for Hewlands Farm, the childhood home of Agnes (the original is just outside Stratford and better known these days as Anne Hathaway’s cottage). Film location fees helped to fund essential conservation work on the farmhouse, which is managed by the National Trust and will reopen as a holiday cottage in December.And now my Shakespearean idyll is over – except I’ve forgotten to visit Sir John Oldcastle’s birthplace and play detective in the church at Almeley. There is nothing to be done except turn around and head straight back into the past. I have to admit, I like it there.Accommodation at theOld Bakehousein Pembridge was provided bySykes Cottages; from £513 for 7 nights, sleeps 4.Further information:visitherefordshire.co.uk/through-tudor-landscapes.Hamnetis in UK cinemas from 9 January 2026Explore more on these topicsEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysCultural tripsStratford-upon-AvonDay tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The punchy anchovy and garlic butter does all the hard work, and gives the impression of more effort than was actually exerted. But what to serve it with, I hear you ask? Well, it wouldn’t be out of place with creamy mashed potato, buttery polenta or a salad. Just make sure to baste the fish halfway through cooking, to get all the flavour and juices back into it.Roast hake with caper anchovy butterPrep10 minCook30 minServes42 garlic cloves, peeled5 anchovies4 tbsp capers½ bunchchives1 lemon90g unsalted butter, cut into cubesSea salt andblack pepper250g sweet heart cabbage, or other greens2 onions, peeled and halved2 tbsp olive oil4150g hake or cod fillets, skinned and, if need be, pin-bonedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the garlic cloves in a mini chopper with the anchovies and half the capers, then tear in most of the chives. Blitz until finely chopped (you can also do this by hand or in a mortar). Finely grate in the zest of the lemon, add the butter and season well, then blitz smooth (if need be, you can do this ahead of time and store the butter in the fridge).Trim the base of the cabbage, cut out and discard the core, then finely shred the cabbage. Finely slice the halved onions. Place the cabbage and onions in a large roasting tray, squeeze over the juice of half the lemon, add the olive oil, season generously and toss to coat. Spread out the mix into an even layer, then lay the fish fillets on top and evenly spoon on some of the caper butter; dot any remaining butter over the cabbage mixture. Cut the remaining lemon half into fine slices, nestle these among the fish and cabbage, then scatter over the remaining two tablespoons of capers.Roast for 16-20 minutes, basting everything with the buttery juices halfway through, until the fish is tender and the cabbage a little charred. Finely chop the remaining chives, scatter on top and serve.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Toss the tomatoes with a teaspoon of oil and, once the pan is very hot, add the tomatoes and cook, shaking the pan a few times, for about five minutes, until blistered and deeply charred all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.Put another two tablespoons of oil in the same pan and return it to the stove on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, spices, dill and tomato paste, and cook for another two minutes, until fragrant.Add the tinned tomatoes, 300ml water, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down.While the sauce is cooking, cook the fregola in plenty of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Drain, put in a bowl then toss with a bit of olive oil to prevent the fregola from clumping.To make the pesto, put the coriander, chilli, pine nuts, olive oil, lemon zest and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to make a coarse paste.When the sauce is ready, stir in the cooked fregola, prawns and charred tomatoes, cover and cook on a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for another five to six minutes, until the prawns are cooked through.Serve straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls.
